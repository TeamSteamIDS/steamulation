												allright so i just finished the main game in 14 hours.what i think about it?let me first tell you that i have played and finished both Lords of Shadow 1 and Mirror of Fate, so this would be a great and useful review as i can compare this installment to the others.first the negative part:1 - the game is a tad shorter than Lords of Shadow 1 but it is longer that Mirror of Fate.2 - this game is easier than LoS 1 and MoF, but the last boss is such a pain..3 - not many puzzles, if any it will be a kid's puzzle.4 - story is weaker than LoS 1 but somewhat alot better than MoF.5 - the modern city is not very interesting.now the positive part:1 - graphics are very very good.2 - combat system is simplified and it is more useful than LoS 1, no longer you have combos that are useless in combat.3 - great story, still not as good as LoS 1. meaningful and relevant to the previous installments (LoS1 and MoF)4 - no crashings, no freezings and no technical issues what so ever.5 - amazing design of the Dracula's castle.6 - Great soundtrack and voice acting, still i think LoS 1 was a bit better.7 - rotateable camera angle in-game, which was somewhat painful in LoS 1.8 - so many secrets and playablitiy, just like LoS 1 and even better than that.9 - great boss fights and boss designs.10 - state of the art character design, level design, theme, atmosphere and off course bosses.frankly i dont get why on earth metacritic gave this game a 58 out of 100.if i would to give LoS 1 98/100, then i would give this game at least 85/100.i strongly recommend this game to you, defo worth the price and time.do not look at the metacritic score, it is an amazing game.i hope my review was useful to you guys, all the best and enjoy this astonshing game.

Don't bother suffering the reviews by critics and gamers alike who have written this title off because of their views of the first game.Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is easily in the running for my 2014 game of the year. You've undoubtedly seen the low reviews from people who claimed poor graphics. These claims are groundless, and trampled by some of the screenshots you can uncover in the community hub for this game. The graphics are staggeringly good, and some areas have such incredible photorealism that you have to look twice just to make sure you're looking at a texture.The free-form camera works great. No longer can whiners throw a fit that they can't see elements of the battle, as you can now rotate 360 degrees in virtually every setting. It not only grants you a breathtaking view of the scenery; it allows you to tactically view your surroundings and analyze your best moves mid-combat.Platforming and quick-time events have been significantly altered to combat the same list of complainers who hated them in the first game. Platforming now directly shows you where to go, and no longer forces you into long-winded movements where every step is a new jump. You now streamline climb like spider-man over most surfaces, and the ones too far grant you a swift, and simple jump to the new object. Quick-time events have been cut in quarters. No more cinematic sequences where defending yourself during a movie becomes normal. They're limited to combat, and the rare gameplay-to-cinema segue.Controls are as easy as they were in the first game, with a few minor improvements. Button rotations have made combat noticeably smoother, and grant the player less hectic moments of desperate survival. Moves now have instant-cancellations, (another complaint from the first game) which allow the player the freedom to be as quick and reflexive as they want to be. If you die in combat-- you're just not up to snuff that round. No more blaming the devs.The music. What can I say? I've never been so excited to tear into a new game just to hear the musical composition behind it. Oscar Araujo does it again with a score so moving and epic that it pulls players back into its immersive world of magic and demons with a slew of trumpet blasts and harmony-driven pieces that are sure to win over even the most jaded action-gamers.There's never been a better time to jump into the world of Castlevania. I loved this game's predecessor, and I can still hold firmly to my nostalgic love of a classic Castlevania devoid of all the work MercurySteam has pumped into it in recent years.However, the ""Lords of Shadow"" series has brought life into a franchise that has desperately needed fresh-blood (forgive the pun).I strongly urge anyone to pick up this title, even if you're only looking for a new action-game. The battles are challenging; you'll be forced to reconsider how you take on countless enemies that you think you know well enough from the first game.The story is moving. Piecing together questions and answers from both the first game as well as Mirror of Fate, LoS 2 brings about a conclusion that is sure to yield an uproar from the masses for more of this tale.You are no longer a pure-hearted man. Gabriel has become a ruthless, violence-embracing monster who is indifferent to suffering and who will stop at nothing to obtain the freedom he desires. Many of his choices in the game will makes fans of the holy-hero cringe as he shows how his transformation into the Prince of Darkness has affected his moral judgment.This game is worth your money, and it's worth your time. If this game stretches even HALF the length of the first game, then it's going to be a ride you'll never forget.			"

												Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 continues the story of Gabriel Belmont and his transformation into the dark lord; Dracula.Upon starting the game you'll immediately be plunged into an epic battle as Dracula's castle is besieged by the Brotherhood of Light. During this time you'll be trained in the art of combat, mastering Dracula's three weapons as well as evasive maneuvers. The weapons vary and each of them fill a specialized role. After the initial opening, you'll be unleashed into an open world with two dimensions to travel between, Dracula's Castle and a modern Gothic city built upon its ruins. The art direction and audio is phenomenal, featuring an amazing cast of voice actors; Robert Carlyle, Sir Patrick Stewart, and Jason Isaacs to name a few. The soundtrack is also really well done, fitting the mood of the game flawlessly. The environments are absolutely beautiful, allowing plenty of room for exploration while searching for the various upgrades, lore and abilities.The story, when combined with the previous two entries is engaging and helps propel you through the 15 hour game, although the ending is a bit abrupt as well as disappointing. Veterans of the Hack n' Slash genre will want to begin on the harder difficulty as it's a bit simple when compared to games like Devil May Cry and Bayonetta. Between, fighting, exploring, puzzle solving, and platforming there's a lot of fun to be had.While the stealth segments seem to be a major complaint for a lot of reviewers, they don’t detract from the overall game. I’ll admit that I was skeptical at first since stealth really has no business being in a Castlevania title, but they play out similarly to puzzles opposed to traditional stealth missions. They’re also few and far between.The menu system is highly polished and will document every type of creature you fight against. It also acts to manage your upgrades and abilities as you level. Plenty of Lore and backstory is provided along the way from diaries as well.While it'd be nice to have a triple A classic Symphony of the Night experience, LoS2 is great in its own way and playing as “The Dragon” with this new take on the legend is a blast. Don’t believe some of the critics, Lords of Shadow 2 is a must-play.For a longer and more detailed review, here’s a video my friend and I put together:

												It usually happens I find myself torn between a diamond in the rough and problematic technical or some other aspect of the game, but with Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 it's somewhat different. Time to see if I can put into somewhat coherent paragraph or two as to why that's the case.Let's start off by saying I was one of the people who enjoyed the original Lords of Shadow for what it was – not necessarily a creatively original masterpiece, but a game of astounding production values, competent writing and tight narrative punctuated by stellar voice work and lastly, and perhaps most importantly, it was a very meaty game which lead to some even saying it was too long for its own good. Fast forward to sequel and you can see it basically falters in each of these categories.Interestingly enough game seems to swing between two polar opposites with its visuals because on one hand you have this classic Castlevania look comprised of foreboding yet mystical gothic castle to romp through, as well as its assorted menagerie of beasties to but heads with and solve painfully few puzzles compared to the first game, but on the other you have to contend with extremely bland modern-day warehouses and science laboratories ad nauseam alongside some fairly uninspired enemies ranging from more classical demons and Satanists to, what really should've been more interesting that ended up, futuristic soldiers and cybernetic abominations roaming the streets. But honestly, it's this weird disjointed narrative that undoes the game the most in my mind because you can clearly tell there was meant to be more there instead of just going from A to B and meandering in-between retreading locations with nothing but brief radio contacts from time to time. And lastly – game is simply short compared to the first one and that probably ties into my previous point. Rumors abound regarding game's troubled development were apparently well founded. That's not to say game is bad because, as you will have most likely noticed despite my continued rambling on regarding its negatives, this is marked as a positive review overall. It's still Lords of Shadow and if you liked the original you'll probably like this considering you can overlook its weak story. Gameplay feels familiar and skippable QTEs are god-sent, both of which are points in game's favor for me, not to mention combat and item system was expanded and enemy variety despite their designs actually means you'll end up facing quite a bit of different behaviors. Story establishes the mood very early on as one of Dracula's somber and more resigned journey, one profoundly personal despite all other events that unfold over the course of the game. Had it been properly fleshed out and Robert Carlyle's more subdued performance given time to develop, occasional hamfisted melodrama notwithstanding, it would've been a much, much better final product. I also heard some nay saying about mandatory stealth sections in the game to which I say it's about time to drop hand-holding. Barring for one section involving leaves and crazed Satyr these were a welcome diversion for me and fitting considering MC's condition story-wise.One last caveat I feel should be posted is that playing the original game and Mirror of Fate is recommended before tackling the sequel.

												As a huge fan of Lords of Shadow 1, I sadly find myself rather disappointed in the sequel.  It seems like every change they made to the gameplay is for the worse.First let's talk about the much lamented stealth sections.  They truly and unequivocally suck.  They are relatively infrequent and certainly not insurmountable, but they simply are not entertaining, often annoying if not outright frustrating, and aren't even logically consistent with the rest of the game. One moment you're ripping the heart out of a monster the size of a building, the next you're hiding from two grunts with guns. I can not fathom the developer's reasoning behind their inclusion to the game.  Who played Lords of Shadow 1 and thought ""You know what would make this game better? Insta-fail stealth segments!""Then there's the combat.  I found the combat in Lords of Shadow 1 quite satisfying even it could be simple at times.  It seems they wanted to up the challenge here, but they did so by making the enemies get staggered less, attack at a much faster rate, and having more attack you simultaneously. The problem with this is not that it makes the game too hard, but you need to guard or dodge so frequently that you rarely have time to execute anything more than the most basic attack combo.  Several of the more powerful attacks have such long windups or leave you open so long that they're nearly useless.  As a result, I'm finding the combat to be less varied and far more tedious than the first game.  Too much time is spent dodging and not rattling off impressive combos.There are also little bits of level design that make me wonder at what point the developers stopped asking whether it was fun in favor of just coming up with tasks for the player to do (much like the stealth sections).  For example there are several timed switches where you'll hit a switch to open a door, and as you get close to the door several enemies will appear.  Spend time fighting the enemies (and likely you'll have to) and you won't make the door in time.  So you walk back to the switch, hit it again and this time you can cross the area unmolested.  It's the most egregious form of repetition to pad playtime and makes no sense in a game that's sufficiently long regardless.  It's the kind of thing that makes you feel like the designer isn't respecting you as a player.If that wasn't enough, even the camera is disappointing.  Some reviewers whined about the fixed cameras of the first game, when the problem was just a few bad angles.  They switched to a controllable behind the back camera here, and while it's perfectly functional, the game has lost the epic vistas and panning shots of the first game that you only get with fixed (or more accurately: not player controlled) camera angles.  As a result, despite environment design that feels roughly on par with LoS1, the game has lost much of the grand feeling of it's predecessor.Now on the plus side, everything that doesn't have to do with the mechanics of the game are at least as good as the original.  The art design and aesthetics are great even if you don't get to appreciate them as much with the narrow camera.  The characters and cinematics are absurd, but in a way that feels fitting and not like it's trying too hard - though it can get close at times.Taken by itself, the game isn't awful, I still found it reasonably entertaining on the whole.  It's just that everything about how it plays feels worse than the original and it's especially disappointing to see so many mistakes made by the developer after the success they had with original.

			Josh possesses the dark lord himself in Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2. Here's what he thought. Review by: Josh Please like and subscribe for more reviews, gameplay, and discussions!		

	Mercury Steam's hack and slash take on Konami's long running vampire slaying franchise proved to be a bit divisive by rebooting the franchise's lore and staying away from the loot gathering of the massively successful side scrolling titles starting with Symphony of the Night. With Lords of Shadow 2, Mecury Steam is drawing their controversial take on the franchise to a close, putting players in the worn out boots of Dracula himself as he faces off against Satan and his army of minions. Attempting to inject a bit of metroidvania design and hopping back and forth between Dracula's castle and modern times, is this the compromise between the side scrolling titles and the foundation laid by Lords of Shadow? After a recap of the events of Lords of Shadow and Mirror of Fate, players are treated to an epic prologue that has Dracula defending his less than humble abode from a tremendous siege which culminates in an encounter with his son, Alucard.  The game then flashes forward a thousand years to find a very weak Dracula awakening in a cathedral in modern times greeted by Zobek. Zobek offers Dracula the chance to end his cursed existence in exchange for the death's of Satan's acolytes. In typical video game fashion, Dracula must regain his lost powers and battle a few inner demons in addition to Satan's minions. While the sections that have Dracula revisiting his castle provide some appreciative depth and introspection, the plot unfolding in modern times is rather underwhelming and even a bit silly. The game is at it's narrative peak when it recaptures the spirit of Gabirel's sober journey in the first game, reflecting on Dracula's numerous sins and the decimation of the Belmont family.  Perhaps the largest change to Lords of Shadow 2 comes in it's structure. Dracula moves between present day and his castle and, eventually, players can revisit areas previously explored. It makes the game more metroidvania-like thank it's predecessor but hoping back and forth between the two areas leaves the geography feeling fragmented and backtracking only becomes available much later in the game making this still feel somewhat like a linear level based affair. Combat remains largely intact from the previous games with light and dark magic now complimented by two additional weapons: the chaos claws and the void sword. These along with Dracula's shadow whip can be upgraded by purchasing various moves and utilizing them. It's a system that rewards using your entire move set and is an excellent addition to a genre where many rely on a couple effective all purpose combos. Relics have been added as consumable items that give Dracula the ability to restore his health, transform into a dragon for massive damage and gain extra experience. Tragically, the gameplay does take a major step back when it comes to the puzzles. Standing in for the first game's brain teasers are a gauntlet of stealth bits that have Dracula posessing enemies, cowering in the shadows and transforming into a rat in order to navigate small cracks and crevices. Most of these are easy and don't feel rewarding in addition to being at odds with playing as a powerful and feared vampire. A couple of the stealth sections can prove to be frustrating and one visit to a forum exposes one pre-boss fight stealth section as a stopping point for many. Boss fights are also completely unchallenging which is a shame since Lords of Shadow provided an excellent difficulty balance.  Fortunately, those who invest in the DLC will be treated to gameplay and puzzles that are more in line with the original Lords of Shadow making it an excellent piece of content for fans even though it's narrative additions are minimal. On the PC, Lords of Shadow 2's beautiful art direction is showcased by higher resolution textures and runs silky smooth at 60fps. Despite the fact that it doesn't offer the lastest graphical bells and whistles, this Direct X 9 title is more than pleasing to look and all of it's details can be appreciated since the fixed camera of the first game has been ditched. The Castle in particular is a stunning place to be and it becomes almost frustrating that the entire game doesn't take place there since the modern city seems a bit bland in comparison. Enemies can also be a bit bland and repetative but the bosses generally make up for this minor short fall. The soundtrack to Lords of Shadow 2 is also magnificent with beautiful somber orchestral compositions and delicate piano pieces. It adds a huge amount of ambiance to the game and is perhaps this year's best soundtrack. Lords of Shadow 2 is unequivocally not as good on the whole as it's predecessor though it shows a few major improvements that are easy to appreciate. It's a lengthy experience that offers superb combat, excellent visuals and a top notch soundtrack. For a Castlevania fan, it generally outweighs the lame stealth segments, repetitive enemies and underwhelming open world design. Even for it's biggest detractors, the Lords of Shadows games are proof that Castlevania can exist in three dimensions.			"

 “What is a man, but a miserable pile of secrets.” Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is an action adventure game developed by the company MercurySteam, and the sequel to the 2010 game Castlevania: Lords of Shadow. Atmosphere & presentation: + Sinister depiction of the game world with dystopian elements.+ Each stage has its own atmosphere and iconic art style of the Castlevania series. + Obsessive attention to detail regarding level design. + Extensive concept art section with hundreds of pictures and sketches. o Solid sound effects. o Due to the console based origin a gamepad is recommended, in order to play the game.    Combat & gameplay: + Combat system is solid and reliable. + Good camera handling in combat and exploration sections.+ Exploration of the surroundings is rewarded with bonus powers and useful trinkets.o Variety of enemies is rather small and champions are too weak. - The stealth sections are an atrocity. An insult to the legendary abilities of the Lord of Shadows.  Characters & story: + Certain characters and story elements from Lords of Shadow and Lords of Shadow – Mirror of Fate are reintroduced and further developed. + The downloadable content “Revelations” introduces Alucard as a playable character and provides some surprising background information.o Compelling storytelling in the beginning, but it loses momentum towards the end.    - Inconsistent character development of Dracula.- The final boss is a cliché.  Summary: The second instalment of the Lords of Shadow series offers beautiful visuals and a solid combat system. However, the rest of the game does not reach the level of quality of its predecessor. Despite the strong start it loses its momentum in the middle of the game, and the solution of the conflict between Dracula and his antagonist can be considered a cliché. To add insult to injury, the forced stealth sections are an unnecessary and partially frustrating element.  Achievements: Estimated time for 100 % completion: +40 hoursSingleplayer achievements: 56Multiplayer achievements: none			"

												So, I actually liked it a lot more than I expected. The overall impression of it everywhere seemed to be very negative (regardless of what you think about metacritic, 58/100 doesn't exactly inspire confidence), but I ended up liking it quite a bit.The combat is fun, even though it sometimes feel like the enemies have too many unblockacle moves, so instead of sync blocking you are dodging maybe more than I would prefer. Still, Dracula is nimble and there are enough new moves doled out every now and then to keep things interesting all the way through. Void and Chaos powers replace the light and dark magic from the first game, but more in name than function. You still get orbs from keeping your combat focus going, in order to fill out those magic meters, and one of them is more powerful and the other one is less, but heals with every hit landed. It's essentially the same system as the first LoS, but some very minor differences. Probably the biggest difference with combat is not even directly related to combat, but it's the free camera. And they handle it well, the combat camera is smart most of the time (unlike say, the camera in MGRR), and doesn't get in the way. All the finishers take too long though, I get it, you are Dracula, but suck that blood a little faster, thanks. But overall, good stuff.Presentation is probably the most uneven thing in the entire package. Environments and locations can be gorgeous, but they can also be ♥♥♥♥ing boring. Boring sewers and industrial plants, but also gorgeous gothic (or something) architecture and fantastic vistas. Dracula seems incredibly tiny in this world too. The grand scale of everything works well in the non-industrial setting, big majectic doors and windows etc, but in the industrial setting it just looks comical. Music is the same, Araujo does some good work with some tracks, but others are just a big meeh. I remember reading an interview from him where he says that he didn't really have a lot of freedom in the end, that he had tried to approach the music from other angles but was told that it needed to be more cinematic. Some of it works, some of it doesn't. The story is really really dumb, somewhat poorly written, but it does its job of pushing you towards your next objective.The worst part are the sections where they probably thought that they should add some variety in the gameplay design or something. Obviously the much talked stealth stuff is one part of that. They have absolutely no place in this game, they are just poor. But they are also really easy and short, so I'm not sure how the press was so badly hung up on them. Yes, they suck♥♥♥♥♥ but it takes like 2 minutes to go through. The elevator action section is dumb as well, again, not because it's hard or anything, but a timed switch to restore power in order to use an elevator is not fun. And I imagine the director had played Uncharted and told that we need something like that, heart pounding set pieces. The results are absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ There's one section where the floor falls under you, push forward and push A for awesome. The entire train section is hot garbage, but especially the part where you dodge the roof lights or whatever. And then there's the QTE's, which you can turn off from the settings. If you played LoS, you'll probably remember that most boss fights had some easy quicktime event sequences in them, sometimes in the middle or in the end, and usually if you failed the boss would gain a little health back, rinse and repeat until you were quick and timely enough. That's still here, but if you turn them off, it will just play that whole section as if you were successful. And I very much recommend it. What does it tell you about this hot feature that they added an option to just disable them?The game is very linear, but it has a hint of that non-linearity with all the secrets you can find. That speaks to me in some primal level and I can just get lost in the world, just running around and looking behind every corner and such to find everything. It just speaks to me man. Of course I would recommend you do this only after you get all your powers back, can't get them all without all your powers. There's also some combat challenges, and I played through couple tiers of them... but didn't bother with the rest. It gets into a little more complicated stuff than I have patience for (you can only hit this dude while he is frozen, while simultaneously killing smaller dudes every 20 seconds etc etc). For me it takes the fun out of it.So overall, I'd say my experience with the game is positive. I paid ~20$ for it and I'd say it's worth at least that if not more.			"

												Well if you're here then probably you have already looked up some ""professional"" reviews about this game. And most of them call it inferior to the series or just simply say it's mediocre. This game made me to stop listening to these reviewers. I didn't really want to buy it, but I fell in love so hard with the story they presented in LoS1 and MoF I needed to know the conclusion and I felt like I wouldn't be satisfied if I just simply watched it on YouTube. So here I am amazed by this fantastic game...+CombatIf you are coming from LoS1 (if not then please play it before this one) you already know the basics. They basically tightened it up, made it much more responsive and fluid then it was. There are new moves and combos, too. And this time we get a much more ""user-friendly"" skill page then in LoS1.+Story and narrativeThese were the second biggest positives I encountered in this game (the 1st one is ofc the combat). Of course there are plot twists, and most of them hit hard (you know it's good when your jaw drops). There are many interesting characters; there will be some who you'll hate and many who you'll love. It made me care about a side-character in ~20 mins and when it turned out he may die I felt really bad. But the ultimate peak for me was the Toymaker. It is that kind of rare time in gaming when a good story and a well-imagined narrative meets. I won't spoil it for you, you have to experience it by yourself. And most importantly it got rid of that bad narrative element that they used in the 1st game, which made up every little thing so dramatic that it felt like it just changed the whole world, but in reality it had no impact on anything.+CameraThankfully they got rid of the fixed camera presented in the first game. Don't get me wrong, fixed camera can work pretty well (like the old Resident Evils), but a high-speed action came certainly doesn't need it. Surprisingly it's also dynamic. So like when you're just walking, it comes quite close to you (kind of like RE4). But during combat it goes much further so you can see better.+PlatformingJust like the combat, they kept it and made it better. Thanks to the accurate controls it's much more fluid and if you failed a lot of times during platforming in LoS1 (like me) than fear no more, it's much better. A little bat swarm will always indicate where you can jump to and during climbing you can (optionally) highlight where you can climb to.+SoundtrackI know it's subjective, but it's still amazing. It's not that kind of music that you will download and listen to regularly. It just fits so well the game, that it greatly boosts its already good atmosphere. It's epic and beautiful at the same time. And when it needs to be, then it's emotional.+BossesThey are pretty diverse and just enough challanging.+DesignThe graphics are good, but the design is the thing that's important. When you're in the castle dimension it's simply breathtaking. Every little detail in every little painting and statue and thing in the castle...Everything feels just in place, that I risk that even in 8-bit it would still look beautiful. Now about the modern dimension...For a city design it looks good, but I couldn't wait to get back into the castle from the modern world.And the list could go on and on (good portray of Dracula, references, etc.), but let's talk about some not that good aspects of the game.+/-Stealth segmentsNow this is the most criticized part...I don't hate them but neither love them. It's all about if you mind being taken away from the fast-paced gameplay and use your brain and patience a little bit. But the biggest issue with these is the fact that mostly there's only one way to do them! But people hate it like it's all over the place but you have to be stealthy like 5 times in this game...But I loved the parts when I could be a rat, it still really gave me the feels of being smarter and more powerful then my enemies.-No detailed mapYou get 2 kinds of map in this game: one that shows the districts and one that shows your surrindings.-Rare bugsI encountered two kind of biggie bugs during my playthrough and I looked up if anyone else has encountered them and I didn't find anyone, so they must be really rare.In conclusion: As a fan of Hack 'n' slash games and the first two LoS games I have to say that this is a must have. The game is very well optimized, so no worries about that. It has it's bad moments, but they're still mediocre at worst. I love this even more than the 1st one actually. The story and drama feels kind of weak if you don't really care about it, but once you start to think about what just happened you'll be amazed. Don't listen to the critics (probably Konami just didn't pay for good reviews), this game deserves much more than that (8/10 minimum).P.S.: I feel like it's needless to say about this kind of games, but a controller is strongly recommended (I played with a Steam Controller and it was very comfortable and precise).

												(DISCLAIMER: Objectively, as a game, Castlevania LoS 2 is a good, overall,  game that has some flaws. However, as a follow up to Castlevania LoS, it is terribly disappointing. My recommendation is based on the game itself, not my disappointment as  a sequel to the original.)	Let's start with the GOOD. The combat has been refined in a very nice way and thusly feels a bit more responsive. As in the last game, with the points/experience that you receive from defeating enemies, you can use that to buy additional moves for your weapons, but this time, you have the addition of the chaos claws and void sword AND they have their own moveset on top of the same function as shadow and light magic respectively. Thusly, giving you many combo possibilities. Dodging is smooth, although I would have preferred a roll like the original, or the turning into smoke like Laura in the original game as well. I'm glad for the addition of the free rotating camera that was lacking in the first game.	Platforming has also been improved and is much smoother than before.	The graphics, very,very nice. However, it seems a bit of a waste since the most of the environments are dank, dark and very similar; unlike the original game where there was a lush forests, autumn ruins, icy castles, dark dungeons, crazy grand canyonesque platforming. Just wasted potential overall, but a great graphics engine nonetheless.	Now for the BAD: STEALTH, man oh man, this game never needed stealth to begin with so I don't know why it's even here. Not that I mind stealth, it's just done very, very poorly in this game. The stealth sections were very tedious and boring. It was repetitive and not necessary to the game.	Speaking of not necessary, the section where you have to hide from Pan's brother so you don't get one-shotted....ridiculous! You're freaking Dracula, the prince of freaking darkness. Satan is even scared of you in the game, yet, you have to hide from this guy? Again, since this was a stealth portion, it was terrible and necessary.	The modern setting, I'll admit that I was excited to check out a modern setting in LoS, but honestly, it felt so out of place, especially the robots and commandos in exo suits. The sections you get to go back to the castle felt much more appropriate and epic. 	The story, the story this time around, lacked a sense of urgency and purpose. This is probably partly due to that you're now Dracula and you don't care weather thousands of people live or die. I through most of the game, it felt as if I was just trudging along just getting through the game, instead of feeling like I'm making real progress. The story lacked any real revelations, twists or turns, like the original had. It was very one track and lacked anything with real substance. There is no internal struggle like in the first game, any real tragedy with character investment, the story felt like it had a beginning and an end but missing pieces in the middle, not necessarily plot holes, but more so they needed to add elements to make it really interesting.Overall, the game is ok with some flaws. I did have fun with the combat, especially in the intro of the game, but after that, it felt like it was all downhill from there; lack luster story, repetitive environments, terribly implemented stealth. Sadly,  Castlevania LoS 2 just couldn’t meet the standards set by the first. As a huge fan of this series, I'm hugely disappointed. As a gamer, it's a “not bad” game.7/10			"

												I'm a diehard Castlevania fan. I was also one of the few who defended Lords of Shadow 1 when it really alienated the Castlevania name. I enjoyed the first game a lot, and I was really excited with the idea of a second game. Unfortunately, I can't recommend this title. It does have great ideas, and I love NWO references (like a reptillian creature, and that a pharmaceutical company is in leagues with Satan). In any case, I'd like to think that this is the Simon's Quest for the Lords of Shadow series. The gameplay is okay, but it has no idea what it wants to be. It wants to be a hack/slash adventure, yet it wants to be a platformer, and yet there are stealth sections which ultimately hurt the game. As a customer, I wanted the Castlevania that built on Lords of Shadow 1, not whatever this is currently. The game falls VERY flat in the end. I was not satisfied with the story, despite the massively epic build up from E3. With that said, I don't recommend the game at full retail value. Maybe if it drops down to 30 or 20, I would say go ahead. As it stands, it truly is one of the weakest. Pros: Robert Carlyle as Dracula, other voices were great too. Decent story Cons: Doesn't know what it wants to be, multi-vision projectToo few enemies Doesn't offer the excitement that LoS1 providedFlat endingFelt rushed "

IT'S PRETTY SWELLOkay, I'll write a serious review now. That was just me being silly. I'm not a review expert though so don't expect the best from me.First of all I really enjoy the combat in this game. They changed nothing in the first one except for the Light Magic (now the ""Void Sword"")and the Shadow Magic (now the ""Chaos Claws""). Those function the same as they did in LoS1, however.The stealth portions of the game seem to get a lot of negativity. I enjoy them, but based upon the crap they've gotten so far, I'm not so sure you will. I don't have a problem with them at all, though, but that is indeed just me.The boss battles are no different than they were in LoS1.All in all I say IT'S PRETTY SWELL.Disregard everything I've said, this game made me euphoric as hell.

												It is a good game, but difficult to reccomend. I do so, however, because I see it's only my bias against the modern day backdrop that holds me back.Honestly, I feel that the developers did everything they could to make this a spectacular title. The controls and mechanics are great, the graphics pretty and most of the DLC is fair - but, in the end, if you can't get over the setting and what many feel is a weaker story than the first, then this game won't do it for you. That being said, if you give it a solid chance, it may just grow on you - perhaps not like the first, but nevertheless, it still has it's own merits.			"

												MetacriticJeuxActuFeb 25, 201485%Without changing anything, Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2 offers an action packed game based on your ability to inflict a maximum of damage to your enemies. In spite of a very old graphics engine, the game offers a decent life with about 15 hours of play. With dynamic gameplay, the ip follows the likes of Devil May Cry and God of War for the fan's enjoyment. The only true drawback is a very poor script that loses the player in its turns before the grand finale where a very expected twist happens, destroying all hopes of a good story. "

												8.5/10Overview: Third Person Action Adventure The Good+ The setting is a mixture of a modern city in ruins and Draculas old castle. Both settings provide a nice contrast with each other and are fun to explore+ The first major difference from the original is the ability to control the camera as opposed to having a fixed camera in the first game. + The second major change is all the levels are interconnected with each other. This provides for a much more immersive and seamless experience with gameplay. + Combat is more refined than the original and just as fun. You have light magic that does less damage but heals you whenever you damage an enemy and chaos magic that does significantly more damage but is slower and has less range. Effectively dodging and switching between your magic meters is fun and engaging. If you played the first game, the combat should offer little surprise to you. One key difference is by using attacks over and over again you can increase your mastery of a certain weapons making them stronger. + Boss battles have always been a highlight for this series and this game is no exception. Bosses are unique, well designed and will require you to use all your techniques in battle to defeat them. + the game has plenty of collectables scattered throughout the world+ The game features 16 optional challenges to further extend your game time. Each challenge has a series of objectives that has to be completed in order to complete the challenge. + option to disable quicktime events The AverageThe story is not awful but it didn't really do much either. It doesn't help that most of the dialogue spoken by the villains is bad. This game has some REALLY annoying enemies that will test your patienceThe BadFor some odd reason the developers decided to include stealth sections in the game. I like stealth games and I like it when developers try to mix up the gameplay but this was just a bad effort. The stealth sections feel very out of place and are not always clear in what you have to do making for some really frustrating trial and error. It also feels very odd that you play a badass destroying most enemies in your path only to reach a section in the level where you have to avoid enemies. ConclusionThis game fixed two of my biggest gripes from the first game. The fact that the levels are interconnected and the ability to actually control the camera make for a much better gameplay experience despite the awful stealth sections. I was a bit baffled that reviewers panned this game pretty badly as I think this game improves the first game in many ways. If you enjoyed the first game then there is no reason why you shouldn't love this game as well, unless of course the modern day setting doesn't appeal to you. "

												Some spoilers ahead:Finishing Lords of Shadow 2 left me with a bitter aftertaste.From the very beginning of the game, you will be forced into stealth missions, evading generic vat-grown monstrosities in high-tech labs. The game's combat system, one of it's greatest strengths, is mercilessly defenestrated here, and as you find yourself sneaking behind an invulnerable guard for the fifth time, you start to wonder at what point it was that you stopped having fun.But then you cross over into a castle area, and the familiar atmosphere coupled with the excellent swordplay (whipplay?) makes the game seem like a worthy sequel once again. The combat is fast and fluid, with the accelerated orb gain (compared to the first game) playing a great part in that. The platforming is much more forgiving, although the inclusion of (even more) platform highlighting was really not needed.As soon as the game manages to realize you're having fun, however, you encounter the acolytes of Satan. These unfortunate excuses for characters that seem to have been created by pulling edgy tropes from a hat will casually wipe the floor with you - that is, until you use a clever trick to defeat them. Unfortunately, this is a sign of things to come, as well as one of my biggest issues with the game. You are Dracula, the Prince of Darkness. You've ruled this Earth from the shadows for centures, while Satan cowered from you ever since his last defeat. Well, it sure doesn't feel like it, since you'll spend most of your time in LoS2 running away from large fights and powerful enemies. Gabriel Belmont feels no more powerful than he was in the first game - weaker, in fact, due to the fact that you start the game with no skills or abilities.Still, I went on with the game, hoping that the story would make it worthwhile. I cleaved my way through research facilities and desolated city streets, castle ramparts and dungeons. The narration was served to me in droplets, as if the whole story was an afterthought - an idea that I haven't quite managed to fully dismiss. Eventually, after maybe 12 hours of gameplay, the story started going somewhere. A major revelation was shown, and it had me genuinely interested.Then it abruptly ended. There was a boss dull boss fight, set on an epic stage only to serve as a distraction from its lazy design (I'll use this opportunity to coin the term ""forced epic""). It was over, Dracula said a cheesy one-liner and the credits rolled. That was it. The cluttered mess that the story had become turned into a Gordian knot not even Dracula's Void sword could sever, and it seemed like the developers didn't even bother trying. No shocking twists after the credits, not this time, only a lingering feeling of disappointment. There's a certain sense of irony that the only distinct feeling this game managed to evoke in me, that of sadness, was not over Gabriel's fate, but rather over the missed potential that this game had once held.Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is a game as empty as its protagonist's soul. Avoid it, especially if you were a fan of the original.			"

If you haven't played the first two, that's okay, because this is one of the best action/adventure games I've played in a long time.  Great set pieces, killer soundtrack and script, epic boss fights and the cherry on top......CAPTAIN JEAN LUC PICARD reprises his role as Zobek.Play this one!!!!!!			"

												As a Castlevania fan (and I mean all of them), I recommend this game sincerely to fans of the series, gothic atmospheres, vampire and other mythical lore and fast-paced action games.I've played this game before on a different system, but I needed it again for the PC. That's how much I love it.The negatives about this game often are about the stealth parts and the modern day sequences. I also find those less appealing, but it makes me appreciate the castle sequences even better. The environments are beautiful and open for exploration. Once you've got the majority of your abilities the exploration becomes the best part of the game, for me at least. Some people say the story is so so, but I love the amount of effort they put in the lore. A lot of the story is hidden in the pages of the bestiary and abilities. Accompanied by amazing artwork and good music (though, earlier Castlevania's had better music), it makes it a atmospheric experience of storytelling. My opinion might be influenced by my love for the series, but I can still recommend this game just for the amazing leveldesign, atmosphere, awesome bossbattles and rich mythological lore.			"

I didn`t complete the game on Steam yet, i did however 100% it on PS3 and the game completely took around 27 hours (+3 for the DLC) to complete 100&Negatives:- bland art design on the city part- story drags in mid part but feels rushed in the final act- lackluster endingPositives:- really f***ing beautiful art design in the castle- awesome combat- really good story- nice graphics- protagonist you actually give a♥♥♥♥♥♥aboutAll in all, I`d say you should go for it if you like Hack n` Slays like GOW.It tells a way better story than that anyway			"

												This game is an underrated gem. Not sure where the bad reviews are coming from. Most of the game takes place in an interconnected castle that will remind players of the metroidvania games. The combat is simple and satisfying and rewards variety and good timing. The boss battles are epic, and each one is unique and requires the player to learn a specific strategy. Sound design, music, graphics and presentation are all fantastic. Stealth sections provide a change of pace and though they are not as fun as the exploration and combat portions of the gameplay, they are few and far between.  Happy I decided to pick this up despite the abysmal reviews.... If you are fan of the first Lords of Shadow then you absolutely must play this game. If you haven't played the Lords of Shadow series, definitely pick up the first as it is also a classic IMO. The series gets a lot of hate from Castlevania fanboys, and whilst it is definitely true that it deviates from many of the series tropes, I don't consider it a bad thing at all.  A lot of care and devotion was poured into this series and it's a shame it has not gotten the positive reception that it deserves. Bottom line is if you are a fan of 3d action/adventure games you need to play this game.			"

												Eu sunt Dracul!After I was highly disapointed by the console port of Lords of Shadows 1 I must say I really like this game. It got a 58 Metacritics score, but since I'm a sucker for Metroidvania and God of War-like games I gave it a try.And boy am I glad I gave it a chance. I have to admit the game needs some time to get you. The first two hours are kind of lame (The fight against the angelic robot and the boring sneaking part). But after the tutorial and the first visit to the science facility the game unfolds its beauty. The artdesign is fabulous, overall graphics, shadows and lightning are fantastic. Even more important, the controls are smooth even for a non gamepad-player like me. Combat is challenging throughout the game. After unlocking more and more combat options the normal fights as well as the boss fights are immensely fun to play (The whole toymaker part is a lesson in gamedesign for other devs). You can adjust the camera by mouse so there are no more fixed angles and even jumping is fun again. No more QTE, thank you for that dear devs. The game is kind of an open world game, you can constantly roam your castle and the modern world and unlock secret after secret while advancing through the game. The speakers and the music are nearly over the top. The speakers are so good and the music fits so fantasticly well it's scary.And last but not least this game is dark, no emo vampire he's the kind of vampire I want to watch in movies or play as in a game.My rating would be a 86 (edited), it's one of the best games of this kind I ever played.So give it a try and don't let yourself get fooled by the not so brilliant beginning.

												  The game's not quite bad, but not near as good as the first one. Everything different from the first episode is for the worse. First of it, the cyberpunk setting feels cheesy, and the designs cheap.  The very structure of the game, wich is now a real metroid-vania, will just have you spend hours in long, frustrating trips across the area. No real maps, not enough shortcuts, and no real way to help you create a mental map of the whole place (not like dark souls for example). Plus you'll have to endure excruciatingly slow scenes designed to hide the loading away from your righteous wrath. Tons of them. It's what I remember the most about the whole game experience.  The combat is still good, yet not as good as before. The new beautiful FX will quite often hide important informations on enemies, resulting in a punch in your face, and the sad disappearance of your focus bar. And the combat sessions have been fragmented in shorter fights, wich doesn't allow you to make this focus bar really useful. What were they thinking ?  Every new feature, like stealth, are absurdly bad.   All in all, it's not a bad game, it's still beautifully crafted, challenging and the core fighting gameplay is still good. But everything else seems to have been designed by a drunk guy. That's really sad. And you'll have to endure hours of this♥♥♥♥♥♥between every neat fight or exploration of cool (or less cool) places. That's too bad, really. "

												Portals? Ratula? Demons with guns? Explosions? Blood vomits? Blood and gore?  Space Marines? Belmonts? Kicking Tldr: Scroll DownThis game was a fun ride and not as bad as other reviews made it out to be, There was some really strong points and weak points to the game but it was not a flop compared to the other games out there. Please do think for yourself, watch some videos and some gameplay and play for yourself Heres my review on why this was a fun game to play.  I enjoyed all 15 hours of it and thats not finding Everything.The Story was not suspenseful as LOS this time around, It started off flaring and action packed and for some reason just ended in a sorta fizz. You'll start as Gabriel in his castle fighting against the army of brotherhood, After so you'll be treated with some story telling from the Ds version of the game and past forward into the future. You are Gabriel Belmont thousands of years laters in the future you'll be fighting Satans army while experiencing the past and the future in the game at the time. Play the game to find out more. The story was really not the game strong point this time around.The music of course was amazing as usual and really brings out the game, alot of the symphony and the epic music world music makes you feel really pumped playing it, Even if you're walking through an empty hallway. The voice acting is great along with returning Patrick Stewart. Has a very epic sensation to it and goes really well with the game.Gameplay  The fighting and combat is fast and action packed, fighting enemies is sort of like a puzzle and requires strategy and thinking You cannot go in mashing, I tried and ended up looking like a fool and getting ripped by the mobs. You'll have to think the game revolves around your shadow whip, Vorpal blade which heals when you hit enemy and your Chaos gaunlet  which breaks defense when you use it against certain enemies along with dodging and guarding mechanic.The game itself has alot more jumping puzzles and Puzzles itself. This time along with some stealth which is medicore. There is alot more platforming. The real treat is that also the world is a bit more explorable this time around, with many sections of the future + past at the same time.Used an xbox controller for this game, tried the keyboard and didn't work too well for me, also note the port had Xbox showing buttons popped up which needs to be fixed for players. This time the camera is also no longer in a fixed position, it is  now controlled by the player though could be better if you could actually hit a button to face your enemy. The graphic itself has HD textures given to you, which is great but doesn't change the fact that it was  A PORT. though still a great game and looks quite decent. The level design looks phenominal, the detail put into it if you look carefully and how the buttons and switches in the game works the way they do, The future might look a little bleak and grim maybe a  bit different than what many expects but did look ok.TLDR +Good music and voice acting+Great environments design+Fast action paced combat that requires players to think before mashing+Lots of puzzles and platforming+Boss fights were really fun, and bosses look cool very unique.+ Not a linear game this time around, has explorable areas that can be revisted with warp points.-Story was mediocre-The stealth sections of the game was mediocre also can be very fustrating at certain points for some.- Could had offered more than just looking for items in the  world, sidequest could had been great.-No multiplayer, no real replay value of any sort except finding the stuff you haven't found or playing harder difficulty.-Unescessary qtes on buttons.- Game was way too easy even on hardest difficulty you could choose in the beginning.

												Recommended? Maybe.....After giving Castlevania Lords of Shadow 1 a glowing review, it really pains me to give this a thumbs down.  I was really hopeful that this sequel would follow in its footsteps as a worthy successor. Unfortunately this game is marred by a clunky camera system, weird game mechanics that don't always work right and an irritating save/checkpoint system that punishes you heavily for failure by making you repeat the same sequences and boss fights over and over again until you get them exactly right. By contrast, the first game's checkpoint system was much better in saving your progress (even during boss fight stages) and all the artifacts and items you picked up you kept after you got them. If you died at a particular place, you would just restart at that place with all of your previous progress saved. Not here, you're forced to proceed a great deal further in most instances in order for everything to be saved. Make a mistake and you're going all the way back to the beginning of the sequence or fight. It's just frustrating and not fun.The story is just OK. Nothing that really draws you in and connects you to its ficitional world like the first one. The levels take place in a bizarre alternating transition between the past and present which makes the game feel like a cross between its gothic horror roots and the futuristic setting of Doom 3. In the modern levels Dracula will be operating elevators, powering modern machinery and battling mechanized bad guys that are equipped machine guns, grenade launchers and electronic counter measures, it just feels out of place. The main characters aren't as memorable nor do they stir up the same level of emotion as Lords of Shadow 1.It's also much harder to go back to previous levels and pick up many of the artifacts you'll need to make your character strong enough to face the tougher enemies in the late game after you unlock the special powers required to get to them. There isn't an individual level selection system like the first game. Instead you have to select a previous location and then find a special room which allows you to teleport to an area of the that location where you think you might have left something behind. It takes way more time to do and just means more repetition of the same convoluted areas over and over.I'd say it's worth picking up only on sale and only if you're a fan of the first one (having completed it) and Mirror of Fate and have an interest in the story. That's alot of ands. At the time of this writing, I haven't finished it and I intend to see it through but after 15 or so hours I'm getting ready for it to be done.Overall 5/10			"

												Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is much better game than its predecessor. The combat has been improved,  and finally you have control over the camara so you see all the gorgeous structures. With lots of boss fights, and boy the boss sure are alot of fun! Especially the toy maker. They aren't the most orignal bosses, but like I said..they are fun to battle with. Also I find myself enjoying the puzzles, there are actually very few puzzles. The platforming also has been improved...it feels more natural to me..too bad they didn't put any sort-of challenge within the platforming area's that often, the challenges that are within the platforming bits  were fun. But! this game is not perfect, in the beginning you have a few stealth sections which are terrible. They are not difficult or anything, just annoying..ESPECIALLY the last one! that one just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off.  Also believe or not..there are two hide-seek moments, the first one was hilarisch and put the big smile on my face, seeing as the person who was looking for me couldn't find me...and the thought that the great Dracula had to hide..was funny to me. BUUUTTTT the second one I didn't like. That stupid cow-thingy could smell you, hear you with every step..and once he did he rushed towards you..urghh quite pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥was that guy.And finally the story was good. The voice acting was excellent. I mean Patrick Stewart voiced a character can hardly go wrong. ButI hated the ending, I thought was going to be something emotional and deep but..no. I was really disappointed.So should you get this game? Well if you like 10-hours full of kick♥♥♥♥♥as a vampire, with lots of bosses, platforming, few puzzles, and a dissaspointed ending? then my friend, get this. Otherwise wait for price drop..or steam sale.			"

												I think I need to add this to the ""games that most people hated which I actually enjoyed"" list. Admittedly, I'm biased because I really dig Castlevania, enjoyed the first Lords of Shadow and Mirror of Fate, and am a sucker for the idea of playing as Dracula himself. But even at its most frustrating moments, Lords of Shadow 2 isn't nearly as bad as Edge Magazine (which gave it a 4/10) or any of the other mainstream reviews would have you believe. Bloodsucking awesome stuff:+ I feel like combat's speedier and more responsive than it was in the first Lords of Shadow, and there's less reliance on quicktime events. This might have to do with the fact that I'm just more experienced with the combat system after playing through the first game and Mirror of Fate, but I had a lot of fun beating up some of the bosses, which leads me to the next point...+ The boss battles (with the exception of the finale) are grand as hell! You've got some classic mainstays in there, like Death and Medusa, whose inclusion instantly make this game seem ""more Castlevania"" than its prequel.+ On that note, the first Lords of Shadow got criticism from many people who felt it was Castlevania in name only (though in a surprising twist, I've noticed that the first game is now retroactively considered great in the wake of the poor reception the second got). This isn't the case here - from the getgo, when you start out as Dracula in your castle sipping a glass of blood, Symphony of the Night references start popping up everywhere. These plus the haunted atmosphere and the inclusion of Alucard just make the game *FEEL* more like a proper entry in the series. + Lords of Shadow 2 is beautifully presented, and like its predecessor, has some of my favorite menus ever in a video game. (I'm just a sucker for any menu that resembles an old torn book and has little hand-drawn animations showing your available attacks.) The music feels like it's from the long-lost Castlevania movie that got stuck in development hell, and the environments are amazing...at least for the flashback sections of the game. Not so bloodsuckingly awesome+ The game has two worlds, Zelda-style - a flashback castle that sort of exists in Dracula's mind (or in another dimension, it's never really explained) and a modern setting. And while the castle is gorgeous, the modern levels are laboratories, deserted hospitals and dirty streets that resemble Gotham City in the Arkham games at their best but are just forgettable at their worst. + With the strange duo world thing comes the plot, which I actually enjoyed for the majority of the game, even though there's one big twist near the end that is really the most comic book thing ever, and I don't mean that in a good way. But the ending is very weak. Let's just say that the final boss battle doesn't exactly hit the heights of previous fights, let alone the epic clash of Gabriel Belmont versus Satan from the first game, and even though there's a big redemption story that builds up for Dracula over the course of 30-some hours, the whole thing concludes like a wet fart in the night. Also...Victor Belmont, what a waste.+ Unlike Lords of Shadow 1, this sequel's a Metroidvania. This is good in theory, but on the negative side, enemies are still damage sinks, which interrupts the joy of exploration, and the shackles of the level-based structure of the first game are still there. Many times you can only traverse areas in a VERY SPECIFIC WAY that the game wants you to take - ie, even though Drac gets a double jump, he can't jump over this crappy little ledge to get the collectible on the other side even though you can CLEARLY see he should be able to reach it. No, you have to take the long route around and use your mist form to pass through a gate (and the mist form can only be used in a few key places too) because the game's been programmed that way. Mirror of Fate had this issue as well, but it wasn't as noticeable because that game was 2.5D. In a 3D environment, it's very obvious.+ Tying into this element of restrictiveness, the stealth sections that got slammed by every reviewer ARE quite annoying. If you dunno what these are - there are a few enemies, like some huge armor-plated guards and Pan's brother, who can kill Drac in two shots, even though in every cutscene the Prince of Darkness easily demolishes much bigger foes. The only reason Drac is vulnerable to these guys is because the designers needed an excuse to make the players complete so-so puzzles where you need to change to rat form or cling to walls to sneak by them. It's kind of a ham-fisted way to switch up gameplay, but luckily it's only about 5% of the game. Lords of Shadow 2 got massacred upon release, but I'm glad to see it's at least getting positive reviews on Steam two years later. I still liked it enough to go out of my way to find every collectible, which is rare for me. It's biggest flaw is that it has the restrictive design of a PS2 game, but was released in 2014, a year which also saw innovative titles like Shadow of Mordor which introduced fresh gameplay mechanics. (OK, I agree that Mordor was overrated - but it did offer a solid open world, and the Nemesis system WAS great.) Reviewers were expecting more when this came out, frankly, and rated the game as such. As it stands, it's still not a horrible way for the Castlevania franchise to end, and worth a look for more open-minded fans who aren't opposed to Castlevania games not made by Koji Igarashi. If you're interested, I wrote some longer thoughts on this game and the negative reception it got here: http://pixelgrotto.tumblr.com/post/150812695901/musings-goodnight-sweet-prince-eurogamer "

												Fun action/adventure. Worth a play-through.Good:- Combat is satisfying- Lots of unique/pretty moves to unlock- Story is interesting- Boss fights are awesome- Every fight is fairly unique but towards the end they become less uniquely challenging- Levels were very intricately designed- Platforming was satisfying and had a lot of variety- Audio effects/soundtrack are greatBad:- Can't reliably force 4k on a 1080p monitor (additional smoothing)- Last boss was anti-climactic in terms of the difficulty; felt like it should have been longer and harder to really finish it off- Dungeon key secrets were tedious; every third shrine I had to run back to the shop to buy 3 more- The swinging platform mechanics felt kludgy and should've been smoother- Stealth elements were lackluster and not very rewarding			"

												Lords of Shadow 2 proves to be much like its predecessor. It's very much a ""bigger, better, more"" sequel. An open world connected by shortcuts, more weapons and spells to use, and the addition of new relics and items to toss about. Unfortunately, the story and lore about about as mishmosh and nonsensical as the first games if you give them even a second thought, so if you're looking for a compelling addition to the Castlevania chronicles, like the first game, you're going to be sorely mistaken.For being ""the epic conclusion"" to the Lords of Shadow saga, very little is actually concluded.Luckily, the combat is smoother, faster, more fluid, as are all the platforming aspects. While the trappings and aesthetics are lacking, underneath beats the heart of a solid, fun action game. Like the first game, I feel like if it had been called anything buta Castlevania game, the story would get a pass. The game itself though, is fun enough to be a recommendation for anyone who enjoys action games.			"

												I enjoyed the first lords of shadow, it being an interesting take on the castlevania story. This would be one in a modern setting, that would be interesting right?Well it turns out there were a lot of missed opportunities. The first half of the game does things pretty well, tension and story build up. Then part way through it... just becomes a mess. It's hard to believe this was done by the same people, with the first being executed so well.I had heard that the development studio had a lot of problems, and so perhaps it was more of a fluke that the original ended up working. Mechnically the game works well, and is even pretty fun. But the story? Well you'll probably feel let down.			"

												Didnt expect really that much from the 2nd game but so happy that i bought it. The soundtrack is once again out of this world and the graphics are at times really amazing especially the castle which is really dark and foreboding. I found this to be a very emotional and moving story and a great reboot of the series. Its just a shame that its the last installment as i would have enjoyed playing further as Dracula or Alucard. The only negative thing that i will say is that near the end the story seems a little rushed as if they are struggling to tie all the loose ends up. The ending is rather anti-climatic i expected so much more from Satan but i suppose it makes sense since he spends centuries hiding from Dracula. Tips for Stealth sections - Use Mist to cross leaves                                          Use Shadow Daggers to hit bells                                       Use Bats to distract Golgoth Guards Those sections are really not that hard once you know how to approach them.

Second, I later checked on Steam, and noticed how low a metascore it has.Now there are already plenty and enough of information you can see from other people.So I'm just going to say this.The only regret I have for buying this game?I didn't buy it sooner.

I've been playing games for around 25 years now and I did find entertainment in this one. And I have played games of this genre quite a lot. At the end of the time while it didn't outperform the first LoS in every area and has a few design faults (that mostly disappear after the beginning of the game), I think you will find this one pretty good if you enjoy action adventure titles. There's plenty of soul in this one.			"

												This game is a mixed bag, and by no means outright terrible. There are however many flaws which strike me.Gameplay in and of itself, with the exception of the glaring annoyance of nonsensical stealth sections is decent enough, and all of the provided mechanics are put to work equally in the combat and in exploring the world itself. This works well enough though it doesn't appear to me to be anything revolutionary or exciting.  Stealth sections very much break the established flow, despite being short and ridiculously easy to get past they are at odds with the rest of the game, disabling your ability to perform any attacks short of stunning opponents and trying to escape. It doesn't make sense when the game plays up the fact you're a character with ridiculous combat ability, and you're regularly destroying enemies twice the size or so of the guards in the stealth section which utterly wreck you in seconds if you get caught. The mechanics the stealth sections use, possesion and transforming into a swarm of rats don't seem to be used to their utmost. Particularly possession, why not allow the player to actually do something with the apparently invincible guard they're controlling aside from use an eye scanner to open a door? As for turning into a group of rats, when the rat you're controlling dies - you possess the next rat in your entourage.  If all the rats die, you die.  This is used to -some- effect in the first stealth section where you have to navigate tunnels and avoid hazards, keeping your other rats alive. As well as again later on very briefly.  I don't particularly like this kind of gameplay, but the idea was good and for the effort spent in making it functional it seems very underused. The game world itself is nice looking and well designed in most respects but it's fairly linear, it does allow backtracking throughout though mainly for the purposes of revisiting past areas with new abilities to grab missed collectables, which is more in tow with the series prior, although likely not quite as interesting. If you like collecting lots of crap (increases to various gauges, unlockable challenges, item limit upgrades, artwork) and trying to 100% games, that's a pro and you might enjoy it. The upgrade system for the main set of combat abilities is good, and offers some interesting options.  Enemies are fairly varied, interesting and the bosses are pretty fun. Though the hardest difficulty is locked until you've beaten the game. One flaw is that enemies and bosses (and anyone in combat with you) will quote the same 3-6 lines of dialogue over and over as you fight them to the point of it becoming annoying.  I like about as many of the character and enemy designs as I find unappealing, even then knowing that the ones I do like aren't very memorable and don't actually get that much focus.Story is a big no sale for me, which is a shame because signifigant portions of it could be considered competent and plenty of time has clearly been spent on it. The main setting is uninteresting and feels generic as a plot point (despite the actual work which went into designing it.) Most of the characters motivations seem either generic, pointless, obvious or some combination of all three. The best segments are generally spent in the castle sequences, but the whole premise behind that is fundamentally pretty simple and renders itself unnecessary on the whole. There's a lot of background information in the journal which updates with entries on your abilities when you get them, and each enemy type/character when you kill/meet them respectively. This is nice if you like these kind of details.PC controls work well enough, although onscreen prompts still use controller buttons which is lazy. There is a contextual control reference dropdown bound to F1 which shows what action, what button it's mapped too and what key represents that button, which is at least something. Being provided with a HD texture pack and features like being able to disable QTE's is great. Even if I found this game average I feel at least somewhat vindicated in supporting it for providing things like this. If you're sensible, You'll wait to get this until it's on sale or gets a price drop. It's entertaining, stable and more or less what it presents itself as, but no grand masterpiece unless you're a person who'd particularly enjoy the areas where the game excels and be capable of enjoying it despite its problems.

												I got this for 10 bucks on the Humble Bundle store after having a lot of interest in it beforehand. Having played the original Castlevania, SOTN, Aria of Sorrow, and a portion of LOSMOF HD, I can say this game stands up to the general dark vibes. I was a bit hesitant of a 3D Castlevania game, but it worked quite well. Once I got used to the keyboard controls and whatnot, the game was not difficult at all, with the exception of a few very frustrating puzzles and a couple bosses.It plays a lot like the older Devil May Cry games, including the 4th game in the series, even some of the camera zooms on doors and other things were very reminiscent of those games, which I loved. The game promotes using different attack patterns, by using a ""mastery"" system for each skill you buy with Souls. This system gives you points in whichever skill you are using, and when maxed out, can be used to upgrade the weapon itself. I found myself using more varied combos and different attack patterns, instead of just cheesing the bosses with Guillotine. I digged how Dracula / Gabriel is portrayed, and the other characters are well done as well. Though, be advised that the controls are not shown as keyboard keys, and will instead be like, ""push A"" and so on, corresponding to an Xbox 360 controller. This got extremely frustrating in the beginning before I knew what the buttons translated to on the PC, but once I got used to it, everything worked well. Is this game worth the $40 dollars? I am not sure really, it depends how much you want a game like this. I personally feel that the game is very good, and was well developed, even if by a different company than the original games			"

One of the Most Underrated Game EverIf you look at the metacritic score you would think ""This game is not good"" yes? But it is sooooooooo far from the truth. This is a one helluva solid game. Believe me when I'm saying that I enjoyed it's every second. Musics, graphics, voice actings, drama, face emotion, level designs. All of 'em. Just brilliant.If you like the first game you will definitely like this game because they give camera control, fluid control over Dracul and his endless combo. I didn't like these things at the first game because they were so dull. But here... Man it's one the best game since GoW.By the way people hate this game because ""it's not Castlevania"". I don't know about that because i didn't play the old games. Bu this game gives you the control of Dracul and his smooth powers and let me tell you I was thrilled. Especially after the first LoS game.Please do not mind the sh.ty metarcritic notes. This game is solid and SOLID. And that's that.9/10			"

With the stealth stripped out and the more frustrating combat encounters trimmed away there's probably an amazing 8 hour game trapped in there somewhere.

												The only other Castlevania game I played to completion prior to this one was C:SotN, widely regarded as the best Castlevania in the series. Without knowing until after I finished this Lords of Shadow series follows an alternate timeline from the others in that series, and without playing Lords of Shadow 1, I enjoyed it a lot. The game catches you up to the story of Lords of Shadow well, and I enjoyed the plot and flow of the game.Gameplay (fighting) is pretty hack-slash with comboing using the whip, or sword/chaos claws but is quite simple. I've read people compare it to God of War, but having not played that series I wouldn't know. I wasn't expecting anything amazing in combat but I did find it fun to play despite not a huge variation in enemies. At least most of the enemies weren't annoying, but I did dread getting into fights. There was a fair bit of platforming, some stealth missions which I hated, and some nice simple puzzle-solving. There as good flow and variation during the story to keep it fresh.Exploration in this game is pretty lacking. Missions/the story is pretty linear/guided, and unless you wanted to upgrade your weapons/skills (not necessary if you played on an easier difficulty like me, I just wanted to play this game casually) there was no point in re-visiting areas. You can access 'new areas' in levels with upgraded abilities later in the game, but there's really no point unlike in Castlevania:SotN because you won't be getting new weapons/skills/etc. doing so. Don't expect some Skyrim/TES bonuses from going off the beaten pathVisually, this game is pretty good. Nice background scenery, the castle looks beautiful. The modern city is kind of 'meh', but I did appreciate how the game looked. Some of the audio tracks are great too, but you will run into a lot of the same music.Overall, I had fun with the game and enjoyed it for what it was. I admitedly got frustrated with some parts of the game and would just quit playing 10 minutes in if I couldn't advance through the story fast enough to do other stuff but my yearning for knowing what happened in this game kept me coming back. I won't be playing it beyond the story mode and doing a NG+ mode or anything like that. Buy it on sale for 10-15 dollars but I wouldn't pay full price for it.			"

												Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is lying to you, there are not Lords of Shadow in this game. But luckily there is a castle, so I guess it's not all bad. Okay, half a castle.You play as Dracula...What, really? Yeah, you play as that guy you've been beating up since the 80's. Now, when I played Lords of Shadow I explained that I am not familiar with Castlevania outside of a little bit of Symphony of the Night. Now that I've played more than an hour of the original games I have a better understanding of the series. And now I come to you saying that Castlevania: Lords of Shadow as a series feels more like a fairly competent fan fiction than it's own universe.After an annoying tutorial sequence, you wake up in the DISTANT FUTURE OF 1999, at least I think it's 1999. Dracula awakens form his long slumber looking much like I do after a Saturday night, minus the incredibly handsome. After getting beaten up by a large T-rex looking monster, you are saved by a man in armor  who's wielding a suspiciously Japanese looking sword, lets just call him Scrungus Humungous for now. So Scrungus takes you back to his master Zobek, who is Patrick Stewart but also a jerk. He tells you that Satan is using his Acolytes to revive him so he can dominate the world. Zobek tells you that if you can pull Satan out of hiding and defeat him, he will give Dracula the eternal rest he longed for. So yes, this game is about Dracula fist fighting Satan. I should probably explain the game now.Much like the first game, LOS is a action beat-em-up much like God of War. You have three weapons, a whip, a sword, and your dukes, but your dukes are on fire, how rad is that? Both the sword and your fire fists are on a meter of sorts while your whip is good to go at any moment, not unlike a whip in that weird teachers basement. Your enemies come in different shapes and sizes, with a nice touch that they all have lore and back story to them. But other than a few special moves they all attack the same outside of the very few bosses you run into. Standard attacks can be both blocked and countered, leaving the enemy open for a critical attack. But every now and then, or more than often, all the time, the enemy will use a heavy attack which you will have to dodge. Outside of a few items and changing weapons on the fly, that's about as complicated as combat gets. So I'm going to say some bad stuff now.Like I said before, I finally got familiar with Castlevania as a whole, and now a lot of elements just leave a bad taste in my mouth. Outside of Dracula originally being Gabriel Belmont (Spoilers by the way, if you've never watched any of the trailers), the Belmont lineage kind of gets turned into that soup the weird lady hands out down town. Dracula and Alucard (That's Dracula backwards) are both Belmonts and the rest of the lineage kind of takes a back seat.  Actual spoilers by the way.You actually DO meet another Belmont named Victor, but he dies roughly 10 minutes after you meet him, so whatever. This is honestly kind of stupid, in the original series, Dracula was a man named Mathias Cronqvist, so not only did they change who Dracula actually IS but they also flat out replaced him with their own new character for the series: Gabriel. What was the point of this? I'm not in the fanbase but did anyone actually ask for Dracula as a playable character? It doesn't add anything because your best healing is the same healing you used in the last game because Dracula biting fools doesn't really cut it. If they really wanted you to play as a Vampire why didn't they just have you play as Alucard as you did in Symphony or that other part of Mirror of Fate? Alucard already plays better than his father does in the DLC and has a more interesting set of skills. Did they think that people really liked Gabriel so much as a character that they wouldn't want to move on to another Belmont? Perhaps continue the narrative in another way that doesn't include reusing an original character you made specifically for your reboot? It doesn't really even feel all that Castlevania like, really, outside of a few name drops and shout outs from previous games. And for a game with as much padding as Lords of Shadow 2, it sure as hell is rushed at the end. And by that I mean it just kind of ends, it's all over and then Dracula goes to take a nap. I'm not kidding, that's how it ends. Roll credits. I've watched bum fights with better closure than that. Should you play Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2: The Reckoning: Fury Road? This is actually hard. Because the game has a really strong start but then kind of fades away at the half way point. A lot of plot points are just kind of shoved aside or hand waved before the game comes to an end and it drags on just long enough for the combat to become frustrating and boring. Just like my sex life. But on the other hand, it's nowhere near as offensive as other reboots like, lets say, DmC, or my sex life. I just feel like it could have maybe cut out a lot of the fat and busy work and focused on it's strongest point. Just like my sex life. LOS2 is getting pass, but just barely, I would get it while it's on sale at five bucks or less. It's not great, but it's nowhere near as offensive as a lot of other reviewers made it out ot be. If you absolutely NEED a vampire game right at this moment, though? You can get the Legacy of Kain series for much cheaper.Fortressmania 2: Kings of Shade gets 3 badly voiced sections from Symphony of the night out of 6. Dracula backwards is Alucard.The curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation "

												I never played the first one in the series, so I couldnt compare how it stood against the first game. However this game by itself is easily worth the price. I loved the gothic castle enviornments, voice acting, story line and combat. What I didnt enjoy were the stealth sections, which I felt while not hard or time consumine, were simply unnecessary. The graphics of the game are pretty decent, with an unlocked FPS cap. I got a stable 144 FPS on my PC, so its a pretty easy game to drive for an average PC. The only bug I got was that the audio and subtitles cut off for a few seconds in 2 different cutscenes. Aside from that the game was rock solid and I had no bugs or crashes. I picked this game for about $6 on sale, and it took me about 20 hours to complete the game. I would easily recomend to anyone who is a fan of the genre. If you are a fan of platformer hack and slash like DMC or God Of War, you will probably enjoy this game.My rating for this game is 8/10.			"

												I want to meet every single developer who worked on this masterpiece even though their work environment was terrible and just congratulate them. I want to thank them for this game. For the amount of love they have put in this. It is so rare to see such games nowadays. If it wasn't for the terrible studio managers, this game would have been so much better. The whole team behind this game has my respect. What they have made is mind blowing - and the result isn't even as good as what they could make. Once again, it was the terrible studio managers that made this game a ""mess"". However, even at it's current state, Lords of Shadow 2 is a true masterpiece. The visuals are stunning, the level design is one of the best I have ever seen. The orchestral music is just beautiful. Animations are smooth and responsive. The story will hook you up. You will find yourselves playing non-stop for 7 hours just to see what is going to happen next.The voice acting is professional! The story has many plot twists and interesting character development. There are just so many great things about this game. I have no idea where the negative reviews are coming from. If you are reading this, please do yourself a favor and buy this game. It is a challenging, beautiful and fun 20-30 hour ride that you will never forget.			"

												It's Castlevania! That is probably the main reason you are thinking of playing this game. If you love Castlevania you'll find the game enjoyable enough. If you merely like Castlevania this game may not be very good. The medieval castle scenes are all awesome. The voice acting is good, if not great at times. The story is a fair continuation of where we left off after the first Lords of Shadow game (LoS). The modern city scenes are a tad bland and boring, though. The combat mechanics are even more fun than in the previous LoS game. The boss battles are tad easy, although there is always a higher level of difficulty to be selected. Some of the puzzles are damnably frustrating though, such as the garden with Agreus. I feel the pros far outweigh the cons though and this is a good addition to the franchise.			"

												Initially, definitely significant to mention is... *ahem*  F@CK NEGATIVE REVIEWS. Really now, many gaming magazines (see Edge #d0uche_detected) have underrated it... (4/10). Even ""Octodad"" or ""The Banner Saga"" got a higher score than LoS2... I can only assume that they were trying to elicit attention through these means... anyway --> TO THE POINT!   Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2, The Dragon Returns! :O \o/ Such a good game... but how come it has so many opponents this time, in contrary to its predecessor? lel.. Well, let's begin with the reasons I deem this game worthy of its money:+ Gorgeous Graphics+ Satisfying durance+ Wide variety of actions, skills, collectibles, missions, enemies etc.+ Very well contemplated and made plot (they have taken really good care of it), plus there is an awesome plot twist!+ The combat mechanics (endless moves, powers and upgrades)+ THE PROTAGONIST! Anyone who has played LoS 1, can definitely recall Gabriel being... uuhm... TOO QUITE! Honestly, he scarcely spoke, we knew almost nothing about him or his personality. Unlike that, this time, Gabriel (or what is left from that♥♥♥♥♥♥ starts to reveal who he really is, his character, his desires, and generally he now IS appropriate for a protagonist. (Moreover, his voice actor, Robert Carlyle, has done an undoubtly good job ""incarnating"" dracula)+ Yup, MANY stunning bosses ^^+ The soundtracks ;3 (♥♥♥♥♥yaeh)   ....But, there is always the other side...- A number of fans maintain that they face several problems (like the game can't start, or gets stuck at a certain point of the game). Also, in spite of the aforementionted problems, EVERYONE may face glitches (small or B I G ones)- It could become monotonus at some point, especially when you get to roam the same area over and over again... - The enviroments you play in... (yeah it's a whole new era, and yeah no more majestic forests etc., BUT, it is the plot that demands that! You are no longer Gabriel, but a creature of the night, you live in the 21st century, you can't move with the sunlight. The very game itself has ""darkened"". This is the reason some fans don't even consider this ""negative"" point at all, while others miss the old castlevania enviroments)- Despite the fact that there are many boss battles, some of them end really quickly, and it is not that difficult to understand how to defeat them. - There are TOO many (and a bit complicated) moves in the combat system, that you just don't have time to remember, use and make good use of them (some are just beautiful and expensive, nothing more, nothing less)- The final boss battle... (relatively short and easy to cope with)   To sum up, this game has both various advantages and disadvantages. But I would still recommend you to purchase it, it is really stunning, fun, and worthy of your time. Yeah, it is true that there are some disturbing drawbacks, but the advantages still surpass them. ***(This review is based on my personal view on this game. If your own view happens to be in opposition to mine, don't be a♥♥♥♥♥♥ thanks ^^)***			"

												First of all - I played it on lord of shadow difficulty setting, it was not that hard, only few enemies were ♥♥♥♥ing cheap (hi mother♥♥♥♥ing robots). It was not the best Castlevania game. And in some aspects it did not beat LoS1. However after first part in city  it got more interesting. Rat parts and stealth parts are utterly boring and stupidly easy. Combat is great, mastering skills is fun, looking for secrets also. Enemies in the ""flashbacks"" or what it is are great, some familiar characters. Story is pretty decent, some suprise moments towards the end. Music was kinda disappointing though, only 3-4 tracks were on par with Los1. Overall  I would say - if you can overcome some boring parts mostly stealths and real world fights, game itself is fun.Pros:- weapons, amount of skills-story, suprise characters-flashbacks-secrets-bosses (mostly flashback ones though)-graphics-atmosphere-some awesome levels and ""puzzles"" (theater <3)-option to disable QTE'sCons:- RIP logic puzzles-you dont feel like being most powerful being in the world...-annoying as ♥♥♥♥ robots.-rats-dungeon keys... if I knew it, I would be full of them ffs!-no baba yaga musicbox level :(((-small spoiler - on of familiar bosses was on steroids lolOverall 8/10I hope new game plus shows secret locations, because there is no hint in which area did I miss some.

												One of the best interpretations of Dracula's castle, marred by a clumsy early game and the occasional design choice of dubious quality. The characters are enjoyable, the boss fights are true highlights, and the combat remains the meat of the game. We finally get to explore Dracula's castle in a modern 3D environment that does it justice, there are too many instances where a new area makes you pause just to admire the scenery. It is like the level designers took the concept art (which always looks so much better) and then implemented it literally, and somehow made it even better. I like the anti-hero that Gabriel became, even if they fumbled a bit in justifying how he got to that point. The original LoS had puzzle sections which some players did not care for. LoS2 eliminates those in favor of ""stealth action"" puzzles, which even fewer people cared for. Whoops. There's about three or four of those sections in the game, and they're really not as big of a deal as they're made out to be, but they do remain pretty funky standouts. The biggest error LoS2 makes, which I haven't really seen mentioned anywhere, is being a wildly lavish game that was hamstrung by console design. There aren't any loading screens, but there are enough terminal areas where things are being loaded in the background that it's painfully obvious what's going on. At least there are no chupacabra levels. It's clear the designer's hearts were in the castle levels. The modern era is ""fine"", but really lacks anything interesting. And monsters shouldn't have guns, they break your concentration meter easily and are barely telegraphed.			"

												It's a great game.  Alot more dark than the first game, but for what it is, it's very well presented.  There's more to do, and bigger areas to explore.  The story is a lock-step continuation of the first game, and you'll see some familiar faces and some inuendo for your imagination to figure out.  I find the dark style a little unwelcome, but that's just me.  It doesn't have to be bright and sunny, but it could have more supernatural monsters, or ... you know, just something.The fighting in this is much improved.  Some of your moves are similar to the first game, but they do more of what they are supposed to, and less scripted.  If you do a Guilotine for example, some enemies will dodge, some will block, and some will take the full brunt, instead of a guaranteed hit every time.  So those familiar moves feel so much more realistic.  Even small enemies require some strategy.One almost deal breaker was the onscreen prompts.  I started out using a keyboard-mouse, and it displays xbox prompts -ONLY.  It took me forever to associate B with ""f"" and Y with Mouse2.  You can get used to it though.If you liked the first game, you'll find this one better in alot more ways than not.  Qualitywise, hugely better.  Graphics, way better, Fights, hugely better.  Mood, eh... but I think the story compensates for that alot.  It looks like the DLC ""Revelations"" is going to have alot of what I'm looking for.  Great game all around.			"

												Just consider the 'Lords of Shadow' trilogy as a self-contained universe and you'll have no problem. It's a great game when not compared to the rest of the Castlevania series. It's a great gothic-horror action game. It's just not the Castlevania you remember. It has great music, just not traditional Castlevania music. Great atmosphere, just not the castle we remember. Great monsters, just not the monsters we remember. Taken for what it is, you'll enjoy it.			"

												06-Nov-2016 : Finished main story + extrasSetup : Windows 10 64-Bit, MSI GT80-2QE Notebook, Logitech F710 GamepadREVIEW :I really love the first game, but the sequel is just weak compared to the first one. No wonder it got bad reviews everywhere. The graphics and designs are still beautiful for the castle part, but the modern city part is just bad. Gameplay mechanics are much better than the first. more fluid with dynamic camera and option to turn-off QTE. From storytelling point of view, the main plot is ridiculous, but the side-stories, characters and lores are actually really good and interesting.The creative puzzles like in the first game are no more, replaced by boring stealth puzzles. Basically, you have to pass some of the mission using stealth only, get caught and you instantly died. It's clear to me that the developer intended this stealth part of the game as new kind of puzzle, but it's boring, annoying, and solving them won't make you feel smart and proud of yourself.CONCLUSION :Recommended on sale price.

												The game story was nice (specially in the end of the game, when you recieve your memories back). I really enjoyed every minute of it even though I expected more challenging puzzles. The gameplay was very nice! Well there were things I didn't like in the gameplay such as:- Not getting the chance to use your Void Sword and your Gauntlets in the beginning and there is always a limit of how much you can use them (unless you're very good at not getting hit and making counters). - The climbing is kinda dumb at some situations, because you can climb at really mad places and some other places that seems very easy to climb are unclimable.- Also you can chain nice combos, but combos compared to DMC series and Darksiders 2 were not that great. The graphics are pretty okay - I liked it! The environment was also really nice! Gameplay: 8.5/10Graphics: 8/10Environment: 9/10Story: 9/10It was worth getting this game!			"

												Continuing from the first Lords of Shadow, which had a strong sense of adventure, always moving on, traveling from one end to the other and, apart from the dlc(which I'd advice you to simply ignore entirely), never forces you to backtrack. A feeling of being on an grandious, epic, adventure through ancient lands and fairy creatures as well as monsters. It's was not the most ideal re-imagining of the Castlevania brand, there were the low's but also the high's, and the high's outweighed the low's IMO... that is until they actually continued from the epilogue and explained it.Lords of Shadow 2 is an oddly excellent example of a game who's budget coupled with one man's over-confidence(from the success of the first game) turned arrogance, effectively ruined any ounce of a future this particular franchise ever had. There is quality here, don't doubt it, it's just found sparsely between thick stretches of game-design that will utterly boggle the mind, how Enric Álvarez, the series director who, literaly, stood for every gameplay design and story sequence in LoS2, how he ever convinced himself this was good. The combat is more of less the exact same, apart from a few weapons, with an added options to turn off quicktime-events.The game is split up between modern-times, where you travel through a city which was built around Dracula's grand castle, and past times, before humanity apparently conquered the dark prince, a mystery you will only solve a half-hour before the credits roll. Execution is everything. The story telling, the characters, the level design, the various game mechanics, the leveling system to the weapons... all of it is just horribly miss-matched and all over the place. There are stealth sections equiped with enemies in god-mode. You simply aren't able to fight them and they take you out with projectiles in two hits. These sections are numerous and extremely tedious. You're supposed to be Dracula, taking on Satan himself... but you are apparently a small ant compared to this simple mob. Laughable. PR said that they were going to fuse the first LoS with SotN(one of my favorite games ever) and the thought had me riveting with saliva. I could even see it in front of me.I loathed the story almost completely. Resented every aspect of the modern levels. Not a fan of this Alucard either apart from purely visual perspective. He even retconned the story from the first game in a pretty stupid way. I bought this at full price day one. I did not listen to reviews. If you think you want this game, re-evaluate, come back after a week or so and if you still want this game... wait for a steamsale, no sense of wasting more money than you have to.			"

Posted: October 8, 2014
												I completed the game and basically the game doesn't have a very good story (totally ignored other people complaints about this games story, thinking it couldn't be that bad) Who could of pictured Dracula as a anti-hero, can i call him that? He comes off as bad but develops into a semi heroic character. I don't think developers will ever grasp the concept of being evil as a main character. If someone plays as a bad guy, he has to remain that way, i mean he/she has to be totally deprived of emotions and feelings. Dracula here has these and it basically takes away from the evil that the character is known for in the castlevania series. I'm content with saying he is basically a sissy compared to the Dracula in other Castlevania games. If i play as a evil bad guy, i want to bad all the way to the end. The art direction i notice is down right horrible. The art direction on satan in particular is down right terrible. I think i could of design a better version of him thats not too similar to the bible depiction of him. The armor on a couple of particular characters, dracula included are pretty much weird to me. They have the same similar design and shape, which consist of sharp wave like rig. The combat is decent, but i just don't understand why the devs didn't add more skills to draculas default whip, they had room to. They could have even recycled some of gabriels whip skills from lord of shadows. While playing i kept thinking i could do one of my favorite skills from the first Lord Of Shadows but then reality hit.. Final battle could of been done better, instead they went for a semi-cliche kind of approach, which is expected in other games. If you're a castlevania fan, you'll expect a really cliche climatic Castlevania final battle, which isn't a bad thing. I guess these guys didn't play the castlevania games, when putting this one together. If it was me i would of added a bit of fanservice to the game. I can say artwise, though the graphics are pretty good, the devs dropped the ball hard on this game. It's a ok game if you just want combat, decent boss battles, but dont expect a great blow your mind game experience.    "

												Lords of Shadow 2 is a very good, but not quite a great game. It has some flaws, but it has fun gameplay and a rich atmosphere. It's mostly a character action game with some open world elements.Firstly, the good stuff. Most of the time playing this game you will be either in combat with enemies, or exploring the world. Combat is very fun and engaging, albeit not the deepest of the genre. It can't rival the likes of Platinum's work, but still creates a fun system that keeps you wanting more. It has a nice rhythm to it as it requires you to always keep an eye on enemies and properly timing blocking to keep your combo up, which is crucial for the ""Focus"" system. This system is also what gives you the power needed to use two of the three main weapons. These two weapons also have special effects, such as freezing enemies or burning away their armour, but break your Focus. It creates this flow to combat that feels very fluid and back-and-forth, meaning you can't get lazy and just endlessly wail on enemies without opposition, especially on higher difficulties. The different weapons also feel distinct from each other outside of their special effects. They each have different range, speed, and power, and there are plenty of combos in each weapon that all have a use in different combat situations, which are unlocked in an RPG style experience system.The aesthetic of the game is also great. Everything has a dark and intricate look to it, with stunning Gothic architecture and really interesting world and boss design. The soundtrack is also fantastic, with a sweeping orchestral sound that fits the melodramatic and dark feel of the game. This makes simply being in the game world and moving around it a lot of fun. It does a good job of helping you soak in the atmosphere, both in and out of combat. The kinaesthetics too, are fantastic. The weapons all have a very satisfying feel to them. A sense of power and impact, but also vibrancy. They leave trails colour that arc around in the air as you swing your weapons, or explosions when they hit enemies. Some of the more powerful moves are especially impressive in how they surround you in a storm of whirling lights that destroys everything in the area.The structure of the game world is pretty interesting as well, and quite unique for the genre. Unlike the first game in the Lords of Shadow series, this game is set in two moderately sized open-world areas. It is somewhat inspired by the traditional Castlevania style of level design, but isn't really the focus of the gameplay here. Yet it still manages to achieve this feeling of place to the game world. You can explore around the worlds seamlessly, without any loading screens, and many areas are connected, and sometimes loop around on each other. This also aids the sense of atmosphere to the game, and gives the game much better pacing than the first as well. Here, you're not thrown back to the main menu to sit through a long loading screen every fifteen minutes. It's nowhere near as dense and maze-like as the older Castlevania games, or something like Dark Souls, but for what it brings to the type of game it is, it's a great addition.There are also some areas of the game which are clearly lacking, though they are not anywhere near significant enough to ruin the experience.Firstly, there are the much lamented stealth sections. These are pretty bad, but not game-breakingly so. They feel half-baked and somewhat forced in to the game, by taking away your ability to fight while entering a stealth section. The mechanics of the stealth sections are also shallow, and it’s not exactly clear when you are detected or not. When you are, although it's not an instant failure, it might as well be, given that you will be attacked by enemies that can kill you in two hits or so, even with all the health upgrades. But even so, these sections are relatively rare. They make up only what is probably 5% or less of the actual main story. On top of that they are all incredibly short and easy. All they require you to do most of the time is sneak to the other side of a small room. Usually that involves nothing more than distracting one enemy, or possessing another. Additionally, once a stealth section has been cleared, you will never have to do it again if you return to the same area. Another problem is the story. It's a confused mess of underutilised characters and poorly explained plot devices. This game was set up as a big finale to the Lords of Shadow story, and unfortunately it mostly fails at that. There are a lot of characters in the game which don't get as much time as they need to really make the impact they could. They often appear only as bosses, given a short introduction and forgotten immediately after. While the boss fights themselves are fun, from a story perspective they feel like they are being given the short straw. There are also some elements of the story that are fairly crucial to the plot which aren't explained well at all. For example the Mirror of Fate, from the game of the same name, also plays a prominent role in this game, but its significance isn't explained here, and its role seems unrelated to the game it was introduced in. But despite this, there are a few good moments. A conversation or two that hit on some interesting points, although they are never explored as they could be, still bring out some good character moments. Even so, the story isn't a huge part of the game. It can be mostly ignored, and it's not as if the series had a particularly great story to begin with. The best part of the story was mostly the tone and feeling of it, which in both the previous games and this one, are mostly achieved through the aesthetics.So overall, Lords of Shadow 2 is a pretty good game. Far from perfect, but certainly undeserving of the baffling critical mauling it got. If you were a fan of the previous Lords of Shadow game(s), then this should be right up your alley as well. It's far from the best game in the world, but much like its predecessors, it is a flawed gem.As a side note, I recommend that if you have played the first game, but not Mirror of Fate, you should also play that before this one. The stories are quite closely connected, and as previously mentioned, this game expects you to be familiar with it. Although it’s not as good as LoS2, MoF is short and can be beaten in a day if you focus on only the main story.			"

												Despite the bad reception from the press, this game is  worthy of every single penny that you can waste on it.The combat has been so much improved that it would not be absurd to say it is one of the best combat systems i've encountered in a action-adventure game. The new weapons replace very well the light/dark magic system from LoS1.The exploration part is really solid, with a lot of powerups and collectibles for you to search for.The graphics are awesome and REALLY, REALLY OPTIMIZED. In terms of hardware, its very acessible.The story is very interesting and compelling, with some nice plot twists.The soundtrack is not as good as the first one, for it lacks the same quantity of high quality songs, inspite that, it still is a fantastic score.Can't wait until the DLC is launched on Steam so a i can continuing play this great game.

												Saw the IGN reviews and was skeptical about the quality of the new installment.  I am very happy to say the IGN reviewer has no idea what they are talking about.  The game is beautifully done.  The graphics finally feel like a step up from the console version (i felt LOS 1 PC version was almost identical to 360 version i also had).  anyways i am about two hours in and the game has me itching to play more. While it takes place in modern times you do get flash back sequences with your son trevor (before you turned him into Alucard) in a more classic castelvania setting.   If your a fan of the castlevania series you can't go wrong.			"

 Interesting game with many Pros and Cons. BLUF: Recomended IF you wait for a Steam Sale/game patching.Heres what I found to be the best and worst of the game, in order of presedence. Positives    Good story line   Very good visuals, particularily the scenery (it seemed this is where they put their most effort into.)   Fluid, responcive, satisfying combat. Completley reminicent to the God Of War series.   Good characters/voice acting. I personally enjoyed watching all of the cut scenes.   Partialy destructable enviornment. Cans clutter and such.   Challenging boss fights.  Negitives       It wants you to play with a game pad. The game does not seem to be designed for a mouse and keyboard. Every Single Time there is a quick time event the UI will come up telling you to spam things like the left trigger to an Xbox controller. Made me have to consult the key mapping way way too often.       Claims to be partly open world when it really is not. You get to revisit previously traveled to destinations. Mainly rooms and hallways in a completley linear path.      Dracula does not act like Dracula. You find yourself with menial tasks, and small obsticals that make little sence. You're supposed to be the Prince of Darkness.. Satan is concerned with how powerful you are.. but hold on I have to run down stairs to turn on a power switch to activate an elevator to go to the next floor. Tell me that's somthing a Vampire Lord would do.      Silly stealth sections. Again, knowing forwell that Satan fears you, you decide to morph into a rat and sneak around a guard or two, here and there. Must be one hell of a guard.  Insta kill if they find you btw. On that note, you never face them in open combat.       Invisible walls. If a spot is not game essential, you're not going there. Don't expect an Assassins Creed style of play here.      The game holds your hand the whole way through. The camera will usualy show you exactly where you need to go, how to get there, and have either a glowy thing waiting for you or a char shouting to you with explanations. Yet, some parts you just havent the foggiest bit of a hint of where to go.      Low replay value. There are elements present to keep you busy after the main story is over, however I can't see entertainment value lasting with that; or starting a new save; albite there are always diffrent difficulty levels if you're into that.      The only way to die in this game is in a giant explosion of blood. The enemies almost always blow up, or burst into blood. I think that greatly takes away from the feel of it.   Another game that likes to kill off just about everyone. You catch onto the trend of: Oh a new guy. Guess he's the next boss..  but this ones my opinion, maybe you just like all that murder.One list seems to be bigger than the other. Hrm.So to wrap up, The game has a solid foundation, and is fun; 15 ish+ hours gameplay. However there are some problems that sound like somebody put money over quality. I may have been nitpicking but this is a $60.00 game, and theres another $10.00 or so worth of DLC.Nothing is perfect, but if you're going to put somthing out at full price don't do it half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Regrettably, that seems to be what this is. They came so close but just didn't go all the way. As I said up top; Sure I'll recomend this title.. but not right now. This is somthing that you will enjoy playing, but not with the current pricetag/greavences.P.S.Is it just me or do the DLC costumes just look like a recolored version of what he's already wearing??

												It's a fun game, the gameplay is fun, but it doesn't look like a 100% castlevania , I think the idea of putting dracula on modern time is creative but it could have used some more thought, and sometimes the characters are a little bit dull, but I'd recommend the game.			"

												Castlevania LoS2 Is what I would define as bad oatmeal. Strong elements of several kinds without a smoot transition is what makes the experience feel forced, or what may force you to have harsh feelings about the game. (Like I did)Merging strong storytelling with exploration using cutscenes is a big no in the experience category. When you find a new area or get past or to a boss or story area, you get a cutscene that either  shows you everything you want to find on your own, or tells you a story that moves you from the area before you can finish exploring. Other games manage this type of merge by using character narration or slowing the walk speed. Strong combat elements with excessive backtracking: Having to down half a dozen enemies who are tiered to what part of the main story you are on just because you are looking for something is what I hate most about the game. The lack of loot and a equipment system makes me lose the edge for excessive combat, but in addition to that, almost every enemy has a ranged attack that has huge hitboxes that they are all too happy to use deciding you would like to skip the battle. Most battles near the endgame or after you gained a new traversal ability are begun with a groan because you've been shot off a ledge to the point where you do want to fight just so you can enjoy the game. The mastery system ends way too early to entice excessive battling and credits are easy to get provided you dpend them properly upgrading skills you'll most likely use. The open world element is trashed by an isolated map system and the same looking load elevators and hatches. Find things in this game is met with repeatedly going the wrong way and passing points where you cannot backtrack through the area after you jumped down. The areas are intertwined somewhat and only one or two pllaces have this problem, but that tied with the block the area rests in being behind one of like 5 blue elevator doors makes the experience irritating and repetitive.But after you swallow those strong flavors and seperate them by improvising, you can stop to appreaciate the art and fluidity of the combat and the thought they put into hiding the upgrades. And then when all that is getting good... The game is over. It's metroid all over again. Get the screw attack, Find stuff, kill the last guy. I just hope there is a secret boss or something. The alucard dlc is honestly why I bought the game. For some reason, everything dracula backwards is in seems to get more polish than the game itself... for some reason, that's still true. Alucard has proper last gen hair animation, a shiny coat, skin that is also pale but not sickening to look at, skills that are practical, a sword and movelist that probably drove the fans crazy, and one of the coolest ideas for a puzzle element ever. It doesn't break pace ever, and it makes you feel like you're a strong character. Instead of being dracula where you never even got to beat one of the guards that caused you so much trouble without taking over their body and dropping their gun. It's one of those games that gets better when you play it. The start is slow, and the search is tedius, but after you play through it, you realize it is really a fantastic idea made into a just okay game. Where in my opinion, Lament of innocence probably takes the cake for a castlevania game, and alucard still takes the cake for the coolest vampire. Dracula should have stayed dead... Could have been a way better game.			"

												Remember everything: a vampire is said to be ageless and immortal, yet it is an aged, anemic, amnesic Dracula we see at the begin of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2's story, after the flashbacked prologue reminiscing Golden Paladin Roland de Ronceval and the Brotherhood of Light's fatal assault on the Gothic castle five hundred years ago. Gabriel-Dracula, now a thousand years old, awakes at the exit of the Cathedral into the nocturnal streets of Castlevania City, built upon the remains of his old Castle. He won't be astray much time but soon be meeting the two characters guiding him through the plot: young Trevor Belmont, the never known son, and Zobek, Lord of the Dead and former nemesis, now an influential businessman.It apparently has been one of the developers' worries to enhance the game where the first Lords of Shadow has most been criticized: so the camera can freely be moved in a 360-degree angle now, the framerate is increased, and the formerly linear setting and storyline made place for an open-world design offering a greater variety in the pacing chosen. Also the gameplay has notably been improved and the sound, vibrant combat mechanics using the default X360 controller is thoroughly satisfying to use (Quick-Time Events can be deactivated in the Game Options menu).Well-executed are also the necessary climbing and jumping sections that seem largely scripted, in addition to some occasional platforming elements which are usually easy to achieve thanks to a generous savepoint system.Swarming bats indicate audibly where to proceed to the next ledge or ladder which is useful during as well as after beating the game, in addition to the White Wolf Medallion and the Map rooms for quick-traveling, to continue exploring the medieval Castle and the modern City.Both the epic bossfights and the numerous collectibles (580 in total) give the game its replay value, in order to try oneself on a higher difficulty level or get one's skills and gauges maxed out.No doubt, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is an ambitious game: what sets in quite like another God of War replica and stumbles at the gloomy entrance of Castlevania City's Sciences district, soon evolves into an extraordinary, creative Gothic action-adventure, with breathtaking visuals, atmospheric music (Óscar Araujo), and an unforgettable plot that relies heavily on the franchise's previous releases.Story-wise, Castlevania is an epic family drama the likes of Star Wars: akin to Anakin Skywalker, Gabriel Belmont changes sides as he becomes the Prince of Darkness which opposes him to his own son Alucard (Luke), albeit those family bonds seem to be the only human trait left as he shows indulgence towards Victor, leader of the Brotherhood of Light and last of the Belmont bloodline.The story finds a worthy conclusion in Lords of Shadow 2, but the myth is probably just too good to simply let it die: “Who knows what fate has in store.”Read the full user review on: http://www.gamespot.com/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-2/user-reviews/2200-12606707/ "

												the free camera makes it incredibly easy to be blindsided from off screen, the levels are so cluttered that the only way you can locate grabable ledges is when the game highlights them for you most of the time, just about has an unblockable attack for whtaever reason, even if the attack itself doesnt look like it should be. The story is complete nonsense, all I managed to gather was that you are dracula and you must stop Satan because of reasons. They pretty much removed all the clever platforming and normal puzzles that the first lords of shadow had. There is a new pointless stealth system that was poorly executed. While there are some improvements over its predeccessor, the bad far outweighs the good, don't waste your money. You're better off purchasing Dark Souls or Dark Souls 2.			"

												Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 has polarized its' audience upon release: while the game is mostly well received by the gamers, it's has been a subject to negative criticism by the game media.So is Lords of Shadow 2 a worthy sequel?There has been some changes since the prequel, some for the worse and some for the better.Lords of Shadow 2's core element is the combat which is very smooth and features a free movement camera. Gameplay wise the arcadish mission selection approach has been replaced by an open world with transitions from the present, modern age  to the medieval ages.There's also a stealth mechanics introduced in the sequel, which is largely criticized by many people.But is this new feature really THAT bad? I think not, while it certainly breaks the pace of the game, the number and difficulty of these segments are LOW, that it shouldn't bother many people. And certainly not a reason not to play the game because of these parts.That being said, this game is a very solid and entertaining entry in the franchise, which also concludes the Lords of Shadow trilogy!PROS:- Graphics are gorgeous, and performance wise the game is very well optimized!- Soundtrack is excellent, and so is the voice acting!- The game design also well done in Lords of Shadow 2. This includes the architecture, level, creature and boss designs.- Combat is easier, than Lords of Shadow 1, but still very satisfying.- Boss fights are easier than Lords of Shadow 1, but at the same time very entertainining.- Platforming segments are more fluent this time.- Lot's of content and collectibles providing huge replay value.NOT PRO, BUT NOT CON EITHER:- Due to the newly introduced open world approach, the arcadish level selection feature is gone in Lords of Shadow 2. This means boss fights cannot be replayed, unless you start a new game! CONS:- While the story is good, the story-telling is not so coherent as it was in the last game.- Some characters weren't introduced properly (lack of screentime)- Xbox button prompts, and console HUD. This wasn't an issue in the prequel, so there's no excuse here!- The difficulty decreased signifantly in all aspects. This includes platforming, combat and boss fights as well.- Puzzle elements were mostly removed from Lords of Shadow 2. It's a pity, the prequel had some nice puzzles.			"

												Castelvania: Lords of Shadow 2 is a wonderful ride from start to finish, with very few road bumps along the way. If you're a fan of action games, exploration games, or loved the first Lords of Shadow, there is plenty here to be happy about. However, if you were NOT a fan of the first game, there is little reinventing of the wheel here to pull you into the franchise.Gameplay: 8/10The exploration from the modern areas to the realm of Dracula's Castle is fluid. Dracula moves very intuitively, response time is great, and once the game really starts to open up its areas you really get this sense of a large scale fluid world. The negative here would be the platforming, or lack there of. Platforming in LOS2 is mostly just wall climbing from grapple to grapple. It can feel a little dull at times.Combat: 9/10The combat system from the first Lords of Shadow returns, but with a HUGE overhaul. It has been streamlined to perfection in almost every area. The pace at unlocking skills feels perfect, the variety of Dracula's weapons is interesting enough to keep combat feeling fresh, and the combinations of moves Dracula can perform make combat easily the most enjoyable experience of LOS2.Story: 8/10Continuing where LOS1's ending left off, the story of LOS2 is a great epic. There are moments in the story that had me jaw drop, the highs are fantastically done. However, there are low points. There are a few twists that you can see happening a mile away that occur, and there are two specific points in the story that really bring down the overall score. Without spoiling for those who haven't played, the two negatives I attribute to story are in the case of a character being VASTLY underused, and the game's ending.Music: 9/10It's awesome. Orchestral awesomeness. The somber tones, the high symphonies, everything. It's not classic Castlevania, but it deserves praise all its own.Graphics (PC): 8/10Even if there is occasional tearing and the odd lightning hear and there, LOS2 is very pleasing to look at. The game looks great.Other notes: As many have read, there are *stealth* sections in this game. I am not even going to dignify them to allow a drop in score, because they are NOT broken, NOR are they impossible. They slightly disrupt the flow of the game in some parts, but if you utilize ALL of your abilities (Shadow Daggers, Bats, Mist form, Possession) and use your brain, these sections are laughably easy. The most infamous response to these sections have been from Kotaku, who's reviewer got stuck on one particular section for FOUR hours. I completed the same section in less than two minutes. Use your abilities, and these sections are trivial.Overall: 8.75/10LOS2 is a great game that is sadly being underplayed by major media sources. It is NOT game of the year, sure, but this is a solid title that can stand on its own and a wonderful edition to the Castlevania franchise. Mercury Steam should be proud of LOS2, because they made a good game. I enjoyed my 14 hour playthrough, and will continue to play it for 100% and achievements.			"

												It's a big improvement of the first game. No doubt about that. Also I would love to like this game but it's decent at best. I'm pretty sure they made it as irritating as they could. I'm going to list the MAJOR grievances I have with this game.EXAMPLE: At one point in the game, you have to ride an elevator. So you kill a bunch of enemies and go to the elevator to find out it has no power. Then you go back to the entrance and start the generator. All enemies respawn and you kill them again. When you're finally at the elevator there's still no power since the generator has a timer >: ( So back to the entrance again and start the generator AGAIN! Then back to the elavator a final third time. Frustrates me to no end.The game constantly pulls this sort of thing. EXAMPLE: You see a powerup just out of reach. You move through the entire area of jumping puzzles and climbing to get to the top. That's where the way to the powerup is found and you have to jump down all the way to the beginning to get it.Unnecessary and long cutscenes is also gravely irritating. I love cutscenes when they tell story and fill a purpose.When you fast travel you get a 15 sec cutscene when he ""opens"" the device, a second cutscene (10 sec) when he enters, and a third (10 sec) when he exits. That is not fast. When you enter the shop there is a annoying cutscene every time.To be fair though you can skip the cutscenes by entering the pause menu and selecting skip cutscene but that is also slow and annoying.Oh! I broke my keybord in half in pure rage recently when playing the challenges in this game. You don't get full health or magic between tries. You don't even get back the levels of hp and mp you had when you entered the challenge if you retry. And the goals in the challenges are not set to be fun. They are set to be as irritating as (un)humanly possible.And the chupacabra character. I seriously want to punch the creator of that guy. I'm dead serious.Other than that it's a pretty decent game. Combat is mostly fun and the whole idea with the castle(won't say more) was actually great. The lore is a good read and the existance of dodo birds is a great relief for any perfectionist. Also the freedom to run around the city and castle however you want (after you've unlocked the area) is a welcome change in the series.Oh! Also the story is pretty bad.If it's on sale and you're bored, buy it. Otherwise stay away!			"

												Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is an action-adventure game, the sequel to the 2010 game Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, and the 34th installment in the Castlevania franchise (37th if one includes the 3 Pachislot games). The game was developed by MercurySteam and published by Konami. It was released late February 2014 in both North America and Europe and on March 2014 in Australia. A Japanese release was released on September 4, 2014. A downloadable chapter has also been released in March from the same year.GameplayAs in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game's opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula's main weapon is his Shadow Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula's health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take. Lords of Shadow 2 features a movable camera, something that was not available in its predecessor.My opinionThe game is fun, but it's optimized poorely. The controls with keyboard are pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥and FPS drops make it even more worse and PLUS horrible stealth mechanic ruins most of the fun. I fixed of the problems by using Razer Onza controller. This game has a good plot which I don't want to spoil, but if you're unfamiliar with the previous game- don't worry, there's a short re-cap in the start of the game.  The slasher elements make the gameplay live and interesting and the level up system doesn't award those who use only one combo, which makes you use different variations of attacks. The game is great for the money that are asked for it.Would recommend to:*Fans of Slashers*Fans of Vampires*Fans of games with great story*Fans of lags/horrible controlls/bad stealthWould not recommend to:*Old fans of Castlevania (Way before the first Lords of Shadow was released)			"

												tl;dr - Enjoyable hack-and-slash game in nice gothic environments.If playing with a Steam Controller, take note - some of the cutscenes are so long that the Steam Controller falls asleep and the game immediately pauses, asking you to connect a controller.  Find a way to get your controller to not sleep, you should be OK.Graphics - played nicely at 144fps on a GTX 980 Ti, no hitches, very smooth. Storywise, overall, it's as decent as a hack-and-slash can get. There are plenty of evocative names and mythological tie-ups, I felt they were well presented. I don't think it's necessary to play the prequel to this, there is a somewhat incoherent recap of the occurences, but it doesn't matter too much. I am one of the few people who is not a fan of the prequel to this game, but I'm happy with this one.The presentation of in-game lore was nicely done.  You have a book with nice drawings, short texts, there are diaries and even your power-ups have descriptions.  At times I felt some of the boss fights were a bit short, they just ended too quickly.   The final fight felt short and straightforward too.  I think perhaps the fights weren't meant to be difficult, just a means to move on.  Some of the mob-fights, however, were of satisfying difficulty.  Some reviewers are not happy about the stealth parts of the game.  I can relate, it's understandable, thankfully those parts are not too long and you can quickly get over it.  You can also return to those areas later.			"

												I don't think I've ever enjoyed destroying gothic furniture for bonus exp so much....But seriouslyCastlevania lords of shadow 2 was very hard for me to break into. I thouroughly enjoyed the first one, so much so that I was looking for the same "" magic "" in this game, the discovery and newness. Unfortunately it wasn't until about 3-4 hours in I started enjoying it. Perhaps I was trying too much to relive the the wide eyed amazement of the first game. Oh for sure, it's Castlevania, don't get me wrong, the story carries on extremely well from Lords of shadow 1 and mirror of fate and ties the 3 games together but I just didn't "" get it "" until that 3-4 hour mark. Graphically...supurb! I'm really amazed that this game engine looks so good and yet getting a decent framerate of 40-60 fps on full settings. Gameplay is alright, the combat can be monotonous.I enjoyed the story as it carries over from the previous two games. All in all a great game.			"

												In my opinion, most of the video reviews I came across don't give this game the credit it deserves. In a sentence, this is an excellent third person action game, with very nice and enjoyable combat mechanics, which is what matters to me most in this kind of games.Once you get a good feeling of the combat system (might take a while though), defeating hordes of enemies becomes very satisfying. Comparing it to the benchmark -in my opinion- of the category Batman Arkham City/Origins, you don't get to feel as invincible as Batman (although you're supposed to be even more badass), but the combinations and the options you have in the battle are more engaging.Most of the critics seem to point out how it is unfit for Dracula to be in a modern era context. Some others seem to dislike the story ending. Let me say that, although this is my first Castlevania game (since the original one on SNES :P ) and I didn't follow the earlier episodes, the story seemed to me to be brilliantly scripted, especially due to its clever ending (no spoilers), where everything is explained.If you are like me and are searching for a third person action game in the style of Batman Arkham series, where nice combat mechanics is your priority, then I think this is a game you will enjoy.

												I'm going to start by saying that my overall experience with this game is more positive than negative. While there are a few issues that detract from the overall experience, they are not serious enough for me to not recommend the game. Some key points follow.The combat system is an evolution of the one in the first game, with significant refinements that make for a very smooth experience. For example, you can dodge and parry attacks even in the air. While the skill trees for each of the weapons may seem labyrinthine at first, if you put some thought into how they're structured and how each of the moves are executed, you'll start to realize how elegantly designed Dracula's moveset is. Gone are the difficult-to-execute combos in the first Lords of Shadow; you now have a broad range of attacks that are easily performed with plenty of versatility for nearly any combat situation.Setting and environmental design is generally excellent. Both in the castle and in the city, there's a great sense of scale, and the level of detail put into the environment is absolutely incredible. Overall, it's designed in the open-world ""Metroidvania"" tradition, with plenty of exploration and discovery. Many level design cues have been taken from the Assassin's Creed series, which isn't a bad thing since I've always liked their level design; likewise, when not in combat, Dracula himself handles a lot like Connor from Assassin's Creed III. However, it is not completely flawless; ......in particular, some of the stealth sections need improvement. While the ones involving Golgoth Guards aren't exactly bad, Agreus's maze and Carmilla's blood curse puzzle are questionably designed, leaving the player very little room for error which can lead to frustration.The story is good, but not great. Dracula as a character has some very nice background but scenario design can be a bit better and the ending is a bit too open-ended.Again, neither of the last two points are enough to take away my recommendation. It's sad that these (relatively minor) flaws in an otherwise well-executed game led to such negative critical reception from several expert reviewers. Playing as the Prince of Darkness himself has been an unforgettable experience for me and I ultimately enjoyed the game. Recommended. "

												Mercury steam sequel of their reboot of the Castlevania series takes the ip back to its root of exploring an entire whole castle, where different sections have unique style, mechanics and monsters. It is probably the closest someone got to make a full 3D experience of Castlevania Symphony of the night. As for the first reboot the game is also at its core a spectacle fighting game.The story of the game is suspended between two moments in time. In the present, your character, Dracula, wakes up after a very…very long sleep and faces a the evil deeds that are being made in what remains of his castle, now part of a whole city with a high tech facility rule by evil itself. Dracula also has to gain back his lost powers and it will do so traveling back in time to his old castle. Unlocking new areas and abilities will allow Dracula to travel more and more freely to every part of the levels in the typical Metroidvania style. Enemies will respawn every time in the same place giving you always some challenge. It may though get to become repetitive (a common problem with backtracking in this type of game design). What will not become tiresome is how beautiful the environments are! Especially the old castle, simply stunning. The same effort was not exactly put into enemy design, which are a bit more repetitive than in the prequel (no more mounting on orcs or giant spiders!)The combat system is solid, strikes have impact force despite being almost all whip based and allow for a decent amount of combination, crowd control and power strikes, but not as much as tytles like Devil May Cry or Bayonetta. Mobility during combat is now much improved compared to the prequel, you can dash as much as you want in any direction, which really gives you the sensation of being a superpowered mischevious vampire that moves swiftly and strikes hard! The combat itself did not changed much from the first game. Magic attacks now use a sword and gauntlets instead of different colors of the whip attack, changing a lot the range of actions, but the combo scheme is copied into every weapon set (whip, sword and gauntlet alike).The interesting combat mechanic of the series, the focus mechanic, comes back. This mechanic builds up a meter for chaining combos and variation of techniques used (as the meter of score for Devil May Cry) and is set back to zero if you are hit. Instead of just being linked to a score rating this focus meter is directly linked to the combat. Once it is filled enemies start giving magic refill, which you can absorb to fill up one of your two magic style (healing/defense style with the sword or heavy attack style with the gauntlet). Timing your block properly is probably the most efficient way to build up focus meter and create opening to attack even stronger enemies. The sync block mechanic (such is the name of this timing block thing) will create a sort of light explosion which will stagger enemies and slow time for a bit, great visual effect and good for planning your reposte.I had the impressions that enemies and boss design had a step back compared to the prequel, but it may be due to the amount of time you will have to backtrack (especially for completionists).In conclusion, I liked playing this title as much as the prequel, it is probably a more direct 3D successor to Castlevania than the first Lords of Shadows. It has some flaws for sure, but it a solid title if you wish for a good spectacle fighter with a Castlevania flavor.  I really hope a third title comes out taking the good of Lords of Shadows 1 and 2, combining them and smoothing the mistakes. That would really be a great game…but unfortunately it is Konami we are talking about…so don’t hold your breath. "

												- Graphics :Very very good. Few glitches here & there. Still wondering why Dracul would have a shadow but no reflection (because they're kind of the same thing...). But a very nice and polished game graphically speaking. Artistic direction is... you know, quite nice. The environment are less numerous than in the previous game considering we really have two sets : the castle & the modern town, but both are cool to explore (yes, even the modern world).- Sound & Musics :Voice acting is yet again very good, musics are kind of below the quality of the first game's ones.- Gameplay :A bit better than the first game : it's still the same thinking but with more variety (you got a whip, your fists & a sword this time), the moves are really fun to launch and there's more strategy this time. The boss fights have also improved.... 'xcept the last one...- Storytelling :So, it's the conclusion, and all in all it's not that bad but there's one thing that totally ruined it for me : the ending. The last battle & the ending following that is one of the worst I've seen. Last battle : too easy and not at all making you feel involved in it. And the ending was totally rushed, it just sucks. This whole ending was completely rushed.- Length : Half the time you'll need to complete the first LoS, this game is much shorter (partly due to the fact that it's much easier)CONCLUSION :IT'S NOT A BAD GAME. You need to remember that. BUT:  it's lacking a lot in the storytelling (especially nearing the end) & in environment. I still recommend it because the whole experience isn't a bad one... not just the epic game everyone was expecting.....			"

												Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2: ːcsgostarː ːcsgostarː ːcsgostarː ːcsgostarːLords of Shadow and Mirrors of Fate are amazing games and couldn't be different with Lords of Shadow 2.Even with some skills very likely when we played as Gabriel Belmont (in Lords of Shadow); play as Dracula is a totally new and excited world. Using his Void Sword, Shadow Whip and Chaos Claws to create powerful combos you'll become invencible, and in this point I have a negative opinion to say: I'm not sure if is because I played the first game and know how the combat system works, but I felt the game much easier, even when I was playing in Prince of Darkness difficult (except fora some Kleidos Challenges - they made a great work in those challenges).They made a open world game this time and they made great in my opinion. Was amazing when I started to play and everything was...normal and as long I kept playing I could see the world changing around me.The fights, and in this point I have to say, they improved A LOT from the first game. Each weapon (Sword, Whip and Claws) has a different movement's tree and I just loved to use all: freezing smallers enemies and throwing them in the air with my Sword, breaking some shields and armors with my Chaos Storm and finishing them with my Whip was simply awesome, after all he's now Dracul and not just a simple human.Whitout no doubt a great game, not as much as the first one, but a great game. BUT like any game, this one has negative points too. Let's talk about bosses and enemies first.We play as Dracula, but there isn't much fights to enjoy all our powers, and should have more since is an open world game AND (yes, I know we play in present days), but I felt a bit out of context when I needed to fight against Mech (like robots) and enemies with guns (WTF face that moment), like Dracul just dropped of in another world. And I didn't see those epics bosses fights as I saw when I played the first game. The bosses in my opinion were just normal enemies a bit bigger (except for four: SPOILER WARNING the fights against the two first acolytes, Zobek and Satan). You won't see an epic Titan or a dangerous Lord or some powerful Necromancer.Well, even with some negatives points and some troubles (I'm not sure if was 'cause my computer or the game so I decided do not talk about them), I still recommend to everyone to play this awesome and beautiful game.

												If you're reading this review, you've probably played the original Castlevania: Lords of Shadow. If not, go check out that game first before you buy LoS 2, since this game relies VERY heavily on the backstory from the original LoS.For those of you who have played the original LoS and finished the game, your next question is probably going to be: how does LoS 2 compare to the original?I was a very big fan of the original LoS, and my review of that game gave it a 9 on 10, with high praise for its beautiful landscapes and art direction, for its incredible musical soundtrack, its professional voice acting, and for its ambition in telling the origin story of Castlevania. I felt its weak points were the holes in the story that sometimes just didn't make any sense, and the odd puzzles that forced you into a puzzle menu to play the associated minigame.LoS 2 retains all of the things that I felt made LoS a wonderful work of art, and also retains the higher resolution graphic textures that are unique to the PC version. It still runs easily at 120 fps for those who are using 120hz monitors and want to lock the VSync to the refresh. No screen tearing, no artifacts, just beauty. But be sure to disable the motion blur in the graphic settings (setting it to LOW is 100% disabled).The game looks stunning, the backdrops and scenery are jaw-dropping, the animation is superb and flows like water. New weapons in the game have their own detailed animations and combos, and open up a whole new God of War-like variation to weapon variety that wasn't present in the first LoS. The music is modernized but retains the original LoS theme throughout many of the compositions, keeping true to the original soundtrack (the composer is the same as the original LoS, so he knows exactly how to bring back variations on the old tunes). If you were a fan of the original, then I strongly recommend buying this game. In my opinion, this game is as good as the original, if not better in a number of ways. It isn't just a brand new story slapped on top of the old one, but rather it builds entirely on the story from the first LoS and gives it a full tribute in everything that it does. It is a very worthy sequel to the original game.As a final score, I give Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 a rating of 9 on 10.  The only reason it did not score a 10 on 10 was due to the introduction of a new stealth mechanic that wasn't entirely fleshed out enough. Thankfully it isn't used that frequently, but it can get frustrating when you're in the mood to kick♥♥♥♥♥and you're forced into a medicore stealth mode.I'd also like to thank Mercurysteam and Konami for releasing this game on PC, and for releasing it at the same time as their Console launches! They have shown us PC gamers a great deal of respect. Thank you!			"

												Don't mind the so called critics who gave 5-6 to this game. They gave 8 to Ghosts :)It's not perfect but for me it's 8/10.Good variety of environment, weapons, characters.It's plot is smooth, not boring and engaging. I don't have to talk about atmosphere. It was a great moment when i first walk in future (cutting here to avoid spoilers:))Combat could be better, for me even bosses is so easy. But it might get harder later.Graphics are perfect, considering it's an old-gen game. And it works great on ultra detail. If you want to buy it, do it. You won't regret.			"

												The original text was published on Kanobu on 25.02.2014I don’t know if a secret contest is taking place among the slasher game developers for the most over-the-top prologue*; but if there is one, then Lords of Shadow 2 is a shoe-in for the grand prize. First game of the series reboot by MercurySteam has greeted you with a slow gothic fantasy. This time the game gets right into the action. The protagonist is Dracula himself. He uses his own blood as a whip. His castle is under attack by an army of thousands. This army has a giant humanoid robot. The stakes are high, rivalries are thousands-of-years-old, prophecies are dark, and angels are fallen. And then there’s the usual removal of all those nice abilities which used to allow you to perform a complete massacre on poor grunts of the army which was attacking you.The combat system looks exactly like the one of its predecessor: accentuated counter-attacks and two bars of special energy used to break blocks and heal. Both kinds of magic now have unique weapons, but controls are still the same. What stands out is a free-floating camera as opposed to static angles from the first game. A lot of delightful improvements to what already worked perfectly before aren’t the biggest surprise. The game looks back at the series’ legacy and remembers where the second part of metroidvania term came from. The world is a holistic labyrinth with inaccessible high passages and grates standing in your way. This promise of big and small secrets is the foundation for everything else here. The story progression path goes in big stretches only occasionally offering to come back to the earlier places. You could replay levels in the first game to access locked upgrades once you’ve acquired the required ability, but you also had to go through the repetition of story scenes and routes weren’t particularly interesting.The second installment simply blends the secrets in the world as a part of a bigger picture. The scenery is grotesque most of the time and is occasionally filled with details for you to look at for some time. Half of the locations are in the future, of course, so it adds up to a final result of a truly bizarre over-stylized collage.The wild outlook in accompanied by an equally wild script. It defies logic in favor of having more and more bizarre characters and spectacular action scenes. If there’s a fight on a moving train it’ll end with a crash, explosions and acrobatics. You can’t just kill the giant boss — you have to rip out its heart. It is completely normal for the protagonist to ride a giant gas bottle because he needed a new entrance in the building. The headcount of unlucky enemies of Dracula is in a thousands range. Relentless postmodern carnival wouldn’t give you a break, so at some point you just can’t be surprised by anything. Raisa Volkova, the daughter of Satan? Sounds completely normal!Lords of Shadow 2 wants to go further than its predecessor so desperately and tries so much new stuff, that sometimes it ends with stuff that is just too cringeworthy. Clumsy stealth sections simply don’t hold up to the pace of the game and are irritating rather than entertaining.Still, you get transformations into blood mist and rat pack out of this torture. Two more instruments for world-exploring toolset. You can see in it the reminiscence of what Symphony of the Night did to Rondo of Blood. The story of the series also goes in circles on the moebius band of time-travelling nonsense. The game may pass a self-parody for the long franchise with a few dozens of titles in it. And that may be a good thing sometimes.			"

Give it a go if you enjoyed LOS1, otherwise give it a miss. I'd also reccommend playing through on hard, definately adds to the experience. Soundtrack + visuals are pretty damn good, as are voices and locations. Enemy designs are also pretty kick♥♥♥♥♥ though they lean more towards demonic rather than in the first game where you had random enemies (eg. Spiders)			"

												8/10 Not the best action game you're ever going to play but definitely worth considering if you're a fan of the genre. Stealth parts nearly ruins it, but the sound/visual quality is very good compared to other games. Story makes virtually no sense compared to the first LOS but the combat system is well worth the purchase, a lot deeper than other games, and along with a lot of collectibles make it worth a second playthrough.  Plays similar to GOW for puzzles/platforming to compliment the fighting which isn't a bad thing since there isn't that many games like this on PC. Like the first game though, took a lot of ideas from other games, but didn't really interograte them quite as well e.g. the pharmaceutical industry and the monsters; the failored light/shadow combat system (DMC), the stealth system (Dishonored), and the open exploration (Metroid-ish).Ending was slightly disappointing. Just seemed that the whole story wasn't well thought out enough plot wise. The DLC is worth a look too if you liked the main game.  Doesnt deserve all the bad press it got, and definitely look forward to going through a second time with a better laptop to really indulge on the visuals. Difficulty has been nerved compared to the LOS.			"

												I have been a fan of this series since the first game was released on NES. Although I liked the lore/story of the first Lord of Shadows a lot, I felt the first game was a little bloated with filler and lacked a strong third act. Lords of Shadow 2 is a better game and sequel.  Its a great twist with the changing of time (past/present) through the game and the mulitple, over the top boss fights (I really like a game with boss fights). I would highly recommend this to fans of the series. Unfortuantely, if you have not played the first Lords of Shadow the story is a continuation and will not make sense. PROS: Beautiful graphics/music to match. Awesome environments in the past and present time spans. CRAZY boss fights! Better story than the first. CONS: Too many skills and weapon upgrades that are not necessary. I used about four out of each set.             The transport system to teleport from each part of the city is far and inbetween.             Final boss was a little underwhelming.			"

												I have been hyped for this game ever since the first one was released and I've been counting days up until it's release. Imagine my disappointment when all the be game sites butchered the game pre-release and chrushed my hopes of this game being what I wanted it to be. But jesus were they wrong, I'm enjoying the game a lot so far and from what I heard it only gets better as you get deeper into it. From all the negative things the reviewers mention I can't find myself to agree with any of them, if you really like Castlevania games and you're not sure because of the reviews you read, trust me just try it for yourself and don't belive everything you read. I've even enjoyed the ""terrible stealth sequences"" every reviewer and his grandma keeps going on about.			"

												This is a very fun to play, yet poorly written game. The visuals are incredibly good, voice cast is awesome and voice acting is overwhelmingly amazing, combat is fun and diverse. If you know what you are doing, which you should be around 5-6 hours into the game, combat becomes very fluid and fun to repeat. Also the final boss fight was one of the best boss fights I've ever played. It managed to give the feeling of two very strong forces clashing.BUT, it's really hard to keep track of the story, because of the way the writer wanted to reveal things. The overall story was poor, yes, but the storytelling of it was even worse.Now to my suggestions for alternative names for this game;Public Property Smasher 2014, Vandalism Simulator 2014 and Furniture Destroyer: The Sequel.6.5/10 Enjoyed everything except the story telling, which is a big negative point for a VERY cinematically designed game.

												It's pretty awesome the Theme is so cool. It's a lot darker then the first one. But it's so exciting to fight the monsters and stuff!There are some weak moments, when you have to do stealh as a mouse.What's funny about the Game. The Bosses are really Cool but super weak... I had more trouble with the normal monsters.			"

												Ignoring all the reviews these so called game lovers publish, this game stays true to itself, it's the same style as the previous we all know and love, yes the graphics aren't next gen, but to be honest who cares when you are enjoying what your playing, it really brings a new meaning to the style of hack and slash while still having that gabriel style humor we all love. I would 100% recommend this to anyone who has played the first LoS, and would certainly recommend this to anyone who is new to the series. Certainly worth the money!!			"

												This is without a doubt, the BEST Castlevania game in years. Story heavy to the point where you feel the need to press on and learn more about Dracula and his past, topped off with plenty of action for your counter/dodge heavy beat em up fix. Starts off a bit slow, but once your about 2 hours in, the game really takes off. Beautiful enviroments and enemies, likeable characters, responsive controls, and plenty of game. Has little annoyances like pointless stealth aspects but nothing of which that will take away from your modern Castlevania experience. Highly reccomend.			"

												Poor sequel to LOS1. Too many cutscenes & too many QTE's but not enough gameplay.This is a very poor sequel to LOS1 (a superb game). Such a shame same developer as well but there you go a bloated tedious in places by the numbers God Of War clone set in the LOS universe. If you like QTE's instead of gameplay & designs borrowed from Dark Souls, Devil May Cry & Darksiders then you may like this but the gamplay is terrible due to the atrocious confusing level design & a dual nature (future/past). The Castlavania castle sections are superb the rest of the game is quite frankly filler to pad it out to twice  as long as it needed to be & the stealth sections are some of the worse seen in many years. I hope Konami can listen to consuer feedback & offer a patch to skip those stealth sections as they are nothing but frustating. You can skip the QTE's I hope a patch lets you skip the stealth sections as those alone hurt the game a lot bu the overall feeeling is of a developer who rushed this out the door. I have not even mentioned why they chose to have the main character as Dracula (I know how LOS1 ended) its so odd & adds nothing at all really. PC textures are also pretty poor in places after the great work on LOS1 you would expect at least the same on LOS2 but the developer has not put any real effort into the PC its barely different to the console versions apart from FPS.

												This game improves upon everything they did in first game.  No more fixed camera, and there's a decent arsenal of subweapon to experiment with.  They way you level up weapons and techniques encourages variety in combat.  Unlike the first game the Light and Dark magic forms have their own weapons.  Void Sword and Chaos Claws once leveled up can be used long enough so you can experiment with them instead of just using them when you know you the extra health or damage.  Also since the game is open world it's much easier to backtrack and find secrets you may have missed on your first time through.  That was the biggest pain about LoS1 since you have replay an entire stage.  Though at least the chapters were divided up into multiple areas.Hard to understand all the hate for this game, but I can understand some of it.  The story is a bit whacky, and the events that bridge the two games have their own 3DS game (which was ported to console and PC), but that game is really lackluster.  Kind of depressing since the summary they give in the beginning of this game is really interesting.  Almost wish that game would've been Lords of Shadow 2, then make this game Lords of Shadow 3.  My biggest complaint about the story is how they treated Victor Belmont.  I assume he's suppose to be Richter, but given that you meet him and 20 minutes later he sacrifices himself, I'm glad he's not Richter.  Really wish there was more of him in the game.Environments in the present day segments are pretty dull.  No real variations in it, just greyed out industrial areas.  The other parts of the set Castlevania's past feel alive.  Definitely feels like the devs had fun making those areas.  Enemy designs also don't feel very varied either.  Boss design is on point though aside from the final boss.  *SPOILER WARNING* Final boss is Satan inside Alucard's body.  I was hoping for something a little more unique.  And since you only see Alucard for the last little section of the game (though technically he is there for the entire game disguised as the Zobek's second in command) it's disappointing that he's only there for that last little bit.Speaking of Alucard.  his DLC is solid too.  It has actual cinemas unlike how the DLC for LoS1 was handled.  He doesn't have new weapons for the magic modes, but the DLC is just long enough you don't notice it.  The only disappointing thing about the DLC is Alucard doesn't have any attacks for his Bat Swarm or Spectral Wolf abilities in combat or with magic.  Would've been a nice touch.  Oh yeah, the actor that plays Rob Stark from Game of Thrones does his voice if you're wondering why he sounds familiar.			"

												The reviews were wrong in my opinion, giving it mediocre scores and saying the original was better. Besides the questionable stealth sections, this game is vastly superior to its predecessor. Im about four hours into the game and I'm enjoying this way more than LoS. The introduction of the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws shake up the gameplay and give it more flavor than using the whip all the time in the first game. The story is much more interesting than the first game and the combat feels much smoother and more rewarding. The enviroments are beautiful and the sound design is flawless. I'm already loving this game and I'm glad I ignored the review scores and picked it up anyways. So far I give this game an 8.5-9/10 but ill see if that changes when I get later into the game.			"

												Where do I start?The goal here was to improve upon on a good game that many claimed to be a ""God of War"" clone. Which it had similarities, sure, but to call it a clone is blasphemous. In fact, it possessed many qualities that made it superior even. The story, and acting was much better, for instance. The original had so many things going for it, and I for one, thought the fixed camera really showed you how beautiful the environments were. Lush forests, large abandoned temples, etc. Those things are replaced by castle, and rainy, dark alleyways. Not much variety there.The gameplay itself suffers from the new and 'improved' camera system. I feel like the fixed camera was done away with because we're sitting here saying to ourselves ""It's 2014, we're past this. Resident Evil was frustrating."" The truth is, it functioned very well in LOS, and you didn't have to fight that while also fighting swarms of enemies. That's the real issue with the new camera. You have a very claustrophobic point-of-view, and can't admire the environment even if it was really a sight to behold.  In fights, it backs out a little, but sometimes getting caught in an awkward corner and trying to manuever the camera while unleashing a planned combo at the time is not very fun. It turns making a well-timed block into a ""I can't see if the enemy is attacking"" kind of fight.The other issue is the story. The ending of LOS set the bar very high for this game, which is a little unfair, admittedly. I do feel like the game lost some punch in its delivery when it canned the narration from Patrick Stewart. And sometimes during the cutscenes, it doesn't feel like the acting is very into it. Very subdued, and uninspired.I could say more, but I can barely stomach the amount of time I've put into this game as it is.In shorter terms; Every area where LOS2 planned to improve upon its predecessor, it instead falls flat on its face.

												I wanted to love this game. I really did. Don't buy it unless you have a morbid curiousity to see what happened after the very entertaining first game. If you haven't played the first, go buy that instead.The first Lords of Shadow was an unexpected surprise for me, with gorgeous art and a fairly well told story backed up by solid action. Combined with a ridiculous twist and cliffhanger at the end, I was pretty excited to see where MercurySteam took the series next. On paper, it sounds pretty good. Expand the combat systems from the original game, continue the story, and place it in an open, Symphony of the Night style world that favors exploration.Then they went and cocked it all up. The action is barely distinguishable from the first, despite the huge change in character. You now have subweapons, but they are essentially palette swaps of the default whip with the properties of either the light or dark magic from the first game.The story is hilariously badly written, and at times borders on nonsensical. Character motivations frequently are completely impenetrable and illogical, and the ending of the game provides very little closure. The first thing that you see when the credits roll is that one man 'wrote and directed' the game. If I were him, I certainly wouldn't take credit for this wet fart of a story for fear of the death of my career.Classic metroidvania backtracking and openness is a great idea, but the biggest problem is that the map system is absolutely not up to the task. Modern metroidvanias like Shadow Complex frequently combine the classic 'grid' style map with indicators of an item that you have seen but were not able to access. LoS2 has a woefully inadequate 'world map' that is simply the names of different areas with the number of secrets you have yet to access. With all the shortcuts, twists and exits in each area, neither the world map or the local map (that basically confines its view to the loaded in level chunk with no indication of where exits go) is sufficient to make hunting for upgrades anything but a chore.And then there are the infamous stealth sections. God, the stealth sections. I'm typically against the death penalty, but whoever added those to the design doc needs to be publically executed. I want to watch. There are apologists for them, saying that they're 'more of a puzzle' than a stealth section. That may be true, but they're still a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥, inconsistant puzzle, using mechanics that do not smoothly integrate into the game. If you thought the 'boat stealth' sections from ACIV were the worst in recent memory, boy do I have a surprise for you.Alright, I've got that out of my system. Don't buy this for 60 bucks. Please don't.			"

												Lords of Shadow 2 continues where Lords of Shadow left off, almost literally, with an aged Dracula awakening during modern times, weakened and missing his memories from the past thousand years or so. Soon, Zobek comes to Dracula and informs him that Satan is preparing to return. Zobek offers Dracula eternal rest in return for destroying Satan’s acolytes, thus preventing Satan return. With the two coming to an agreement, Dracula sets out to recover his full power and prevent the return of Satan.As one of its strongest aspects, Lords of Shadow 2 expands on the excellent combat system from the original Lords of Shadow. Many of Dracula’s combat moves are very similar to those used in LoS, this time with a vampiric twist. Instead of the Combat Cross Dracula wields whips made from his own demonic blood. Instead of the light and chaos magic from the first game, Dracula has the Void Sword and Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can restore Dracula’s health with each successive hit, while the Chaos Claws increase the Dracula’s combat strength. Similar to the magic system from LoS, both the Void Sword and the Chaos Cross have their own pool of magic which can be restored by chaining combos, which drops magic orbs.Chaining combos is not as easy as it sounds however, as even the weakest enemies have ranged attacks, as well as strong unblockable attacks. Thankfully, Dracula’s dodge and parry will mostly keep the player safe as long as they are mindful of enemy patterns. Lords of Shadow 2, like Lords of Shadow before it, shows the player no mercy when they fail to dodge or parry an attack. In fact, even with some of the weakest enemies, a failed dodge can mean getting hit by a string of unblockable attacks until the enemies combos are over. This can lead to a somewhat abrupt death if the player does not manage to restore Dracula’s health immediately.Combat does feel more forgiving in Lords of Shadow 2 this time around, however. For one, checkpoints are more frequent and areas before large fights generally have an artifacts which allow Dracula to recharge his health and magic before heading into the fray. Helping to make things easier this time, secondary combat items such as daggers no longer require collection and instead recharge after a few seconds. There are also a host of consumable items in LoS2 that do everything from restore health and make attacks stronger to slow down time and give unlimited magic. These items make the difficulty curve in Lords of Shadow 2 feel more manageable, despite its sometimes unforgiving combat.Unfortunately, the game is not always about its fantastic combat system. Sometimes, the game slows to a crawl as Dracula is forced to use stealth to proceed. These segments see Dracula using some of his abilities such as possession, rat transformation, and bat swarm to progress. At first, the stealth segments make sense as Dracula is weak and needs to possess either scientists or cyborgs to progress. As Dracula recovers his powers however, it becomes unclear why he is forced to sneak about. Dracula can destroy one of Satan’s acolytes but is unfit to face a simple cyborg? It makes little sense.One particular stealth segment towards the middle of the game is particularly frustrating. Dracula is forced to sneak about a maze full of dry leaves as a boss actively hunts for him. If the boss hears Dracula step on the leaves, the boss finds Dracula and forces him back to the start of the maze, taking a portion of the player’s health. This is made worse by the boss actively pursuing Dracula regardless of the noise made, sending Dracula back to the start if he simply comes into line of sight. The segment is made all the more insulting since Dracula and the said boss fight almost immediately following the maze. What was the point of the maze at all? Why did Dracula run if he could simply stand and fight?Some of the frustrations involved with Lords of Shadows 2 also stem from what should have been its greatest strength: the open world. Without spoiling too much, the game basically revolved around two semi-open worlds: the city and Dracula’s castle. The game looks beautiful and the levels are mostly well designed, but the navigation map struggles to keep up. Sometimes the player is left with nothing more than a vague arrow pointing somewhere off-screen. I found myself several times wandering in circles only to discover a small ledge I strained to see or a far off switch I was supposed to hit with a dagger. These moments can be frustrating, and may be played off as exploration/puzzles but mostly just feel like poor design.In regards to puzzles, LoS2 is a little bit disappointing. While the volume of puzzles seems to have increased significantly from the previous entries, the quality seems to have gone down. Most of the puzzles boil down to pull this switch/use that power. Rarely do the puzzles reach the height of those in the original Lords of Shadow, if at all.That’s not to say the game doesn’t have its inspired moments though. Part way into the game, Dracula unlocks optional arena style challenges where the player can put Dracula’s powers to the test. These can be a lot of fun and test the player’s skill by doing such things as banning the use of a specific power or setting a time limit to kill enemies.There are also moments where the game shines creatively such as a first person feeding segment, some clever sliding puzzles, and an interactive play. Equally enjoyable are several segments in the game where Dracula fights with a companion at his side. Dracula may be required to work with his companion to platform past obstacles or to solve puzzles, which really feels great. These moments are too few and far between, unfortunately.On the more positive end of things, the boss fights in Lords of Shadow 2 are actually an improvement on Lords of Shadow and seems to take a page from Mirror of Fate. The fights feel more epic, with larger bosses, and fewer quick time events.  The QTE are mostly limited to escape animations but are sometimes used for boss finishers. Wisely, Mercury Stream has provided checkpoints before boss finishers which makes the QTE less frustrating. Wiser still, you can turn off QTE entirely if you so choose. With boss fights less reliant on QTE, the game flows a lot better, and it gives the player more of a sense of involvement during boss fights.As someone who actually enjoys the Lords of Shadow universe, I felt slightly let down by its supposed conclusion. While the ending was satisfying enough, it felt a bit abrupt and unexpected. The story also pays almost no attention to the events of Lords of Shadow, only vaguely referring to the game’s events. Instead, the game focuses more on events from Mirror of Fate. This combined with the sudden demise of some key characters and a lack of explanation regarding how the player comes to arrive at Dracula’s castle, make the story feel unrealized at times. This is further compounded by an ending that doesn’t necessarily feel appropriate for the series, especially given the general direction of the entire game’s story and portrayal of Dracula throughout.As the player progresses through Lords of Shadow 2, they see Dracula coming to terms with the monster that he has become - how becoming Dracula has affected him, his family, and the world around him. Unfortunately, that character progression just doesn’t live up to the ultimate ending, leaving loose ends right at the moment that it seemed everything was going to be tied up.Overall, Lords of Shadow 2 was an enjoyable experience despite some questionable gameplay additions and a lackluster ending. There’s a lot of content to Lords of Shadow 2 and a lot of fun to be had, including a New Game+ mode. Hopefully the upcoming Alucard DLC just ties up some of the loose ends that LoS2 left unraveled.

												It's games like this that really make me wish Steam has 3 recommendation buttons: thumbs up / thumbs down / apathetic shrug. Because LOS 2 is far from the great game the first one was, but also isn't totally crap - I'd say it's about 60/40 on the quality divide.If you played LOS 1 you'll recall it finished with a gob smacking reveal - that had me extremely curious as to how the developers would follow up on this audacious twist. As it turns out - not particularly well. It's a beat em up platformer just like the first, but in this case the camera is moveable - which makes a big, and unwelcome, difference as it is slightly too far out to see the action, and also gets obscured by the ridiculous amount of special effects that happen with EVERY attack.The game begins back in ye olde days with Dracula's castle being attacked by a giant robot that looks like a building. At first I was like WTF  is that?? because it looks utterly stupid - until I remembered the Titans from LOS 1: those majestic towering elemental creatures that were so impressive. Well, this is one of those - except it's been put through the moronometer, and come out with totally dumb design. Technically impressive for sure, but so NOT Castlevania!If you hated the liberties the first game took with the series design - you'll be frothing at the mouth over this one....and I'd probably best not mention it gets even worse when the game jumps back to the present day, because those bits will  likely cause your brain to explode in disgust. They annoyed me, and I wasn't bothered by LOS 1's changes. In the modern day bits you begin by traipsing through a pharmaceutical warehouse, beating up crates and plastic barrels - but not the enemies because you are too weedy after starving yourself of blood for hundreds of years. Yet there's a cutscene where Dracula gleefully murders a family of three - kid included - to regain some of his strength, and to show you how EVIL he has become...err, okay ...not really selling it so far (mainly due to Robert Carlylse's utterly♥♥♥♥♥♥performance), but whatevs!Anyway, because you've become a total wimp  the first enemies you face have an enforced stealth aspect, which is pretty basic - and by the way, said enemies are big dudes in demonic armour with a gun bigger than you are.......Wot tha fudge?Eventually you get through these dull encounters, and get sucked back into ye olde times - which thankfully are (a) much more enjoyable, and (b) less crap stylistically, though the first boss you face in this world isn't the greatest to look at. Duff them up, explore a bit more, and then...it's back to the crappy warehouse, traipse thru that some more, and it's back to ye olde world. The games a YOYO!!! Ye olde world =good, modern day=big bag'o'shitoBack in yon days of lore there's a bit with these creepy snake headed girls that's very....creepy, as they skitter about, and contort themselves in a fashion that really won't be doing their spine any favours. They're genuinely disturbing, yet at the same time it's such a pity the whole game seems incapable of maintaining the menace they exude. The boss battle that precedes this bit has an awfully written cutscene, that's very japanese (even though the devs are spanish...) With an overtly sexual demonic villainess who laughs like a demented walrus, and then says you make her wet....yeeeessss, ok then. The bizarrest thing about all this - the first game had Hideo Kojima involved and wasn't this bad, this time around he was nowhere near this game and it's even more Hideo Kojimaesque than Hideo Kojima. And, well, that's as far as I've got so far : that's an awful lot of crappy aspects for the first 3 or 4 hours of a game. There's still some enjoyment to be had with it, but it's a shadow of LOS's greatness and a horrendous treatment of Castlevania.On the plus side - Patrick Stewart is much less awful this time around, so there's that. So, here goes - time to push the 'meh' recommend button, oh wait - there isn't one.			"

												As much as I would like to, I cannot recommend ""Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2"". OK, yes - fighting is perfectlty fine. Especially since devs dropped the fixed camera. But everything else? Not so much. It's like devs tought ""We have a good fighting that we improved with working camera. Lets call it a day, just fit anything as the rest. Who cares anyway - it's the beating that matters"". And  so we have booooooooring plot, told in Fast Forward mode (even faster than in previous part). With some sort of poor stealth sections instead of puzzles. And of course there are still platforming elements but just as in part 1 - you have to be deliberatly sabotaging yourself to fail them. And the visuals... Castle part is ok. Really. But the City?! Jesus, it's supposed to be somewhere around year 2000. So why dafuq everything that can tries to look like World War I thing?! The things that cannot are just plainand simple putting fantasy stuff in early XX's cetury seting, Which never looks good. I know, I know - we all want to be unique and original. But that doesn't mean we have to be ugly or do ugly things. And - last but not least - technicals. The game does not recognize controllers other than Xbox's. You are very limited at keybinding (for example, the game does not recognise mouse side buttons). And autosave feature is f***** up - which means that you will see info about ""autoseve issues"" which is a kind way of saying ""Next time you start the game, we will ask you to do it from the begging"" cause you cant save on youir own. So make sure you kep somwhere copies of your autosaves.			"

												I loved the hell out of the first Lords of Shadow, and I enjoyed this game as well. However, it's not without its share of problems.First and foremost, there's the setting. I didn't mind the fact that a significant portion of the game was set in the near future, but the open nature of the environments (both the castle and the city) seemed to sap the creative element from their design. Yes, it's cool that all of it links together, but that feeling of exploring strange new landscapes with all their weird quirks has been completely sacrificed. I get that it works with the plot, but I feel like the game would have benefited from having a level structure like the first.Speaking of plot, there's the second problem. The story in LoS2 doesn't stack up to the first game at all, opting to go with a campier plot more reminscent of other Castlevania games than the original Lords of Shadow. While this isn't inherently a bad thing (I love Castlevania as a series, cheese and all), there's a massive plot hole introduced at the beginning of the game that is never resolved. Dracula was defeated at the end of Mirror of Fate, but apparently rose up again at some point between that game and this one. This is entirely glossed over in the main narrative and only offhandedly mentioned in Alucard's lore entry. I might be expecting too much out of the story of a Castlevania game, but it bothers me nonetheless given the detail and work put into the first game.Then there's the stealth sections. Oh god, the stealth sections. For the most part it's not too bad; there is one enemy type that requires you to go around instead of confronting directly. These sections are mostly just mild hiccups in the pacing (which also isn't quite as good as the first game), but the final one is absolutely one of the worst segments I've had the displeasure of playing through. Not only is this segment immensly frustrating, but you battle the thing you were sneaking around immediately afterwards; no new weapon, no new powers, no upgrades whatsoever. You just fight it straight away, essentially rendering all the work you just did completely pointless.Fortunately, it's not all bad. The combat is a ton of fun, giving you three different weapons with distinct features and fighting styles. It also looks fantastic; though I disparaged the nature of the new environments earlier, I can't deny the level of detail put into the city and Dracula's castle. The creatures and characters all look great too, from the detailed facial animations of the humanoids to Satan's grotesque abominations. Voice acting is solid; the actors did a good job delivering the lukewarm script in a believable way.All in all, Lords of Shadow 2 is a solid action game with a few flaws. Go into it expecting more of a Devil May Cry experience than a Lords of Shadow 1 experience and I think you'll be able to derive more enjoyment from it that way.			"

												Great transitional game from Metal Gear Revengence as far as some mechanics are concerned.  The last time I actually played one was either on Nintendos first game system or the Super version, but none of them compares to the enhancements that I have seen this game take with this game.  People complain about the stealth missions which is something I dont understand being as though it does not take away any gameplay performance for me and keeps me interested in the story line.  Great graphics on the Alienware 14 as well as gameplay, bosses and a ton of action upgrades to weaponry.  I am not even done with this game and I am already for the follow up, just dont change to much that could hurt the winning streak.			"

The settings and environment, oh my gosh it was spectacular. Mad props to the design crew. So yeah I recommend this game. (♥♥♥♥ the agreus sneaking part, ♥♥♥♥ that part)			"

												Fantastic game, the Art Style is amazing with really cool enemy design, the boss designs are outstanding.Its like Darksiders with less puzzles which i'm glad for. And the story was quite ok.I enjoyed the combat, combo system is easy to remeber, and combos level up your Weapons.

I enjoyed the boss fights as i said bosses look Epic, and not many huge bosses like in the first game, there is only 1 and half huge boss fight in this game, but i'm ok with it.Early in the game you encounter stealthy parts which are really just puzzles, easy and was kinda fun to find out how you can solve them for me. For those who hate this kinda stuff just youtube that part, the rest of the game is really good.

And last but no least the game has a smaller open world to Metroidvenia style, acquire power to cross.And the game is a collectible fest for those who enjoy collecting stuff.

												Allow me to add to the chorus that says ""The Metacritic Score is a lie.""This was a good game. Though it differs from the first. It is by that measure that I think its best compared.+Graphical Presentation+The first game had your character crossing an elaborate, Lord of the Rings like world with plenty of variety and set pieces. It was absolutely beautiful.None of that beauty comes close to be realized here. Instead, what you get is an atmosphere......THAT ACTUALLY FEELS LIKE CASTLEVANIA!There are many reviewers who will cry at the fact that the last game was prettier, but here, you are in a dark, moody castle with full control of your camera and dammit I just couldn't help but love how it actually felt like you were involved in a dark tale of vampires and demons, unlike the first. So between this and the first, its an apples to oranges comparision. In the end, the graphical presentation gives you that SoTN feel that the first game was missing (the sexy mountaintops of LoS1 be darned).+Story (Spoiler Free)+The first game was about losing faith. The second game is about redemption. Obviously. What else is new? What's important here is characterization and voice acting delivery. To which it does an absolutely fantastic job of delivering. Though, in my view, its story is not as heavy as the first, given that every single chapter in LoS1 had Captain Picarde himself explaining what the heck is going on in detail. We really could've used that narration to explain some of the strange stuff having in this castle-city. Like what the heck is a castle doing here in the first place? That was a head-trip, but hey, its Dracula; his castle be constantly respawning I guess.So here's what I recommend you do before jumping in here: 1) Play the first game first (or read its cliff-notes). 2) Play Mirror of Fate (or read its cliff-notes) . They frequently make references to the first game and the hand-held tie-in so if you skip these steps then expect a confusing plot. Given that I didn't skip these steps, I found LoS2 to make for a pretty good story. Certainly has more heart than most games these days. It's like a DMC that you can take seriously.+Gameplay+Here is the one place where I can say without a doubt that it delivers better than the first game. You see, LoS2 is easier than the first, for all the RIGHT reasons.The first had some Nintendo-hard bulls*** issues holding it back that have been fixed. For one, you have more options given the three weapons to choose from. The lame Light and Dark Magic system is replaced by an Ice Weapon and Fire Weapon.  In the first game, you only switched to Light to heal on occasion and that was it, as you were constantly struggling to fill up the focus meter to fuel your heals. Dark magic was never used. It was nothing more than an unimportant DPS buff. Here, the replacements to the old magic honestly feels different enough for you to want to mix it up, what with the fire ability being able to break enemy shields and blocking (in addition to doing more DPS), and the ice sword having some mean crowd control abilities (in addition to healing you). Filling up the focus meter is much faster and easier so you can continue to fuel these things without fear, and with the camera in your control, you just won't feel as frustrated as before.The side items and powers are must more useful as well, and a power you get later on adds a whole new dimension to to your defensive options. Overall, I'd say LoS1 comes no where CLOSE to being a steller action game in the gameplay department. It was servicable and that was it. Here, we actually have a system that's as fun as God of War.  YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ DRACULA, AND NO ONE CAN F*** WITH YOU! You ARE the final boss of over 30 games, and nothing can stop you, only slow you down.Hell yeah. About the only thing relatively weak are the stealth sections, which make sense only at the start of the game...how is it that you're a threat to Satan, but these red guys can blow your♥♥♥♥♥away doing 9999 damage per shot? I need Captain Picarde to explain. Fortunately, such sections are mercifully short and easy.There are also fewer puzzles than the first game. But who cares?+Overall+Overall I give this game a 7.9/10. Its not the greatest thing since Bayonetta but taken as a whole, the Lord of Shadows series offers the best story in the action game genre today...taken as a whole.  View Lord of Shadows 1 and 2 as one really long epic and you're pretty much doing it right. When the dust clears, you'll likely give this game a worthy playthrough on New Game + and have fun with it as well.			"

												If you expect this game to be of the same caliber as the sublime Lords of Shadow, prepare for bitterest disappointment.  While the fighting is responsive and the PC optimization is excellent, too much of the game is a mess.The levels, in layout and aesthetic, are by and large atrocious; the magnificent fantasy forests and brooding, vine-choked ruins of the first game have been exchanged for tedious near-future cityscape where 90-degree angles dominate (nice attempt at camouflage with those pretty textures, Mercury Steam, but they can only go so far).   There are a few brief, beautiful segments that take place within Dracula's ""inner castle,"" but these are over too soon and serve to highlight the dull ugliness of the metropolis, which is confusing, repetitive and filled to the boxy margins with generic, endlessly respawning T-Virus monsters.  Yes, you spend most of the game battling urbanites transformed into Biohazard C-stringers by a Satanic biological agent, and they are a dull lot indeed.  The worst gameplay sections of all are the stealth bits.  In these, Dracula, who is supposed to be the baddest damn thing in the world, Dracula, who demolishes building-sized gorgons, Dracula, who ultimately succeeds in deep sixing Satan himself, must hide from cyborg guards with plasma rifles who are able to one-shot him on sight!  Aside from making absolutely no sense in terms of the game world, these bitter bits of Metal Gear lite are distinctly unfun.  Hell, you don't even get to kill one of the damn things!  The bad guys should have just sent an army of these cyborg guys after Dracula, thus ensuring the Devil's terrestrial reign forever.The storytelling in Lords of Shadow 2, like everything else in it, seems patchy and incomplete.  In concept, it was a great idea (you'll see this if you stick it through to the end), but the execution is completely slapdash, leaving even some of the most important plot points, particularly the seemingly transdimensional status of Dracula's castle, unexplained.  Most of the time, you'll be unsure of why you are doing what you are doing.Despite all, I recommend this -- but only for the price of ten or fewer U.S. dollars, and only if the shockingly fun DLC, Revelations, is included.  Surprised?  Well, as I said, the story isn't bad, it's just badly told for the most part; if you are fan of the first Lords of Shadow, you'll want to the experience the unexpectedly cool ending of LOS2.  Also, most of the boss fights are pretty damned great, particularly the epic final battle!    Lords of Shadow 2 is a poor Lords of Shadow game and kind of a bad Castlevania game, but it's not really a bad game, just a mediocre one with a few redeeming bright spots.  By all means, give it a whirl when it's on sale.			"

												This new Castlevania series just isn't for everyone.Personally I loved it.  The first game ended on an interesting note and the LoS2 picks up right at that point.A game controller is recommended.Many people didn't like the stealth segments, but they're really brief and play out more like simple puzzles with minimal punishment for mistakes.Pros: Great PC Port: Rendering / Performance and Framerate were fantastic.  No bugs encountered. The Intro (First 15 minutes) were outstanding. Excellent boss fights, one of which has become one of my favorites in the Castlevania series. Crisp, Responsive Combat system.  Nice animations. Great Soundtrack The Intro and Middle-section of the game are excellent along with the ""Revelations DLC""Cons:*spoilers* All 3 weapons do share the same special moves upgrades which does make them a bit less unique. If you don't like the Xbox 360 Controller you may need a modification in order to use your preferred controller. The Ending was both abrupt and lacking but apparently Konami asked Mercury Steam to keep the ending open so that they could continue the series[/list] "

												Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is the latest in the Castlevania franchise. This title is a hack and slash action oriented game that is not for the faint of heart. Those who dislike blood and gore are likely to turn away from this game, however those who like blood guts and gore can go nuts. Fans of Castlevania will appreciate this game to a point, however those new to the series may find things a little confusing.For starters, the control system in the game is very fluid for the most part. Abilities can be used at will depending on the situation at hand. Swapping between the 3 weapons you get in the game is very smooth, switching from one to the other and back again at the touch of a button while keeping a combo going. The combat in general is smooth, however there are minor things that can be very disheartening for newer players. Unblockable attacks can be overlooked given the amount of things going on in a heated battle at times. For example, fights with a lot of dirt, rubble, blood and enemies flying everywhere can sometimes (not always) block your view from unblockable attacks meaning you are going to get hit. And in a life or death situation this is very annoying.The difficulty of the game varies between 4 difficulties, 3 of which are available from the outset. The 4th difficulty is unlocked by beating the game once. A veteran of games from series like Devil May Cry will not find the initial ""hard mode"" all that difficult. While it can be a challenge at times managing the players health and resources on hard, it isn't deathly hard. For newer players the easy and normal difficulties can provide their own challenge, but all in all things are very much dumbed down for ease of play.Graphically, this game is incredible. The HD textures make everything within the environments stand out. From the tiniest pebble on the ground to the largest building in the distance, the developers have not skimped on anything. The whole game looks amazing from start to finish. The addition of several hundred pieces of concept art makes the whole look of things even better. The animations for every enemy, and every npc are very fuild, very good at depicting a certain realism about things.The music in this game is also once again incredible with a few minor exceptions. Certain cutscenes have music that just doesn't fit at all. No emotion is felt from the music, no meaning. However that is just a few places. For the most part the music, and sounds in general are very well placed, very well composed and very well done overall. Voice acting is quite good, at times it's a bit questionable however again for the most part it fits, and is very well done by the actors including Robert Carlyle and Patrick Stewart.Now. The major gripe I have with this game is the lack of direction throughout a lot of the games ""open world"" sections. Your minimap shows you the general direction on where to go, but a lot of the time you can spend a fair amount of time searching for the way to go. This could be a ledge to grapple, or a wall to walk around. For the most part things are easy to spot, but there were several times where I had to look around the area, after backtracking and re-entering the room just to find where to go next.To conclude, I would give this game 8/10. It is a good solid game, well built and with a lot of nice features and well crafted gameplay. If you like hack and slash adventure games then this is a definite pick-up. 15 hours of solid gameplay minimum, well over 20 with NG+ and challenges, as well as the concept art collection. Those who know the Castlevania games of old may frown upon its story, but give it a shot and you'll like it.			"

												This review is written after having played almost three hours of gameplay with intent to play more. It's also important to note that this is written from the point of view of someone who has not played any of the Castlevania's before Lord of Shadow (The first one.)Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 thrusts you into the role of Gabriel Belmont (otherwise known as Dracula) who is disturbed from his centuries of rest to once again battle Satan. The game stands well on it's own and I feel like someone who hasn't played the first game can still pick up this one and not be confused as to what is going on. However, I also feel like if someone were to have played the first one they will enjoy the story a lot more than if they didn't. (This is easily remedied by reading a wikipedia summary or watching the cutscenes of the first game on youtube.)The gameplay is reminiscent of Devil May Cry, Ninja Gaiden and other stylish action fighters. You do combos against multiple enemies and emphasis is placed on avoiding attacks to survive. Even the normal mode feels difficult because there is just so much going on and it's easy to lose track of enemies that end up behind you. However, the combos you can upgrade into feel almost pointless when you can just mash your single target attack, dodge and come out victorious. However, it also does some things good by giving your weapons meaning. The Void Blade restores health through attacks and the Chaos claws deal extra damage to enemies. Dodging attacks is essential because in order to use these weapons you need to build up a combo meter which allows ""blood orbs"" to appear which gives power to the weapons.Where Castlevania: LoS2 sets itself apart from Devil May Cry and Ninja Gaiden is in the platforming sections. With Devil May cry you time a bunch of jumps and with Ninja Gaiden you run across rooftops. With Castlevania it manages to execute a good platforming experience reminiscent of games like Prince of Persia. You'll scale up walls while under siege by enemies, time perfect jumps and use your abilities to reach hidden spots to power up Dracula.I also think it's worthwhile to note that if you dislike Quick Time Events(QTE), there is an option to disable QTE's in the game menu. This is a huge step forward as a lot of gamers moan and gripe about having to ""Press X to not die"" and I hope to see this option more in the future in other games.Overall, if you liked Ninja Gaiden or Devil May Cry you'll find a similarly enjoyable experience in Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2.

												Muito Bom!!!!- Excelentes graficos, principalmente se seu computador aguenta rodar tudo no max com o pacote de texturas em HD- Sistema simples e fácil de combos com evolução intuitiva de habilidades e magias- Ambientação simplesmente arrasadora, principalmente nas partes antigas. As partes modernas ficaram boas mas Clastlevania é um jogo que precisa te levar ao passado com suas construçoes em pedra e com uma ambientação escura e sinistra- Ele é longo, de uma forma positiva e diferente do primeiro, não é como se o jogo te enrrolasse para durar mais, mais ele tem fôlego para te prender realmente por muito tempo. Segundo alguns reviews que li pode chegar a 15h horas se você for rápido e 20h procurando todos os itens escondidos, ou seja, vale o seu dinheiro - A arte do jogo é linda com tantos detalhes que da ate pra se pegar olhando para o cenario sem se mexer, só admirar. - História mediana, mas na longa vida da saga já houveram bem piores - Se você jogou o primeiro e gostou, não se desapontará com essa bela continuação. Se você gosta de jogos de ação a la GOW você vai gostar. - Dois contras: Dificuldade fácil demais mesmo em níveis dificeis e inimigos menos carismaticos do que o jogo anterior			"

												Castlevania LoS 2, takes everything that was in the first game, and makes it better. The light magic has been changed to cool sword (*heh pun), and shadow magic is replaced with fiery claws. The graphics are better and this time and you can control the camera. The combat system is also much better in this game than in LoS 1. Storytelling in LoS 2 is between mediocre and good, and I actually liked few of the ""Forced references"" there was in the game... WHAT IS A MAN?*  The only complaint I have about this game is the final boss, which was kinda boring and too easy even on hard difficulty. It was a cool final boss though. come on, it is Dracula VS Alucard... How cool is that?  <-OOPS, spoilers.The final boss in the first LoS is still better (but not as cool) though, as it had some interesting aspects to the fight.I'm currently on my second playthrough, this time on new even harder difficulty. I hope the final boss this time will be more interesting.			"

												I simply... can't stop playing this game. Near finishing it up, I've got to say Mercury really did an awesome job with LoS2. When they meant the game was going to be ""open world"", they weren't kidding; no map stage selection screen to revisit stages or whatever, you gotta backtrack either on foot, or through warps (map rooms) which, I admit it can be a bit tedious at times but, I don't mind (especially when you get to grind on enemies along the way). The story is great and we get to see a more human side of Dracula in comparison to the previous iterations before the reboot of the series. The contents to collect and search throughout the game is pretty vast (void/chaos/life crystals, kleidos nails, soldier/memorial scrolls, and other sub-weapon expansions). The skills and skill mastering system is also pretty deep (SO MANY MOVES YO! :V ). But enough about me gushing over this game! :D ENOUGH TALK, HAVE AT IT... and discover for yourself. :D			"

												Lords of Shadow had wonderful graphics, great combat, spectacular boss fights, clever and interesting puzzles, brilliant art design with lush worlds and fun enemies, a heart felt story and a fine performance by Patrick Stewart.This? Has a fine (but small) performance by Patrick Stewart.Graphics? I think the first game looked better and I played that on 360. No support for resolutions above 1080p btw.Puzzles? Flip a switch, sometimes twice or turn into a rat and sneak by. I mean you're Dracula right? You can turn into a dragon and scorch the earth, Satan himself is afraid to leave the pits of hell to fight you...but you gotta sneak by these Golgath guards.Art design? Hope you like brown! And sewers! And empty bulidings! What is this, 2007?Enemies? Mechs and guys with guns. Because that's what you want in a Castlevania game, right?!Not to mention a terrible targeting system, sloppy platforming and some all around poor design including having to wander around for 5-10 minutes prior to the final mission.I played through all 20 hours of Ride to Hell Retribution and had more fun than this. There were 4 times towards the end of that game I considered quitting and not finishing it, this was at 4 times 7 hours in. Then it got worse. I somehow managed to finish it anyway.Game producer Enric Álvarez said of Edge's 4/10 review ""one must be blind or stupid to give a 4/10 mark to a game with this quality"" and he is correct. How this got anything above a 2/10 I'll never know.I do highly reccomend the original Lords of Shadow and Mirror of Fate but I'm quite sure this unseated Assassin's Creed III as worst game sequel.

												Somehow this game is even LESS like Castlevania than Lords of Shadow 1.It's like Mercury Stream's objective was to cram in as many aspects from OTHER successful games as possible, hoping that by emulating them that they'd make a blockbuster. This game took a lot of chances by drastically distancing themselves from the traditional Castlevania formula and judging by the abysmal metacritic score, things didn't pan out for this game as the devs had hoped. Dracula endures stealth segments like metal gear solid and at times transforms into a rat to covertly delve into enemy ground, very much like the morph ball from Metroid Prime. Also instead of a level select book like in the prequel we now have a psuedo open world to explore, like SotN. Beating up enemies is a 1:1 conversion from the previous game and the rockclimbing simulation aspect was reigned in just slightly.I have a few gripes about this game. Though the overhead map in the corner ensured I'd not be lost for very long, I still managed to get stuck in several rooms scratching my head hoplessly trying to figure out what to do or pick up to continue. Eventually I'd stumble upon whichever asanine detail of the room I had missed in my multiple examinations.This game's biggest shortcoming is the plot. The writers had an outline of what they wanted to have the main character do and feel, and while they try to explain his motivation the game just feels full of holes.This game is like a delicious recipie with some fresh ingredients, but the chef forgot to stir the pot as it was cooking so now the meal separated. Rather than blend together into one satisfying experience we have competing facets of gameplay (flavors) that seem to detract from one another. I heard mercury stream had a lot of problems. Maybe if the people running the company paid their employees and stopped enforcing their asanine and uninspired ideas over the people who had experience making games then this game would have been better recieved. As it is only TWO people on my ~200 friend list have bought your game and BOTH dropped it more than halfway through. Despite all this game's shortcomings it has plenty to offer and overall I enjoyed playing it.			"

												I loved ""Lords of Shadow"" and the intermediary sequel, ""Mirror of Fate"", but I heard a lot of bad news about this game before it came out on Steam. There was a letter from someone in the development team that talked about how the production was disjointed, some bad reviews, etc. There was no way I was going to pass on it though.The player returns again to the role of Gabriel Belmont, who is now Dracula. Following a tutorial level that takes place in his castle, the game is divided between two major environments, both of which are ""free to explore"". The first is the city of Castlevania in the 2040s or 2050s (mostly modern, but with some nice cyberpunk and gothic touches), while the other is Dracula's castle of antiquity (which has been destroyed in the modern day, but still exists as an extradimensional realm; I don't believe it is in Dracula's mind).Unlike the fixed camera angles of ""Lords of Shadow"", this game features a true 3rd person over-the-shoulder camera. It is well executed, and allows the player to really drink in the beautiful visuals that drip ambience. I personally preferred the castle to the modern levels, though.Combat still consists of basic attacks, combos, dodging, special weapons, and special powers. I have to admit that most of the fights were a bit dry for me. Most enemies require a single special tactic to defeat, and I frequently found myself looking for ways to bypass them (and there aren't enough ways in the game to do so). The designs are interesting, but fighting even common enemies frequently took as long as a boss fight; that was annoying.The boss battles are a lot of fun, mixing again a good amount of combat, quick-time elements, cinematics, and great music. Unfortunately the game suffers from boring boss battle environments; like the first game, it's usually just a sort of open arena (though the music, in my opinion, imparts the sense of swinging around to avoid attacks and other epic thoughts.)The voice acting and story are still excellent. Robert Carlyle and Patrick Stewart really have to carry most of it, and they do great jobs. The game takes some time to defeat, though all the events occur in a single night (this is undoubtedly longer for Gabriel/Dracula, since half of the game involves him traveling to his other-dimensional castle).The music in this game is AMAZING. It's probably my favorite video game score, and possibly my favorite of both video games and movies. To say that composer Óscar Araujo accomplished something amazing would be an understatement.Despite so many similarities, this game didn't feel the same as the first ""Lords of Shadow"", so I can't say this one is either better or worse. There are some weak points in the gameplay (such as some enemies that Dracula is NEVER able to defeat in combat, regardless of how powerful you become), but this is balanced by some truly amazing scenes as well (the train battle comes to mind).In some way it is more ""Castlevania"" than the first game, and less so in other ways.Ultimately, I would recommend highly it to Castlevania fans as well as fantasy action fans. It's a shame that this game will be the last in the series (to my understanding). Mercury Steam and the designers did a great job of creating a Castlevania series that represents Western concepts and artistic values over the Japanese anime style that the original games devolved into.

												According to Steam I've sunk 16.8 hours into this game from beginning to end, and two of that was on the last boss, because jeez, what a pain!If you were a fan of Lords Of Shadow 1 then the next entry should definitely satisfy your jonesing for another foray as Gabriel Belmont.  The story is decent, it's not an amazing articulate and in depth thriller, but it is serviceable for the game that it is, and honestly, as far as Castlevania games go, it is probably the best story.  (People really seem to love the 'plots' of Castlevania games without understanding that the story is generally pretty weak.)Gameplay-wise, big improvement over LoS1.  The camera isn't locked, the environments are open for fighting and the ""background"" doesn't obstruct the combat the way it did in LoS1.The platforming is guided, there aren't a lot of fall down and die challenges, if you can make a leap, you'll make a leap, and there's a lot less guesswork than there was in the first one since the camera now sits behind Gabriel not a mile away from him while you judge a gap.The pace does get disrupted in several moments with these bizarre stealth pieces that, as you approach the end of the game, will have you wondering how it is you still aren't powerful enough to sneak around enemies you should be able to kill.  If you've been playing about 45 minutes of combat, then expect to spend the next 45 dealing with sneaking.  There are a couple of scenes that will definitely test the frustration durability of your controller as well.The game allows backtracking, but it isn't as crucial as it was in LoS1.  I remember in LoS1 NEEDING to go back and get some more upgrades because combat was such a pain.  In this I tended to find enough health upgrades, power upgrades etc. along the way if I kept my eyes open for side passes, that I did not backtrack at all.I didn't backtrack because it is a giant pain in the♥♥♥♥♥  The environments are HUGE, there is a quick travel system but it goes to like 4 waypoints in massive areas in the city or in the castle, so it doesn't exactly put you right where you want to be.  I thought about it said ""nope"" and never backtracked, aside from hitting up a shop.You may also get locked into certain fights and you can't back out of them to go back and farm health potions, so you're screwed.  Let's just say I spent so long fighting the last boss starting with a shred of health and zero void sword power that I had to learn how to fight and counter him effectively.  I'm probably pretty much unbeatable now thanks to my own lack of preparation going in to the end game.Despite some of the flaws, fun game.So...Get this if:You love the atmosphere / plot of the Castlevania games and aren't so linear in your thinking that ""ZOMGZ ITS NOT CASTLEVANIA IF ITS NOT 2D!""  Or if you were ever a fan of the Legacy of Kain games, because there hasn't been a better ""bad♥♥♥♥♥vampire platformer"" since the last ones of those were made.Avoid it if: You need complicated platforming, not the hand holding kind, or if you're the kind of person who will put a game down if the pace of it gets disrupted.  Because this game definitely upsets its own pace several times during a playthrough, and then it just sits on your computer never getting played.When in doubt:Steam sale!			"

												I have been a fan of the Castlevania Saga since its very early days on the nintendo consoles. Seeing the first LoS on my gaming rig made me salivate and I was not disappointed. Awesome storyline, great voice acting and a perfect mixture of puzzles and action bathing in a dark graphical and musical atmosphere.Now here comes LoS2 and I was ready to sharpen my holy swiss army cross against a legion of blood suckers again... which... you don't get to do per se. Now, don't get me wrong, I wasn't upset about the choice of having to play as Dracula. I wasn't bothered by the rather mind boggling flashbacks and choices for his resurrection. What DID make me quite mad, was the lack of consistency of the story compared to the prior game. Plot holes scattered all over, questions about some enemies which remain unanswered (you know, those mechanical ones...). Quite honestly, by trying to give you more freedom by opening up the ""world"" and let you travel back and forth to reach secrets you could not get before acquiring specific powers, the developers actually have damaged the game rather than improving it. I found myself running around like a vampire on the beach at noon all over the place to end up at random places for not much more than a couple of XP. Rather disappointing.But frankly, the game gets better the more you play it and old Fangs gets his powers back to kick to serious booty. Puzzles, action, frantic action, lots of blood and body parts flying around. Seriously entertaining. And the end is satisfying.Overall, it's a notch down compared to LoS, but not a complete disaster. Much could have been done to make it more engaging and gripping if the story had been more consistent. But aside from that, I'd say that I would recommend this game nonetheless, especially on sale. It's good. Not jaw dropping awesome but solid.			"

												Well, after playing and seeing such a beautiful story as Lords of Shadow's and Mirror of Fate's, Lords of Shadow 2 didn't meet my expectations. Gameplay is much better than Lords of Shadow but Lords of Shadow's features were much better than Lords of Shadow 2's. It took me 39 hours to finish the game 100% along with the Revelations DLC while first one took 44 hours. Story is shorter than the first one. I did a speedrun and I beat the story in 6 hours. It's not a very short story but if I could've done the same in first one, I'm sure it would've took me no less than 12 hours. Stealth sections are terrible. They were pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ I can understand that stealth section which you had to do in the beginning but the other ones were really unneceserry. I mean he is Dracula and he is immortal. Why would he prefer stealth to action? I don't even wanna talk about that stealth section just before Agreus boss fight. And that ending... well after seeing beautiful endings of the other games, this ending was a disappointment. Long story short, gameplay is OK but story? Nah.			"

												Muito Bom!!!!- Excelentes graficos, principalmente se seu computador aguenta rodar tudo no max com o pacote de texturas em HD- Sistema simples e fácil de combos com evolução intuitiva de habilidades e magias- Ambientação simplesmente arrasadora, principalmente nas partes antigas. As partes modernas ficaram boas mas Clastlevania é um jogo que precisa te levar ao passado com suas construçoes em pedra e com uma ambientação escura e sinistra- Ele é longo, de uma forma positiva e diferente do primeiro, não é como se o jogo te enrrolasse para durar mais, mais ele tem fôlego para te prender realmente por muito tempo. Segundo alguns reviews que li pode chegar a 15h horas se você for rápido e 20h procurando todos os itens escondidos, ou seja, vale o seu dinheiro - A arte do jogo é linda com tantos detalhes que da ate pra se pegar olhando para o cenario sem se mexer, só admirar. - História mediana, mas na longa vida da saga já houveram bem piores - Se você jogou o primeiro e gostou, não se desapontará com essa bela continuação. Se você gosta de jogos de ação a la GOW você vai gostar. - Dois contras: Dificuldade fácil demais mesmo em níveis dificeis e inimigos menos carismaticos do que o jogo anterior			"

												Castlevania LoS 2, takes everything that was in the first game, and makes it better. The light magic has been changed to cool sword (*heh pun), and shadow magic is replaced with fiery claws. The graphics are better and this time and you can control the camera. The combat system is also much better in this game than in LoS 1. Storytelling in LoS 2 is between mediocre and good, and I actually liked few of the ""Forced references"" there was in the game... WHAT IS A MAN?*  The only complaint I have about this game is the final boss, which was kinda boring and too easy even on hard difficulty. It was a cool final boss though. come on, it is Dracula VS Alucard... How cool is that?  <-OOPS, spoilers.The final boss in the first LoS is still better (but not as cool) though, as it had some interesting aspects to the fight.I'm currently on my second playthrough, this time on new even harder difficulty. I hope the final boss this time will be more interesting.			"

												I simply... can't stop playing this game. Near finishing it up, I've got to say Mercury really did an awesome job with LoS2. When they meant the game was going to be ""open world"", they weren't kidding; no map stage selection screen to revisit stages or whatever, you gotta backtrack either on foot, or through warps (map rooms) which, I admit it can be a bit tedious at times but, I don't mind (especially when you get to grind on enemies along the way). The story is great and we get to see a more human side of Dracula in comparison to the previous iterations before the reboot of the series. The contents to collect and search throughout the game is pretty vast (void/chaos/life crystals, kleidos nails, soldier/memorial scrolls, and other sub-weapon expansions). The skills and skill mastering system is also pretty deep (SO MANY MOVES YO! :V ). But enough about me gushing over this game! :D ENOUGH TALK, HAVE AT IT... and discover for yourself. :D			"

												This review is written after having played almost three hours of gameplay with intent to play more. It's also important to note that this is written from the point of view of someone who has not played any of the Castlevania's before Lord of Shadow (The first one.)Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 thrusts you into the role of Gabriel Belmont (otherwise known as Dracula) who is disturbed from his centuries of rest to once again battle Satan. The game stands well on it's own and I feel like someone who hasn't played the first game can still pick up this one and not be confused as to what is going on. However, I also feel like if someone were to have played the first one they will enjoy the story a lot more than if they didn't. (This is easily remedied by reading a wikipedia summary or watching the cutscenes of the first game on youtube.)The gameplay is reminiscent of Devil May Cry, Ninja Gaiden and other stylish action fighters. You do combos against multiple enemies and emphasis is placed on avoiding attacks to survive. Even the normal mode feels difficult because there is just so much going on and it's easy to lose track of enemies that end up behind you. However, the combos you can upgrade into feel almost pointless when you can just mash your single target attack, dodge and come out victorious. However, it also does some things good by giving your weapons meaning. The Void Blade restores health through attacks and the Chaos claws deal extra damage to enemies. Dodging attacks is essential because in order to use these weapons you need to build up a combo meter which allows ""blood orbs"" to appear which gives power to the weapons.Where Castlevania: LoS2 sets itself apart from Devil May Cry and Ninja Gaiden is in the platforming sections. With Devil May cry you time a bunch of jumps and with Ninja Gaiden you run across rooftops. With Castlevania it manages to execute a good platforming experience reminiscent of games like Prince of Persia. You'll scale up walls while under siege by enemies, time perfect jumps and use your abilities to reach hidden spots to power up Dracula.I also think it's worthwhile to note that if you dislike Quick Time Events(QTE), there is an option to disable QTE's in the game menu. This is a huge step forward as a lot of gamers moan and gripe about having to ""Press X to not die"" and I hope to see this option more in the future in other games.Overall, if you liked Ninja Gaiden or Devil May Cry you'll find a similarly enjoyable experience in Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2.

												According to Steam I've sunk 16.8 hours into this game from beginning to end, and two of that was on the last boss, because jeez, what a pain!If you were a fan of Lords Of Shadow 1 then the next entry should definitely satisfy your jonesing for another foray as Gabriel Belmont.  The story is decent, it's not an amazing articulate and in depth thriller, but it is serviceable for the game that it is, and honestly, as far as Castlevania games go, it is probably the best story.  (People really seem to love the 'plots' of Castlevania games without understanding that the story is generally pretty weak.)Gameplay-wise, big improvement over LoS1.  The camera isn't locked, the environments are open for fighting and the ""background"" doesn't obstruct the combat the way it did in LoS1.The platforming is guided, there aren't a lot of fall down and die challenges, if you can make a leap, you'll make a leap, and there's a lot less guesswork than there was in the first one since the camera now sits behind Gabriel not a mile away from him while you judge a gap.The pace does get disrupted in several moments with these bizarre stealth pieces that, as you approach the end of the game, will have you wondering how it is you still aren't powerful enough to sneak around enemies you should be able to kill.  If you've been playing about 45 minutes of combat, then expect to spend the next 45 dealing with sneaking.  There are a couple of scenes that will definitely test the frustration durability of your controller as well.The game allows backtracking, but it isn't as crucial as it was in LoS1.  I remember in LoS1 NEEDING to go back and get some more upgrades because combat was such a pain.  In this I tended to find enough health upgrades, power upgrades etc. along the way if I kept my eyes open for side passes, that I did not backtrack at all.I didn't backtrack because it is a giant pain in the♥♥♥♥♥  The environments are HUGE, there is a quick travel system but it goes to like 4 waypoints in massive areas in the city or in the castle, so it doesn't exactly put you right where you want to be.  I thought about it said ""nope"" and never backtracked, aside from hitting up a shop.You may also get locked into certain fights and you can't back out of them to go back and farm health potions, so you're screwed.  Let's just say I spent so long fighting the last boss starting with a shred of health and zero void sword power that I had to learn how to fight and counter him effectively.  I'm probably pretty much unbeatable now thanks to my own lack of preparation going in to the end game.Despite some of the flaws, fun game.So...Get this if:You love the atmosphere / plot of the Castlevania games and aren't so linear in your thinking that ""ZOMGZ ITS NOT CASTLEVANIA IF ITS NOT 2D!""  Or if you were ever a fan of the Legacy of Kain games, because there hasn't been a better ""bad♥♥♥♥♥vampire platformer"" since the last ones of those were made.Avoid it if: You need complicated platforming, not the hand holding kind, or if you're the kind of person who will put a game down if the pace of it gets disrupted.  Because this game definitely upsets its own pace several times during a playthrough, and then it just sits on your computer never getting played.When in doubt:Steam sale!			"

												After a little more than 15 hours of a rather painful experience, I've finally managed to plough through the boredom, frustration and dismay, feeling a great and lasting sadness when the credits finally rolled over, putting an end the whole agony.A calamitous art direction:  Bland and repetitive backdrops (sewers, laboratory, castle, then more sewers), poor choice of a de-saturated almost monochromatic color palette (everything seems to be just another variation of grey), botched facial 3D renders (the characters' faces look like plastic with absolutely no emotional range, Dracula's face is particularly bad and almost laughable), uninspired character design (Nergal is just some random bald dude and Satan looks like a gym bro on steroids).Incoherent game design:  Ridiculous mandatory and aggravating stealth (the 'Agreus' sequence is already famous all across internet, and that's not even talking about Dracula being forced to transform into a rat to avoid security guards that are stronger than Satan), exploration ruined by a archaic game structure and sub-par plat-forming (the wolf game mechanic breaks the rhythm and the climbing is either unclear or too easy with the pointers).Mediocre sound design:  The only thing worth listening to is Dracula's theme at the title screen and a couple of action themes during the prologue, the rest being forgettable (compared to the first Lords of Shadow, this is a major let down), and the voice actors seem to be reading their lines more than they are giving it any kind of emotional depth (Robert Carlyle, Patrick Stewart and Richard Madden, shame on you ! You guys were so much better in previous games !).A decent plot, completely destroyed by the worst appalling ending I've ever witnessed in a triple A game.  The story is actually interesting if you've completed both the first Lords of Shadow and Mirror of Fate (otherwise, don't even bother), but the grand finale and the game's ending is so embarrassingly insulting, it's actually a league of its own. Combat mechanics are half-way decent, since it's basically a dumbed-down version of the first game (the game is much easier, thanks to a larger Synchronized Block window and an overpowered evade move, which knocks down and interrupts enemies), but let's not delude ourselves any longer and call this game what it is: shameful.Objectively, it's not the worst piece of gaming♥♥♥♥♥♥this century, but unfortunately the first Lords of Shadow which was published 3 years before this sequel, is just way better in every possible way (yes, even the fixed camera which actually provided some cinematic flair).  As a fan of the first Lords of Shadow and having always argued about Mirror of Fate's qualities (still waiting for it on Steam), Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 has been such a disappointment it has made me depressed, disgusted and hateful.  And I don't play video games to be depressed, disgusted and hateful.  You have been warned. "

I thought the things that needed to be improved on from the first LOS (like the camera) were and at least there was some effort made to bring some new elements to the game.  Were all those elements needed or well executedt? Not really, but I dont think they made a big enough impact to deter me from playing, they were just things I could have done without.  Story aside, I enjoyed playing this game more than the first.  And the story isn't that bad, but compared to the first LOS it falls flat, and I could see some people having a negative gut reaction to to where the story is going within the first half hour of the game and that may sour your opinion of the game as a whole but Io have played much worse games that have better ratings than this. If you played and enjoyed the first LOS, you need to play this game.  If you haven't played the first one, do so before this one. If you think all Castlevania games should be like the ones from the  80's, dont play this game.			"

												I'm only 3 hours into the game, but so far I have enjoyed it.  Feels very God-of-War like, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Combat is fun although there's not much here that hasn't been done before.  Combat skill trees are present.  Exploration is fun as well despite not being truly open world, it's still fun to find hidden secrets.  They bring back staple items like the hourglass that can slow enemies' movements, etc.  That along with destructible things like candlesticks that hide experience points or other goodies keeps it feeling like Castlevania.  Not sure about the modern setting, but most of the environments don't reflect a modern look anyway, it still looks like dilapidated castles, etc. for the most part.The graphics are not fantastic, particularly in the distance some of the meshes have very jagged outlines, even with settings maxed.  The lighting/shadows in cut scenes can also be pretty distracting.  Much has been made about the stealth aspect of the game, but I didn't find it overwhelmingly unpleasant, although it did make me itch to get back into the combat and exploration where the game shines.  Ultimately I'm glad I bought the game "

												I really tried to like this game. I think the best part I played was the tutorial. Whoever thought stealth gameplay was a good idea needs to be exiled to Antartica.

												What a botched sequel this truly is. I loved Lords of Shadow. It had some issues, but was incredibly enjoyable, from the variety of settings to the classic monsters Gabriel did battle with. I'd read that this one was very slow to get going, but that once it did, it was solid. That disappointed me in and of itself, but it also made me wait for a sale to buy it. Finally a good one came along, and I bought the game, looking forward to get back into the world and see what had become of Gabriel since we'd last met. Because I'd read the reviews already, I was willing to sludge through the awful stealth sections where you have to turn into a rat to accomplish a variety of goals. And yes, they were terrible. But what was also very annoying was a constant sense of ""where do I go"" and ""what am I supposed to do now?"" A lot of time was spent backtracking or wandering all over the map looking for the next goal. There were areas that I couldn't get to simply because I wasn't SUPPOSED to get to them yet, even though I could see things I wanted just beyond simple things like rocks that Dracula should've easily been able to leap over and obtain. Not this Dracula. So that took me right out of the immersion. But OK, I can overlook it if the game itself is good. It's just the opposite of the first LoS to me. That one was excellent with a few flaws. This one is generally bad with a few bright spots, none of which make up for the game as a whole. The voice acting, aside from Dracula, is absolutely terrible, especially the ""extras"" you fight who constantly shout out the same lines over and over. The monsters in this one are poorly designed as well, and even the humans look bizarre. Garbriel's head often seems way too small for his giant body, for instance. Some of the fights were OK, but the vast majority just came down to relentless button mashing mixed with evasion. You can learn all the ""cool moves"" you want, but you really don't need them. Just mash that X and Y, and you'll get through most of the fights. Boss battles are typical of the problem with so many of these types of games today: big, giant, lumbering beasts or creatures that you have to climb or hit a glowing portion on, blah, blah, blah. Nothing exciting, nothing very interesting. The only thing that kept me going in this was really wanting to see a resolution to Dracula's story. Quite frankly, I wanted to see him become Gabriel again. But about 3/4 of the way in, I realized that, despite what some of the reviews said, this game was not getting much better. I was revisiting the same places over and over again, and who wants to walk Dracula around science labs in a game like this? Drab, boring science labs is where you spend much of the game, not the gothic settings of the first. SPOILER:Anyway, I was getting so frustrated wtih the game that I decided to spoil the ending for myself. I wanted to see if it was worth playing through to the end for a solid payoff. Well ... for me, it's not. Not even close. There was no resolution whatsoever. Silly me. How could I not get that they were just going to leave everything open-ended for yet another one of these things. The plot has become idiotic, downright stupid. I felt dumber for having played as much as I did. But at least I got it on sale. A true shame what they did to this franchise after such a great predecessor. Do not recommend this game at all.			"

In my opinion Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 failed to deliver (I played these two games right after another).Much shorter, the story was more straiht forwarded (lesser twists) and the bossfights weren't as interesting as the first.I should have stopped after the first game.

												Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is with distance one of the best Action RPG's ever made!Short: The Story is excellent and it contains Love, Hate, Vengeance and Sadness, also is well told and full of Surprises.The Gameplay and Combatsystem is fluid.Graphically this game is maybe not up-to-date, but it looks really good and every level in this game is wonderfully designed and affectionately made.Over time you get many upgrades which grants you more Ability's and skill's.More detailed:Story: The story tells of a former member of the Brotherhood of Light, named Gabriel Belmont.Many years after the Brotherhood of Light started to Hunt and Fight against Dracula alias Gabriel Belmont [Play part 1 to know why Gabriel is Dracula] a old ""Friend"" of Gabriel looked for him [you will wonder who it is if you know part 1] to ask for help defeating Satan again to save the World, because he wants revenge and destroy the world. Gabriels ""Friend"" make him an offer which he almost can't refuse.Also a Character which is akin with Gabriel, has an important role in this game. Even there is a second one who is akin with Gabriel, but find out by yourself =)So his Journey begins again ...Gameplay/Combat: The Gameplay and Combatsystem is a little bit slower as in part 1 but still really smooth and the controls are even really good and comprehensible. Over time you can learn more and more Ability's and Skill's which you can use by using the right button combination and timing. I played it with the Xbox360 Pad and it works perfect in all cases.Barely you have smaller stealth parts in this game which can take some time and sometimes you must transform yourself into a rat ;) also to find secrets.Enemys: like in part 1 there are many different Enemys. Every Foe has his unique style and his own behavior and/or abilitys and skills, which makes every Battle with an unknown enemy different from each other until you know them all. Some of the Bosses are little bit harder as like the Bosses in part 1, but good beatable.Soundtrack: The Soundtrack fits perfect to the game! It was made from a Orchesta.Graphic: The graphic is outdated but this gameengine looks Awesome!Environment: You have different surroundings in part 2. Sometimes you are in the Presence and sometimes you are in the Past which is technically important for the Story. Like in the first part, every detail is well designed and looks really good.Riddles: This game has many Riddles which must be solved to get further. Some are Easy, some Average and some Riddles are really Hard for the first time,Over and all this Game is totally worth the Money! You will not make a wrong decision if you buy this game. Also you will need to spend 13 - 21 hours approximately to beat the game the first time.Have a nice Day ^.^			"

												A game i waited over 3 years for, expecting a final epic battle against satan and his army in hell but what we got was a bunch of running around a city with crappy stealth sections and just a lack of varied enemies, with almost nothing related to the castlevania universe. Should mention that the tutorials are horrific in this game and leaves a bad first impression right there but other than those things, its a pretty decent game with good combat and somewhat fun exploring(when you go back in time ofc, to avoid those horrible city sections.) and the boss fights are quiet nice, most of them are really well designed and badass but also not too difficult. At its current price i find it hard to recommend this game, at least if you are a fan of the first Lords of Shadow game but when it drops down to 20-15€ then it would be worth the price and worth giving a shot. Quick round up the good thing and bad things of the game.Pros: +Really good looking graphics and runs really smooth with not a single framedrop+Medieval era is awesome and looks fantastic+Combat is great and fun+The Orchestral music in the medieval areas and most boss fights are fantasticCons:-The Orchestral music during the city sections are really bad-Very few different kinds of enemies-Story is mediocre-Stealth is boring-So is the whole city-Characters this time around are not as interesting or memorable as the first game.EDIT: Now that the DLC is out but cant be reviewed seperatley, i will just combine it with this.The revelations DLC is a fantastic piece of content but still feels like it was cut from the main game just too make some extra cash. So you play as Alucard this time to retrieve Draculas weapons for whats coming next for him when he  wakes up. Sounds simple and a bit boring but it was much better than i expected.The big thing about this is NO STEALTH or CITIES, it only takes place in the castle and it looks amazing and has some nice puzzles and exploring the castle is fun.Now how is it controlling Alucard? I find it awesome, he has a good variation of combat skills and his abillities are cool but they have no purpose in combat. Instead of having a different weapon like Dracula for his light and dark magic, he has a sword with light and dark magic which might sound a bit lame but its not, works really well and its not too hard to learn the combat skills.Overall this is one of the best DLC's i have ever finished and definetly worth the money and makes the games story feel much more complete, its just a shame that this wasnt a part of the main game from the beginning.Would easily recommend the main game and dlc if found for 30-50% off, unless you own the main game, then you should throw ur money in steam right now and buy the dlc.

												It pains me to do this, but I can’t recommend this game. It’s an example of how not to do sequels to good games. The first LoS game was a good reboot of the Castlevania setting with an ending that was baiting for a sequel, so I was anticipating this game, hoping for something better or at least more of the same. What I got was mostly the worst parts of LoS1 made even more annoying.[Spoiler alert for LoS1 and LoS2]The story and the way it is developing is boring and goes to unbelievable lengths to be stupid. The whole premise “You are Dracula” is being thrown away almost immediately and replaced with a redemption story that defies almost any reason, considering the setting and the narrative. The game starts you with a DmC tier edgy vampire lord and then repeatedly shows him as some pathetic weirdo, who was visions of his son he never actually saw in his young form. The gameplay humiliates the character of Dracula even more with annoying stealth sequences that make you hide from some demonic space marines – these sections of gameplay have zero freedom of approach and challenge – you just have to make progress the way it was intended or you will face ridiculous fail states or invisible walls.And oh boy, this desire to limit the player can be traced through the entire game when you are stuck with forced tutorials, platforming that makes little sense considering the level geometry (you can’t get to a secret you see hidden behind a 1,5m tall cinder block with wide gaps by its side, because you have to circle around it and use the Mist Form skill after a decent chunk of story progression)The level design being “open world” doesn’t help at all – it’s just badly designed locations, taped together in an attempt to create a fake metroidvania feeling. It actually brings frustration instead of interesting exploration because there are no ways of traversing the world that are fun. You would think that being Dracula could mean that you can fast travel by turning into bats or something like that, but no – you are stuck with tedious running and platforming with fake loading screens behind switches for doors and elevators.The things that made this experience actually bearable and occasionally fun were the visuals and the combat system.  The visuals and the designs of sceneries and enemies were pretty cool and the combat system had an interesting leveling gimmick that motivates you to use different moves as often as possible (if you want to level up your weapons faster).By the way, the Alucard DLC shares the same problems of the base game – it’s more of the base game if you want it.This game is not the worst game ever, but it’s a disappointment and you can almost always find a better action game to play and waste 15-20 hours on.

												This game is not worth your time. The graphics and combat system are still fine - they're directly from the first game, after all. They also added a way to mark the next spots you're supposed to grab when you're climbing, so that's an improvement over CLOS1. But the whole rest is terrible. The storytelling is artrocious right from the 10 minute opening cutscene. The modern day scenario is completely lacking in any charm whatsoever. They were definitely trying to be more like Darksiders with their ""open world"". However, the game throws you from one thing into the next way to much. The game feels disjointed. It sends you around between worlds like nobody's business and breaks up the flow of missions constantly. It's simply uninspired and disappointing. I stopped caring after 9 hours.			"

And the new weapons are interesting. Enemies are more reactive, and more interesting to battle.Bosses are good too.The level design is a great overall from the first one (less puzzly). Some stealth passages can be frustrating but not a lot.The only letdown can be the story which is not that great. Not that the first one was better, but it was more consistent.			"

												I would highly recommend that you play LoS1 before playing this - the premise of the game spoils the 'secret ending' of the first game, but the game does recap the story if you just want to jump in here.Combat is much tighter than the first game - not only do you control three distinct weapons (a long-range whip, a mid-range healing sword, and close-range guard-breaking gauntlets), but the Mastery system encourages you to play around with and get comfortable with all of the moves in your repertoire instead of just mashing the simplest combo.Visually the game is intense - this is about as good as it gets from the PS3/360 generation, and the PC version has special HD textures.As far as the story, I was personally hoping for something a little less safe considering the gut-punch ending of the first game.  I have heard that Konami changed the original ending to the one we have here, so we'll see what the DLC offers.All in all I think that I may have enjoyed the first game more than this one, but this had moments, especially in the first half of the game, where I felt as if it was exactly what I had wanted out of the sequel.  The latter half also has great segments, such as the Toy Maker, but the last quarter of the game the narrative begins to get a little loose and things just happen because end the game already.  Which is a shame, but it doesn't necessarily ruin it.			"

												Wow. What a piece of crap game that was. I thoroughly enjoyed the original Lords of Shadow. This... this was NOTHING like the first one. I think the only redeeming quality was the artwork/graphics, and some of the voicework, mainly Gabriel's. Absolutely horrible ""puzzle"" design. Traversing the world was tedious. I never felt powerful even with a fairly wide array of powers. I beat every boss the first time fighting them, including the final boss whom only had one form. I thought for sure I was fighting his first form, so I didn't use any items except one healing potion. Not gloating at all, just demonstrating how even the combat was poor in this game. Wait until the Steam Summer or Christmas sale and maybe pick up this genuinely bad game for $10, $15 tops.			"

												Been a Castlevania fan since NES and I find this storyline interesting. The battle mechanics are fun if not repetitive, the leveling up is tedious and chore like. I am good with all of this though. I am not however a fan of the stealth missions or the hide and seek mechanics that keep cropping up. If I wanted to play a stealth game I would buy Metal Gear.  I'm not sure who decided that it was a good idea, but you're wrong. The main character is Dracula.. even weakend he's supposed to eventually fight off Satan. So why do I have to tip toe around so much? I find these parts of the game frustrating, unrewarding and out of place in an otherwise fun game. I""ve changed my reccomendation to a NO. This game had potential but the steath and ""puzzles"" are just to annoying to make this worth my time anymore.			"

												Castlevania: Lords of Shadow was the first Castlevania game I played. It was an absolutely outstanding game with an amazing soundtrack, beautiful visuals and areas, detailed artwork and an over the top amazing story line.Now, I haven't played much of LoS2 yet, but it is turning out to be much more impressive. I don't want to give spoilers for those who never played the last two chapters in LoS (Which you should..), so I won't talk about the story, the only thing I will say is that it talks about the past of the Belmont Family. The visuals have been updated and they do look so much better, and that's just from two areas that I decided that. I haven't looked through the artbook yet, but I can just tell it will be amazing like before.If I had to give this a score out of 10, I would only have to say an 8.3/10 for now, as my views will change (hopefully for the better).

												Well it's a lot like God of War gameplay. The story so far is alright. You play as a weakened Dracula who has to get his powers/abilities back. The combat is strange because it's harder to fight regular mobs than it is to fight bosses. It has light puzzle solving. Parts of the game you have to sneak past guards because you're not strong enough to kill them. Which is complete bull crap because you're fighting Satan's acolytes who are super powerful demons. Basically the developers are forcing you to play a crappy game mechanic they thought was cool and justifing it by saying it's supported by the story. The more you play it the more it seems like an anime. Although the gameplay is different than Lords of Shadow you shouldn't play this one if you didn't like the story of the first.			"

												I was sceptical of the critic reviews for the final instalment in LOS, but I did not loose faith in MercurySteam and they pulled through with flying colors! Being an avid Castlevania fan since the snes days, I was more than surprised at mercurysteams reminagination of the franchize. This game is very well polished and manages to top it's predecessor in almost every way. The graphics are beutiful and almost photorealistic, the diferences in graphics between the PC and PS3 version are very noticable. The combat is more refined since the first game and makes for a very enjoyable experience every step of the way(considering it take 15-20hrs to complete) and the storyline keeps you wanting to keep playing till the very end. I have to dispell some alligations by ""reviewers"" who mentioned the story is confusing compared to the first game. The games story is linear and easy to follow so long as you've played mirror of fate (although the game does a pretty dam good job of filling you in on the details at the begining, in fact you probably don't need to play the game although I recomend it).My only complaint with the game are the stealth sections.I found them to be a nucance but in no way were they hard of frustrating, actually they were well executed and easy to acomplish. I only dislike them because they felt out of place within the games combat and fun platforming.There are barley any stealth sections in the game anyways, maby taking up less than 10% of the game so it's not an issue worth crying over. This game was a day one buy for me and I was surprised to see I did not have any software issues with the game like crashes or freezing etc ( I have bad experiences with AC4 black flag and battlefield 4). On a gtx760 and FX6300 I can run this at a full 60fps. One thing I would like to mention is how half of the critic reviews said this was a God of War knockoff. God of war did not invent the Hack-and-Slash genre and LOS2 shouldn't be classified as such. If we are going into deep water here, mineaswell call God of War a knockoff of Devil May Cry.Going back to the game though, I fondly look at this as a fun hack-and-slash game with  an amazing story! This game is a true testament at the hard work mercurysteam has put on their take of castlevania. All in all I would give the PC ver. an 8.5/10. If you were a fan of the first lords of shadow like me, this game will not dissapoint!			"

												This is a GREAT game. Very beautiful and optimized. The ambiance is great, the gameplay is good, the castle is amazing.The plot is very cool, although...(spoiler)ITS EXTREMELY DIFFERENT COMPARED TO THE ORIGINAL CASTLEVANIA FRANCHISE GAMESIF YOU ARE EXPECTING SOMETHING LIKE SOTN, GO HOME.I think this reboot is awesome, Gabriel and Alucard are a way cooler now, they now have identities and do behave like, well, the VAMPIRES they are!?The gameplay isnt very original. Its clearly GOW inspired. It has its own traits with the focus system, just like the first LoS, but greatly improved, the camera being is the greatest improvement.Hence, if you like the GOW gameplay, and the castlevania gothic style, you should have this game.

												Doresc ca in acest review sa vorbesc despre ambele parti mai exact Castlevania Lords of Shadow 1 si 2.La inceput am crezut ca am dat banii de pomana pentru un joc de consola cu camera statica care nu aducea nimic interesant (l-am cumparat la insistentele unui prieten foarte apropiat). Am inceput jocul ... si primele 6-7 ore au trecut fara sa imi dau seama, in cele din urma am terminat Castlevania Lords of Shadow 1 de mai multe ori. Acum urmeaza partea a-2-a care vine cu plusuri fantastice marca Konami, efecte wow, povestea si mai wow ca prima si multe altele. Va recomand cu sinceritate aceste jocuri si prin acest intermediul vreau sa ii multumesc si amicului meu pentru recomandare.Grafică : 8/10Multiplayer : N/ASinglePlayer : 10/10			"

												GAME REVIEW TIME:Okay, so, I'm sure you all know, or at least some of you know, how passionate I am about Darksiders 2.That game, was a brilliant masterpiece of a creation. I must'v played through it at least 5 times.Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 COMPLETELY matched up with it. I WOULD say it beat it, but I hold Darksiders 2 near and dear to my heart, I couldn't betray it like that.Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is a GREAT Action/adventure game, with tons of different enemies, with different attack patterns, it forces you to adapt to your situation really quick, and I think that's what we need more in games.I'm going to be comparing CLOS2 (castlevania: lords of shadow 2) To Darksiders 2, since it has a small bit of similarities. The problem with Darksiders 2, was that they threw the same enemy at you constantly, and it made the game a bit boring, not to mention memorizing all their attack patterns, and making the game a breeze. Not much of a challenge, in hindsight.CASTLEVANIA THREW THAT OUT THE ♥♥♥♥ING WINDOW.MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING♥♥♥♥♥♥TONS OF DIFFERENT ENEMIES LEFT AND RIGHT EVERYWHEREEverywhere you went there was a different enemy, and it really brings out that sense of impending doom thing they have going for it.Like, 'oh i'll just go over here and grab tha-wait... no... no i won't. it's scary over there'Granted, if you're skilled enough, you can defeat the enemies no problem, and grab whatever the hell you want, but that's not the point. The point I'm trying to make is, you never know what's going to be behind that corner, so it really makes you stop and think about your situation. Do I have enough health in case a huge ♥♥♥♥♥ shows up? Do I have enough healing items in case I get ♥♥♥♥ed over? THAT'S what makes the game fun, exciting, and fresh. It just throws new♥♥♥♥♥♥at you, it keeps it FRESH.And the weapons you get, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ Your main weapon is called the ""shadow whip"" and it's basically, a whip that Dracula (main character) can summon whenever he wants, as it's made out of his own blood. The lore about the weapon says that people who get hit by it says it feels like ""A thousand fangs piercing every inch of your body."" Also, it hardens on impact... That's why it's able to hit people, and not just splooge all over the place.Your secondary, or heavy weapon, is called the ""chaos claws"" These deal... MASSIVE amounts of damage, but they can't be used for long, as they require a chaos charge. you get a Chaos charge by absorbing blood orbs from enemies.Your third weapon is called the ""Void Sword"" This is the same as the Chaos claws, except it doesn't hit as hard, AND with every blow you land, you get health back. So, basically, if you've played Darksiders 2, it's basically health steal.And the Graphics... The Graphics, and the lighting technique are AMAZING. Everywhere you go is beautiful scenery, be it the modern city or Dracula's castle. The Characters models are amazing, as well. The art they chose for Dracula, and alucard, and all the other people you come in contact with is BRILLIANT.And the best god damn part of this whole game? YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO KNOW THE STORY! CLOS2 is technically part of the story that Castlevania was portraying in their earlier days of 2d sidescroller, but it doesn't match up with it. It's almost a different timeline.You know what? ♥♥♥♥ it. Castlevania beat Darksiders 2 in my list of all time favourites.You had a good run Darksiders 2...Seriously though, go buy this game. It's ♥♥♥♥ing great.			"

												I loved the prequel to this game so much, I had the best time on that game, it was beautiful, I felt strong and I had motivation to keep on truckin'. I was so hyped for Lords of Shadow 2.The game began, the tutorial scene was spectacular. I felt like I was unstoppable as I tore through armies of men with great ease.Suddenly I was in the future and I had no powers at all. I thought to myself ""I'm ok with this, it's just an intro scene to tell me the story"" and I was right, I gained some of my powers back and I was placed into the world, the world which was simply a modern day looking city... that ruined some of the Lords of Shadow feels, I was used to beautiful natural landscapes with ancient ruins dotted around, the modern world is not something I want to see in a fantasy series, it's boring because I see it every day.I decided to push on and I came up to the first ""enemy"". The first enemy of the game you cannot kill, you have to hide from it. I am Dracula, the Prince of Darkness... and this GRUNT enemy is undefeatable by me, yeah that doesnt make me feel cool. You have to use stealth which is just turning into a rat and running past him, THIS IS A CASTLEVANIA GAME. I proceeded and there were two more of these undefeatable enemies, it took what felt like forever to get into real combat and ... it was Ok.The combat feels smoother that the last game but for some reason I ended up getting hit a lot more, I dont know if this was my fault or a lack of enemies telegraphing attacks, I really dont know. The first boss was cool to begin with but it was quite repetitive and way too simple, way more simple than the tutorial boss which actually hit me quite a few times.I continued through the game a bit longer, but after an hour or so after fighting mutants and military mech suit things, I gave up. My character had no motivation so I had no motivation, there were too many gaps between combat where i just had to♥♥♥♥♥♥around for a good while to make my way through an area. The scenery of the game was unattractive in my opinion with everything being either black, white or grey and all of the feelings of the original Lords of Shadow were gone. I was truly truly disappointed when I played this game and I wish that it didn't exist.tl;dr THIS GAME IS CRAP3/10 "

												MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS:To be honest, I really enjoyed this game during.  I think the combat was well put together.  The story we really well done, IMO.  This is a tricky review though.  As I said, during the game it was fun.  On beating the game though, I did feel disappointed.  But let me break down some of the elements.Stealth:  I feel the hate for these sections is misplaced.  The fact is, they are such a tiny part of the game, they might as well not even be there.  They can all be completed in no more than 10 minutes.  I also feel the whole transforming into the rat swarm was not neccesary at all.  Enemies:  Most enemies are very good.  They vary up their attacks, they dodge your attacks, and large groups of them can prove problematic.  Out of all the times I died, it was mostly to these situation.  At points you are under seige from large groups of small enemies, and then sometimes you are facing two or three very large hard to kill enemies.As it should follow - Combat:  The combat I feel was excellent in this game.  It was as good as the combat in the first game, hands down.  They added this power up element which basically incentivizes changing attacks and weapons.  The dodge was much more responsive feeling in this game than the last game.  Accordingly, the timing for the charge moves of enemies is very much varied.  So there is no absolute time to block.  They also made it harder to syncronize block in this game.  It felt like you have less frames to hit the button in.  I noticed that some enemies hardly ever normal attack and almost always charge.  Those enemies ended up being the easiest though as their attacks tended to not be varied.  The World:  This is where the game has some failings.  It placed you in many small corridors and very few vistas.  In the first game you had lots of open and interesting areas to fight and puzzle your way through.  In this one lots of times it felt lackluster because of this failing.  The castle, as other reviews have stated, is awesome.  But it just feels like the castle is mostly optional.  You find Wolf portals between the worlds, but I found little reason to back to the castle and explore.Environmental puzzles:  Almost non-existent.  It's a shame, iit was fun to try and get past timing puzzles and spike traps in the first game.  This game had none of that.  No timing puzzles, no spike traps, it just felt like you were walking forward a lot in this game with little to hinder your way... well little except finding a switch which was usually located in the same room.  I just didn't see the point of pulling a lever to open a door that was five feet away.Extracurriculars: There was plenty of things in this game to collect.  But the back tracking isn't fun to me.  In the first game, the stage based design was awesome for this.  Go back, find the scrolls, collect the gem or the weapon upgrade, maybe do a the stage challenge while you are at it.  I loved the challenges in the first game, they were fun to try and complete.  This game didn't really have that.  They had some sort of challenges that I unlocked throughout the game, and the game managed to tell me about them about 700 times throughout the course of the game.  The funny part was, going through the pages of the Journal and menus... where the hell are they located?  I never figured it out, but I wan't inclined to backtrack and figure it out. Pros that don't need explanation:Music was awesomeVoice acting was awesomeStory was, for the most part, very goodCons (many of these are personal cons and as such I know aren't objective or shared by many people):Free Camera - I loved how the first one was with the locked camera.  The devs always put it in a good spot to show off the awesome world.  I feel that stepping away from that was a mistake.  The camera was downright annoying in some battles, and in other battles it didn't do a good job.  Open World:  As explained, I didn't enjoy this aspect.  I am a firm believer that not every game is automatically made better by an open world.  This one was definitely not.  Believe it or not, the world actually felt much smaller than the stage based world from the first game.  I think a good open world is truly awesome, but this unfortunately was not.  Also, in making it an open world that helped to deny my want to go back and find collectibles.Overall Opinion:  I think this is a worthy game on a sale.  If you played and liked the combat from the first game, you are probably gonna love the combat in this one.  I also felt that the dev failed to deliver on a conclusion to the trilogy.  The ending was not a conclusion, but an outright attempt to further the series into yet another game, which disappoints me.  I am anxious to see what they do with DLC however.  There are rumors of an Alucard DLC, which I would be interested in playing.   If they did some sort of DLC that let you play as the other Belmont you meet in the game, that would also be fun.  If I had to give it a score, I would probably give it a 6/10.  This is not an objective review, I have explained what I personally did not like about it.Edit:  At the time of writing my Steam timer shows 25 hours in game.. but I alt/tabbed out of the game to do something, realized I had to leave for work, and then left it on while I was at work by accident.  I really only put 15 hours or so into the game, so that was a disppointment.  The first one I put 29 actual hours into.Edit2:  I did a ""No"" recommend.  But if you get it on sale and want to see how the story plays out, it's  a yes.			"

												One of my favorite action-adventure games; but be careful, this game has a different tone than the first Lords of Shadow and also, it has big plot holes and some gameplay flaws.The combat is very similar to the first Lords of Shadow, but improved.The puzzles are easier but most of them are more related to the game than the puzzles of the first Lords of Shadow ( now many puzzles involves using the abilities of Dracula instead of moving pieces in a board).This game also have camera control with the right stick instead of the predefined camera of the first game.Another noticeable change is that now there are exploration in the game, it's really a 3D Metroidvania game, where you unlock new areas while getting new powers.About the tone, LoS 2 has an atmosphere much darker than the first one, basically you explore two worlds:  one is very similar to the first game(but darker), and the other one at the beginning may look like an arkham city less appealing, but most of the game it's more like the first Darksiders atmosphere.The story also remind me Darksiders and a little bit of Hellboy.The bad parts: there are some stealth sections that feels out of place and there are not very fun, the first hour of two of the game(after the prolog) are not very good, Dracula doesn't look like a vampire(but you can buy a skin :) ), and the game has some annoying on-screen suggestions (fortunately, they can be deactivated in the menu).Even when these shortcomings most of the game is great.

Posted: March 9, 2015
												A few notes about this review: I'm yet to play the prequel to this game as of the time this review was written, and as such, will not be comparing this title to Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 1.Gameplay:The game is very reminiscent of open-world  hack and slash classics such as Devil May Cry and Bayonetta. The mechanics are well varied and properly executed, and at its' very beginning, launches the player into action. The boss fights are bloody, epic, and memorable. Little was spared in terms of length and difficulty when encountering various bosses, who are well varied and endowed. Prepare to die a few times in your quest to make progress.Note that duie to the nature of the story (see section below) , repetitive gameplay is necessitated for one to unlock Dracula's potential abilities as the story progresses. This is executed in a repetitive manner, and as such, incurs a considerable challenge at the early stages of the game. However, as an indirect consequence, later sections are very rewarding as your new abilities are fully utilized in making progress. Prepare for a challenge. The stealth system and mechanics used are not ideal and are out of balance. A being such as dracula shouldn't be reduced to a powerless imp in the stealth sections, which can be confusing and often convoluted. Graphics:Excellent, judging bu its' requirements and visuals. They are well balanced and properly executed. Details are clear and vivid, and so are the vast, open world environments. Character forms are well refined and so are their spectral abilities. Story line: All in all, dependin gon your background, its' taste may differ to you. I've read previous reviews from people who played the games' prequel and most were not pleased.in my opinion, I found the fusion of both the present and the past (through the use of the Wolf Medallion) a bit unique in that you can switch to either timeline and progress at your own rate. In a manner, this further enhances the open world experience. As a drawback, this can make the game very repetitive since the environments are consrained to one transitional area, a chemical company. This also incurs a drawback to the overall quality of Dracula's retelling as a legendary vampire who must be trapped to a moden themed factory for extended periods of gameplay time as a requirement to progressing in the game. This repetitive nature may not bode well for all players. Overall rating:The production quality is superb, and so is the gameplay. Comes highly recommended.My personal rating is 7.5/10.			"

												Solid, smooth fighting mechanic is not sufficient in my opinion to carry the whole wieght of this game. I'll start with the good elements of the game, then follow up with what went wrong with it:Pros:-Smooth fighting style and movement-All three weapons are unique and special in thier own way with robust upgrading tree for each.-Atmospheric scenes and amazing Castle design are enough to leave you at awe at some moments.-Some great and well designed boss fights scattered throughout the game.-Collectables scattered throughout the game encourage you to explore many areas and backtrack.Cons:-Absolutly shallow and unnecessary ""stealth"" mechanic slapped on multiple parts of the game.-The city doesn't leave a memorable moment. Its colorless and many times make you feel like you want to run through it as quick as possible.-Particle effects of attacking/blocking leave you blind to where the enemies hits will come from midcombat.-Blocking is ineffective when you are swarmed my multiple enemies. leaving you vulnerable to consecutive hits after your first block.-Many boss fights feel scripted, with no way for you to beat bosses unless you do it the way the game wants you to.-The story is such a drag, with characters coming and going with no backstories to them.

												A massive overhaul of the combat system without forgetting tricks learned, optional quicktime system, across the board admission that they made mistakes with the first game, and a demonstration that they can learn from them. The only problem this game has is the menu interface, which doesn't allow multiple saves or easy access to an actual title menu. But it doesn't hurt the actual content of the game.Graphics: 9/10. Only deducted points is for some weird-looking hair and particle animation touching on the uncanny valley, but it's otherwise a gorgeous, nigh perfectly beautiful game.Sound: 10/10. The score is wonderfully emotional and puts you in the middle of each moment. You'll find yourself humming along with the rat theme, and gratified during the main theme's return in key moments.Gameplay: 9/10. It's not castlevania anymore, but I'm not complaining. The tricks they picked up from Devil May Cry combine well with other improvements, and mesh in the Symphony-esque metroidvania world. No more is the whip the only useful weapon, no more is spamming R1 the easiest way to end fights. No more are quicktime events required, but neither are they abandoned, for those who enjoy them. And they skip function works beautifully, at no point during even cutscenes do they feel forced, nor does the lack of them feel depriving. A good status quo. But it looses a point for not having a heart system, or a means to deal with stealth sections as a combat option. Sorry, series fidelity is one thing I'm big on, and Castlevania isn't a stealth game, neither is it Devil May Cry. That said, the stealth segments are still very well designed, just a littlle immersion breaking when you're playing as the Prince of Darkness, whom the devil and death both fear.Replay: 9/10: Postgame, Newgame+, and some really enjoyable once-through sequences, with a train sequence early on being a standout, and a few of the boss build-ups having that effect as well, make for a game that you won't feel a need to give up for awhile, and will always be willling to dig out in a year for another run. No complaints, only point deducted is thanks to Dark Souls moving the goalposts (and Dark Souls II doing it again,) for replay value in recent years by evolving the new game+ formula, and there should have been an attempt to learn from their methods. Great games learn from each other. This applies to all games developed after a previous game. You don't need to change your self-entity, but cool tricks should not be ignored.Story: 10/10 Yes. On par with the first, with a slightly more Castlevania-y feel, despite your role as the series villian. No more pacing problems. Just awesome. There is emotion, forshadowing, character depth all done wonderfully. If I can make a complaint, it is only that some character arcs require a knowledge of the much-less-enjoyable first game to fully appreciate, but watching a youtube cutscene compilation will fulfil your need.Overall: 94/100. If you're into the genre, if you're into the series, heck, if you're into just good storytelling in general, give this game a shot. If you're scared, wait for a steam sale. It's optimized wonderfully, so hardware shouldn't be a big problem.			"

												Great game, just wish the story was more cohesive and not just drops you into random settings at abrupt times and had a higher difficulty. Plowed through the story without any trouble at all in the second most difficult setting on my first try. Besides that, great visuals and a soothing combat			"

												This game is really good. If you liked the first one, like I did, I highly recommend it. The combat depth from the first is still there, and no amount of button mashing will save your life. And the combat is quite chalenging. The map exploration is a Metroid-Vania, but in a 3D enviroment, look like Darksiders. The game rewards exploration, since there are a lot of collectibles and upgrades, and you can easily miss then if you don't explore, and a quick travel trough castle map rooms are a enourmous help, altough the quick travel system could be better. Story is awesome, what could you ask? It is Dracula, The prince of Darkness kicking Satan in the nuts - that's a good one on my book. The presentation is spot on, you totaly look like a badass vampire and fight like one, and both city and castle parts are impressive. The developers reproduce the horror ambience from other Castlevania games perfectly, and even when you are in modern times, it really looks like a Castlevania. The only complaint I have is that they could use more of the open air parts of the modern day city, since it looks so awesome, but you'll be on the inside of buildings most of the time. I'm a big fan of the series, and this is a worthy sequence of a great game. I'm still working on beating it, and the boss fights are really good.			"

												Way more badass than the first, but not all a good thing. The story I thought was sacrificed in this game, it was meh (7/10).The combat... I loved it. made me want to max out everything. (9/10).But this overall forbidden fruit was sweet and sour and in my book its at least a ""wait for a sale"".P.S.

												An okay game (los1 was epic) plagued by a poor director. While looking into the source code people have already found mentions of dlc with alucards side of thing; which was obviously cut out of the game. The ending was also very open and lacked the resolution that ""the epic conclusion of the franchise"" deserved. I still enjoyed the game but it could have something far greater.			"

												What can I say other than I will not be recommending this to my friends...Pros:It looks nice (very few graphical glitches only seems to happen on higher settings)The story can grip you sometimes with a 'what next!' moment. (very rare)Get to see my man alucard thats always a plus. (wish he had more face time)It was cheap when I got it that was the plus if you can not get it on sale dont bother.I felt compeled to finish it I suppose I will count this as a positive but would be hard for non Castlevania fans to have that drive imo...Cons:Horrid voice actors (seen more life in a mortuary could have been chanting 'I LIKE APPLE PIE' would have made more sense than what they said 65% of the time and would fit with the facial expressions 85% more)Overly drawn out tutorial (does it really take like 5 minutes of pounding heads to say oh beat them down then eat them alive)Crazy player hitbox size compared to enemies. (A ground based attack hitting you in a double jump)Really stiff platforming that feels like it belongs in a slycooper game. (felt like tomb raider on the ps1 well... better animations)Constant screen flashing and out of no where flashbacks that confuses the player (Never knew where I would pop up).Foot holds I have a fear of rock climbing now due to the gross overuse of climbing sections.Other:Nudity and strange ugly creatures (if you like dead body boobs this might be for you otherwise #NoPe)Would be nice if it had only one or two quarks I did not like but it has 6 game breaking flaws!That is just off the top of my head not counting those annoying reaper things that if they are not airborn will own you trying this on a moving terrain with a fixed camera beyond annoying.In closing I feel this is a game with a huge identity crisis it has a hard time deciding what it wants to be does it want to be a stealth action game, a brawling beatem up, a god of war clone, or even a platformer. Also Wtf Man! Drac spent so much time as a rat was beginning to think even he has an identiy crisis. (I get the plot memory loss thing but the second he knew he was the prince of darkness he should have had a little dignity)			"

												Great game with all sorts of improvements over the first one. Better combat system and skill usage. Story is pretty decent so far, nothing spectacular but at the same time still interesting. The stealth moments of the game sometimes make no sense but are not in any way game-breaking and can be done rather quickly. Boss battles are as expected and similar to the ones in the first game. All in all an enjoyable experience.			"

The environments, monsters, look & feel are all superb.  Fantastic lighting, graphics, mechanics - the game feels good to play.  Some pacing issues and 'duh, i know that' moments.

												While it's not perfect, Lords of Shadow 2 is still an extremely fun game.If you liked the classic Simon's Quest back in it's age, you'll probably enjoy this as well. You can't just go in blind for the story, but if you've followed the other LoS games, it makes sense. Gameplay got an overall improvement from LoS 1, and the hub-structure feels great.Some of the stealth sections can feel a little heavy handed, but they're over fast enough with just basic levels of situational awareness. Also, some of the monster packs can feel awkward at times due to running out of weapon-magic at bad times.Overall, it's still a solid game. It feels like a Castlevania, it plays like a Castlevania, and it's plotted like a Castlevania. Not sure what all the over-negative games-media reviews were hating on, part of me thinks they didn't ""get"" Simon's Quest when it was out on the NES originally, and have held a petty grudge since. It's not a 10, but it's not a 5 by any stretch of the imagination. IMO, 7.8/10, solid combat systems, a healthy-sized world with plenty to explore/find/collect, but with some rough stealth sections, and one character feeling fairly wasted in their introduction/departure.

												Addictive!If you liked the first game, expect improved mechanics and a better developed battle system which encourages you to learn your combos instead of constantly using the same button. Leveling your weapons up is a much better experience now and you will actually feel the difference as Dracula's power returns.As for graphics, the game is beautiful - though not as inspired as the first episode. Light is improved, textures are improved, creativity not so much. Bear with the game for the first 2 hours and it won't let you down. Playing through modern cities with the almighty vampire might sound like a nice idea but the lack of better designs and the feeling of repetition as the scenery looks the same for a while will make you ask why the developers chose this path instead of focusing on the much nicer gothic    landscapes Castlevania really shines on.Storywise, even though the actors are awesome and doing their best, they haven't got much to work with. Still, this is only true if you compare it with the first LoS. Yes, there's a story, yes, it's kind of mediocre... Well, the majority of games I've been playing haven't been above mediocre so I guess it's fine.Other than that, lots of places to explore and collectibles all over the place will give you replayability over the already lenghty main course. So, yeah. Good. Really good and recommended at full price. 7/10			"

The stealth sections were a challenge.

												Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is an entertaining, 12+ hour long action game with a few issues holding it back from greatness. It's a shlocky, hamfisted and (in my mind) enjoyable story focused on Dracula and his bloody escapades around his palace in two different timelines. While not wholly divergent enough from the play-book of the first Lords of Shadow to call it a Metroidvania, Lords of Shadow 2 (LoS2) makes an admirable attempt at creating a fully explorable world which requires backtracking to old nooks with new moves in your arsenal to claim some doodad for your growing inventory of glowing crystal assistance-thingies. It's all very obvious and not particularly exciting, but it does reward you for your time and attentiveness. You won't really need those 'hidden' rewards unless you're playing on the upper difficulty echelons. The combat is instantly recognizeable if you've played the first game. This year's model does come with improvements, weapon switching on the fly similar to DmC: Devil May Cry replaces the blue glow/red glow for essentially the same status effect, but with new combos to learn. There's also a fully adjustable camera, which is a pleasant new necessity (given the level design). Like the first Lords of Shadow, LoS2 has a deeper combat system than you might give it credit for at first appearance, it'll grow on you, but it doesn't go as far as some contemporaries and on all but the highest difficulties you won't struggle in battle.LoS2 has a few obvious issues. While there's some goofy and entertaining narrative chunks to push you forward early on, there's also some sluggish tutorialization. The two timelines are enjoyable, but the past clearly has the art design edge- with the present not really distinguishing itself nearly as much. You'll probably greet flashlights with a weary sigh as the signal in another easy, brainless stealth section that, conceptually, is used to break up the monotany of entertaining flashy combat and brisk level design. Yeah, great idea.At the end of the day, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is a likeable sequel. It's self-aware, in many aspects, with fantastic options like 'Turn off QTEs' which I highly recommend, as well as boasting satisfying boss encounters. It unfortunately struggles with branching out and exploring new gameplay elements. The pacing could be tighter... But, that said, I had a lot of fun with it. There are some great sequences, great moments that play off of the crazy Castlevania Dracula power trip which make it easy to recommend to fans of the first game. When it's firing on all cylinders, it captures the essence of what so many people liked about the first. It hits a lot more than it misses and is worth your time and money if you happened to enjoy the first. It runs great, looks great and is fun to play. While it didn't surpass my expectations, it met them.			"

I wanted to thank Konami and Mercury Steam For this amazing game! i was watching the countdown on the store page for days and i kept playing the demo over and over. I like the idea of playing as a dark character and the gothic architecture is spectacular. I give this game a 96 out of 100. It very challenging dont expect to blaze through this one even on the easiest difficulty. Top notch well worth the money!!!:) This Game is a Million times better then anything Orgin or Dice could Offer me! In my opinion Battle Field 4 is way too much of the SAME OLD SAME OLD.  Konami ALL the Way Worth every single Penny i spent!!! If i was on a island and could only pick one game to play for the rest of eternity it would be CastleVania Lord of Shadows 2!			"

												Forget the general critics from ""God of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; and ""Symphony of the Night"" fans (the majority of them just played SOTN and dont really knows about Castlevania games at all) this is a deep very well made fan service.Rule of the tumb: if you liked the 1st Castlevania: Lords of Shadow this game is a ""Instabuy""***Edited at 09/13/14 to review the DLC Revelations.***PROS:- Improved combat and movement mechanics making this even more solid;- Awesome graphics and immersive scenarios (combine several aspects of Vampire lore with Castlevania's elements);- Free movement camera;- Lots of extra content including: 400 pages of design artwork (seems much but it is easy to have those collected during the game - I've completed mine in the 1st run), Challenges and Lore- Fantastic follow up history;- About 14~17 hours long (if you're a completionist and like achievements you would mostly at least double that time);- On LOS1 the platforming wasn't really great and you finished get killed by bad jumping several times. That was corrected!CONS:- Although stealth isn't that bad as people say (in reality just a puzzle) it is so easy that doesn't adds any value to the gameplay at all;- In 17 hours -my 1st run- I didnt spend no more than 30 minutes with ALL puzzles (including stealth) which means that the puzzles are super easy. The LOS1 puzzles were waaaaay more fun;- Voice acting, for Gabriel Belmont, should be better. During LOS1 it was ""Fair"" for a Brotherhood templar but it is not enough for Dracula;DLC Revelations:The level of disappointment provided by this one is only compared to Oblivion Horse Armor.Add 2 hours of gamplay with an incredible weak plot.Do a favor to yourself and skip this one.

												Absolutely loved this game. Now, most people will say the story sucked...and they're right. The story wasn't all it was supposed to be. Very shoddy work on the story, I won't lie. But you know as well as I do they aren't done with it. There will be more story released just like there was with the first one. Which, i'm ok with. With all the backtracking and whatnot I did it took me 23 hours to complete. That's a good length in my book with what story they went with. I mean, who wanted more of what they were doing? And the graphics are truely amazing. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. The screenshots alone prove this game is pretty as hell. (heh) And a lot of people are complaining that the scenery is bland and boring. It's modern age style london. It's not that exciting. What did you expect from modern times? I mean, come on now. The segments in the castle are amazing and remind me of the backdrops of the first one, though not quite as epic looking.All in all it's an improvment on the first. The camera problems are gone, the combat has been tweeked, and you get to play as Dracula. That in and of itself is way too awesome. WAY TOO AWESOME! It was a great game that I reccomend for fans. People joining in on the series now may find it difficult at times to maintain interest in the story. But the gameplay will probably keep you around. I give this game an easy 9/10. Only losing a point because of the story. I had high expectations and they were met. ^_^			"

												Highly recommend this game, if you loved the first Castlevanie Lord Of Shadows, this epic and spralling conclusion to the series is awe inspiring with its art and soundtrack and localtions, along with its gripping story and the combat and weapons are supberb, responsive, easy to learn, diffcult to master and rewards experminting with the combos. 8 out 10 for me.

												    Today its 26/02 and i played almost of 50% of history in game. I recomend this game, its have great changes, like the way player can use the camera, the scenes during gameplay its gorgeous! And now ill compare this game with the castlevania frangise itself:     The game its just like other games of castlevania that we played before, but with more realistic graphics. You need colect all the power you vampire can use before face new bosses and other chalenges.     You can go back to other areas that you previous visited and use the new powers to get hiden improvements for your charecter, discover new areas and sutch. Castlevania sinphony of the night also have this kind of ""option"". You have the npc stores to buy new items just like others castlevania games. You can solve puzzles like other castlevania games, but this time it feels  yeasier and ""fluid"" in the pace of game.      I understand that some players complain about the fact that this game its not 2D, and the 2D games of franchise, since its not so realistic opens the imaginagion of players and the way they experience the game. But this game have all the best features that other games has ofered in the past.     Castlevania never was a beat-em-up game, you aways will find the monters in specific location, lust like other games of frachise. You can go back and phorth to use you powers and have a lot to explore!      I totaly recomend this game!!  "

												Unlike its predecessors, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 in overall did not move me as much I was expecting it. Gameplay wise, it's gone back to the dungeon crawling genre which could be great for some of the gamers out there. The abilities are quite similar to what we experienced in Castlevania: Lords of Shadow however with different type of weapons and upgrades. There is a larger selection of secondary items that can help, but in my personal experience, they were rarely used. Some events were quite interesting but I must agree with most people that the stealth feature should have been scrapped and put focus on the platforming and puzzles.As you might have guessed, the storyline begins with Dracula or formerly Gabriel Belmont fight the Brotherhood of Light then ends with Alucard appearing. You then jump through time into a modern technological world, and start with the ridiculous stealth feature à la Metal Gear Solid. So, your objectives are basically to fight various bosses and repossess old powers which Dracula has lost through time. Pretty much like any dungeon crawling game. Unfortunately, there is little content about the storyline which was pretty disappointing. Characters, including Dracula and Alucard were uninteresting, emotionless. The exception is when Dracula returns to his castle throughout the playthrough. I finished this game without any emotion and with lots of questionning. Do I recommend this game? I will for the people who like Castlevania, the old dungeon crawling genre. But, you must expect some disappointment if you want to know the rest of the story. Cheers.			"

												Even with it's flaws, Lords of Shadows 2 stands tall on its own. Especially if you're a fan of the series.Been playing castlevania since Symphony of the Night, and this game feels like hitting the right chords. I'll say it, this game has some flaws, for starters the stealth segments doesn't always make sense. It kind of depends in the way you see it. In Dracula's standpoint, and with a little abstraction on the player's part it is okay. You see, the stealth per se is not bad, it's place in the game ins't always right tough.Battle is absolutely great, history works and has some nice subtleties with high points. Story telling fits in place and the graphics are quite beautiful, art direction is top notch. This game has flow!My score: [Graphics: 8; Music: 9; Story: 8; Controls: 9]                 Overall: 8.5			"

												I have to admit I was a little late to the game when it came to the first game. For those that don't know, the first Lords of Shadow - and by extension this game as well - is a reboot of the franchise as opposed to a continuation of the original canon.That being said, I have been greatly anticipating this sequel since finally playing and beating LoS and man was it ever worth all that waiting and anticipation! LoS 2 has you playing as the Prince of Darkness, Dracula (Gabriel Belmont in this universe) himself which really needs no explanation in regards to it's freaking cool factor.Patrick Stuart reprises his role as Zobek (aka Death) and Robert Carlyle is back (and better than ever!) as Gabriel/Dracula, which alone are two good reasons why this game rocks! Also, Richard Madden as Alucard was a pretty splendid choice in my opinion. The sound and music - and the other voice work too - is all quite excellent as well.I have been absolutely loving the gameplay so far, especially the combat which I feel has recieved a nice overhaul. There is still enough of the old system there that it should feel familiar and comfortable, but they also improved nicely upon some of the smaller snags I felt the first game suffered from. AI is a bit more agressive and (only slightly) less predictable this time, which is a bit refreshing. Also, for all intents and purposes - at least as far as gameplay is concerned - Gabriel and Dracula are two entirely different characters, despite actually being the same person.Gone is the Combat Cross, Gabriel's signature weapon from LoS; instead Dracula most commonly wields the Shadow Whip which is a manifestation of his own blood that he can summon and control. Instead of Gabriel's Light and Shadow Magic, you now have the life-leeching Void Sword and the armor-piercing Chaos Claws which each offer their own form and style in combat. You can also feed on stunned opponents to recover your health in a pinch. Oh and instead of the consumables Gabriel used to carry around, Dracula wields powerful vampire abilities and other dark magics - Shadow Daggers, Void Projections, Bat Swarms and more; instead of being consumable they all have their own cool-down timers and thus behave more like spells would.The game is much bigger and better all around for the most part, though there a few minor things that I personally find annoying. For instance exploration is way more 'hand holdy' than it was in LoS... to the point that ledges you can grapple and climb now glow faintly and are surrounded by a small swarm of bats, objects you can bash with your throwing daggers are outlined by a glowing red ring of what appears to be blood, and the addition of an actual function (hold LT) while platforming that outlines possible moves 2-3 steps ahead of where you're currently climbing/hanging. Not really a deal breaker, per say, but definitely takes a lot of the fun out of it. In LoS I actually missed quite a few collectibles due to not being able to find them or simply not being able to reach them once I did locate them - this in turn drove me to explore further and look all the harder for what I may have missed; the possibility for this level of challenge is all but impossible in LoS 2 it would seem.I won't give away too much of the plot, for two reasons: one I have yet to beat the game and two it would just be a damn shame to spoil something so good. That being said the basic premise is this: a thousand years (and a 3DS game) have passed since the events of LoS, Dracula has been defeated and weakened - by his own blood no less - and thus left vulnerable to an attack from Satan, whom Gabriels seriously♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off the last time they met. Zobek makes a timely arrival to warn his 'old friend' of course and offers him both a way to regain his powers - to defeat Satan - and a way to free him from his curse - death at the hands of Zobek, who has supposedly located the Combat Cross. Thus the battle begins between the Prince of Darkness and the agents of Satan.			"

												What can I say other than I will not be recommending this to my friends...Pros:It looks nice (very few graphical glitches only seems to happen on higher settings)The story can grip you sometimes with a 'what next!' moment. (very rare)Get to see my man alucard thats always a plus. (wish he had more face time)It was cheap when I got it that was the plus if you can not get it on sale dont bother.I felt compeled to finish it I suppose I will count this as a positive but would be hard for non Castlevania fans to have that drive imo...Cons:Horrid voice actors (seen more life in a mortuary could have been chanting 'I LIKE APPLE PIE' would have made more sense than what they said 65% of the time and would fit with the facial expressions 85% more)Overly drawn out tutorial (does it really take like 5 minutes of pounding heads to say oh beat them down then eat them alive)Crazy player hitbox size compared to enemies. (A ground based attack hitting you in a double jump)Really stiff platforming that feels like it belongs in a slycooper game. (felt like tomb raider on the ps1 well... better animations)Constant screen flashing and out of no where flashbacks that confuses the player (Never knew where I would pop up).Foot holds I have a fear of rock climbing now due to the gross overuse of climbing sections.Other:Nudity and strange ugly creatures (if you like dead body boobs this might be for you otherwise #NoPe)Would be nice if it had only one or two quarks I did not like but it has 6 game breaking flaws!That is just off the top of my head not counting those annoying reaper things that if they are not airborn will own you trying this on a moving terrain with a fixed camera beyond annoying.In closing I feel this is a game with a huge identity crisis it has a hard time deciding what it wants to be does it want to be a stealth action game, a brawling beatem up, a god of war clone, or even a platformer. Also Wtf Man! Drac spent so much time as a rat was beginning to think even he has an identiy crisis. (I get the plot memory loss thing but the second he knew he was the prince of darkness he should have had a little dignity)			"

If you enjoyed the first LOS you will definitely love this chapter. The HD texture pack is a sight to behold. Audio, especially throught headphones or a decent sound system, is rich and deep.

												It's like two different people worked on this game. Some Konami Exec wanted to ""be hip and keep with the times"", while someone else wanted to make an actual Castlevania game, and because of that, the game ends up having two completely different tones, a modern day boring hack and slash that plays into every troope of any recent triple a game, and a castlely place in the past(?) that actually has some great level design, some pretty spooky atmosphere, and overall feels like what a modern Castlevania game SHOULD be.

												A great conclusion of the Castlevania saga on PC, 8/10! It is much more open world than the 1st part, you basically explore 2 big realms you can switch between, instead of small secluded missions like in part1. Although many skills are the same as before, it plays quite differently because of that, and also seems to be a bit easier. In the end, the boss fight were not as impressive as in game 1, so I like both games equally. Nice number of achievements to unlock, good graphics and some bad♥♥♥♥♥skills make this game highly recommended for action fans. Some of the new stealth parts can be a bit frustrating, but it is again fun to explore and hunt down all live, void and chaos extras to become super powerful! The DLC actually has some clever new skills for the new protagonist, and they are used for some much more difficult timed puzzles, so the really add to the gameplay.			"

												A great game with excellent boss fights which was ruined by an endless amount of cutscenes, a fairly non-sensical story and completely unnecessary stealth sequences which ruin the game. The presentation is spectacular and the controls are responsive, but the game asks you to backtrack repeatedly to get the collectables you missed along the way which wouldn't be so bad if the level themselves weren't so annoying. Some people might not mind backtracking to an area which requires a ton of platform jumping and climbing, but I find it fairly frustrating myself and it takes a lot away from the game.			"

Plays boring.First LoS was a really boring game, but at least the story was coherit, the art style was beautiful and it, while borrowed, truly *tried*. It felt like it was trying to be a good an exciting game. Usually it wasn't. But it's the thought that counts.Mirror of Fate was surprisingly fantastic, falling slightly flat from what people expect from the 2D Castlevania, but a fun mix of classic games in the series with gameplay elements of LoS.LoS 2 tries to improve. It looks better technologically, tries to rebalance some things in a good way, makes camera mostly good, removes the linear level progress in favor of the open world and makes soundtrack especially nice. And then adds forced stealth sections. And boring bland looking levels. And ""secrets"" which usually feel like pointless stuff. And incoherit storytelling without any conflict you can feel (but it's there, honest!).This feels like Blood Omen 2 recreated in LoS universe. Except Blood Omen 2 was still a pretty okay game with some excitement and Kain, while this game just... is. LoS 1 was boring, this game just exists. It's just there. And you can play it. But you really shouldn't.P.S. Playing as Alucard in the DLC is fun, but that's about all there is to the DLC. It tells nothing new at all, despite the title.			"

												Lords of Shadow 2 abandons everything that made the original game great. You'll only enjoy the last quarter of the game, but are you willing to put up with a painfully boring and frustrating experience to get there?			"

												-Pros -Graphics look amazing         -Combat is fantastic         -Amazing story-Cons  -few annoying stealth parts           -trouble changing config in game, had to edit text file manually (no other problems after that though)I highly recommend this game although the few cons. I really enjoyed my time with the game and I am almost at the very end. I think a  chunk of (professional reviewers) are being overly critical about things and bashing the game a little too hard for parts of the game that are so small in comparison to the rest of the game.The combat is amazing, its fun to play, the cutscenes are fun to watch and you are going to want to know how it all ends. Its a game worth playing! Give it a try!  If you played the demo and like the game, its a must get as the game is much better than the demo they showed you. :)			"

												A great conclusion of the Castlevania saga on PC, 8/10! It is much more open world than the 1st part, you basically explore 2 big realms you can switch between, instead of small secluded missions like in part1. Although many skills are the same as before, it plays quite differently because of that, and also seems to be a bit easier. In the end, the boss fight were not as impressive as in game 1, so I like both games equally. Nice number of achievements to unlock, good graphics and some bad♥♥♥♥♥skills make this game highly recommended for action fans. Some of the new stealth parts can be a bit frustrating, but it is again fun to explore and hunt down all live, void and chaos extras to become super powerful! The DLC actually has some clever new skills for the new protagonist, and they are used for some much more difficult timed puzzles, so the really add to the gameplay.			"

												Sequel to the first Lords of Shadow game, this second installment is very good. It has amazing graphics and soundtrack as the first one. The gameplay is very good too, with some differences with the first game.You play once again as Gabriel Belmont, but this time you're known as Dracula.The story is good, it keeps you hooked to see what's next. However the ending of the game pales in comparison to the ending of the first Lords of Shadow. I was expecting a closed, more epic ending for Gabriel Belmont.This game has had a lot of criticism because of it's stealth sections. I think they're not bad once you get used to them. However, one think I didn't like is that the Golgoth guards are the strongest characters of all for no reason. And the Agreus garden could be a little less stressing or frustrating in my opinion.The game is very well optimised and runs perfectly.I would rate this game an 8/10. It's very good, but I still think that the first Lords of Shadow game is a little better than the sequel. "

It controls like garbage if you dont have a gamepad, to the point where its unbearable. And don't even get me started on how they completely ruined castlevania as a whole.

												A great game with excellent boss fights which was ruined by an endless amount of cutscenes, a fairly non-sensical story and completely unnecessary stealth sequences which ruin the game. The presentation is spectacular and the controls are responsive, but the game asks you to backtrack repeatedly to get the collectables you missed along the way which wouldn't be so bad if the level themselves weren't so annoying. Some people might not mind backtracking to an area which requires a ton of platform jumping and climbing, but I find it fairly frustrating myself and it takes a lot away from the game.			"

												***SPOILER*** No no no... as someone who absolutely loved lords of shadow this game is pretty bad. The futuristic London setting is bland and uninspired, the skill progression feels almost non-existent, the stealth parts are terrible. Example of how completely stupid the stealth parts actually are. They literally consist of turning into a rat, taking over a body, or using bat form to walk right past someone. On top of that the whole these enemies are too powerful for you is complete ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t I mean ♥♥♥♥! you destroy satan and all of his acolytes yet you literally get one shot by some random minions where the ♥♥♥♥ is the logic? The half open world is stupid I don't feel like I'm on an epic journey like I was in lords of shadow one, instead I feel like im running to 3 different wings of the lamest city. This is what killed this game for me and the ending(BIG SPOILER). The entire game Dracula had a goal in which he would help kill satan and then recieve what he has wanted for one thousand years which is death. The ♥♥♥♥ing ending to this stupid game is him looking into the mirror of fate crushing it and saying fate will tell what happens from here and he walks away and the game ♥♥♥♥ing ends. The only redeeming quality of this game is when you are in Dracula's castle, the outstanding sound track, and the boss fights. I don't recommend this game for anyone looking for a good story/ending to lords of shadow.Edit: To all those reviews saying stop comparing it to lords of shadow 1. How the ♥♥♥♥ Can people not compare a direct sequel that claimed to be improving apon the bad things in lords of shadow one and concluding the epic journey of the lords of shadow franchise.			"

												  Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 should be the shining example of how not to do a sequel. The first Lords of Shadow game was a successful reimagining of the Belmont clan's eternal war against Dracula, with a solid combat system and gothic story that ended on a cliffhanger that easily teed up a continuation that would just have to stay the course to be enjoyable. Instead, MecurySteam seems to have dug deep to unearth the worst parts of the original, then added a pile of steaming♥♥♥♥♥♥on top of it.   I've never played a game that was so hellbent on taking control away from the player as this one. You start out in Gabriel's throne room, fighting back an invading army of armored foes. Every few steps you take, the game pauses to display tutorial text detailing moves you have available. It's a standard introduction to the controls, I thought, that's fine... Then I arrived at a section that required platforming, which was excellent in the prequel. Here, swarms of bats appear on handholds, and you just jump bat point to bat point, with no rhyme or reason to how high/far Gabriel can jump; often where you're jumping is completely off screen or doesn't make logical sense, you just jam jump to follow an arbitrary bat path. The movement in general just feels very stiff, linear, and unreliable. The camera is much too close to the character when “exploring”, and trying to jump a two foot gap could mean death in one instance, but you're deftly performing acrobatic leaps when the game wants you to...   Lords of Shadow 2 is more movie than game. After about the two hour mark of barely controlling the character, watching intolerably long cutscenes, taking two steps forward then triggering another obnoxiously long cutscene, I tried to grin and bear it, holding out hope that the game was setting the scene and would go off the narrow rails later. I was wrong. The reliance on movies to fill out the play time is persistent for the entire game. A few minutes of control, fighting a few small, easy demons... ten minute cutscene. Fight a boss for five minutes... ten minute cutscene. And the story is miserable; part emo, Dracula wants to kill himself, and part cartoon/anime cringe-y, Dragonball Z trash, every story beat somehow manages to be stupider and less cool than the last.   On the off chance you aren't watching a cutscene, you're presented with a poorly designed, fake open world to explore. It's only “open” in the sense that you can theoretically move among the levels at will without loading into them, but good luck with that. The environments are these super tight, twisting, confusing to navigate messes that's don't connect logically, and you're often forced to hit switches and wait for load-hiding mini-cutscenes to play out before you advance. It didn't take long before I completely abandoned any desire to look for optional power ups or secrets and just wanted to rush through the main path as quickly as possible. And even that can be a nightmare...   And then you'll hit the stealth sections. Oh, boy. They are really bad. Putting aside the idiotic narrative leaps where Gabriel can rip the heart out of a skyscraper-sized demon in one scene but will cower and automatically fail if a Strogg spots and shoots him the next, it's just a horrible, tacked on mini-game that you're forced to endure six times too many. Like the rest of the game, these horrible tests of patience expect you to play like a robot, using what powers they want you to use when they want you to use them. Experimentation is discouraged; there were a few instances where I thought I was pretty clever and found shortcuts around the unnecessarily long path they laid out, only to run into invisible walls or nonsensical fail states. You can transform into a swarm of rats if you activate set “dark spots” (because apparently Dracula is shy) which seems neat, but you're forced to watch more canned animation play out every time you do this, and you're often tasked with following a glowing skull bread crumb trail through narrow, linear vents, which is about as much fun as it sounds.   The one thing Lords of Shadow 2 has going for it is the visuals. I guess throwing player agency to the wind has it's perks, because the artists had the time to make a beautiful game. The demon and boss design in particular is excellent and creative. From fighting a Guillermo del Toro looking, tentacle-headed scientist to battling Satan riding a flying Cthulhu worm, the unique monsters and reimagined classic foes are pure, inspired eye candy. This ends the positive things I have to say about the game...   The “Ultimate Edition” includes all of the DLC, including a mode called Revelations that I think lets you play as Alucard in a new set of single player missions. I can't say for sure, because I didn't play it. I honestly couldn't wait for this game to be over so I could delete it off of my hard drive and be done with it. That might not be much of a review, but Lords of Shadow 2 isn't much of a game.			"

The final battle is a joke and the ending is the laziest♥♥♥♥♥♥I've seen in a long time, opening up for DLC obviously.Game tries to spice up as much as possible the original formula by bringing out zelda elements : hub, tons of subweapons, backtracking. It doesn't work : the hub is confusing at best, the subweapons feel like cheating and well backtracking isn't very fun. Music is so so with like 10 remixes of the same theme.Good points are three very cool boss fights and the gorgeous art direction. The rest is pretty bland and the stealth sections, while not as bad as expected, don't really bring anything.It had been one of my most anticipated games for two years. I'm really dissapointed.			"

												I can't even explain how pumped I was for this game. I watched all the trailers over 30 times at least and got kinda obsessed over it, but then release day came. I started playing and it was a great game! Smooth combat which improves a lot over LoS 1. There are many moves for all weapon types and with each mastery level, the weapon's effectiveness improves. The enviroments are stunning (plus with the free camera, you can enjoy them more), and with the HD texture pack only available on PC, the games was absolutely amazing and showed what PC's can do that consoles can not. I enjoyed the game quite a lot infact, but the story did seem dumbed down, especially the ending (won't spoil it for you and besides, it's my opinion on the ending). The modern day city was refereshing, but got a bit boring after going through the same area's multiple times during many missions. The stealth mission's are not exactly as good was Splinter Cell, but they are alright in their own way. Characters in this one seemed a bit bland as well, even Alucard and Gabriel. The only part I enjoyed in terms of characters was the Carmilla part, other than that, the story was pretty dull in most areas. After all, Dave Cox did say that we were going to get an epic, emotional ending as well. I'll just list pro's and con's on my view:Pro's:Great combat system! Way better than that of LoS 1.Beautiful enviroments (just a bit repetitive).Great QTE's for boss fights.Soundtrack is absolutely one of the best I have ever heard in a video game!The free-camera.Pretty cool boss fights.Con's:The story was pretty bland compared to the first one.Characters seemed to not be that interesting either (Except Alucard, Gabriel, Zobek, Marie, Carmilla and maybe Victor) Mainly the acolytes and Satan (Dave also stated we'd see how Satan progressed as a character. Didn't really see that at all).Some enviroments are boring when you keep having to go through them all the time.Not too many enemy types actually. I came across about 10-15.Stealth isn't the best either.The difficulty has been lowered down in this game as well compared to LoS 1.Final Verdict for me:Personally, I'd give it a 7 maybe 8/10. The ending wasn't all the good in my opinion, others may disagree. I think the game was pretty over-hyped, but most games are these days to be honest. I would definitely recommend buying this game, but don't expect as much a story as LoS 1. Combat was lovely though as well as the climbing buildings, wires and lamposts etc. I only ever got to use the dragon form once though (found it rare to find fragments of the medallion). Overall, if you loved the first one and MoF, get it! If you found LoS 1 and MoF a bit boring and bland, this game may not be for you then. I personally enjoyed 80% of it, but I feel that it will be another year or 6 months until I replay it.			"

												Just finished the entire game and I've to say, I quite enjoyed it. The story is definitely not something to be amazed at but it does have its moments. The gameplay is nice, your powers have multiple uses. Combat is amazing and the difficulty level is just about right. I played it in normal. The game is also visually very impression, however, Dracula's hair is kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥looking, that was my only problem with the graphics honestly.My only real complaints with this game is that there's♥♥♥♥♥♥tons of QTEs in the game, you even have QTEs while opening doors! However, QTEs can be disabled in the options menu. Also, Keyboard mapping is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the game doesn't tell you that to change the book's pages you need to use Insert and Delete. I had to randomly press all my keyboard buttons to figure that one out because it's not even written in the configuration menu. If you're playing with QTEs ""on"", the game will not tell you which button to press in the keyboard but will rather tell you which button to press on the gamepad, so you're always looking at the options menu in order to figure out which buttons to press. (For easy access to the keyboard layout, press F1 while in-game.)Cons: QTEs everywhereGame is not keyboard and mouse friendlyPros:Great Graphics.Okay-ish storyline, the game does have it's high moments but it's rare.Good hack and slash combat with proper difficulty settings.The game definitely does not hold your hand but you can adjust it that way.There are demons with boobs!

												Debilitatingly disappointing. I can't stand this crap pile of code. The story is excruciatingly slow. The dialogue is awkward and is comprised mostly of overly-exaggerated acting.The graphics are sub-par. Even on the highest settings on a newer high-end Samsung plasma TV and a gaming PC equipped with SLI'd GTX 780 Ti's, I am reminded more of a PS3 game than a PC game. After much experimentation with the graphic settings, I have come to the conclusion that they used motion blur to cover up the shortcomings and inadequacies of their game engine. Motion blur has clearly been implemented to bridge and smooth the gaps between stuttering frames rather than to create a more realistic sense of motion. (Turn off motion blur and you'll see what I mean.)The combat gameplay is utterly terrible. Gabriel is incredibly sluggish for being the badass that he's supposed to be. The camera angles are unmanageable and frequently interfere with the direction of your attack. Even the minor improvement after you disable the ""Combat Assist Camera"" setting, you are still left to struggle against some unidentified form of 'aim-assist' that frequently targets random objects to your sides and behind you rather than the bad guys - which is completely infuriating.On that note, let's talk about enemies. Enemies are as cheap as they come. Their attacks will always interrupt yours where, conversely, your attacks rarely ever interrupt theirs. To make matters worse, the enemies constantly rely mostly on their 'unblockable' attacks. They are so frequent that fighting multiple groups of monsters results in more dodging and - invariably - dying over and over again rather than a well-balanced challenge. The unblockables are either back-to-back or followed up by a second attack that changes oblique angles to follow Gabriel in more of a 'homing' fashion. All of this requires a lot more room to maneuver than is often provided.Forget blocking. It worked well in the first game but here, blocking is inconsistent in success.Worse still; as you progress through the game, you are faced with armored enemies whom you can not damage until you fist-pound the armor off of their bodies with the chaos claws. (This supposedly makes the armor ""hot"" until it either shatters...OR the AI decides that it's too hot to wear - at which point they strip it off.)Attacks don't just glance off of the armor. They bounce off. This makes targeting the lesser enemies around an armored enemy IMPOSSIBLE as your blows land squarely on the armored enemy rather than on any of the non-armored enemies. This makes fighting infuriating as you can't target the armored enemy without having to constantly avoid the attacks of the lesser enemies and vise versa. (Again, most of these attacks are unblockables.)It is also obvious that the developers generate challenge in the game using cheap methodology. The whip's reach is ridiculously short and enemies purposefully stay just outside of it's range. The sword and claws are nearly useless as they are limited on usability due to rapidly-drained energy meters which must be saved for various tasks. It's also irritating that ground attacks still catch you in-air - despite what basic relativity/logic would otherwise dictate.The bosses are ridiculous with typical lather/rinse/repeat tactics. Many of their attacks feel cheap and, at first, unavoidable. (Again, Gabriel is ridiculously sluggish.)Also... Why is a terrible creature such as Dracula spending so much time skulking in the dark as a rat? LAME.Then there are the little maze/stealth 'puzzle games' you play with various main story characters. (Carmella, Agreas (Pan's brother,) etc.) Here, you have to sneak through the areas unseen as the characters hunt you with intent to kill you on sight. These are incredibly irritating. This is NOT what Castlevania games are about. The controls are difficult enough but these control difficulties are highlighted during these maze/stealth puzzle games.All of this does little more than to make your character seem weak and not AT ALL like someone who once defeated the most powerful foes the world's history has ever known. This is unforgivable.It definitely wasn't long into the game to realize that it's an atrocity. Not only does it quickly prove you right, it actually makes you realize that you underestimated it's terrific level of crappiness. It's definitely the type of game that makes you wonder in fury if the studio has ever heard of ""quality assurance."" (""Did they even PLAY the damn game after making it!?"")NOTE: Dying finds you having to re-watch all videos and re-gather all items you find unless you passed a save point - including shards that increase your stats. (WHY, Mercury Steam? WHY!?)Don't feel bad if you finally give up on playing this crappy game and resort to Googling the videos to finish Gabriel's story instead. Trust me. I should have. It's NOT worth the time it takes to play it.This game is GARBAGE			"

												Finally, a 3D Metroidvania that does the series justice. This game is packed so full of homage to classic CV its ridiculously cool. Gameplay is similar to the first game, but much tighter. 'Useless' moves were removed, now every move in your arsenal has a point and purpose. The new movesets for the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws are excellent and diverse, they have a distinct different 'feel' as opposed to simply being light and dark powers.A true Castlevania fan will appreciate how far the series has come in this conclusion to the LoS story. Don't listen to the butthurt Igavania fanboys who are seriously the cancer killing the series. There are merits to both 2D and 3D CV's and this game fully delivers the 3D CV real fans have been waiting for.Oh, and ignore the paid reviewers who are butthurt they didn't get a paycheck, or simply suck too hard at REAL games to actually get far enough to form a proper unbiased opinion. It shouldn't even need to be mentioned though, anyone with a fraction of a brain knows to ignore 'professional' reviewers nowadays.			"

												Undead and loving it!  I ripped through LoS on 360, PS3, and again on PC, and I'll be ripping through denizens of demons with LoS 2 as well.  The combat is fantastic and the game looks amazing.  It's vastly different from Lords of Shadow, but in all the right ways.   If you played the original Lords of Shadow and enjoyed it, don't do yourself a huge disservice by reading a bunch of biased reviews and not buying this gem.  Buy and play...if action/adevnture is your thing, you won't be disappointed.  Also, this game is sooo much more than a God of War clone.  God of War doesn't hold a candle to this series, and I love GoW.			"

												So many people, blind with nostalgia and/or unrealistic expectations, are coming out of the woodwork to spew hate about this game.  The fact is, Lords of Shadow 2 is a beautiful, well-polished, crazy fun action adventure with a deep, engaging plot.  Mercurysteam has done the Castlevania franchise a great service by investing so much love and attention into their vision of Konami's classic gothic tale.Don't pay those unfairly low rview scores any mind; LoS2 is worth every penny, and you won't regret treating yourself to the experience.

In some locations I was just standing and maked screenshots because they was truly georgeous. Boss fights are fast and concept artist did good work. I think storyline is not so strong like in Los but that not mean that storyline in los2 is bad. Yes reviews not end good, but  in my opinion they not was truly objective. But players I think use to be for that. I truly recommend this game!			"

												I'm not sure I'm playing the same game as review sites are, this is a great game for fans of the first one. There's plenty of opulent set pieces to go with the same emphasis on defensive, carefully paced combat, alongside newly added incentive to try and vary the attacks you use long term to upgrade the power of your weapons. There are a few samey corridor pieces and a few poorly executed ""stealth"" puzzles, but for the most part the game is whips and platforming. If you liked LoS1 and/or Mirror of Fate there are very few reasons you wouldn't like this. Protip: Golgoth guards will spot you when they are standing still, so creep up behind them only when they start moving.			"

												Truly an upgrade to the first game, LoS2 brings a nice change of pace. The gameplay itself is solid, responsive and platforming isn't a chore like it was in the first game (fixed camera and 3D should never mix). The enemies are a nice change of pace, forgoing the traditional fodder spam in previous Castlevania games and the removal of the ""Grab is the only attack that matters"" is nice. Given the track record of 3D Castlevania games, this one is a leap in the right direction. The puzzles are a nice touch, not too difficult and quite creative.That being said, there are parts in the game that will cause you grief. Wandering around the city looking for an objective is tedious and frustrating, especially when the enemies continously respawn. The stealth mechanics are either stupidly easy or very cheap (I have developped a hatred for the fall season). And certain parts of the game will not give you an indication of what is required until you die (and a tip appears on the game over screen).All in all, the game is decent and will cater to fans similar games (God of War, Dante's Inferno, Devil May Cry, Bayonetta) and maybe Castlevania fans (if they are open to the 3D element). Unfortuately, the game's frustrating componants may deter players new to the genre. If the gameplay issues could be adressed, this game could truly be considered the stepping stone for 3D Castlevania games.			"

												About 4-5 hours into the game and am having such an amazing experience. I was nervous about buying this game because of the poor reviews across the board but I must say that thus far I am glad I did decide to buy in the end. The new gameplay mechanics are fresh and easy to get hooked to and overall feel way better than the original game. Graphics look amazing on max + sweetfx so I don't understand where people are saying the game looks dated. It's by no means a next gen title, but it's pretty darn close, and for what it may lack in visual appeal it makes up for in superb fun and exciting gameplay and an intriguing storyline. Looking forward to digging in more.			"

So loving this game it mainly let's your do your own thing with little hand holding. Along with that the port is soild constant 60fps at max settings on my rig with a gtx660 and this time round there's a HD texture pack just a shame there's no way to tell what's in HD though. Also it's not a bad looking game artstyle is amazing levels are big and very deailed.			"

												Pay little attention to the Reviews out there giving this game 5's and 6's. I find it hard to understand the harsh reviews this game has gotten so far, i am about half-way thru the game and it just keeps getting better. here are my obdervations so farWhats Great:+ Game is Gorgeus! lives up to the amzing looks of the 2d castlevania's+ The Combat system is satisfying and a vast improvement over the previous LoS+ Boss fights are intresting everytime and i am loving the enemy designs+ Enviroments in the castle are stunning and detailed (many a time did i stop to gawk at statues)+ Fantastic soundtrack (I still miss the symphonic metal of the old games but this is still pretty good)+ Being the final chapter in the LOS series the story from all those games is paying off and cant wait to see how it unfolds+ Open world enviroment is back!, the first LoS was more of a level based game while this one tries to stick to its roots of open exploration via powers and items unlockedWhats not so Great:+ Stealth sequences (who put this in my castlevania game?)+ Modern time setting feels out of place and unexciting (I get sad everytime i leave the castle)+ Needs a more detailed overworld mapOverall i am excited to finish it and i hope this game does not go unnoticed due to mediocre reviews as many other steam users here seem to agree with me that this game is worth at least your time to try the demo. And if you enjoyed the first LoS there is no reason not to enjoy this one.			"

												This game gets a 6.5/10 - but the revelations DLC gets 8/10If you love vampires (the kind that don't sparkle) then there is really no way to exclude this from your collection, because  when it comes down to it, this is a high budget vampire action game. Whips, swords, claws, and excellent cinematography within the world. Its the first vampire game I've ever played where you truly feel like an immortal being, and time passes in an almost dreamlike way. I personally loved the the parts of the game (about half) spent inside Dracula's Castle, especially walking outside amongst the frozen ramparts with those beautiful gothic spires in the distance, fighting Knights and such. (The whole time not entirely sure whether this castle is an actual place, or it was destroyed and you are simplying battling through your mind palace to reclaim lost memories) If thats the sort of thing that appeals to you, then this game is worth every penny.The other half of the game is set inside a futuristic post apocalyptic earth; it feels kind of like you're playing a dungeon in ""The Secret World"" - not badly done, just a strange break of character to fight flying riot police with machine guns after fighting knights in a castle.The reason I rate this game, especially the original, so low, is because the story and character progression feels like a PS2 game. It is extremely linear; there is very little in the way of character customization or side storylines. The other reason, and this is the main reason, is that the instructions are often very vague and have only one very specific trigger to complete an objective, so you often spend time puzzle solving something relatively mundane. I personally had to look up how to do a lot of things, and it was frustrating. There is also a lot of climbing in the first one for some reason. About 20% of the game feels like a Guild Wars 2 jumping puzzle or an Assassin's Creed exploration mission. Revelations adds a couple of mechanics to shorten this process, but it can still be annoying.End result is, the more you like vampires, the more you will like this game.			"

												A very fun game in the same vein as the original Lords of Shadow, but with the added bonus of the ability to turn off QTE events. Even then, the QTE events are nothing more than timing based. No random button crap that forces you to watch Zeus kill Kratos 60 times in a row like in the end of God of War 2. Good points of this game - Can turn off QTE'sFun CombatInteresting StoryLore of the Loregasm varietyBad points- Menu system is a bit wonky, as you can't access the main menu without loading into your saveTwo major stealth sections that are far more difficult than they need to beItems are a bit of a pain to find if you can't remember where they were when you come back for themAll in all I'd consider this a very good game, an 8 out of 10.

												Did you like LOS 1? Then you might like this game too.Now where to begin, the combat system for this game is still pretty good, that is if you enjoyed how it was in LOS 1. The art is even better and the visuals for the game itself are as it predecesor, flawless. The story is 7/10 compared to the original LOS game and the game is shorter than the original. The boss fights are a joke. LOS1 had some cool fights, so does this game, but in terms of difficulty it doesnt even compare. If you played ""The Forgotten One"" DLC for LOS1 and enjoyed that as I did, you will be massively disappointment with the amount of challenge these bosses in LOS 2 gives out. Pros+ Great Visuals+ Alright story+ Good combat system+ Light/Dark Power has been redone a bit, making it more fun+ More configurationCons- The game is short- Incredibly weak bosses- Low amount of puzzles - Game feels rushed - Probably the last LOS game we will ever seeOverall I'd recomment it, but only so you can see more of the ""Belmont"" storyline.

This feels like a JRPG where you spend more time watching the game then playing it, there are multiple instances of sitting through a cutscene to then just walk 50 feet to hit a button to start another cutscene. The graphics are amazing, the voice acting top notch, but I can't get past them cutscenes. I would recommend the previous 2 games but this one can easily be passed over.			"

												Game play was fairly standard, if you've played the original you'll find nothing new here. Most of the story was boring or stereotypical, but a few moments shone through. If the entire game was made up of those moments I could recommend this game outright to anyone. However, as the game stands, if you can get the game super cheap and are a fan of the original, or God of War esque action, then pick it up, but I wouldn't pay full price.			"

												I Really liked the first Lords Of Shadow, but this game is in my oppinion way worse. The story is pretty poor and the settings are way worse then the first game. The Gameplay itself i'd say is pretty ok, pretty much the same as the first game (which we're quite good). However the worst part of the game are the puzzles and stealth sections, those completely ruined the game for me.			"

A much improved game from the first Lords of Shadow.The controls are finally keyboard AND mouse, although when you're still told to use A B X Y it gets you f*cking confused. I know that you should use a ""gamepad"" as it recommends, but this is on a god damn computer I should be able to switch between gamepad and keyboard controls.The graphics, gameplay, h*ll EVERYTHING is 1000% better. The characters are really creative and the boss fights are fun and challenging.Would highly recommend!8/10 "

												Let's just get one thing straight; Lords of Shadow was my personal GoTY. Whilst I will admit that it had its foibles, overall I enjoyed it more than any other game I played that year. After spending some time with LoS2 I can already say that this is more of the same, so if you liked the first game then you will like this and vice versa. The game looks simply amazing, there's no denying that.The gameplay is almost identical to LoS but with a few tweaks. You now have a free roaming camera; This makes sense, as whilst the game world is stil split into distinct areas, you have the freedom (of a kind) to move between them as you see fit, and having a free camera lets you search around levels for all of those secret hideaways and stashes. As I just mentioned, the game world this time round is a much more open one. There are a ton of secrets and upgrades to find. Some of the things that made some people dislike LoS return, though they aren't deal breakers (platforming is still ropey and sometimes you think (can) jump to ledges only to ""bounce"" off them and fall into some lava or a pit and have to restart your platforming. The game starts off slowly but then builds pace nicely. The combat is almost identical to LoS (no bad thing).There are however some annoying things; ""cheap"" shots by enemies that are way off screen, unlbockable and sometimes un-dodgeable attacks and the way enemies will keep you in their fight area if you try to run/climb your way out of a fight. Most annoying.Seeing as this game is around £40-£50 on consoles I would definitely recommend getting on PC. Grab yourself an Xbox controller, ram up the graphics settings, sit back and enjoy another lengthy epic adventure (with minor quibbles (and they ARE minor)) with Gabriel Belmont AKA Dracula.Considering how EPIC the finale of LoS was, I can't wait to see how this one (as the end of the LoS storyline) pans out.

												While this game does not deliver the most fantastic graphics and next-generation gameplay I've ever seen, it doesn't matter - the game ends up being a perfect combination of elements that work. Gameplay is tried and true, the graphics make awesome use of every system I've tested the game on, and the game itself is entertaining well beyond the amount of cash it costs. A true victory on the part of its creators. I've added some insight over here as well: http://www.slashgear.com/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-2-review-01319080/ "

YES, it is an awesome sequel which learns a thing or two from the first LoS game, even better graphics and gamplay, took around 12 hours to complete with some exploration, if you have played the first in the series this is a must, if you are a fan of the genre or type of game, this is something I highly recommend.

												Easily one of the best games of 2014. The music, the graphics, the combat flow...everything is beautiful. I'm enjoing every bit of it, even the stealth sections (still trying to understand why people hate them). Don't know much about the plot yet but so far a solid 7/10Update: So I fiunished the games and I firmly belive that this game is awsome. A very good way to end the LoS franchise. Still have no problems with stealth sections, well maybe just with Agreus's part.That was  kind of unnecessary and a bit more illogical than the rest of  stealth sections. The lack of variety of enemies is a bit disappointing which comes from the free-roam aspect. In the previous game there were tons of enemies who added more flavour to the locations but it's kind of understandable that there aren't many enemies in the city locations.The story? I liked it but i do understand why people have problems with it.Overall, a quality game that deserves your attention if not at full price than at least at a discount.			"

												A very fun game in the same vein as the original Lords of Shadow, but with the added bonus of the ability to turn off QTE events. Even then, the QTE events are nothing more than timing based. No random button crap that forces you to watch Zeus kill Kratos 60 times in a row like in the end of God of War 2. Good points of this game - Can turn off QTE'sFun CombatInteresting StoryLore of the Loregasm varietyBad points- Menu system is a bit wonky, as you can't access the main menu without loading into your saveTwo major stealth sections that are far more difficult than they need to beItems are a bit of a pain to find if you can't remember where they were when you come back for themAll in all I'd consider this a very good game, an 8 out of 10.

												I loved the first Lords of Shadow and I'm a fan of Castlevania in general. But I can't recommend Lords of Shadow 2. Gone are the sweeping vistas and gorgous colorful scenery of the first LoS, now it's all drab grays of a gothic city and a gothic castle. Even Patrick Stewart can't say the rediculous lines he's given with any gravitas. Which was a problem in the first game but is even moreso in the sequel. Further, the stealth sequences are shoehorned in and are very clunky. Dracula can take down giant gorgon monsters, combat mechs, and blood golems, but he can't handle some jerk in a suit with a grenade launcher.The plot meanders about, spending alot of time introducing characters who'll never be seen outside of their introduction until it finally mercifully ends on an anticlimatic note. The combat is good, if somewhat shallow, but the platforming is floaty at best. On the whole, you should wait for the steam sale before getting this game.			"

												I will very recommend the first Castlevania Lords of Shadow but this second entry was not what I expected. I don't know if it is that I miss the fixed camera, the way the story progress on the first game or mostly the ""medieval"" atmosphere. I liked the prologue of this new entry. I loved the trailer of course, the hype was pretty much there but I hated the script and of course the ending of the first game. Basically Lords of Shadow is something different from old Castlevania (even Curse of Darkness and Lament of Innocence) but the first one had  some interesting designs and levels. A lot of cliché stereotypes but it was decent. Sorry, I don't like to dislike a Castlevania game but I can't recommend this one. "

												After I have Let's played Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2 on my channel, I can give you a clear and accurate review on to this game. While this is no review in video form, I still hope to give you as much information as you desire.The storyline in Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2 is both gripping and compells you to keep playing the game. It is fun to explore further and further. As the story becomes more clear, the more you wish to play.The gameplay of the game is rather smooth even though it could use some tweaking. This is nothing that will stop you from enjoying the game as it is though.The bossfights are always different. They are never the same. needless to say - they are fights - but unique in their own approach to storyline and gameplay.The relatively vast, open world offers you the possibility to venture through the world of Castlevania nearly freely. You can find upgrades, goodies, best challenges and be furthermore amused by books and scrolsl scattered throughout the game that give you both helpful info on upcoming encounters and on the story of the game.The level design can be -very- frustrating at times. But if you are willing to look past that and can accept the graphics as they are, which as a lovely footnote here - they are not bad at all, then I would say you have a good game on to your hands in which you can sink several hours without regretting your purchase.The only downside is the lack of support for keyboard and mouse. The keyboard and mouse controls have not been translated and you will find XBOX Controller instructions in the game. But once you have learned how to control Castlevania, then you should be able to master it just well.I give this game a 70 out of a hundred. This is a good score for the game itself. If the port had  been better, than the score would surely be higher.Thank you so much for reading. I hope this game review was helpful for you.If you feel like watching it for yourself before playing it, feel free to visit my channel at youtube.com/Shengame "

												5/10tl, dr version: A cash in on the franchise one more time.Awful story that has ruined the heart of Castlevania as a game franchise. Decent graphics and responsive gameplay, but heavily mired by a flawed combat system. Still perhaps worth getting if on sale for the mindless smash enemies combat. Great voice acting from the main actors, but less should have been put in to the voice acting and instead spent on developing a real story that respects the franchise mythology. Big thumbs up, the scourge of modern games, QTE's, can be disabled permanently.Long Version:StoryAwful to put it simply, it's a train wreck. Castevania is at its heart a conquer the castle and kill Dracula game, this ""re-origin"" story series has just wrecked that with taking away everything that is Castlevania in exchange for trying to dramatise the backstory of Dracula to make him a tragic hero; with an overwhelming judeo-christian mythology shoehorned in to dominate the mythological aspects whereas previously the series was only very loosely tied to any particular mythology. The whole story was just 'Ugh, it's the devil is the bad guy story, how original...push that religion on us even more'.We are meant to believe the city is built on the ruins of Castlevania (dont even get me started on that nuke effect taht was shown large enough it would have destroyed several ENTIRE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES), and the devils kids would use that spot to try bringing about their dad's return...ofcourse. Use the site your ancient enemy is at his most powerful as your base of operations.....yep, perfect sense. Major plot holes exist *spoiler* e.g. Zobek could have read Drac's mind to discover his deception unless he lost his memories, but Zobek couldnt realise that his lieutenant had been replaced by Alucard by, oh I dont know...reading his thoughts....yeah, sure. I call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The deal with Castlevania itself is never really clarified, is the castle real and split off from the modern era dimension, or just a figment of Drac's fragmented mind....Major problems arise with the story regardless of which it is.The story is jsut a cavalcade of bad ideas. GameplayTight controls that function decently for getting around and in combat. Probably the aspect of the game that is most positive. The grappling aspects are a disappointment, see that you can only use fixed grapple points to get around, instead of simply making anything that is like a ledge able to be hung from, and the game is loaded with invisible walls which is hugely disappointing for exploration. The game is heavily walled in and you will find that you are limited to very selective above street level areas, and street level, if you want to go explore over the rooftops of the city like some real badass vampire god, forget it, go buy a copy of Batman arkham city, a game which did city exploration properly.CombatThe combat is broken down into mobs using 3 types of attacks: range, melee blockable, and melee/range unblockable.You have 3 weapons, a whip, sword adn claws. All with varying utility, the whip is a mid range weapon that is usable for building up 'focus' which when you hit 100% then attacking enemies will cause them to drop little gems that can be absorbed for magic power for your sword or claws, this only works with the whip though so you will spend a lot of time using it. Void sword burns magic and leeches life on hit, while the claws also burn magic but deal high damage and destroying shields and armour. The shields and armour♥♥♥♥♥♥was a terrible implementation, mobs can stand there blocking forever if you dont destroy the shield or armour, forcing you to use the real core combat mechanic, ""timed counters"" where you hit L2 at the right time in their swing to block an attack and stun them for a second and smash away, this builds huge focus so you can get your claws powered up to break the shields, alternateively you can somersault over attacking monsters and smack them in the back, whatever works. Unfortunately unless you are good at it, you are ♥♥♥♥ed, having spent significant time playing dark souls it was♥♥♥♥♥♥easy to time compared to parries in DS, but often if you are using the void sword or claws the actual enemy attacks get obscured by the flashy animations of the glowing weapons that you dont see them, this is a♥♥♥♥♥♥implementation really forcing play where you dont really engage upclose with magic weapons you mainly use a couple of specific moves then go back to the whip.There is though a mechanic of ""unblockable attacks"", which is a huge flaw in the combat and you are forced to dodge, these attacks are indicated, but seems like lazy design, especially when you come to the bosses who their attacks are pretty much all unblockables or range attacks other than usually 1 blockable melee attack, this menas you can spend boss fights frustrated and magic starved as the range attacks keep you away, and the unblockables are chained so often the fight is 30 seconds of dodging and waiting to get one block and some melee attacks, absorb some magic and hit them a couple times for reasonable damage as the whip does ♥♥♥♥ all. In this way the game lends itself to securing really only a couple of the actual skills for the sword and claws to 'gg no re' your way through the game, namely: Whirlwind for the Void Sword, and Flame Claws for the Chaos Claws. Both expensive to use but when you see them in action it's pretty much a no brainer to use them. You may simply discover the other method which is boss cheese and basically forces you to pop relics such as ensnared demon then go crazy with the inifnite magic while timer counts down (spam those flame claw attacks, for real, ~300 damage per hit on everything), then when it runs out pop the dragon emblem and finish the boss off, takes about 30secs per boss fight, even on PoD difficulty and is almost zero effort (you may have to use the void sword to freeze bosses to spam them hard with the claws).Skipping combat and bypassing trash is often impossible, as pretty much every enemy has some sort of range attack intended to knock you off a hang point if you try to grapple away. Some monsters (the wraith type guys at the end msotly) have ridiculous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t attacks that you cannot do anythign to avoid and hit extremelyhard, as noted, the wraiths, tey have a lightning attack that will hit you from 50 metres away, is practically instant hit and dodging it not really possible as by the time you see it, it is hitting you, and there is no way to defend against it other than popping the sword or claws shield magic. As these creatures fight in packs of 4-6 generally, you can imagine, Drac at max HP has about 300 hp, and lightning hit's for 40 each time....6 of them will kill you in about 3 secs, faster than you can close the distance to get to them sometimes....Also, finally, the camera is terrible, even with ""combat assisted"", it is awful and seems like it tries to blind spot enemies, and the trash monster scripts seem they are intent on getting behind the camera when they can to hit you in the back. This because truly frstrating when their seems to be no 'free camera' even when assist is off and the camera constantly tries to centre in ways that make no sense and you often spend as much time trying to correct the camera so you can see wtf is happening as actually paying attention.DLCRevelations has good puzzles, but disappointingly cruel end boss fight due to endless unblockable attacks and mechanics that dont work with the camera (teleporting behind and unblockable charge).ConclusionIs the game worth buying? Not at full price, it seems like an effort to just milk some more money out of the Castlevania fans who are holding on to hope that each release will be the next Symphony of the Night. Something which the LoD series just hasnt been anything near, ultimately this game is completely forgettable.			"

												The game was alright overall, but it's a poor man's Arkham game. The story of the main game was interesting and the art style is fantastic, but the gameplay and combat system actually got quite annoying near the end, when trying to get all the collectables.Part of the problem is the level design which is a non-obvious corridor, where areas are separated by a multitude of sluice-gates, elevators, decontamination rooms, etc. It's constant delaying and unnecessary gratuituous animations which get boring rather quick. It takes a very long time to navigate between areas and respawning mobs often prevent you from leaving before you dealt with them, even though you have nothing else to gain from killing them. Once I got the final secret collectible, it took me something like 20 minutes to get to the area where you trigger the final boss encoounter.Unlike the Arkham games where collecting additional content is enjoyable and adds to the experience, the design of the levels actually takes enjoyment away. I would recommend doing a story driven run and avoiding backtracking for collectables and challenges.The music is OK on it's own, but doesn't fill inspired as much as the art style and often doesn't really fit the environemt or add much to the game.The PC port is pretty bad. You pretty much need a controller, as all the button prompts are laid out for a 360 pad. It's much worse than the first game which you could play with KB/Mouse perfectly fine. The game runs well and stable, but it's absolutely impossible to tab out. You need to trigger an automatic save, which often happens between areas, but isn't reliable, and quit the game.Lastly, something that bugged me personally. You frequently either fight or partner up with humnoid characters. They have about 3 phrases each on average and will keep shouting them non-stop. Gets seriously annoying.			"

												The first game set up the pins for a great sequel. Now, take everything great about the first game- level structure, fluid combat, compelling (or at least interesting) story, good music, and secrets that made you want to backtrack to get them. Throw all of that in the garbage, and then set that garbage on fire. Voila!I saw things 1/3rd through the game that made me say ""Huh, I need a double jump to get that."" You get the double jump at the very end, and then if you want to go back, you have to traipse through a half hour worth of things you already did to get at that not-really-worth it secret.

												Too much hype for a bad game.The game, itself, taking every bit of context, is not that bad. It's just a copy of every other game that came before, with hack 'n slash combat, puzzle-solving and weapon upgrade.But when you put it all in what this game promised, after the name 'Castlevania', and after the previous game, it is a complete failure, a letdown.Graphics are amazing, can't deny that. From scenery, to character design and artwork/concept.Now, gameplay is generic, and story is  lame, predictable, bland. Most of the characters are poorly written and have no personality, only doing what the plot needs it to do. And the end is anti-climatic.Skip it.			"

												I completed it only for the plot. Gameplay is frustrating, enemies are boring/cheap, stealth (oh the horror) and the whole modern setting is horrible and feels forced.But! When you go to the past, all of that is reversed.Castle: 8/10 + More like the first game+ Beautifully crafted+ Enjoyable enemies- No story related content at all...City: 4/10+/- Story is here, but it's not that good...- Cheap enemies- Bland and boring setting- Horrible stealth sectionsOverall: 6/10Half of the game is horrible and other half is ok. Recommended only to HC fans of Castlevania.			"

												THIS GAME WAS GREAT AT THE START, but after the first area the game went down hill. It went from fun to, is this a Castlevania game!? I felt like I was playing another game, the game went in a total different direction sneaking around. The thought the first game was bad, so when I started to play the second I thought yes now this is a great game compared to the 1st, but no. I would rather play Castlevania II Simons Quest or even the N64 version than Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 1 and 2. This game is not what I thought it would be, and I tried to like it.Graphics 10/10Sound 10/10Music 10/10 I give this game a  2/10 "

												I have some things to complain about:   1. It is mentioned in the requirements that it is suggested to use a gamepad, but it never mentions that it is impossible to play with the keyboard.  I have configured the control to ""keyboard"" multiple times, and it invariably reverts to gamepad while playing.  In occassions it is required to pres X, Y, A buttons, and the keys originally configured don't work. It has become frustrating.2. The game is a series of events that are default and the player finds himself only following simple instructions as: press this or that key, without any other consequence than to be able to proceed with the tight story.3. The camera shifts during combat makes it impossible sometimes to know what's happening.4. The combats are so cut by scenes and ""must press or do"" situations, that it is hard to really enjoy them.I think this could have been a great game if not for these details.			"

												2 hours in it is unclear wether I still am in the tutorial. I mean, what is this, AC3?The game is ridicously bloated with cutsecenes and the little gameplay you are offered are the sort where you run through linear corridors, scale some ledges and then fight some guys. Some times the camera will even pan in on something important for you, then give you ""valuable"" hint on how to overcome your struggles. should you happen to die or fail the game will kindly show you everything again. And again. And again.Also, the main character is not evil enough. OK, ""ooOOooh"" he kills some humans in need of blood, which is as expected from a vampire, but then, as part of the half-hour intro cutscene/""immersive"" exposition gameplay he seems all sorry about it, as if he only drinks from the bad, or like he has any kind of sentiment. Gimme a break!Anyways, played it for two hours, felt like I was playing some empty♥♥♥♥♥ soulless game from the nineties and felt like I was wasting my life. Then in an attempt to feel relevant and to justify the squandering of my grains of sand, I wrote this review so you don't have to squander yours.Play something worthwhile,play dark souls.			"

												This is that type of game that doesn't even know what it's trying to be, in the first part you're fighting in what appears to be a hack'n slash type of third person game, kinda like Devil May Cry, or the modern Ninja Gaiden games, and then all of the sudden it's just you walking around in first person for no reason whatsoever, only to then appear in what seems like an open world, with stealth elements, if you played the demo, and expect something similar to what you got at that point then you're out of luck.The combat system is extremely repetitive, and clunky, the graphics are nice, but every time that i'm enjoying some of them there's either a cutscene that lasts more that ten minutes while saying nothing, or just straight out a quick time event, that you luckily can disable, and i recommend you do, in the options menu in the game.I just didn't enjoy it, i didn't enjoy any of it, i was expecting a hack'n slash game, and instead i got a game that goes up, and down, not knowing even what's supposed to be, only trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator of people that just play games for the sake of playing them, this is a game that's trying with each second appeal to an, any type of audience while never acknowledging it's own, shame.

												If you can tolerate mediocre story and obsessive hand-holding through the never ending tutorial tips. AND you can tolerate them interrupting the actually good gameplay for long periods of time, I'd reccommend this game to you. Sadly, my attention span only goes so long, and when I spend only ~20 of my first 100 minutes actually exploring and fighting, it'll make me stop caring.The actual core gameplay is pretty good, it's just not enough to get through the A-button spamming imo.

												I am a fanatical Castlevania fan. I've played every single game to date! (including Simon's Quest) I have kept an open mind about all the different stories and enjoyed every single one. So believe the severity in my words when I say that I *FIRMLY* believe that this game ruined the entire Lords of Shadow series for me. Don't get me wrong! Mechanically speaking, this game is near flawless! (I say ""near"" because on the hardest difficulty I was alowed to play, I still didn't find it challenging.) The story, however, took my favorite iconic Castlevania characters and just... Ruined them. The first one had a GREAT concept. I liked it! Despite the fact that it really was very ""God of War""-ish. The DS ""between"" game even expanded on the great story they built up towards. BUT THIS ONE TOOK THE GOOD IDEA AND JUST RUINED IT. I want to use much harsher words, but I find reviews that just spew profanity never really seem to hold any weight for anyone. So trust that I want to just use every harsh word in the book at this. Honestly, I wouldn't even recommend this game to anyone who ISN'T a fan of the previous games. The story writing and concept for this game just didn't work in this one.			"

												Hmm this Review is based on how much you got the game for, as there is no ""hmm maybe"" button ill have to label as not Recommended unless its on a nice discountThe core Combat is fun and satifieing and some nice skills, everything however...First off the Modern setting is completely generic and does nothing for the games story, while certain Dream sections echo a game it could of been, Exploreing Draculas castle (Castlevania) is fun and the enemy designs and envionment are top notch.. rest of the time however its boring gray buildings, Top secret Labs youve seen 1000s of times and boring Mutant enemies as cannon fodder.so maybe get if its 50% or 75%, dont make the same mistake and get it full price like I did.p.s The First Castlevania Lords of Shadow, is around the same price as this game on sale, allthough that game has its problems as well, you may like as a God Of War esc adventure game (we dont get many specticle fighters on PC.

												A marvel of writing, the part where there's two Maries and Gabriel has to choose between them broke my heart, engaging stealth sections that keep the heart beating as you scurry past the enemy praying they don't notice (This stealth system could give Metal Gear a run for it's money) and let us not forget some of the best city levels ever designed in a video game. I really felt like I was a demon in the night as I slew generic monsters over and over again, but since its satan's army its OK to not have creativity. It's not like the only parts of the game that were of any worth was the toymaker and the prologue. The one thing that will stick with me for the rest of my life was that great ending, I won't spoil it but you kill satan and walk into a church as some kind of christmas music plays. If I may be so bold as to quote a line from this masterpiece""Don't hit me, father!""That line alone should help you decide whether this game is for you which isn't even needed as this game is for everybody.

Objectives are linear but you can explore anywhere in the game world at any time to find upgrades and etc, just like a castlevania game should be. Combat is responsive and fluid, you can parry and dodge in midair, massive massive improvement over the first game. Great story except it loses a little bit of steam at the end.

There is no way to change that display either. The story was fine, gameplay could've been great..You know, if they'd tell me what to do clearly.			"

ARE YOU SERIOUS? Second, terrible stealth-action, game forcing you to hide from big guys.Third, boss battles are incedible bad, they made so poorly even worse than in Castlevania: LoS14th, main game's setting is in our time 20th-21th century and there's a past with classical Castlevania setting but problem is that both of them are really bad and poorly made.5th, and the main issue is STORY there's absolutely the worst story of any Castlevania series, even Castlevania on NES has more story(actually not but you get the idea, right?)To summ all that I can say ""Never, buy this game!"" it's really bad and poorly made game with a lot of gameplay/story issues and I was really hyped for that and felling so bad because of the quality of product.

												4.7/10 Just skip it unless you are REALLY REALLY into dreary settings... like not kinda into dreary settings, like REALLY into dreary settings. Black and Grey for days... for days. Combat is okay, mostly a mixxed bag of easy battles and annoying battles. Not a single fight is difficult. Played on the the ""Lord of Shadow"" difficulty... game is kinda garbo with nice set pieces here and there. That is about it. Doesn't hold a candle to the first one.P.S.The DLC is decent enough though.			"

												Absolute trash.  This is a complete mess in comparison to the first game.  I'm really trying to love it, but I find myself wanting to /wrists instead.  The controls and on screen garbage this studio put together is rubbish.  The free moving camera makes this rediculous.  I got this on pc because I didn't want to use a controller on a console....fk'ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Guess it's just another series I will have to quit playing because designers and publishers are too damn stupid to know the difference between a pc and console, and clearly have no idea what they put together.  Do yourself a favor if you are reading this, do not buy it.  Do not waste time on it.  Cry yourself to sleep because they destroyed Castlevania.			"

												This game was a disappointment, even if the gameplay is funny, the story is really mediocre and poorly constructed.Some parts of the game are so incredibly boring. Lost in a kind of open world with one of the worst map I ever seen in a game.Even if I completed the game, I still didn’t understand some part of the gameplay and story, which very confusing. Some scenes are stunning, but those doesn’t make it a better game. Is only to play if you are a real fan of the series.Vote 5 "

												The stealth parts are atrocious. Combat is not an option and your weapons are simply removed, the explanation being that you, count ♥♥♥♥ing Dracula, are too weak to fight some lame♥♥♥♥♥baldies wearing what has to be the ♥♥♥♥♥iest looking armor I've seen in my entire life. Boring, mind numbing, badly designed, uninspired, uninteresting, and - most importantly - painfully, PAINFULLY slow paced, these sections of the game are a slap in the face. They make staring at a wall for an hour sound like an up in excitement. Pacing is a general problem, as the game takes control away from the player for WAY too long to play an unnecessary animation or even just display some tutorial text. This makes even picking up gems slightly discomforting, showing the same animation every. single. time. Seriously guys that silly pain box thing got boring halfway through the first animation. The Story is all over the place too. One of two main reasons I tried paying attention and got the basic gist of it was because of  the supreme voice acting. The other was remembrance as well as fondness of the characters due to having played the first game. Something about Gabriel becoming Dracula then getting killed by his son and grandson that don't know they're related and one of them is also a vampire but oh wait they did'nt kill him for real and now he's in the present bla bla bla. At best it sounds like you missed some epic action and get to experience the♥♥♥♥♥♥aftermath.Combat is still amazing, unfortunately I've run into hardly any at all, save for the first section. It looks kinda pretty, some textures seem to be muddy though. This game is so frustratingly bad, it makes me wish the first game had been bad too, so that I wouldn't care. Steer clear, unless your hobbies consist only of staring at walls and you feel like you need something with less action for a change. Then these stealth parts are just for you!			"

Even after remapping controls only the XBOX controls come up for any quicktime event. If people wanted to play with a control they would have bought this for a console.If you DO NOT have a control do not buy this. Better yet, buy it used from gamestop, and return it within a week after you beat it.On a side note, Konami's customer support is a joke, and all they could do is refer me to steam.			"

												If you really loved the first one, give this one a try, otherwise go away and don't look back. Here's the detail : The more I think about this game, the less I like it. At first I'd thought that it was a cool sequel, not ""super great"" but decent, and worth the try if you liked the first one. But in fact to be honest, it's not even half the game that was the first Lords of Shadow.They have removed the Shadow/Light weapon mecanique that forced you to switch during boss fights.Speeking of boss fight, they for most of them have the same paterne with only two phase repeated 3 or 4 time, Phase ""Beat the crap out of the boss"" and phase ""run to avoid the♥♥♥♥♥♥trowed at your face"" abd in the end they feel like they are just the first phase of somthing that should be in two or three phase, like what was the boss in the first game.Some of the bosses are ""shadow of the colossusish"" like in the first episode but it feel forced, like a mandatory thing that the devs have put in the game for no other reason than ""it was in the first one"". The final one in particular is realy lame in comparaison of the final one of the first episode.And then, there is the ""steath"" phase, who are juste tedious as hell !And the ending feel like it was ... amputated of a final boss fight.Ho and by the way, I've finished Lords of Shadow in 15h (and dont feel like spending more time in it) where I've spend 25 for the first one.

												The pitiable game design choices prevent the enjoyment of the art and scenario from shining through this intriguing tale of Dracula.Bad design choices? How about displaying the correct keys on the screen for the PC port, instead of still having the XBox controls on screen? Seriously. You can't even turn off the onscreen controller ""hints,"" so I'm fighting a paladin, really into it; he launches an attack. . . I dodge it. . . screen freezes: ""whow hey, did you know you can dodge this attack, by pressing the X key on your XBox 360 controller?"" I'm already dodging the attack, anyway!! And the game pauses, while I'm in battle, to tell me how to dodge the attack--I've already dodged it anyway--and the instruction isn't even for the right controller!!! In 2014, a majour release title like this, should feature the correct controls when displaying instructions. There's no option to change what controls are displayed, or to just disable when the game displays controller instructions--there is an option you might think would do that: it doesn't. It is an insult to literally the entire gaming community, that a majour video game would not even take the time required to show the keyboard controls onscreen, for their PC release. What does it say about your game, when you do not put forth that level of effort when releasing it?Recommended, absolutely, if you are very interested in the story of Dracula. I am, and I like the game for it, but at least 60% of my enjoyment of that, is burnt away by the frustrating controls and other bad design choices.For example, not too far into the game, you fight through a boss encounter of three strong enemies, and then immediately after, you open a portal to the next area. As soon as I got there, I accidentally opened the same portal again going backwards to where I just came from. I figured it out quickly, however the game would not let me just turn around and continue playing in the realm I portalled to: instead I absolutely had to complete portalling back into the first realm that I started from, where, oh the boss is here again, and oh thanks we just autosaved, and also I now only have a little bit of health and no mana left because I literally just faught this boss 15 seconds ago!! This is a design choice for this game. You can't open the portal until the boss is dead, so I almost quit playing at this point, because I could only survive two hits before dying. This is not how you introduce a new part of your game! Just please don't do this in your game. Like, I even understood that I had accidentally opened a portal backwards, and the game would not let me cancel out of it; and then there's a forced boss encounter before I can open the portal again?  It's just really bad game design. It feels like no one actually sat down and played this game.In another area, you have to get through a high security door. I though ""what I'll do is kill that scientist, then the enemy will send another scientist in through that door, and when he enters,  I can rush through the door."" No! Because that door is really just an art feature over an invisible wall, and the only way through it is to specifically activate a cutscene. Arhg! You can see through the door when it opens; why would this one door, in the entire game, have an invisible wall behind it? And then you can't really tell: ""was I trying to go through that door too early, too late? Did I get stuck on the edge of it maybe. . . ?"" You review the hints you have, and it seems like you're doing the right thing. It's frustrating because you're really playing this game against the game designers, and not against any enemies of Dracula. The game encourages you to imagine yourself as Dracula, but if Dracula was really here, then he would just walk through that door.An enemy has an energy shield, which you have to pound away on to break it. If you cease attack, for literally less than one second, then the energy shield completely recharges. So it's difficult to tell if what you're doing is effective, because it's hard to stay on the enemy as they move around, and other enemies in the room try to attack you. Then, do you want to know what happens when you do break through the energy shield? If you do break through the energy shield, then the energy shield completely recharges, looking just like what happens when you stop attacking it. You actually have to break through the shield three times, but the game offers no signal that you're actually having an impact. If you break through the shield, it looks the same as if you failed to break through the shield. This is a bad design choice which I hope I don't have to explain further, but I will: it encourages the player to cease doing the right thing, maybe even leave the area, and try other things--which incidentally won't work. The game offers a difficulty setting, but so far as I can tell, the only difference is that you get more health pickups on easy. It doesn't, for example, make that shield recharge after 2 seconds, so you can break through it without being a super expert fighter. There is an interesting story of Dracula here, but it is wreathed in bad design. Confusion abounds. Fighting is challenging, but difficulty comes from trying to understand what the game expects. A game about Dracula, could be difficult by having strange boss encounters that make you pass unusual trials. You may even think that's what this game is. But I do not think the difficulty present in this game, was intentional. Having a game throw you back against a boss, immediately after you defeat it; without restoring your health, and autosaving at the start of the battle . .  This is not ""difficulty"" this is ""bad design."" It is worth playing to experience some of the story of Dracula, but it is not worth playing to see what a good game looks like.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Also. . . to one of the commenters: I didn't write about any crashes. And I'm not using a 360 controller, because I like using a mouse and keyboard: the game actually controlles quite well with a mouse and keyboard, except that all the information in game is for the 360 controller, and then you're like ""ooh, what button was it to activate this blood spout?"" Then you have to go searching through not one, but two sepearte controller help pages to try and find it, and just, ugh. . .why? Why is it like this???			"

												I can't believe this game has so many positive reviews. It's total crap. First, the game description forgot to mention one 'detail' - that it's practically unplayable if you don't have a gamepad. Yes, there is an option 'mouse and keyboard', but they did't even bother to change the directions in the game. So every time there's a hint or a new power, you have to stop the game, press F1, and check what are you supposed to press. Plus it's extremely awkard - get ready for A LOT of falling and dying, NOT because the game's difficult but because the controls are idiotic. The game is supposed to be action-adventure, but I'm not sure what the 'adventure' is supposed to be, here. It's all same cheap wannabe dramatic moments, like floor collapsing under your feet - it gets yawningly repetitive within few minutes. There's very little story and the Dracula is about as charismatic and interesting as a loaf of a week-old bread. I wouldn't give this more than 50% - on condition you have the gamepad and like repetitive action.  "

												So first of all I didn't play the Castlevania series before which means I don't know anything about the GBA/Nintendo etc games.I bought Darksiders -which was in a bundle- and I realy fell in love with the game. Afterwards I got Darksiders 2 and after I finished it aswell I started to search for games which are alike. Someone told me about Castlevania: Lords of Shadows.So I started with Castlevania:LoS (Ultimate Edition) and it was one of the best expiriences I've ever had. The atmosphere, the fights, the mechanics (light/darkness) and the insanelly good music made this game a 9/10 for me. When I finished the game and closed the client I got an announcement by Steam about Castlevania:LoS2 and I was soooooooooo happy.I immediatelly bought it and when it was released, I immediatelly started it.The 1st thing was the ""Tutorial"" which was epic as♥♥♥♥♥♥ One of the greatest things in my opinion is the new usage of Light and Darkness which is splitt in new weapons (Sword/Gauntlet). I really liked the character development and how much the characters in the game actually changed.I'll be honest. After I played for about 1 hour I was really disappointed about the game. It didn't feel like the 1st LoS and something was missing. I felt that the story was really flat and -maybe- it was the new location which I felt were not fitting the game. And I stopped playing it.After some time passed I started the game again and realized it was the worst mistake ever to stop playing it. #######################SPOILER###########################It's amazing! I love how the game changes all the time. The timetravel and the changes in the locations are amazing. The story of the 1st LoS and LoS2 combine themself very well and makes a lot of sense. The story of LoS2 feels very flat but after I reach a certain point in the game my opinion changed completely. It pretty much change the whole point of view.One of my favourite parts is still the music in this game which fits perfectly.About the gameplay it's really simple to explain. The people who played the 1st LoS won't find many differences. You can still  find containers to increase your life/light/darkness. The 1st difference lies within the skilltree. While you still purchase new combos with the points you gain, your skills level aswell if you use them and you can compile them in your weapon which makes the weapon stronger. This change is really good in my opinion because it was one of the flaws in LoS. The skilltree didn't seem to be important and you didn't really need to unlock the combos becuase you could beat the game with the stadart attack. Now there is at least a reason to use different attacks.A new feature I really appreciate are the challenges which are a small sidekick. You get different challenges where you need to kill enemies within a certain time of do other things.One of the facts that every LoS1 players will love is the camera which you can move completely freely.What else can I add. The bossfights are still really good and the finishing moves are still epic as♥♥♥♥♥♥ the enemys use undodgeable moves more often which makes the fights a bit harder while the overall gameplay didn't change that much from LoS1.I will say it this way: If you liked the 1st LoS and enjoyed it you will like the 1nd one aswell. Give it some time and don't drop it after an hour like me. Play it and see how well it develops.My rating: 8 /10			"

												As an avid fan of the Castlevania series, I will say most of the 3D entries have been mostly mediocre.  Some had good ideas marred by poor controls (N64 games) while others had tedious gameplay with excellent music and atmosphere (Lament of Innocence and Curse of Darkness).Then 2010 rolled around and Lords of Shadow came out.  Another 3D Castlevania that I had zero expectations for but still an almost forced obligation to try...and it blew me away.  Amazing graphics, gripping story, phenomenal soundtrack, varied enemy encounters, huge boss fights, and a simple on the surface but surprisingly deep combat system in the vein of God of War (this doesn't have to be an insult, people) gave a shockingly well rounded package that earned the game some high sales and critical praise the series hadn't seen in a long time.  It had its faults, namely a camera that couldn't be controlled and a somewhat slow beginning, but the series seemed to be headed in a positive direction.A few years later we got Mirror of Fate, a sort of in-betweener entry to bind the stories of LOS1 and LOS2.  It also marked a return to the side-scrolling roots with flashes of SOTN style gameplay.  The story was interesting but markedly less central compared to LOS.  Still, the gameplay was mostly interesting, a little different, and again had a wonderful score.With the announcement of certain features like a seamless world and a controlled camera, LOS2 had a lot to live up to.  For the most part it delivers, though it definitely has its flaws.  Rather than continue on with the paragraphs at length, I'll make some easy to peruse pros and cons lists.PROS: -The story is still well told and interesting, voice actors all nail their roles (specifically Robert Carlyle and Jason Isaacs). -The soundtrack is still amazing. -Gameplay remains mostly unchanged, though there is less emphasis on puzzle solving. -Good length, around 15-20 hours depending on how much secret hunting you engage in. -Lots of neat references to classic entries. -Dracula's castle offers some cool, varied areas. -Weapon mastery/skill tree system rewards experimentation and discourages 'spamming.'CONS: -Seamless world exploration is hurt by an incredibly weak map system.  Opening the map in the menu only lets you see a very small portion of the area you are in, and you can't cycle between them.  There are also a scant number of teleportation rooms, making backtracking quite painful. -Difficulty seemed all over the place.  I found most bosses very easy and generally struggled more with the regular enemy encounters. -The modern city you explore has that Gothic Castlevania feel to it, but unfortunately most of the areas are hard to differentiate. -Ending is rather abrupt and anti-climactic.As for the now infamous 'stealth' sections, I can safely say they have been completely overblown in just about every review.  Yes, they are by no means a good part of the game.  However they are very simple and account for less than 45 minutes or so of game time.  Don't let that be what sways your heart on the game.Although it has a few questionable design choices, for the most part I can give a positive recommendation for LOS2.  Arguably one of the best facets of the series is that each game brings something different to the table.  LOS was about the closest we've gotten to a (fun) 3D classic Castlevania, Mirror of Fate was more along the lines of a 2D SOTN/Circle of the Moon type game, and LOS2 was an attempt to merge the two.  None of them are perfect, but the series hasn't been this interesting in over a decade.  I look forward to whatever Mercury Steam does next, and we will see what future Castlevanias have in store for us.			"

												So first of all I didn't play the Castlevania series before which means I don't know anything about the GBA/Nintendo etc games.I bought Darksiders -which was in a bundle- and I realy fell in love with the game. Afterwards I got Darksiders 2 and after I finished it aswell I started to search for games which are alike. Someone told me about Castlevania: Lords of Shadows.So I started with Castlevania:LoS (Ultimate Edition) and it was one of the best expiriences I've ever had. The atmosphere, the fights, the mechanics (light/darkness) and the insanelly good music made this game a 9/10 for me. When I finished the game and closed the client I got an announcement by Steam about Castlevania:LoS2 and I was soooooooooo happy.I immediatelly bought it and when it was released, I immediatelly started it.The 1st thing was the ""Tutorial"" which was epic as♥♥♥♥♥♥ One of the greatest things in my opinion is the new usage of Light and Darkness which is splitt in new weapons (Sword/Gauntlet). I really liked the character development and how much the characters in the game actually changed.I'll be honest. After I played for about 1 hour I was really disappointed about the game. It didn't feel like the 1st LoS and something was missing. I felt that the story was really flat and -maybe- it was the new location which I felt were not fitting the game. And I stopped playing it.After some time passed I started the game again and realized it was the worst mistake ever to stop playing it. #######################SPOILER###########################It's amazing! I love how the game changes all the time. The timetravel and the changes in the locations are amazing. The story of the 1st LoS and LoS2 combine themself very well and makes a lot of sense. The story of LoS2 feels very flat but after I reach a certain point in the game my opinion changed completely. It pretty much change the whole point of view.One of my favourite parts is still the music in this game which fits perfectly.About the gameplay it's really simple to explain. The people who played the 1st LoS won't find many differences. You can still  find containers to increase your life/light/darkness. The 1st difference lies within the skilltree.

												Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2 is a cool game. Not the best, but cool.I was a Castlevania DS player, where on those Castlevanias you got lot of weapons and skills in contrast to Lords of Shadow 2 where you got only 3 weapons and it was my first time to encounter such a Castlevania ""gameplay"".Pros and cons listed below:Pros:-Awsome graphics engine. I got a bad GPU(Nvidia GeForce 9600M GT) and I run this game at highest setting+High Res Pack.-Open World. Two huge maps.-Storyline. Epic.-Hero upgradability. You can become the ultimate being.Cons:-Fast finish. Took me less than 24 hours.-No boss rush mode. We want it!!!-Few weapons. I mean it's a Castlevania. Not God of War. I have a whip, a sword and punches? Sequels mustn't copy that.Despite the Cons I like this game for the short time it took me to finish it and I will rate it good.I would recomend it to people who like to check new games and Castlevania fans.

												Fantastic game!   It absolutely lived up to all of my expectations, including the DLC.  It ended, for the most part, exactly how I would have wanted.  It is sad that Mercury Steam will most likely never work with the Lords of Shadow series again, but the story is at least complete and was well done from start to finish.  What more could a fan of great story-telling ask for?It does have some problems here and there, but if you are interested in it due to being a Lords of Shadow fan then your money will be well spent, since you are most likely here for the series' most accomplished attribute, it's lovingly crafted tale.  Otherwise, I suggest doing some more research on it, or maybe even trying the first two games (Don't forget Mirror of Fate) to see if the story grabs you.Either way, my final opinion on this game is that it is a finely polished piece of software that has phenomenal storytelling and an extremely well implemented combat system.  It suffers slightly from some odd gameplay design choices here and there that might be a bit off-putting to some, but this game did not get the attention, nor respect, that it truly deserved.  Hopefully, Mercury Steam will craft something in the future that is not so much the ""diamond in the rough"" that this game, and it's predecessors, ended up being.  Maybe something with a bit more mainstream appeal, i suppose?  I hope only the best for their future after having finished the Lords of Shadow series and am tentatively awaiting news of their next project.			"

												if you like the first game, then you will like the second game. the story wasnt anything to write home about, but it wasnt bad either. the combat was very fluid and easy to get the hang of. that said i have two complaints about the game. first is the stealth part of the game, which was often trial and error while dying over and over again trying to figure out what the game wanted me to do. these stealth parts were usually where i took a break from the game as dying over and over again was frustrating because there are no hints beyond the first couple of stealth puzzles. often times the solution involved using an ability in a way that was never talked about (such as the mist power can go through enemies). my second complaint was getting lost in other puzzles for pretty much the same exact reason (such as the revelations dlc you can use the wolf power while interacting with switches). both of these cases were ""oh i can do that?"" which would have been fine if they were explained better. overall due to its kind of dragged out short story, the stealth puzzles, and lack of information about some abilites involved in puzzles i would give this game a 7 out of 10.

												*Edit: When I first wrote the review, I was only almost done with the game, but now that I have seen it through to the end, I feel I have to amend a couple of my points, primarily with the story. The ending sucks. I won't spoil anything, but I must say it was quite a let down. Many unresolved questions and an unsatisfying end both in story and boss fight. It was easier than the first acolyte.Looking at this game from a completed perspective, even before my edit, I can say that this game had a lot of potential and good ideas, but from what I've read had a botched development. It shows because a lot of the game feels incomplete or like the developers rushed to finish what was left after some development troubles. It's really a shame and very disappointing.*I played the first Lords of Shadow and I enjoyed it. As for this one, I would say it's better in some areas and worse in others.COMBAT: Compared to the first, it feels like they really smoothed out the combat in terms of how you move around and perform moves. some difficulties become clearer when it comes to one mechanic though: the way some enemies block in this game. When some enemies are blocking, they stop your combo and deflect your attack and zero damage is done. This can get really annoying when there are multiple enemies and you are attacking one that is open, but the one right next to the first is blocking. it will stop your combo. This makes engagements with multiple blocking enemies really annoying unless you are really good with your chaos energy (it's like the shadow energy from the first game and it breaks through shield and armor). Multiple skeletons are the most annoying thing in this game... That said, thankfully those kinds of enemies don't show up terribly often, and combat can still be very fun now that it's smoothed out.STORY: Sadly, I would have to say the story in this game is inferior to the first overall. There is no longer an opening narration to each stage like their was in the first because of the way they made the map somewhat open world (I'll get into that further down). There are also seems to be less moments of significant plot progression throughout the game; a lot of times it feels as if you go a great distance just to get a small snippet of story. That said, one of the things that brought me back toward liking the game more were the story moments (they pick up more once you get a bit further) when you see the way Gabriel changes based on his interaction with the other characters. Some of them were very moving. Still, overall there just doesn't seem to be as much story as there was in the first game, and for Patrick Stewart in particular, it almost seems like a waste of his talent.VISUALS: For the most part, I'm going to say that this game's visuals are gorgeous. Very pretty and detailed environments. Not a lot of more vibrant environments like the first game, but they are still very detailed and pretty, especially when the game's graphics are turned up. However, i did say ""for the most part"" because some of the more industrial areas that you explore in the game, particularly the areas with a lot of pipes and wires going along the walls and cielings, are very dull and start to feel repetitive really quickly.MAP SYSTEM: I think they had a good idea when they started this game to give it a more open world feel, but ultimately the traveling around the map gets very tedious, especially when you are backtracking to find all the hidden upgrades, and again in the more industrial areas, it becomes easy to get lost and start traveling in circles when you are looking for certain areas.OVERALL I would say Lords of Shadow 2 is a decent game that you will enjoy for its beauty and decent combat system if you have the patience for the map and sometimes tedious battles with annoying enemies, but I would buy it when the price lowers. Also, if you have a choice, play the first Lords of Shadow before you play the second, it will make your experience with the second. The story will of course make more sense and be more enjoyable.

												Honestly, i was going through a lot of these reviews, expecially from fans of the first game, and i was surprised by how much negatives came here. So this review will be focused in comparing the two games (I played the first on X360) I will say that, only in my first 2 hours of gameplay, i felt comfortable to rely on the lore for my so expected ending of the story. And i need to point out that this is a great game, regardless of comparations with the first. Also, a lot of these reviews say negative stuff about the stealth moments, but i think it's good and important because you have to acompany the story, if Gabriel lost most of his power, how would he go against a creature of Satan? It's very important to the lore. And i cannot agree to you being a fan of the saga if you don't pay attention to the story. I feel like these moments show me that like in the first game, i had to become strong. Playing all the game with ultimate Dracula powers would be tiring, and most likely ruin the experience.As to graphics, my system is not the best, but what i've seen in my game and videos, it doesn't leave a lot to be wished.I really enjoyed the new mechanics of gameplay, especially Gabriel's (sorry, can't call him Dracula :////) new powers. this really feels like to play the first game, but much more complete than that. Something i dislike strongly is the new combat rythim, i can't get to use special attacks, because i'm 95% busy finding enough time to do so. Also, there are some times when you truly don't know what to do, and you have to perform some action too quickly. I found this very troublesome in some parts.And the camera, oh, the camera. That's something MUCH better than in the first game, when the camera was placed in map-specific locations, and also had the problem of having to stop to ajust your controls, since they were kept on camera changes (40% of camera changes). Now, it's something much more subtle, the camera is controlled by the player, and stays in a 2nd/3rd person view which receives some influence in a few map areas (but nothing that forces the camera on a spot or a too strong change. It feels better because now it gives me the immersion of exploring the world. And of course, this is better because now i feel rewarded for looking for a nice view and finding an amazing view. It's very balanced.I do recommend this game to everyone, best buy, worth all the money (altough i got it on a discount).Please feel free to add me or comment on my profile with any disagreements or suggestions to this review.I wished to give it 10/10, but the gameplay has a few artifacts in my point of view.8.5/10			"

There is no adjustments for the Mouse sensitivity and it is REALLY sensitive.    I may play it a bit more but I don't think I will change my mind about it.  It wasn't made for the PC and they put the littlest amount of effort that they could, they obviously didn't think ahead in the programming.  Unless they come out with an update that fixes these bugs, I think this game should just be sold for Gaming Consoles.			"

												Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is a solid entry for the series, delivering an intense, visually adventure. I liked the first one and I like this one too, the game is pretty good, but not perfect. The graphics, animation, voice acting, details are amazing, storytelling is not obvious and thrilling. However even gameplay is pretty the same to the previous Lords of Shadows, but it provides us with some new interesting gameplay mechanics like an ability to become a fog or the ability to freeze opponents.

												This game had a lot of promise but ultimately felt like a parody of itself. This game was loaded with recycled content including characters that shouldn't have been there - and game mechanics that were random and only served to draw the game out. The load screens were my favorite where Gabriel/Dracula stared thoughtfully into some candlelight while his inner dialogue summed up the most immediate objective. Soft, introspective piano music would play in the background. Then you the accept button and a slashing sound was followed by Gabriel glaring suddenly into the camera... It was over-the-top.The return of his wife Marie was a surprise and a happy one but they failed to tie her presence in to the over-arching arch. The ending was like watch an okay movie where they awkwardly avoid bring closure for the sake of making sequels that you already know are going to be bad. Its a little sad given how well this reboot started.			"

												Hm... I loved Lords of Shadow 1 so I had high hopes for this, but the meh reviews it got when it came out had me wait until I could pick it up on sale. Overall, the middling reviews were merited. Unlike the first one that let you opt out of puzzles if you didn't like them, the puzzles in this one are mandatory and annoying, a terrible combination indeed. The boss fights felt lackluster compared to the first one with none of them really reaching the intensity of the Titan battles or the Werewolf leader.The soundtrack is great and the game is a must play if you absolutely have to know how the LoS mythos comes to an end (Very anticlimatically, especially compared to the amazing setup from the first one), but it definitely felt like a chore a lot of the time.

												Overall a great game. Deviates a lot from the classic castlevania we all know and love but draws enough from the lore while giving unique insight into dracula's minions to create its own to be entertaining in its own right.  Graphically interesting, fantastic voice actors and great music round it out nicely.  Its not perfect, but most of the flaws that LoS2 suffers from is due to lazy porting from consoles.If you have a xbox controller  its strongly recommended to plug the sucker in, all the prompts and events are only shown as xbox controller buttons making its annoying and frustraiting at some intervals if you haven't memorized what keybind is what xbox promt. (Such as one of the devices you interact with early in the Toymaker's area, where you press B, X, or Y repeatedly with the buttons alternating now and then near randomly.)			"

Posted: September 1, 2014
												I'm going through my second playthrough now under Prince Of Darkness difficulty, and figured I'd write a bit of a review about the game itself.First off, I would have to agree with some people who have posted ""not recommended"" reviews on the game for a few reasons:  The primary being that the game itself feels entirely too short for it's own good.  In comparison to LoS1 where levels are abundant and the scenery constantly changing as you progress, LoS2 seems to rehash the same areas, in a similar fashion to that of Dragon Age 2.  You spend more time running through the same areas and just gives off a feeling of redundancy throughout the course of the game.  Sure, the areas are pretty huge, but when you need to run through the same areas repeatedly to progress it's more of an annoyance than anything.Groups of enemies seem to perfectly chain their ""undodgeable"" attacks to seemingly no end.  I'm up for a challenge, but when you're surrounded by a whole group of enemies it's extremtly annoying to constantly be chained from special to special.  Then again, I suppose that's how the NPCs feel so bit of karma I suppose.  The stealth sections truly are a bit annoying.  I understand that they're trying to incorporate a bit more than your run of the mill hack and slash, but there aren't multiple ways to approach them or to resolve them.  Not to mention that if you're spotted, you can pretty much expect to just restart from checkpoint; rarely is there a chance to regroup without taking massive damage.On to the good, as this overall is a recommendation for the game.  Overall, I have to say that I did quite enjoy the storyline, and being able to play as Alucard really gave me some flashbacks to some of the greatest games in the canon.  [Spoilers] The surprise appearance of another Belmont was quite good as well!  The combat system, while much has been leveraged from the first game I quite enjoyed, even if it was a bit repetitive.  There seems to be quite a large focus on countering in this game as opposed to its predecessor, which I don't mind personally.  The new abilities are quite interesting as well, and the upgrade/mastery system keeps you trying to use new attacks against the same enemies you encounter.All in all, I wouldn't agree with the Metascore rating as it does seem a bit low.  Sequels are always tough and when you have a title as solid as LoS1, it's hard to not play second fiddle.  Anyone who is a fan of the series I would think would like the game, and overall it's a good playthrough with the added Kleidos challenges.			"

												Horrible port from xbox to PC, it still includes the xbox controlls in the quite time events!!! But the developer does provide the F1 key which shows you what each key has been mapped too. This requires a fair bit amount of remembering durring hectic batles. The keys also change in menu which is a pain.Ignoring that, its a fantastic game with lots of imagination and epic boss batles.			"

												'Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2' isn't a good game... there I said it, it isn't good, but it is however, brilliant. The game seems to have this uncanny ability with me to make me keep wanting to come back for more (And I'm sure it's the same with many others) The Graphics are stunning and a pleasure to look at and each level seems to have been thought out in fantastic depth to provide the most fun for the person playing it.The gameplay is as smooth as the previous game in the 'Lords of Shadow' series. The fighting is smooth an as fun as ever, and the array of new moves (And old ones with a new twist) just add more enjoyability to the game and truely make you feel like the all-powerful vampire that Gabriel Belmont is.The story, as every is a pleasure to work through, with each character being able to snap your interest to them and not make you feel bored or fed up with the cutscenes. Lastly, something that deserves a mention, the boss battles in this game are just amazing, as fun as they look from the opening cutscene all the way to the end of it.In conclusion, I would certainly recommend that people buy this game and if you do, I hope you have as much fun with it as I do.

												A far better game then its previous game. It has better camera system with a improved combat system, which has finishing moves. Plus has less cutscenes so more time for playing, some ppl says the stealth bits are rubbish but there more like a puzzles to solve then stealth bits. if your a fan of the 1st game i would pick up you wont be disappointed!

												I liked the first and enjoyed this one even more, it's not anywhere as bad as reviews made it out to be but it's still pretty flawed. The combat is good but 80% of the moves you can buy you'll never use since the basic ones are good enough and there's no point in using anything else. The infamous stealth sections act as replacement for the puzzles from LOS1 (of which there are a grand total of 2 this time around) and are very short, few and far between - I don't really remember more than a handful during the entire 13 hour campaign - but at the same time add nothing to the game, they're just ""there."" If there's one thing I genuinely liked then it was the semi-open world which is very similar to the Batman Arkham series in that you head down a linear path but there's plenty of optional areas with collectibles/upgrades.The storyline is nothing special, and the ending itself is very underwhelming considering it was supposed to be the last installment in the franchise. During the last 2 hours the plot quickly rushes to the end as if developers ran out of time, having you repeat a very simple puzzle 3 times in between a series of cutscenes then fighting two final bosses in a row with nothing else in between. If they had cleaned up the combat system, gotten rid of the stealth sections, fixed the pacing issues at the end and put more thought into the storyline it could've been great, but in the end it's only slightly above average.

												Whoah what a ride‼️ 10 bonus points for most insane storyline, which stretches across the series entire lore. Another 5 bonus points for the treat of hearing Patrick Stewart voice one of the main characters!  I also think the use of a 'God of War' play style is a perfect fit for Castlevania as the whips fit into that combat system nicely. Overall I recommend this game. The boss fights weren't quite as epic as God of War, but the wild storyline more than makes up for it.			"

												A truly mixed bag. Great in some ways, horrible in others.PROS:-Good, fun combat-Great boss fights which are a lot of fun-Great graphics-Castle environments are fantasticCONS:-Terrible writing/story-Extremely 'samey' with LoS 1, right down to some of the exact same movesets with the whip. For a sequel that took 3 years to come out that's a little inexcusable.-Modern environments are bland. They're supposed to feel gothic-modern, almost like something out of V:tM, but instead they just feel like they were ripped right out of Darksiders.-Some stealth sections are bad. Others are fairly straight forward and just serve as puzzles.The medeival setting of the first game worked so well, they should have continued it in this game.			"

												I wouldn't necessarily consider this game to be an upgrade to the first one.  While it had it moments, which for the most part came from the storyline, I was disappointed by the open world concept that was completely hyped by marketing.  Of course if you love mazes, I say go for it!  The game play was another upgrade, as far as controlling Gabriel Belmont is concerned.  The different powers that you pick up during the game add a fun challenge to break up the hack-and-slash that the first game depended too much on.  I think, unfortunately, that the developers listened to too many people while they were in the creative process, and it caused a bit of a mess.  Overall, I still liked the game, though I would have just as impressed if it was simply a movie.			"

												When I first saw the reviews come out for this game I was a little worried, though I did really enjoy the first Lords of Shadow a few years back. Bought the game anyway and surprise, it's the reviewers being crap at games and reviewing again. LoS2 is, like LoS1, a game that takes the best parts of various action games like God of War and it works out great as a result. Dracula is a great choice for a protagonist and is made a much better character than his main Castlevania counterpart in both abilities and personality. The story isn't too weak either, it's there, it does the job so you can't complain either.A lot of complains were aimed towards the stealth sections in the game, sure this seems like an odd decision but it works, and despite what reviewers say, it's not as inhumanly hard or excessive as they say. There's probably 5 stealth sections overall, they're all incredibly brief and are there to act as a bit of variety to prevent fatigue from constant fighting smaller enemies. Although it is easy to see why reviewers proclaimed the stealth section involving Agreus as the scourge of gaming, it requires you to use multiple skills you have gained so far, but the game doesn't tell you. Thinking is too hard for reviewers after all.Overall, Lords of Shadow 2 is a solid game and definitely deserved a better reception than what it got.			"

												I have played the game for 5 hours. I haven't made too much progress. If I would have listened to all the reviews I read I wouldn't have purchased this game! I went out on a limb and purchased for PC. Castlevania: LOS2 is a mixture of Darksiders 2, and the God of War Series! However, this game is very story driven! At the beginning of the game it can be a little off putting when you have to do the things in stealth mode. However, from my perceptive it's okay because I am into the story, Zobek even tells you that you are not up to strength. However, as I stated I am biased. I would encourage the fan base to get the game. I find it worth it, I like games that pull me in....this is one of those games.			"

												This was my first Castlevania game so I went in not really knowing what to expect. First of all, the combat's fun, not played many hack'n'slash games and this made me wonder why, it's incredibly satisfying pulling off that perfect combo right after a successful synchronized block. Only real criticism I have of the combat is that there's not much of an incentive to try the special moves. When a game's this simple to beat and the enemies aren't overly difficult, nothing really forces you to have to pull off the special attacks, and you find yourself halfway through wondering if you're really getting the full experience because of your lack of variation in how you play combat-wise. Can't really comment on the exploration, as I've really no idea what makes someone want to explore a game world, some open worlds make you want to explore - some don't. I have no idea if it's to do with art style or hidden secrets, but I definitely wanted to explore the castle and find every secret there was to find, found myself spending hours just exploring different areas. Graphics-wise, this game looks amazing - found myself pressing F12 way more than I probably should have been, and I've changed my desktop to different screenshots about 5 times since I bought this game. The gothic architecture of the castle really gives the developers a chance to pull off some of the most stunning scenes, last-gen ports have never looked so good. Although I've never played the first LoS, I kinda felt myself wondering how great this game would be if it had the same setting, medieval Europe. I really dreaded the modern day parts of the game, the city was boring - everything looked the same, spent most of it hoping I'd see another castle sequence soon. Voice acting was great, can't really go wrong with a cast like Richard Madden, Robert Carlyle and Patrick Stewart, although when voice actors so famous play roles you can't help but see them as the actor as opposed to the character, because you've heard their voice so many times before. Characterisation wasn't the best, I wanted to see a Dracula that didn't start tearing up everytime he was reminded of his past, and he didn't really develop much throughout the story. Not going to go too into depth about stealth, all I'm going to say is that it was terrible and I'm glad it wasn't more prominent in the game. Story-wise, this game's brilliant, sometimes when the combat became a bit too repetitive and I was stuck in the city knowing I wouldn't see another medieval-esque area for a while, I was just hoping another cutscene would occur. The whole father-son dynamic between Trevor and Gabriel was really well-written and enjoyable to listen to, and although I complained about him being too emotional, I really liked the parts that Gabriel's human side showed in the scenes with his family. Boss fights were one of my favourite parts of the game, it was different every time and it forced you to adapt to the situation as opposed to just hitting and dodging, only criticism is that the dialogue during the fights could be improved as I heard the same line over 50 times when fighting some bosses. Can't really think of any other elements of the game to comment on. Overall I'd say this game is definitely worth getting - not got much replayability but the first playthrough is worth the money. Despite its many drawbacks like stealth and poor setting - the art style, voice acting, combat and story do more than enough to make up for it.			"

												Not without its faults, but still quite enjoyable.After playing the full game. I certainly do not feel it deseved such low critic scores. Are there some issues, of course. But on the whole, I still had fun with it, and that's what it all boils down to. If you want some handy bullet points on the matter:Pros:* Combat is very fluid, and there are a number of attacks and options at your disposal* The Boss battles are the real showstoppers in terms of granduer and excitement, and are the high points of the game, and each one of them is unique.* Platforming is also very fast and has definitely been streamlined from the original* The Castle setting is simply beautiful and really makes the player want to explore it* Game is super optimized and runs amazingly well on most machines. Played at 1080p with all settings maxed at a constant 60fps* The musical score is just so well put together and a treat to listen to, fitting the action on screen perfectlyCons:* The game starts off slow after the prologue, focusing a lot on the modern day section* The modern day section is sadly lacking in terms of creativity and imagination. Was expecting something more unique from a modern day Satanic laboratory (especially compared to Frankenstein's Lab or the Toymakers Workshop from the previous games) for instance. * Most time in the modern day is spent underground or in corridors, opposed to the more visually pleasing areas such as the Arts District.* The Stealth sections needed more variety to be interesting, or should have been limited to just a few segments. Though they still only take a few minutes to do. Too much of a big deal was made about one stealth segment in particular, only because people forgot about the handy Mist ability.* The ending is somewhat inconclusive and the final segment leading up to it lacks any real sense of build up.

												Just finished the game and at 16 hours in length (Not completing it 100% but finishing the story and unlocking a good number of the skills) I'll say that I really enjoyed it. I was surprised how much I enjoyed the first game (buying it on 360 and PC), so I was just stoked to have a fully-blown sequel to it. It plays well, combat feels solid, and some of the fights are challenging, and I can think of only one part of the game where I almost ALMOST gave up, which was Agreas' maze, but I can forgive it because overall this is probably the best £30  I've spent on a game since... the first game. For me, I'm just in it for the story, and having played both its sequels, it feels nice and tight to the storyline it set out to tell. Very entertaining and now I'm sure my wife would like to have some of my time back in the evenings.			"

												What can I say?  I loved the first game.  I felt they did a great job rebooting the series and breathing new life into it.  While I loved the old games story wise they sucked.  Even lament of innocence which was great and tried its best to explain the belmont & dracula feud still lacked a little bit.  Now Lord of Shadow did a great job of really giving that belmont dracula feud a purpose and reason.  This game picks up right from the first game and really starts to breath life into dracula and with great story telling elements and voice acting really connects the players to dracula and kinda makes us question is her really that bad.  Maybe he has a good reason for being♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥People will pick apart the game play and the stealth mode.  I didn't enjoy the stealth mode but I did enjoy the combat system and loved using his new powers.  I loved the leveling up of the weapons and skills.  The items you pick up on the way I felt were just wasted I never used anyone of them expect of the health potion.The environment was good.  I enjoyed my time in the Castle but didn't care for the modern world.The important question is should I buy this game?  I think so but not at the full price.  The reason why is because of the ending.  The game really built things up with scenes of Dracula kinda coming back into the light and forgiving himself and redeeming himself in his own eyes.  This was great and really connected me to him even more.  The ending just kinda flopped there like a fish out of water.  It didn't wrap anything up or raise any question of whats next like the last game.  It was disappointing.  The fight with satan wasn't as tough as it was in the first one.  I kept thinking to myself he got beat the last time hit the gym and came back buff, but his old cross fitter body was better.  They need to give this game a proper ending if this really is the final game.  If they don't then all of that great work to just end on a bad note.So final thought great story, but buy at half price due to the lack of a ending.			"

												The game received unjust hate from many reviewers, citing poor story, stealth mechanism and not being open world enough.Now, if you liked the first Lords of Shadow, there is no reason not to like this second instalment. If, on the other hand, you are a fan of the old series (e.g: Symphony of the Night) then you probably didn't liked the first game and you shouldn't bother with this one. The name ""Castlevania"" is the only common ground between the old series and the reboot.The story isn't memorable, but it is decent and it does its job. Also, the Castlevania series wasn't necessary about story. What you have in Lords of Shadows 1 and 2 is great pretext for an action game.The artistic direction is more dark now and this is understandable since Gabriel turned into the evil Dracula. I am not a fan of the modern setting and I prefer the castle sections which look terrific.The stealth part of the game does seem weird but it's not game breaking as it was stated by the critics. Blame it on a poor game design decision that doesn't quite blend in with the setting.The gameplay is solid and the nice feature, called mastery, encourages you to use all the moves from your arsenal. Successfully using a skill in combat increases its mastery. Once it reaches 100%, you can improve your weapon by transfering the mastery of the skill.A minimap has been added to help exploring and find secrets. The old life and magic gems are back in the form of pain boxes. You can still find more about the lore by reading the journals of the fallen soldiers of the Brotherhood.You can and will return to previously visited areas.This is done better than the previous game, where you had to return to the map overview and select a completed level. Here you simply transition between areas. It's not sandbox, but there is a sense of continuity.To sum it up, Lords of Shadow 2 is good action/combat game, with an excellent artistic direction, nice voice acting and a story that helps you move forward. It's not a classic but it never wanted to be one. Definitely this is not a terrible game as the game critics want you to believe for whatever reasons.			"

												Having been pleasantly surprised by just how good the orginal lords of shadows was, it's fair to say that my expectations for its  sequel were fairly high and nearly four years  later, we have lords of shadow 2 and with it, two questions which roughly translate to: ""Is this game a worthy sequel to the orginal"" and ""should I buy it? In answer to the first question, my answer would be, for the most part, yes it is. The reason why I say for the most part is because while I think that los2 is a genuinely good game, I feel that it falls just short of matching the greatness of the orginal. The main reason why I think this is, is because los2 is a game of two halves. On the one half you have the exploration of draculas castle, which to say the least is huge and the medieval gothic  architecture as well as the unique characters and enemies that inhabit the prince of darkness's home. For me, this is where the game truly shines as it is this part of the game that seems to embody both the aesthetics and quality of the first game. The other half of this game involves navigating through a modern day setting, which I'm afraid to say is where this game falters. The main reason for this is because while the modern envioments are competently enough designed from a gameplay perspective, they lack any kind of personality and uniqueness of their own to make them memorable or even particularly interesting enough to warrent further exploration beyond the main game. Indeed, aside from the boss battles that take place in these locations and the stealth sections (The latter of which I actually quite enjoyed, contrary to popular opinion!) I found most of my time spent in the modern setting to be fairly forgettable,  especially when compared to the parts that take place in Draculas castle, and ultimately hold the game back from being truly on par with the first game. In answer to the second question as to whether the game is worth buying, my answer would be that if you enjoyed the original los then I defiantly believe that this game is worth buying. If you've never played the original but like God Of War style hack and slah games then I would also recomend this title as being a worthy purchase. In short, I would say that if you liked the original los then the odds are that you'll probably like this game as well. In conclusion, If I had to give the first game a score out of ten, then I would probably give it an 8. With this game, I feel that a 7 would be more appropriate.			"

												While not quite what I'd wanted after the first game in the series (and Mirror of Fate,) this is a good place for a semi-closing chapter.  Without any spoilers, a lot has happened since Gabriel Belmont originally set out to kill the Lords of Shadow and Do Good Things.  And this is a worthy addition to that story.  But what we see here is literally centuries after everything that happens in the other two games, and that gap feels kinda weird.  I suppose it's all explained via flashbacks and things, but even still.Lords of Shadow 2 improves on anything the first game did that needed improving, while not messing with 95% of the things about that game that worked great already.  And it THANKFULLY brings back one continuous world that you can explore as you see fit.  Physically walking back to an area with a new power to get a thing you saw but couldn't reach makes sense; selecting an earlier chapter from a menu in the first game, and running into characters and even bosses that are already DEAD... not so much.That said, the tone of the two games is much different.  This one doesn't ride on Hope so much.  Some might like the darker story, but personally I thought that it was a little somber and depressing at times.  It was all well told, and Robert Carlyle and Patrick Stewart knocked their roles out of the park, but I think that the darker universe just kinda took a toll on things.  We'll be visiting different environments, but gone are the sunny paths, baked desert-scapes, and clear skied mountain fortresses of the first game.  Here you get plenty of variety, with stormy locales, night cityscapes, fiery caverns, frozen mountainsides... but you'll never be doing anything during the day.  That's understandable, as Story Reasons require you to get everything done in one night.  And hell, Castlevania games usually all happen indoors, in one night, IN Dracula's Castle, so I can't fault it too much for grim, darkness.Powers work better in this game than the first.  Alternate weapons/magic/sub-weapons, all that stuff is great.  In the first game, I found myself doing everything with the whip, and never bothering to use my daggers, fairies, or dark crystal.  I used Holy Water to deal with BS waves that got boring, but when I used sub weapons or items here, it was all strategic and useful.  Especially in the Kleidos Challenges.Kleidos Challenges are unlockable (and thankfully optional) challenges that put you in a circular area with various enemies.  And there are three objectives, different to each challenge.  You might get, say, don't break any shields, don't use the Void Sword, and don't recover health by any means during the fight.  There's always the same 4th objective: do all three in the same run.  I did more than half of these before I got annoyed, and then just stopped.  For the super-hardcore, this is your kind of thing.Collectables are EVERYWHERE!  Kinda literally.  I've found 3 or 4 things in the SAME ROOM, sometimes I needed different powers for each... and sometimes when you find the first collectable, it's actually only half-way down a secret path, and going just a little farther will find you a hand-hold to climb or sneak or do something to get to another.  I liked that, using one power-up as a distraction so you'll think you've got it and miss out on the next one.Speaking of those collectible powerups, the come from two major things: Pain Boxes and Piles of Sacrifice.  The Pain Box is a box with a mouth that cuts or stabs your wrist when you stick your hand in, but then you get a Health, Void, or Chaos shard to raise your HP or Void or Chaos magics!  The Pile of Sacrifice is a little statue of a dude with a big curved sword over his shoulder, and you slice your wrist on it, bleed a LOT into the bowl beneath it, and then the bowl gives you either a capacity upgrade for 5 of your 6 relics or a Kleidos Nail, to get them Kleidos Challenges unlocked.  Don't worry if hunting for all this sounds annoying: you can pick up or shop for Dodo Eggs, and using one will mark the nearest collectible on your map.  It was fun for me hunting these down, though I did Dodo around... 15 of the game's nearly 200, just because I was at the end and wanted to get everything before I hit the last area.Some people say that the bosses here aren't as good as the first game.  True, for the most part, but at the same time not true.  They're very different.  The first game's bosses were huge and awesome, but had some HIGHLY scripted ways to beat them, and most ended in a series of Quick Timing Events.  Here it's more a real fight, relying on your gameplay skills.  QTEs have been dialed back A LOT from the first game.  Lords of Shadow 1 must have something like 800% as many as this one does.So I'll conclude here saying that this is a solid game with a cool story, and voice acting from two guys who do very good work.  Definitely, without question worth a buy on sale, and honestly even worth a buy at normal price if you're into Castlevania stuff.  But as a caveat, you might want to get the first game and Mirror of Fate HD first, as this is one epic overarching story, and though they do a pretty good recap at the beginning here, you want to be attached to the characters and the world first.  It makes this much more powerful.Here's hoping they make the intended third and final game, and round everything out as incredibly as I hope.			"

												First things first, I LOVE the art design of the whole game, they're really masters when it comes to imaging how Dracula Castle would look like, sound its also very good, music its good, visually its ok too. Now for a Castlevania game it lacks a lot from other games, including handheld versions (GBA/NDS). Game lacks collectibles, gear to improve you status, weapons, etcGameplay its ok but having so many attack combos can be too overwhelming, most of the time you'll use only use 2 or 3 combos for the whip and sword, I barely used the shadow claws (except when required by the game). It might be my bad memory but I found myself checking too many times how to make that cool looking combo I just unlocked and not so much time using it cause you can beat the game without it. Controls are fine but a few times they can get very frustrating, camera its also a bit frustrating since there is no way to lock your attacks to an enemy and the game will try to ""auto aim"" your attacks to the closest enemy but always the one you don't mean to attack. Collectibles are a bit boring, scrolls that try to complete the story and tell you parts of it that are not currently happening in game. You (Dracula) feel like the less powerful Dracula from the saga and the stealth sections of the game make no sense for a Castlevania game. Overall its a good game, not so much a good Castlevania. Definitely an improvement over the first LoS. I'll only recommend it if you don't mind a short game with almost no replay value and very little exploration like in past Castlevania games and you are a ""true"" Castlevania Fan 7/10			"

												If Steam's rating system was stars, I would give this one three of them. It has beautiful graphics, optimized perfectly for a PC (even when the commands displayed are always Xbox 360's ones and you have to get used to them if you're playing with a keyboard and mouse) as it works like a charm on a Pavilion DV6 one. Music is the best part of the product, as cinematics are too (running 99% of the times fully real time)... but all the mythological themes, magic, settings and others that make a Castlevania game a Castlevania game are far away gone to present a more contemporary, darker, story. Character development is way better than the first game, but storytelling is not as solid as it could be. Gameplay feels amazing all the time, but I recommend using a guide if you don't want to get lost and wander for hours sometimes. Feels rock solid, but if you're expecting a Castlevania game you might not like this one at all as it feels a lot more like a Devil May Cry game now. Buy wisely.			"

												Even as a PC game, this game revolves around being played with an XBOX gamepad... To do this, you must use A button, in order to perform this action, you must use the B button, to break free of this boss' freezelike attack, use this random button, to perform a killing combo on same boss, use another random button... How in the hell do you get into the game, if it presents everything in the light of a gamepad, even if it is played with mouse and keyboard?

												This game improved a lot from the first game:- the combat is much more fluid and fun to play;- now it's possible to explore all the map whenever I want instead of playing through stages;- linking the story with another well-known Castlevania game was a good surprise! Overall, it`s good... until the ending.Altough it suffered an upgrade, this game have a few issues (SPOILER ALERT!!):- In comparison to the first game's DLC, I had to avoid been seen by the last boss for his powers were too great - he could melt me in a instant; there was a danger, a reason to hide... but in this game I had to play through a stupid hide-and-seek minigame for no reason before fighting two bosses; neither I nor them got stronger/weaker or the place before the fight buffed them or myself just before the fight so WHY the combat couldn't have started as soon as I saw them? Seriously, give me a good reason to hide from them!- the ending from the main story (I didn`t played the DLC yet) was... stupidly annoying at least. You defeat the last boss by almost killing your partner and then you`re free to do whatever cr@p you wanted but oh, the sun is rising so I guess its time for bed. In conclusion:YOU DEFEAT THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS, FREEING MANKIND FROM ALL EVIL AND YOU REWARD YOURSELF... with a nap.This ending was indeed a miserable pile of sh!t.Altought the story reaches its stupid ending, the game itself is very good. 8/10			"

												To preface: I came into this game off the expectations of the first Lords of Shadow, which I found to be one of the most worthwhile plays of the generation, marred only by the disconnect between cut-scene plot and loading screen plot (the former I chose to ignore for the much greater depth and intrigue of the latter). The way the last game ended, the trailer involving the castle siege, the unique universe and artistic style the game takes place in; how could they go wrong?And at first, it seemed like they'd made another great game (just like the first, which also came out to muted-to-mediocre reception but would prove to be a stellar experience). Even beyond the introduction sequence, with the lackluster stealth, linearity and meagerness of the city, it stilled promised to be much more, at least to me.For as long as I could, I held onto the concept that, at worst, it could be a poorly executed great concept; it kept sliding further and further away from that great concept ideal, to be expected of something coming from such a high plateu with too much expectation; a fault of my own if anything.What was dreadful about this game, however, was not its inability to match the former game's great expectations: it was unbelievably poor direction the plot lurches towards the mid-to-end of the game. In almost complete contrast to Lords of Shadow, which started off slow, picked up speed and took off into orbit: this game started off in orbit, slowed down and instead of just falling to the ground, somehow fell into a wormhole that took it straight into the jaws of a black hole where it went full-on Event Horizon.Give this game a massive miss; play the first and imagine what could have been, don't make the mistake that I did and assume the reviews were just a repeat of the first on release, of fans of Castlevania of old and this game just didn't live up to their rose-tinted rememberance of easiers times, and those who refused to do anything but accuse it of being a God of War clone, when it was so much more.In short, this game represents a tragedy in what could have been, of which I am saddened to have been a part of.

												As a fan of castlevania ever since SotN I have to say this one is a mixed bag. When it hits its stride it is an absolute amazing Castlevania game. It's weaker spots are very bland and dull. What I'm referring to is the point you play in the present period. As a Castlevania fan would come to expect, the present day is completely out of element for this series. But there are times when you play in the past and let me tell you those are what make the game amazing. The story telling is good and if you are a fan of the previous Lords of Shadow games I would recommend it.			"

												The game received unjust hate from many reviewers, citing poor story, stealth mechanism and not being open world enough.Now, if you liked the first Lords of Shadow, there is no reason not to like this second instalment. If, on the other hand, you are a fan of the old series (e.g: Symphony of the Night) then you probably didn't liked the first game and you shouldn't bother with this one. The name ""Castlevania"" is the only common ground between the old series and the reboot.The story isn't memorable, but it is decent and it does its job. Also, the Castlevania series wasn't necessary about story. What you have in Lords of Shadows 1 and 2 is great pretext for an action game.The artistic direction is more dark now and this is understandable since Gabriel turned into the evil Dracula. I am not a fan of the modern setting and I prefer the castle sections which look terrific.The stealth part of the game does seem weird but it's not game breaking as it was stated by the critics. Blame it on a poor game design decision that doesn't quite blend in with the setting.The gameplay is solid and the nice feature, called mastery, encourages you to use all the moves from your arsenal. Successfully using a skill in combat increases its mastery. Once it reaches 100%, you can improve your weapon by transfering the mastery of the skill.A minimap has been added to help exploring and find secrets. The old life and magic gems are back in the form of pain boxes. You can still find more about the lore by reading the journals of the fallen soldiers of the Brotherhood.You can and will return to previously visited areas.This is done better than the previous game, where you had to return to the map overview and select a completed level. Here you simply transition between areas. It's not sandbox, but there is a sense of continuity.To sum it up, Lords of Shadow 2 is good action/combat game, with an excellent artistic direction, nice voice acting and a story that helps you move forward. It's not a classic but it never wanted to be one. Definitely this is not a terrible game as the game critics want you to believe for whatever reasons.			"

												Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2 is a cool game. Not the best, but cool.I was a Castlevania DS player, where on those Castlevanias you got lot of weapons and skills in contrast to Lords of Shadow 2 where you got only 3 weapons and it was my first time to encounter such a Castlevania ""gameplay"".Pros and cons listed below:Pros:-Awsome graphics engine. I got a bad GPU(Nvidia GeForce 9600M GT) and I run this game at highest setting+High Res Pack.-Open World. Two huge maps.-Storyline. Epic.-Hero upgradability. You can become the ultimate being.Cons:-Fast finish. Took me less than 24 hours.-No boss rush mode. We want it!!!-Few weapons. I mean it's a Castlevania. Not God of War. I have a whip, a sword and punches? Sequels mustn't copy that.Despite the Cons I like this game for the short time it took me to finish it and I will rate it good.I would recomend it to people who like to check new games and Castlevania fans.

												I have played the game for 5 hours. I haven't made too much progress. If I would have listened to all the reviews I read I wouldn't have purchased this game! I went out on a limb and purchased for PC. Castlevania: LOS2 is a mixture of Darksiders 2, and the God of War Series! However, this game is very story driven! At the beginning of the game it can be a little off putting when you have to do the things in stealth mode. However, from my perceptive it's okay because I am into the story, Zobek even tells you that you are not up to strength. However, as I stated I am biased. I would encourage the fan base to get the game. I find it worth it, I like games that pull me in....this is one of those games.			"

												Let me be clear...this is a flawed game.  I can't help but mention that because of the potential it had.  Art direction and presentation is grand.  Music is immersive.  The combat makes you feel in control at most times, save when your striking foes and they strike through your blows, and knock you down.    The biggest complaint I have with this game is the stealth portion and poorly designed platforming.  Both are irritating, boring, and distracts from the overall experience.  If the stealth portion were implemented better, with clearer directions on where to go, what to do, who to possess etc, things might have been different.  The platforming at times is ackward, and just feels again, like a distractor from combat.  In the end, I love the script, I love the art/graphical presentation, and I love the combat.  I just wished the rest of the game felt more complete.			"

												Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2... Where to begin... Well for starters the game wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. It was about twice as good as my original expectations... so that's not really saying much.Pros: Better graphics, same great voice acting, good combat system and a lot of skills to learn that had great animations.Cons: Story wasn't all that great (atleast compared to the first..), bosses were way too easy, the timed events and finishers on bosses were weak and nothing like the first game.If it wasn't for the fact that the story needed to make sense I'd say this game should have come out before the 1st LoS because it just does not compare to the first. All in all though... the game is definitely worth playing. Just come in with low expectations.			"

												A nice sequel to lords of shadow, though it feels very different.Combat has been refined from lords of shadow, instead of light and dark magic you have two new weapons that change things up in a nice way. It really adds to the fantasy of being Dracula. You can now block while in the air and that is a nice change. You can suck blood, you use a blood whip....it's good.My only complaint with the combat is that it takes a long time to upgrade your moves as each different weapon has combos and many end up being very similar. I felt forced to repeat a few canned moves at times just to level up my weapons at times.Boss fights are all pretty great, though I did feel the ending was a bit of let down. No spoliers but the last boss was not all it was hyped up to be.Story is alright, you do get to jump between some castle levels and city levels. To be honest the city levels did feel very strange and while some of the structures and areas evoked a sense of older Castlevania themes...it just didn't really do it for me. I would rather have had eveyrthing in an older setting.I found the game enjoyable though, and would recommend a play through.			"

												An impressive game that kept me entertained, and if not for having a lot on my plate actually gives merit for further play even after main story is over, to collect and complete some more challenges. The environments is breathtaking and it is a well executed experience where, besides a few annoyances due to stealth elements (A certain guard type you for some reason never get to face head-on), you will have a blast. Plenty of things to do and a fine combat system makes this a game worth buying, even if you are not actually into Castlevania, this can be enjoyed on its own. Of course knowing the other games adds to the enjoyment, but is by no means required, as you will be given introduction to all elements. The game works great with keyboard and mouse, though every button prompt is sadly only shown for a gamepad.			"

												To be perfectly honest, if you want more Lords of Shadow, you're better off replaying the first game.I feel this one really missed the mark, and after reading about the internal struggles of the development team and their near-constant battle with their director, I can say I'm not really surprised.Lords of Shadow 2 is, in every way, inferior to its predecessor. Graphically, it fails to impress. Mechanically, it feels sloppy. The combat is frustrating and choppy and, while LoS1 had its fair share of controller-throwing platforming segments, LoS2 doesn't even justify its own such moments with an equal helping of fun, satisfying ones. I have only put a couple hours into the game so far, and already I'm mad at it. I cannot comment on the overall story yet, but the beginning feels rushed and strange, and I have to feel bad for Patrick Stewart being forced to deliver such a petty script as Zobek. The writing is childish and uninspired, and the semi-animated lore sequence explaining the Belmont lineage is utterly boring.But you know, I could forgive all of that if the game didn't so completely miss its own point. At no time during play did I ever FEEL like Dracula, who is supposed to be an absolute powerhouse, combining strength, speed, and magical abilities to devastate ranks upon ranks of foes. The most basic of enemies can take a monumental beating from any of your weapons, and can even attack straight through your combos to strike you. One minor strike from an enemy, however, will interrupt your combo and send you flying, which makes your stature feel pitiful, even if you aren't taking significant damage from those attacks. These problems are only magnified and exacerbated when, after the tutorial sequence, the story fast-forwards some centuries and resets all of Gabriel's powers, requiring you to slowly unlock them, one by one.Other games have successfully portrayed their protagonists as extremely powerful beings without robbing the game of its core challenge. A great case in point is Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine. Lords of Shadow 2, however, takes the legendary Dracula and nerfs him into the ground, and then poops all over him with bad gameplay mechanics.I'll say it again: if you want more LoS, play the first game again, because you'll enjoy it a whole lot more.

												It starts out by being really bad SOTN fanservice. But it could be an all right game, right?Then there's a stealth section. It's bad. The rest of the gameplay is somewhere between abysmal and decent but most of the time errs towards the former.The story also doesn't really make all too much sense. Not like you should care about the story in a Castlevania game. Kill Dracula basically. Even in this game where you are Dracula your goal is to kill Dracula. And that's cool, I can roll with that. But the further it progresses the more it falls apart. It tries too hard to make its story matter to just allow one shrug it off as an excuse plot for AWESOME GAMEPLAY and the gameplay isn't awesome anyway so that doesn't matter.Much like the first Lords of Shadow this game just fails to capture the Castlevania atmosphere. But at least the first game was more consistently decent and could be enjoyed if you just pretended it wasn't Castlevania. This does not work for Lords of Shadow 2.""lol alucard"" out of 10			"

												You should know what you're getting into if you buy this not on sale.  It doesnt hold a candle to the original although it is still enjoyable.  Here is what you're getting:-No Patrick Stewart narration (before levels)-musical score does not live up to the original-TERRIBLE camera, may be better with a controller I do not know I'm used to keyboard-Weird futuristic setting (Gaberial somehow knows what a corporation is and knows how to work an elevator? c'mon now)minor spoiler:The fact the Gabe has the same outfit for the future and the past really killed the immersion for me.  Zobek gets a suit why doesn't Gabe? or shall I say Dracula.  Wouldn't a traditional Dracula tux really fit the bill for the future levels? just my 2 centsdespite all this I'm recommending it because the gameplay is enjoyable and you know you gotta finish after that cliffhanger at the end of LOS.  Just get it on sale, don't be impulsive like me and pay full price.			"

												Once again i dont know why this game is so badly viewed. It does not have the same feel as the first LOS, but it has its own merit for being something else. The game is absolutly beautiful, as i  have seen other praised games with a lot ugglier graphics.The maps/places have a bit of the same feel sadly, but i guess that is due to the theme. It could have had some variation, but make no mistake, they are incredibly well detailed and the art behind it is amazing, from the way characters look to the places themselves.Bosses are cool, but a bit too many of the same enemies.Both in LOS and LOS2 the soundtracks are so good.The story could have been a bit more complex and ther plot a bit different , but overall its ok Still it leaves a mark and it is something fans of the genre will like, personaly i love it.

												Don't let my play time fool you. I beat this game and I can tell you it's worth playing. The story is a wonderful dark tale that'll make you jump, smile and cry. Dracula is in the present and at the bottom of his own chain. You travel between the real world and Dracula's twisted mind trying to regain your powers, your memories, and ultimatley prevent Satan's return! an insane mix of contextual stealth, transformation, wicked hack and slash combat, as well as puzzle solving, this is an adventure for the ages, be it for a long time fan or new comers who just wanna feel like a badass vampire.

												This game clocked in just under roughly 15 hours or so. I'd say it's worth 20-30$ when you pick it up. If you played the first castlevania game (the one prior to this - not necissarily all the previous titles) you will find the gameplay to be really similar in style. The storyline is obviously linked though different and the opening gameplay scene was pretty intense and ties all back later in the end of the game. Overall I enjoyed this, though admittedly I didn't go above and beyond with completionist. I finished the main storyline completely and gameplay said 53% complete, so there's plenty of side stuff if you're into that sorta thing. Overall fun, and I'd probably play the next title if they put one out.			"

												A great Castlevania game and a great sequel to the first Lords of Shadow. Even outside of its own series, this game is worth a recommendation, as it can easily appeal to you if you've enjoyed games with similar gameplay like Devil May Cry or God of War.While some aspects like the stealth puzzles or the metroidvania-esque level design may be divisive, the game features a uniquely satisfying, visceral combat system with finely-tuned fights and excellent controls. The game's difficulty modes are well balanced with a good challenge waiting for you on the higher two settings. The presentation is fantastic—all the graphics, music, sound effects, and amazing gothic-styled vistas mesh together perfectly to create a haunting and memorable atmosphere. The length of the game is equally impressive for a game in this genre, easily clocking in at over 20 hours just to finish the story.			"

												At first, I was a bit miffed by the fact that this game becomes anachronistic (Brotherhood version of Liberty Prime], Gabriel in the future), but the story ties it together nicely and it fits together with the in-game lore. The game itself is played out across two worlds (the ""mission"" world and Gabriel's Castle). Both worlds are free-roam and you can backtrack as needed to explore or to get items previously missed.Pros:- Option in menu to turn off QTEs. This made the first game really annoying with the constant QTE prompts; now it's optional.- Great story.- Fantastic soundtrack.- Combat is more streamlined with upgrades. The mastery system forces you to change up your attacks so you get to use all the combat moves.Cons:- Lack of puzzles (I enjoyed the puzzles from the first game).- Lots of backtracking (re-exploring and getting items from areas already explored).- Modern setting sometimes feels un-Castlevania like.

There is some backtracking when you get new abilities, but its common in these types of games. The fighting is fun and fluid. There is enough completionist things to do to add at least 10 more hours: puzzles, finding things, battle challenges, etc. There is also the DLC, which i will wait for a steam sale to get.			"

												Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is an awesome game and the classic example of what's wrong with Metacritic. A 58 out of 100 seems awfully low for a game that plays so well, that I'm baffled by the hatred it gets from critics. Or, perhaps, the way Metacritic aggregates review scores is the problem? A single negative review can make that score right there plummet and provide extreme misinformation on an otherwise great game!Lords of Shadow 2 does a few things quite well. First, it removes the stupid locked camera. Second, it has easy to learn combos that the game outright encourages you to use via the ""mastery"" system. Third, it has far more gothic scenery and themes that pay a deep homage to Castlevania in general. Fourth, the graphics are absolutely beautiful yet they run at 60 frames per second. Fifth, the bosses are incredible. Sixth, there's a ton of secrets and for the most part you are encouraged to explore at your leisure between objectives. Those are the six key aspects I can think of, besides the music, voiceacting, and controls being stellar as well. The story can be confusing, but it's the most tragic tale of Dracula I've ever seen in my life, and that is awesome in itself! Have you ever found yourself rooting for Dracula in all of the Castlevania games? Well, you WILL in this game!The most criticized aspect of this game is that it ""doesnt know what it wants to be"", on critic reviews. I'm sorry, but there is such a thing as ""gameplay variety"". Consistency is nice, but this game isn't trying to be 100% like God of War, and offers decent stealth segments which aren't awful. Some of these segments are even a little clever, but they could be better. In fact, the game IS consistent for the most part, offering lots of platforming, action, exploration, secrets, and grand vistas. So why is that the worst part of the game? Is it really too linear? Does it really change too often too fast with the gameplay? Is it not trying hard enough to be Metroidvania style? These questions don't matter. The classic Castlevania games were by far more linear than this game, except the often criticized Simon's Quest entry. There are things wrong with Lords of Shadow 2 as well, but does it really warrant a FIFTY EIGHT OUT OF ONE HUNDRED Metascore?!So, I highly reccomend this game. I like it much more than Lords of Shadow, in fact!			"

												Ok, so the frist Castlevania: LOS was a bit off right? Well, this time around....they got it right. The atmosphere & settings, the characters, the twisted creatures....very well done this time around. The combat itself, although familiar to the first game, seems much more fine tuned... once you unlock some of Dracula's powers further, you'll really start to tear it up in combat. Also, you get some of the iconic vampire powers to play with as well...turning into a rat, or sending out swarms of bats to distract enemies or send them into a confused mess during battle. I felt like I had to push myself through the frist LOS game, but LOS 2 pulls me in to play...no pushing needed.			"

												After having finished this game, I did walk away Satisfied with it. For it's God of War type fighting and the weird ""No Hit for power"" Combo system going on this game. I was actually glad to have got this, there is little difference between this and the first Castlevania LoS game, With some small extra's of each of his powers giving your character a different weapon, both can be useful on your adventure.One thing that did throw me off was the pace of it, It's quite slow at the beginning, and has a few chances where it will randomly speed up... It made some of the story parts confusing.All in All... an good game, And would definatly recommend for a good fan of the Franchise.			"

												8/10My only actual complaint was that the game was too short. I beat my first run on the second hardest difficulty (considered hardest until you beat it... semi-smart idea for a rerun) in about six hours, and that's with finding most of the collectables along the way. The reason why I have so many hours put into this is because I actually like walking around and beating stuff up; it's that fun to do it.My other complaint (but rather a nitpick) was the difficulty. Even on the hardest I found the game is way too easy, but that's maybe because of my experience with these types of games. Others will say it's hard and I won't disagree with them. Some people can work with it while others can't.I enjoyed the story (Though how well it connected with the first game was pretty stale) but really wished that they put a lot more time into it for a full price game (that 6$ off because of pre-order did help slightly). The combat is fun to play around with and the idea of upgrading your weapon is interesting but the makers kept it simple, which is alright.I'd recommend it to anyone once the price goes down or if it goes on sale. 6 hours runtime for 60$ is kind of disappointing, especially with a decently good story behind it.Until then!

												All in all it's a decent game. The story was not very good, but the gameplay was pretty fun in my opinion. My biggest gripe is all the boring platforming puzzles they put in between combat. For me, the combat was spread too thin. I really do not enjoy the parkour puzzle parts to most all these action hack and slash games, but thats just my opinion. Anyways, if you liked the first one then you will like this one. If you enjoy hack and slash action games you will probably enjoy this one. But, don't expect anything too deep, as the character progression is rather shallow. Your weapon variation is rather dull, and the overall it's just a repetitive mechanic that get's old rather fast.			"

What i generally didnt like so much, is the leveldesign. It doesn't build any suspense.At some point you go straight to the boss, beat him and rush to the next boss. I liked it how it was build in the first one with its levels and building tension before arriving at the Boss.In Conclusion: It is still recommended for the Fans and those who like it, but dont expect the same greatness like the predecessor			"

												This game improved a lot from the first game:- the combat is much more fluid and fun to play;- now it's possible to explore all the map whenever I want instead of playing through stages;- linking the story with another well-known Castlevania game was a good surprise! Overall, it`s good... until the ending.Altough it suffered an upgrade, this game have a few issues (SPOILER ALERT!!):- In comparison to the first game's DLC, I had to avoid been seen by the last boss for his powers were too great - he could melt me in a instant; there was a danger, a reason to hide... but in this game I had to play through a stupid hide-and-seek minigame for no reason before fighting two bosses; neither I nor them got stronger/weaker or the place before the fight buffed them or myself just before the fight so WHY the combat couldn't have started as soon as I saw them? Seriously, give me a good reason to hide from them!- the ending from the main story (I didn`t played the DLC yet) was... stupidly annoying at least. You defeat the last boss by almost killing your partner and then you`re free to do whatever cr@p you wanted but oh, the sun is rising so I guess its time for bed. In conclusion:YOU DEFEAT THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS, FREEING MANKIND FROM ALL EVIL AND YOU REWARD YOURSELF... with a nap.This ending was indeed a miserable pile of sh!t.Altought the story reaches its stupid ending, the game itself is very good. 8/10			"

												First things first, I LOVE the art design of the whole game, they're really masters when it comes to imaging how Dracula Castle would look like, sound its also very good, music its good, visually its ok too. Now for a Castlevania game it lacks a lot from other games, including handheld versions (GBA/NDS). Game lacks collectibles, gear to improve you status, weapons, etcGameplay its ok but having so many attack combos can be too overwhelming, most of the time you'll use only use 2 or 3 combos for the whip and sword, I barely used the shadow claws (except when required by the game). It might be my bad memory but I found myself checking too many times how to make that cool looking combo I just unlocked and not so much time using it cause you can beat the game without it. Controls are fine but a few times they can get very frustrating, camera its also a bit frustrating since there is no way to lock your attacks to an enemy and the game will try to ""auto aim"" your attacks to the closest enemy but always the one you don't mean to attack. Collectibles are a bit boring, scrolls that try to complete the story and tell you parts of it that are not currently happening in game. You (Dracula) feel like the less powerful Dracula from the saga and the stealth sections of the game make no sense for a Castlevania game. Overall its a good game, not so much a good Castlevania. Definitely an improvement over the first LoS. I'll only recommend it if you don't mind a short game with almost no replay value and very little exploration like in past Castlevania games and you are a ""true"" Castlevania Fan 7/10			"

It's weaker spots are very bland and dull. What I'm referring to is the point you play in the present period. As a Castlevania fan would come to expect, the present day is completely out of element for this series. But there are times when you play in the past and let me tell you those are what make the game amazing. The story telling is good and if you are a fan of the previous Lords of Shadow games I would recommend it.			"

												Castlvania has produced many good games in the past that challenged us with difficult boss fights and puzzles that could send you round the bend. hough some of these qualities were toned down for more recent games, lords of shadow 2 still packs quite a punch as it compels the player through gameplay, characters and story. many would argue it is like any other game that allows the player to be a vampire and that is agreeable, however what game offers the chance to play a draula himself. not many thats how many. though there were times when the game seemed to drag due to the lack of movement mechanics that other games offer it is still without doubt a great few days worth playing it.

												This game is quite entertaining, despite not being like what I expected.The game itself plays pretty much like the first Lords of Shadow. Game mechanics, movement and art style is very much the same. Very well executed, and especially the scenery of the game is nothing short of stunning!The storyline, however, is a bit confusing to those who have not read up on what they are going into. The game is open-world, with some backtracking and exploration. Collectibles are hidden where you won't necessarily be able to get them first time around, which can be frustrating if you are not aware of what skills are necessery to get to them. Also, I had a hard time getting used to the fact that Dracula was running around in a modern world for a part of the game, and with the game happening one part in the modern day, and the other part in Draculas castle, the skips can be confusing.The game however is quite fun, the dialogue is quite great, really moving moments that often surprised me in how much they made me care about the characters.

												I love vampires, I love story.Castlevania gives both (though sometimes weakly).The story has large gaps that leave you wondering what your doing, before jumping to it's ending.While the fighting system is decent and the overall gameplay is enjoyable, I didn't like the constant backtracking (seriously, every new upgrade has you retracing your steps for that secret you couldn't reach before)Still, it's solid enought for fans of Castlevania and Vampires alike.To me, that makes it worth it.6/10 "

												Much, much better than the first one:-Optional QTEs-Movable camera-Rewards attack variety-Many more combat items and habilities-FAR better enemy interactions. Enemies interact between them, have more varied attacks, are affected in special ways by some habilities, etc. Combat is much more complex overall-More varied environments-More challenging and aggresive enemies-Much better visually, but bad reflections resolution-Better scrolls-Much more polish. For example, the animations are less clunky.The stealth sections everybody talks about are rather puzzles where you have to guess what habilities to use with what enemies.The DLC is good too, less combat oriented, with very nice platforming and puzzles. The final boss is great too.Background music is great, really good, better than the first one. Combat music is rather meh, with some gems. The chorus in the track for the final boss says ""Castlevania"", by the way.The story has a LOT of elements. This keeps it fresh, but there is little screen time for each element			"

												Oh Gabriel, where did it all go so wrong? As a sequel to the great Castlevania: Lords Of Shadow, this game is rather pitiful. I came into it with high hopes, grabbing my controller, ready for some excellent music and vast landscapes. But oh no, what i got was drab grey city, drab grey cathedrals, and drab grey parking lots. The combat is still nice, with many moves to unlock, but what the hell happened to the atmophere of the first game? M.I.A. If there is a sequel, i hope Mecury Steam go back to their adventurous roots and give us something to get lost in. Now if you excuse me, i'm going to play Castlevania: Lords Of Shadow...			"

												     Over all I found this to be a spectacular game and would absolutly reccomend it to any player who enjoys their games with good story and characters. As said the story is fairly interesting. You play as Dracula on a mission to destroy Satan in order to stop a demonic invasion and finally be able to rest in peace. The voice acting was absoluely fantastic and the characters were completly believable and not at all flat. There was nothing weak with the characters.The Graphics and animation are also superb and the player is presented with stunning visuals all around, especially with the scenery which presents a gorgeous display of gothic architecture and other surroundings which will leave the player feeling fully immersed. Combat was intersting in that you could not simply just plow through a horde, but actually have to take the time to defeat them. I was playing on easy and defeating casual enemies was even then not just a simple task. Every enemy took time to kill. Quite a few boss battles took place and every boss was also an interesting character, who took time to defeat. Though I didn't find too much of a strategy nessessary, they still took time to defeat and it was enjoyable. The game is quite long and I feel that there were some parts the developers should have left out and even some parts I found completly unnessessary. For instance, there is at least two occasions where you are practiacally playing hide and seek, which I didn't feel was really nessessary or even enjoyable. Aside from this I feel it is a very well developed game. While I do not feel is is a classic, it was undeniably an enjoyable expirence that I can highly reccomend to anyone looking for strong characters, good story, and outstanding visuals.			"

The best looking game I have ever had on my PC, the best story I can remember in any game, the action is simple to grasp but challenging enough to be involving.  Great game.

												The games overall good.It feels much smoother then the first game, you can turn off QTEs (I don't, but still a good feature), combat display is completely customizable, and combat is the same as the first game with minor but really helpful improvements.The story is good too, but it is painfully slow, it doesn't even come together until the last hour (Or 10 depending on how much♥♥♥♥♥♥Satan gives you ;p ) of the game. A lot of the time I felt like the game was padded with useless filler that I could care less about. Overall I'd say if you liked the first one a lot, get this one, otherwise I'm not confident you will enjoy it.			"

												All in all it's a decent game. The story was not very good, but the gameplay was pretty fun in my opinion. My biggest gripe is all the boring platforming puzzles they put in between combat. For me, the combat was spread too thin. I really do not enjoy the parkour puzzle parts to most all these action hack and slash games, but thats just my opinion. Anyways, if you liked the first one then you will like this one. If you enjoy hack and slash action games you will probably enjoy this one. But, don't expect anything too deep, as the character progression is rather shallow. Your weapon variation is rather dull, and the overall it's just a repetitive mechanic that get's old rather fast.			"

The sections of the game spent in the castle inside your memories are outstanding and I wish they would of stuck to that.

												As an avid fan of the Castlevania series, I will say most of the 3D entries have been mostly mediocre.  Some had good ideas marred by poor controls (N64 games) while others had tedious gameplay with excellent music and atmosphere (Lament of Innocence and Curse of Darkness).Then 2010 rolled around and Lords of Shadow came out.  Another 3D Castlevania that I had zero expectations for but still an almost forced obligation to try...and it blew me away.  Amazing graphics, gripping story, phenomenal soundtrack, varied enemy encounters, huge boss fights, and a simple on the surface but surprisingly deep combat system in the vein of God of War (this doesn't have to be an insult, people) gave a shockingly well rounded package that earned the game some high sales and critical praise the series hadn't seen in a long time.  It had its faults, namely a camera that couldn't be controlled and a somewhat slow beginning, but the series seemed to be headed in a positive direction.A few years later we got Mirror of Fate, a sort of in-betweener entry to bind the stories of LOS1 and LOS2.  It also marked a return to the side-scrolling roots with flashes of SOTN style gameplay.  The story was interesting but markedly less central compared to LOS.  Still, the gameplay was mostly interesting, a little different, and again had a wonderful score.With the announcement of certain features like a seamless world and a controlled camera, LOS2 had a lot to live up to.  For the most part it delivers, though it definitely has its flaws.  Rather than continue on with the paragraphs at length, I'll make some easy to peruse pros and cons lists.PROS: -The story is still well told and interesting, voice actors all nail their roles (specifically Robert Carlyle and Jason Isaacs). -The soundtrack is still amazing. -Gameplay remains mostly unchanged, though there is less emphasis on puzzle solving. -Good length, around 15-20 hours depending on how much secret hunting you engage in. -Lots of neat references to classic entries. -Dracula's castle offers some cool, varied areas. -Weapon mastery/skill tree system rewards experimentation and discourages 'spamming.'CONS: -Seamless world exploration is hurt by an incredibly weak map system.  Opening the map in the menu only lets you see a very small portion of the area you are in, and you can't cycle between them.  There are also a scant number of teleportation rooms, making backtracking quite painful. -Difficulty seemed all over the place.  I found most bosses very easy and generally struggled more with the regular enemy encounters. -The modern city you explore has that Gothic Castlevania feel to it, but unfortunately most of the areas are hard to differentiate. -Ending is rather abrupt and anti-climactic.As for the now infamous 'stealth' sections, I can safely say they have been completely overblown in just about every review.  Yes, they are by no means a good part of the game.  However they are very simple and account for less than 45 minutes or so of game time.  Don't let that be what sways your heart on the game.Although it has a few questionable design choices, for the most part I can give a positive recommendation for LOS2.  Arguably one of the best facets of the series is that each game brings something different to the table.  LOS was about the closest we've gotten to a (fun) 3D classic Castlevania, Mirror of Fate was more along the lines of a 2D SOTN/Circle of the Moon type game, and LOS2 was an attempt to merge the two.  None of them are perfect, but the series hasn't been this interesting in over a decade.  I look forward to whatever Mercury Steam does next, and we will see what future Castlevanias have in store for us.			"

												Played all 3 games in the Lord of Shadows and los 2 was a good finish to thee series. Acting is a it hammy at points but not teerrible and the rest of the game more tan makes up for it. The overall graphics and art style is great throughout the series. Lord of SHadows 1 and 2 had me stopping to admire the stages/char/effexts and how well they come together.Better than average combat system with tons of upgrades. Mostly useful collectibles plus dev. art. Controls feel tight along with some amazing enemies to fight. Could list alot more i like about the game, but i will just say play LoS 1, Mirror of fate HD, and Los2. IMO it was a great series and it is too bad it ad to end.			"

												I'm going through my second playthrough now under Prince Of Darkness difficulty, and figured I'd write a bit of a review about the game itself.First off, I would have to agree with some people who have posted ""not recommended"" reviews on the game for a few reasons:  The primary being that the game itself feels entirely too short for it's own good.  In comparison to LoS1 where levels are abundant and the scenery constantly changing as you progress, LoS2 seems to rehash the same areas, in a similar fashion to that of Dragon Age 2.  You spend more time running through the same areas and just gives off a feeling of redundancy throughout the course of the game.  Sure, the areas are pretty huge, but when you need to run through the same areas repeatedly to progress it's more of an annoyance than anything.Groups of enemies seem to perfectly chain their ""undodgeable"" attacks to seemingly no end.  I'm up for a challenge, but when you're surrounded by a whole group of enemies it's extremtly annoying to constantly be chained from special to special.  Then again, I suppose that's how the NPCs feel so bit of karma I suppose.  The stealth sections truly are a bit annoying.  I understand that they're trying to incorporate a bit more than your run of the mill hack and slash, but there aren't multiple ways to approach them or to resolve them.  Not to mention that if you're spotted, you can pretty much expect to just restart from checkpoint; rarely is there a chance to regroup without taking massive damage.On to the good, as this overall is a recommendation for the game.  Overall, I have to say that I did quite enjoy the storyline, and being able to play as Alucard really gave me some flashbacks to some of the greatest games in the canon.  [Spoilers] The surprise appearance of another Belmont was quite good as well!  The combat system, while much has been leveraged from the first game I quite enjoyed, even if it was a bit repetitive.  There seems to be quite a large focus on countering in this game as opposed to its predecessor, which I don't mind personally.  The new abilities are quite interesting as well, and the upgrade/mastery system keeps you trying to use new attacks against the same enemies you encounter.All in all, I wouldn't agree with the Metascore rating as it does seem a bit low.  Sequels are always tough and when you have a title as solid as LoS1, it's hard to not play second fiddle.  Anyone who is a fan of the series I would think would like the game, and overall it's a good playthrough with the added Kleidos challenges.			"

												A nice sequel for the epic Castlevania: Lord of Shadows!!  - Finally the player can rotate the camera!!With 3d Vision and Helix Mod looks gorgeous. The gameplay looks a lot easier than the first game, more ""casual"" and lees hardcore but still fun to play with a lot new attacks/spells. If the first would been with this gameplay it could be perferct!- Better gameplay but easier game.If you played the first I recommend you this!If you haven't played the first, buy the first before this!Higly recommended franchise!UPDATE:- I ended the game after ""only"" 15 hours despite the 27 hours of the first game.- Boss figths too easy.- Plot speaking the first game was totally awesome while the second is a little obvious.- I'm a little disappointed with the end.  It's like watching Dragonball Z, the first game is like Dragonball until the death of Freeze while the second game is the Cell/Majinbu saga..The game is still awesome, I recommend it but ONLY after played the first, the real Castlevania. The second have an improved gameplay and it's a good game but not enough as the first :)			"

												*Edit: When I first wrote the review, I was only almost done with the game, but now that I have seen it through to the end, I feel I have to amend a couple of my points, primarily with the story. The ending sucks. I won't spoil anything, but I must say it was quite a let down. Many unresolved questions and an unsatisfying end both in story and boss fight. It was easier than the first acolyte.Looking at this game from a completed perspective, even before my edit, I can say that this game had a lot of potential and good ideas, but from what I've read had a botched development. It shows because a lot of the game feels incomplete or like the developers rushed to finish what was left after some development troubles. It's really a shame and very disappointing.*I played the first Lords of Shadow and I enjoyed it. As for this one, I would say it's better in some areas and worse in others.COMBAT: Compared to the first, it feels like they really smoothed out the combat in terms of how you move around and perform moves. some difficulties become clearer when it comes to one mechanic though: the way some enemies block in this game. When some enemies are blocking, they stop your combo and deflect your attack and zero damage is done. This can get really annoying when there are multiple enemies and you are attacking one that is open, but the one right next to the first is blocking. it will stop your combo. This makes engagements with multiple blocking enemies really annoying unless you are really good with your chaos energy (it's like the shadow energy from the first game and it breaks through shield and armor). Multiple skeletons are the most annoying thing in this game... That said, thankfully those kinds of enemies don't show up terribly often, and combat can still be very fun now that it's smoothed out.STORY: Sadly, I would have to say the story in this game is inferior to the first overall. There is no longer an opening narration to each stage like their was in the first because of the way they made the map somewhat open world (I'll get into that further down). There are also seems to be less moments of significant plot progression throughout the game; a lot of times it feels as if you go a great distance just to get a small snippet of story. That said, one of the things that brought me back toward liking the game more were the story moments (they pick up more once you get a bit further) when you see the way Gabriel changes based on his interaction with the other characters. Some of them were very moving. Still, overall there just doesn't seem to be as much story as there was in the first game, and for Patrick Stewart in particular, it almost seems like a waste of his talent.VISUALS: For the most part, I'm going to say that this game's visuals are gorgeous. Very pretty and detailed environments. Not a lot of more vibrant environments like the first game, but they are still very detailed and pretty, especially when the game's graphics are turned up. However, i did say ""for the most part"" because some of the more industrial areas that you explore in the game, particularly the areas with a lot of pipes and wires going along the walls and cielings, are very dull and start to feel repetitive really quickly.MAP SYSTEM: I think they had a good idea when they started this game to give it a more open world feel, but ultimately the traveling around the map gets very tedious, especially when you are backtracking to find all the hidden upgrades, and again in the more industrial areas, it becomes easy to get lost and start traveling in circles when you are looking for certain areas.OVERALL I would say Lords of Shadow 2 is a decent game that you will enjoy for its beauty and decent combat system if you have the patience for the map and sometimes tedious battles with annoying enemies, but I would buy it when the price lowers. Also, if you have a choice, play the first Lords of Shadow before you play the second, it will make your experience with the second. The story will of course make more sense and be more enjoyable.

												Unless you play this game on a xbox controller you will almost never get past the void boss (2nd boss in the game). The boss fight forces you to use a quick button press of X,Y,B or A (on a PC that is right mouse, left mouse, F key space bar) at random and if your using a keybord then your screw. This fight will not take the keybord commands most of the time and even on the easiest setting the button for the controller flash for .67 sec for you to input the command making this game almost unplayable once you start the 2nd boss fight that you will never beat.I wish game developers would actually try to make a PC game like this for the PC with the actual PC controls. Too bad great game doesnt work on PC do to lazy developers.Added note for keybord users: If you randomlly press all 4 of these buttons on a quick press it can and will most of the time go through even if you didnt press the correct button at the right time. This is a fast way of getting by the lack of design of the quick press. and changing from a bad to a ok to buy thumbs up now.			"

												Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2 is hard to judge in my opinon. I really looked forward to the progression of the story from Lords of Shawdow 1.  I felt a little disappointed with the story since the previous game and its DLC made it seem that much action was going happen. That being said I still enjoyed most of the game, specifically its fighting mechanics, bosses and challenges. Cons: (not trying to spoil so it will seem vague)1. The developers made some odd decisions with the overall features/design of the game, some levels had these sections that required special abilities to get through them which to broke the pace of the game. There were also too many climbing sections.2. You're Dracula, and while he is weak the developers could have taken a more creative route with the abilities.3. The direction of the Story could have been better, The plot development left for so much to be desired.Pros:1. FIghting Mechanics were awesome. The leveling of weapons and powers were balenced.2. Challenges were a great addition, they were fun and just right in difficulty.3. The new items and some of the abilities were interesting. I recommend the game if you completed Lords of Shadow 1, if you get it at a reasonable discount.			"

												An amazing sequel. Graphics are top notch (HD-Texture pack is free and a recommended install), gameplay is engaging and fun, controls are crisp and free from lag or any kind of delay. Combat is varied and there's a truckload of skills to unlock and use.Exploration feels less of a hassle as it did in the first game and you usually pick the various bits and bobs up as you progress through the story. There's a huge number of unlockables and power ups to find, it'll keep you busy for quite a while.The music is fantastic. Really immersive.Overall a lot of quality of life improvements have been made.The only thing that really annoyed me was that the further you progress in the game, the more the enemies seem to favour using unblockable Power Attacks and wear heavy armour requiring you to expend Chaos Magic to break their defenses. Some enemies hit a lot harder and quicker than I think they should. It can quickly ruin your day if you're not careful.All in all, this is a really solid game. A well deserved 9/10.			"

												Strongly recommended, the meta score is overly superficial in my opinion. The story is great, the gameplay WAY better than the first Lords of Shadow and the possibilities (for a hack'n'slash game) are tremendous.But... nothing is perfect. The replay factor is kinda lame, you'll want it only to try 110%.			"

												Awak­ened after cen­turies of sleep, Gabriel Bel­mont joins his for­mer men­tor in an attempt to reclaim his pow­ers and defeat Satan and his acolytes in this final chap­ter in the Lords of Shadow series.The game tran­si­tions between present time and medieval times, just before Dracula’s cas­tle was ruined. Dur­ing these tran­si­tions, Gabriel must not only fight Satan’s Acolytes, but he must also bat­tle his inner self in order to be able to regain his strength.Lords of Shadow 2, like its pre­de­ces­sor, is an action-adventure hack n’slash game, but unlike pre­vi­ous install­ments it has some inter­est­ing game­play inno­va­tions, such as var­i­ous puz­zle ele­ments and stealth-like sec­tions. The new addi­tions, espe­cially the stealth ele­ments, tend to hin­der the pro­gres­sion of the story though and being totally scripted does not seem to add any­thing spe­cial to the whole gam­ing expe­ri­ence.

												if you like the first game, then you will like the second game. the story wasnt anything to write home about, but it wasnt bad either. the combat was very fluid and easy to get the hang of. that said i have two complaints about the game. first is the stealth part of the game, which was often trial and error while dying over and over again trying to figure out what the game wanted me to do. these stealth parts were usually where i took a break from the game as dying over and over again was frustrating because there are no hints beyond the first couple of stealth puzzles. often times the solution involved using an ability in a way that was never talked about (such as the mist power can go through enemies). my second complaint was getting lost in other puzzles for pretty much the same exact reason (such as the revelations dlc you can use the wolf power while interacting with switches). both of these cases were ""oh i can do that?"" which would have been fine if they were explained better. overall due to its kind of dragged out short story, the stealth puzzles, and lack of information about some abilites involved in puzzles i would give this game a 7 out of 10.

												It was my intention to get this for the PS3 to match the first entry but an unexpected Trivia Challenge by Konami made that plan change. This is the first PC game I've ever played that highly recommended the use of a gamepad. Once in the game, I was sucked in. The level of detail in the environments and characters designs are just eye popping.  The controls are solid and easy to get used to, though I can't say for the keyboard controls since I never used them. The story was great but you need to pay attention to little details otherwise you may find yourself disappointed at the end. I'm just sad this is the last one of the series. I'd recommend this game to everyone, even old school Castlevania fans. It's a nice change of pace and an interesting take on this household name.			"

												If you enjoyed the first game, Lords of Shadow 1, then you will no doubt love this game as well. It follows the same formula as the first game, enjoyable combat, amazing boss battles, and superb area design. However the story is mediocre. As well the stealth elements they added into the game are more annoying than they are fun. Despite these two negative aspects to the game, I had a ton of fun with this game and am really glad I picked it up as I thoroughly enjoyed the first game in the series.			"

												Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is a solid entry for the series, delivering an intense, visually adventure. I liked the first one and I like this one too, the game is pretty good, but not perfect. The graphics, animation, voice acting, details are amazing, storytelling is not obvious and thrilling. However even gameplay is pretty the same to the previous Lords of Shadows, but it provides us with some new interesting gameplay mechanics like an ability to become a fog or the ability to freeze opponents.

												If Steam's rating system was stars, I would give this one three of them. It has beautiful graphics, optimized perfectly for a PC (even when the commands displayed are always Xbox 360's ones and you have to get used to them if you're playing with a keyboard and mouse) as it works like a charm on a Pavilion DV6 one. Music is the best part of the product, as cinematics are too (running 99% of the times fully real time)... but all the mythological themes, magic, settings and others that make a Castlevania game a Castlevania game are far away gone to present a more contemporary, darker, story. Character development is way better than the first game, but storytelling is not as solid as it could be. Gameplay feels amazing all the time, but I recommend using a guide if you don't want to get lost and wander for hours sometimes. Feels rock solid, but if you're expecting a Castlevania game you might not like this one at all as it feels a lot more like a Devil May Cry game now. Buy wisely.			"

												Even as a PC game, this game revolves around being played with an XBOX gamepad... To do this, you must use A button, in order to perform this action, you must use the B button, to break free of this boss' freezelike attack, use this random button, to perform a killing combo on same boss, use another random button... How in the hell do you get into the game, if it presents everything in the light of a gamepad, even if it is played with mouse and keyboard?

												First things first, I LOVE the art design of the whole game, they're really masters when it comes to imaging how Dracula Castle would look like, sound its also very good, music its good, visually its ok too. Now for a Castlevania game it lacks a lot from other games, including handheld versions (GBA/NDS). Game lacks collectibles, gear to improve you status, weapons, etcGameplay its ok but having so many attack combos can be too overwhelming, most of the time you'll use only use 2 or 3 combos for the whip and sword, I barely used the shadow claws (except when required by the game). It might be my bad memory but I found myself checking too many times how to make that cool looking combo I just unlocked and not so much time using it cause you can beat the game without it. Controls are fine but a few times they can get very frustrating, camera its also a bit frustrating since there is no way to lock your attacks to an enemy and the game will try to ""auto aim"" your attacks to the closest enemy but always the one you don't mean to attack. Collectibles are a bit boring, scrolls that try to complete the story and tell you parts of it that are not currently happening in game. You (Dracula) feel like the less powerful Dracula from the saga and the stealth sections of the game make no sense for a Castlevania game. Overall its a good game, not so much a good Castlevania. Definitely an improvement over the first LoS. I'll only recommend it if you don't mind a short game with almost no replay value and very little exploration like in past Castlevania games and you are a ""true"" Castlevania Fan 7/10			"

												This game improved a lot from the first game:- the combat is much more fluid and fun to play;- now it's possible to explore all the map whenever I want instead of playing through stages;- linking the story with another well-known Castlevania game was a good surprise! Overall, it`s good... until the ending.Altough it suffered an upgrade, this game have a few issues (SPOILER ALERT!!):- In comparison to the first game's DLC, I had to avoid been seen by the last boss for his powers were too great - he could melt me in a instant; there was a danger, a reason to hide... but in this game I had to play through a stupid hide-and-seek minigame for no reason before fighting two bosses; neither I nor them got stronger/weaker or the place before the fight buffed them or myself just before the fight so WHY the combat couldn't have started as soon as I saw them? Seriously, give me a good reason to hide from them!- the ending from the main story (I didn`t played the DLC yet) was... stupidly annoying at least. You defeat the last boss by almost killing your partner and then you`re free to do whatever cr@p you wanted but oh, the sun is rising so I guess its time for bed. In conclusion:YOU DEFEAT THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS, FREEING MANKIND FROM ALL EVIL AND YOU REWARD YOURSELF... with a nap.This ending was indeed a miserable pile of sh!t.Altought the story reaches its stupid ending, the game itself is very good. 8/10			"

												As a fan of castlevania ever since SotN I have to say this one is a mixed bag. When it hits its stride it is an absolute amazing Castlevania game. It's weaker spots are very bland and dull. What I'm referring to is the point you play in the present period. As a Castlevania fan would come to expect, the present day is completely out of element for this series. But there are times when you play in the past and let me tell you those are what make the game amazing. The story telling is good and if you are a fan of the previous Lords of Shadow games I would recommend it.			"

												This game is kind of a mixed bag with me, so I'll just list the pros and cons. Pros+GameplayThe gameplay is quite a bit improved from the first game; camera is no longer locked, climbing is easier, items are actually useful this time, and there's items dedicated to helping you uncover secrets. I'm also quite fond of the openness, allowing you to go back at virtually any time to explore, collect items, etc.+GraphicsVisually, the game is beautiful, and there's plenty of areas in the game that are simply stunning. Found myself taking in the view more than once.+CombatThe mastery system rewards using different skills to enhance your weapons' power. Each of Dracula's weapons have their own specific use, similar to the first game, but are more than just enchanting your whip with magic this time around, giving you entirely different movesets for each weapon. Also you get to drink your enemies' blood.+MusicThe music of the first game was good, but it lacked any sort of memorability. The music in Lords of Shadow 2 is much better, although you'll hear a lot of the same tracks over and over. Somewhat of a hit and miss here, but a majority of the music is good enough that this is more of a pro than a con.+PacingThere was a lot of nothing in between the major events of the first game; the pacing was just kinda crap, in all honesty. There always seems to be something going on in LoS 2, it's easier to feel like you're actually doing something rather than roaming through some ruins without much of a goal, which was a major problem throughout the first third of the first game.+Gabriel is More InterestingI was completely incapable of feeling any sort of sympathy for Gabriel in the first game. He was a cardboard cutout of a character devoid of most emotion. In this one, however, he's a little more interesting simply because he is fairly PO'ed. Also he's the dark lord, he has a reputation to live up to. Thankfully, he does.+EnvironmentAs previously mentioned in the Graphics, the game is beautiful. The environment is also essential for this as well; for the areas that they created, the world is detailed and interesting. Areas are distinguishable from other places, and the concept of building a city on the ruined foundations of Dracula's castle is, honestly, quite interesting. It creates a distinctive gothic-type city that still seems reminiscent of Dracula's castle pre-ruin when you have opportunities to overlook the city.+LoreWhile the story blows (more on that later), it does have some intriguing lore to find, some of which indicating that the people of Castlevania City are fully aware that monsters and magic are a thing. It's definitely a turn from the original Castlevania games and other games such as Vampire: The Masquerade- Bloodlines where hiding the supernatural from the world was of the utmost importance. In Lords of Shadow 2, I find it intriguing that they accept, and are even fascinated by, the fact that there used to be werewolves, vampires, and even the siege against Dracula are merely documented as history and treated as such. Their history is as natural to them as our own is to us. This is certainly something I'd love to see expanded on in future games- maybe not Lords of Shadow, but other franchises where the supernatural is merely embraced as a part of history rather than hidden from the world for safety.  Cons-It's Not CastlevaniaYou can add the title, give the characters the names, and everything else, but it still doesn't make it a Castlevania game. Let alone it's horridly out of place with half of the game taking place in a modern day city. To be perfectly honest, it feels more like Darksiders than Castlevania due to the themes throughout the game. The heart and spirit of the series is completely absent from Lords of Shadow, hence I only ever refer to it as Lords of Shadow.-StoryI find it ironic that they rebooted Castlevania with an intended focus on story, and then ended up dropping the ball. The first game had an okay, albeit not-very-original story with Satan having Necron Syndrome and popping up literally out of nowhere at the end. Mirror of Fate was an atrocity of a game and explained jack squat. Similar problems are in LoS 2- Gabriel often finds himself back in what appears to be either the past of his memories of his castle. Honestly have no idea because it's never explained at all. His memories/past/whatever-the-fudge-is-going-on also has zero relevance to what's going on, aside from getting back his powers because reasons. There's also some Resident Evil bullcrap going on where the citizens are mutated by some demonic virus; this is so out of place it hurts. Everything else is fairly easy to follow, and there's some interesting things that do happen throughout the game, but it's nothing to write home about. Story is honestly not a good reason to play this game, and if it's what you're looking for, turn the other way.Gabriel forgot how to Open DoorsFound a door? Guess what? You're going to have to pull a switch to open it. He's only a superhuman Prince of Darkness, godforbid he opens a metal door on his own. There's a lot of this crap that just slows the game down needlessly, especially since it takes forever for said doors to open. This game was made in 2014, this is rather inexcusable.-Enemies can be AnnoyingThere's a guard/perfect guard mechanic in the game, which is quite useful. Unfortunately, roughly 50% of the time, the enemies perform an unblockable attack, which renders guarding a lot less useful than you'd like it to be. Also there's plenty of times where I simply wanted to get somewhere and didn't want to fight. Going places often involve climbing. Guess what? Every freaking enemy in the game can use some kind of projectile to knock you down, often forcing you to fight enemies when you don't want to. This is often infuriating when you merely want to explore for upgrades and other hidden items.-Stealth SegmentsOkay, I get that he's weak and whatnot at the beginning, but this just seems so unnecessary. Especially since the stealth segment with Agreus is absolutely infuriating.-BugsEvery now and then, characters may ""say something"" without sound- basically the sound file for the line they're supposed to say doesn't play (no subtitles either, which is even more aggravating). I've had other instances where the objective was the last objective I just did, and wasn't up to date. Worst of all, I've had it crash on me for no reason once. Final VerdictWhile the story is laughable, the stealth is pointless, and bugs are afoot, the game is actually quite fun. I do not recommend it at full price; wait for a Steam sale to get it because $40 is a bit much for some of the frustrations of the game. Gameplay-wise, it's pretty good, despite the annoying gameplay oversights. Worth getting if you're interested in, or at least play the demo first to know if you'd like it.			"

												I'll give C:LoS2 a limited ""thumbs-up,"" but based almost entirely only the outstanding visuals, audio, and effects. To be brief, the models, animations, textures, lighting effects are simply superb. I would often walk into new environments and just pan the camera around to take it all in. The craftsmanship of the content is what propelled me towards the end.However, my big concern with this game is that I was hoping for a different mix of ingredients. In most action/adventures games (God of War, Batman: Arkham series) there is a nice mixture of combat, exploration, puzzle solving, and traversal (climbing, swimming, grappling, etc.) What I wanted from Lord of Shadow 2 was 50% combat and 50% everything else. What I got was basically 15% combat with a TON of emphasis on uninspried puzzles, boring traversal, and some rather obvious exploraiton. There were many, many times in the game when I would walk down a hallway and wish I would be jumped by a bad guy just so I could use my weapons.In the end, I still played and enjoyed it. But I wished for a lot more combat and a lot less of everything else.			"

												Even as a PC game, this game revolves around being played with an XBOX gamepad... To do this, you must use A button, in order to perform this action, you must use the B button, to break free of this boss' freezelike attack, use this random button, to perform a killing combo on same boss, use another random button... How in the hell do you get into the game, if it presents everything in the light of a gamepad, even if it is played with mouse and keyboard? I don't care about bright ideas telling me to buy a gamepad, or write the♥♥♥♥♥♥down when i need it asap onscreen!Otherwise, it might actually just be a game worthwhile....			"

												An impressive game that kept me entertained, and if not for having a lot on my plate actually gives merit for further play even after main story is over, to collect and complete some more challenges. The environments is breathtaking and it is a well executed experience where, besides a few annoyances due to stealth elements (A certain guard type you for some reason never get to face head-on), you will have a blast. Plenty of things to do and a fine combat system makes this a game worth buying, even if you are not actually into Castlevania, this can be enjoyed on its own. Of course knowing the other games adds to the enjoyment, but is by no means required, as you will be given introduction to all elements. The game works great with keyboard and mouse, though every button prompt is sadly only shown for a gamepad.			"

												A nice sequel to lords of shadow, though it feels very different.Combat has been refined from lords of shadow, instead of light and dark magic you have two new weapons that change things up in a nice way. It really adds to the fantasy of being Dracula. You can now block while in the air and that is a nice change. You can suck blood, you use a blood whip....it's good.My only complaint with the combat is that it takes a long time to upgrade your moves as each different weapon has combos and many end up being very similar. I felt forced to repeat a few canned moves at times just to level up my weapons at times.Boss fights are all pretty great, though I did feel the ending was a bit of let down. No spoliers but the last boss was not all it was hyped up to be.Story is alright, you do get to jump between some castle levels and city levels. To be honest the city levels did feel very strange and while some of the structures and areas evoked a sense of older Castlevania themes...it just didn't really do it for me. I would rather have had eveyrthing in an older setting.I found the game enjoyable though, and would recommend a play through.			"

I found the first entry pretty boring with its QTE moments, and finally i didn't finish it, i dont know but i didnt find the motivation to continue. With this one, I have enjoyed almost every part, bad stealth sections, thats true, but they will only take 30 min to complete them all, I prefer to keep in mind the 22 hours of pure joyment( you can also disable QTE!).

												While not quite what I'd wanted after the first game in the series (and Mirror of Fate,) this is a good place for a semi-closing chapter.  Without any spoilers, a lot has happened since Gabriel Belmont originally set out to kill the Lords of Shadow and Do Good Things.  And this is a worthy addition to that story.  But what we see here is literally centuries after everything that happens in the other two games, and that gap feels kinda weird.  I suppose it's all explained via flashbacks and things, but even still.Lords of Shadow 2 improves on anything the first game did that needed improving, while not messing with 95% of the things about that game that worked great already.  And it THANKFULLY brings back one continuous world that you can explore as you see fit.  Physically walking back to an area with a new power to get a thing you saw but couldn't reach makes sense; selecting an earlier chapter from a menu in the first game, and running into characters and even bosses that are already DEAD... not so much.That said, the tone of the two games is much different.  This one doesn't ride on Hope so much.  Some might like the darker story, but personally I thought that it was a little somber and depressing at times.  It was all well told, and Robert Carlyle and Patrick Stewart knocked their roles out of the park, but I think that the darker universe just kinda took a toll on things.  We'll be visiting different environments, but gone are the sunny paths, baked desert-scapes, and clear skied mountain fortresses of the first game.  Here you get plenty of variety, with stormy locales, night cityscapes, fiery caverns, frozen mountainsides... but you'll never be doing anything during the day.  That's understandable, as Story Reasons require you to get everything done in one night.  And hell, Castlevania games usually all happen indoors, in one night, IN Dracula's Castle, so I can't fault it too much for grim, darkness.Powers work better in this game than the first.  Alternate weapons/magic/sub-weapons, all that stuff is great.  In the first game, I found myself doing everything with the whip, and never bothering to use my daggers, fairies, or dark crystal.  I used Holy Water to deal with BS waves that got boring, but when I used sub weapons or items here, it was all strategic and useful.  Especially in the Kleidos Challenges.Kleidos Challenges are unlockable (and thankfully optional) challenges that put you in a circular area with various enemies.  And there are three objectives, different to each challenge.  You might get, say, don't break any shields, don't use the Void Sword, and don't recover health by any means during the fight.  There's always the same 4th objective: do all three in the same run.  I did more than half of these before I got annoyed, and then just stopped.  For the super-hardcore, this is your kind of thing.Collectables are EVERYWHERE!  Kinda literally.  I've found 3 or 4 things in the SAME ROOM, sometimes I needed different powers for each... and sometimes when you find the first collectable, it's actually only half-way down a secret path, and going just a little farther will find you a hand-hold to climb or sneak or do something to get to another.  I liked that, using one power-up as a distraction so you'll think you've got it and miss out on the next one.Speaking of those collectible powerups, the come from two major things: Pain Boxes and Piles of Sacrifice.  The Pain Box is a box with a mouth that cuts or stabs your wrist when you stick your hand in, but then you get a Health, Void, or Chaos shard to raise your HP or Void or Chaos magics!  The Pile of Sacrifice is a little statue of a dude with a big curved sword over his shoulder, and you slice your wrist on it, bleed a LOT into the bowl beneath it, and then the bowl gives you either a capacity upgrade for 5 of your 6 relics or a Kleidos Nail, to get them Kleidos Challenges unlocked.  Don't worry if hunting for all this sounds annoying: you can pick up or shop for Dodo Eggs, and using one will mark the nearest collectible on your map.  It was fun for me hunting these down, though I did Dodo around... 15 of the game's nearly 200, just because I was at the end and wanted to get everything before I hit the last area.Some people say that the bosses here aren't as good as the first game.  True, for the most part, but at the same time not true.  They're very different.  The first game's bosses were huge and awesome, but had some HIGHLY scripted ways to beat them, and most ended in a series of Quick Timing Events.  Here it's more a real fight, relying on your gameplay skills.  QTEs have been dialed back A LOT from the first game.  Lords of Shadow 1 must have something like 800% as many as this one does.So I'll conclude here saying that this is a solid game with a cool story, and voice acting from two guys who do very good work.  Definitely, without question worth a buy on sale, and honestly even worth a buy at normal price if you're into Castlevania stuff.  But as a caveat, you might want to get the first game and Mirror of Fate HD first, as this is one epic overarching story, and though they do a pretty good recap at the beginning here, you want to be attached to the characters and the world first.  It makes this much more powerful.Here's hoping they make the intended third and final game, and round everything out as incredibly as I hope.			"

												To preface: I came into this game off the expectations of the first Lords of Shadow, which I found to be one of the most worthwhile plays of the generation, marred only by the disconnect between cut-scene plot and loading screen plot (the former I chose to ignore for the much greater depth and intrigue of the latter). The way the last game ended, the trailer involving the castle siege, the unique universe and artistic style the game takes place in; how could they go wrong?And at first, it seemed like they'd made another great game (just like the first, which also came out to muted-to-mediocre reception but would prove to be a stellar experience). Even beyond the introduction sequence, with the lackluster stealth, linearity and meagerness of the city, it stilled promised to be much more, at least to me.For as long as I could, I held onto the concept that, at worst, it could be a poorly executed great concept; it kept sliding further and further away from that great concept ideal, to be expected of something coming from such a high plateu with too much expectation; a fault of my own if anything.What was dreadful about this game, however, was not its inability to match the former game's great expectations: it was unbelievably poor direction the plot lurches towards the mid-to-end of the game. In almost complete contrast to Lords of Shadow, which started off slow, picked up speed and took off into orbit: this game started off in orbit, slowed down and instead of just falling to the ground, somehow fell into a wormhole that took it straight into the jaws of a black hole where it went full-on Event Horizon.Give this game a massive miss; play the first and imagine what could have been, don't make the mistake that I did and assume the reviews were just a repeat of the first on release, of fans of Castlevania of old and this game just didn't live up to their rose-tinted rememberance of easiers times, and those who refused to do anything but accuse it of being a God of War clone, when it was so much more.In short, this game represents a tragedy in what could have been, of which I am saddened to have been a part of.

												This game clocked in just under roughly 15 hours or so. I'd say it's worth 20-30$ when you pick it up. If you played the first castlevania game (the one prior to this - not necissarily all the previous titles) you will find the gameplay to be really similar in style. The storyline is obviously linked though different and the opening gameplay scene was pretty intense and ties all back later in the end of the game. Overall I enjoyed this, though admittedly I didn't go above and beyond with completionist. I finished the main storyline completely and gameplay said 53% complete, so there's plenty of side stuff if you're into that sorta thing. Overall fun, and I'd probably play the next title if they put one out.			"

												This game was really worth the money. People complain a bit on how it doesn't fit the story from the other Castlevania games, but nonetheless it's a really worth the money for it. The ending could've been a bit more fleshed out, but felt quite good as a redemption story. The Dlc Revelations was also really well, addin new fighting systems and such. I really hope they will make a few more dlc for this game since it has the potential to be something really good. I've played it several times and enjoy every single moment from it. Just wish the bosses had been a little bit harder for some are so easily figured out it's to easy you can bneat them under 10 mins. But I have high hopes nonetheless for this game and if they make another LoS I would probably buy it without second thought. This is a must have for ppl who loved games with grim atmosphere and lots of blood.			"

												After having finished this game, I did walk away Satisfied with it. For it's God of War type fighting and the weird ""No Hit for power"" Combo system going on this game. I was actually glad to have got this, there is little difference between this and the first Castlevania LoS game, With some small extra's of each of his powers giving your character a different weapon, both can be useful on your adventure.One thing that did throw me off was the pace of it, It's quite slow at the beginning, and has a few chances where it will randomly speed up... It made some of the story parts confusing.All in All... an good game, And would definatly recommend for a good fan of the Franchise.			"

												Just finished the game and at 16 hours in length (Not completing it 100% but finishing the story and unlocking a good number of the skills) I'll say that I really enjoyed it. I was surprised how much I enjoyed the first game (buying it on 360 and PC), so I was just stoked to have a fully-blown sequel to it. It plays well, combat feels solid, and some of the fights are challenging, and I can think of only one part of the game where I almost ALMOST gave up, which was Agreas' maze, but I can forgive it because overall this is probably the best £30  I've spent on a game since... the first game. For me, I'm just in it for the story, and having played both its sequels, it feels nice and tight to the storyline it set out to tell. Very entertaining and now I'm sure my wife would like to have some of my time back in the evenings.			"

												Having been pleasantly surprised by just how good the orginal lords of shadows was, it's fair to say that my expectations for its  sequel were fairly high and nearly four years  later, we have lords of shadow 2 and with it, two questions which roughly translate to: ""Is this game a worthy sequel to the orginal"" and ""should I buy it? In answer to the first question, my answer would be, for the most part, yes it is. The reason why I say for the most part is because while I think that los2 is a genuinely good game, I feel that it falls just short of matching the greatness of the orginal. The main reason why I think this is, is because los2 is a game of two halves. On the one half you have the exploration of draculas castle, which to say the least is huge and the medieval gothic  architecture as well as the unique characters and enemies that inhabit the prince of darkness's home. For me, this is where the game truly shines as it is this part of the game that seems to embody both the aesthetics and quality of the first game. The other half of this game involves navigating through a modern day setting, which I'm afraid to say is where this game falters. The main reason for this is because while the modern envioments are competently enough designed from a gameplay perspective, they lack any kind of personality and uniqueness of their own to make them memorable or even particularly interesting enough to warrent further exploration beyond the main game. Indeed, aside from the boss battles that take place in these locations and the stealth sections (The latter of which I actually quite enjoyed, contrary to popular opinion!) I found most of my time spent in the modern setting to be fairly forgettable,  especially when compared to the parts that take place in Draculas castle, and ultimately hold the game back from being truly on par with the first game. In answer to the second question as to whether the game is worth buying, my answer would be that if you enjoyed the original los then I defiantly believe that this game is worth buying. If you've never played the original but like God Of War style hack and slah games then I would also recomend this title as being a worthy purchase. In short, I would say that if you liked the original los then the odds are that you'll probably like this game as well. In conclusion, If I had to give the first game a score out of ten, then I would probably give it an 8. With this game, I feel that a 7 would be more appropriate.			"

												Castlevania: Lord of Shadows 2 is a sequel to the well recieved but amoung some circles oft trashed ""Lord of Shadows."" Which blended God of War/Devil May Cry style gameplay with the original Castlevania actiony dark fantasy romp through monster land. I won't give away the ending to that game as some jerks do in even mentioning this game, but you probably already know. If you have not played Lord of Shadows, playing it first is an absolute necessity, and it's also a superior game to this one in my opinion. That said, in my opinion, contrary to the many reviews that are probably due to people not getting paid enough to give the usual IGN ""9.5/10 it's ok"" kind of review, I found this game a great experience, for many many reasons, since I always like to leave the reader with a positive taste in their mouth if I reccomend this game, (which I do), Then I'll start with the things this game gets wrong once I briefly summarize what it's about.Lord of Shadows 2 has you playing as a newly awakened Dracula after a brief and extremely handholdy tutorial (which will be especially tedious if you played the tutorial), Where he defends his castle from the Forces of The Brotherhood of light. These events take place after Lord of Shadows, and Mirror of Fate (which still needs a port, get on it Konami) And you can read the rest of this in the game summary above on the steam page. The gameplay is a blend of the 3D actiony combat and beat em up that Devil May Cry and God of War pioneered and refined also seen in Lord of Shadows, it is similar enough to that game that it doesnt feel brand brand new, but still new enough to not feel rehashy. It also features platforming and Uncharted and God of War brand climbing sections. And some stealth sections. You explore Dracula's castle, both in the quasi-otherdimensional quasi-memory quasi-past, and the modern day city Castlevania which was built over the ruins of Dracula's castle and it's quite cool how they overlap.Now, lets get to the negative bits. The stealth in this game is awful and unnessecary, There was a way this could've been done, which would involve Dracula stalking his prey and feeding, but the mighty Prince of Darkness running away from rejects in red from Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen 2 on steroids as rats was just ugh. But this can be forgiven as it is mostly just puzzles. The worst one is a particularly aggravating section of stealth against a giant monster satyr that you fight immediately afterward, and is a *COMPLETE* Pushover. It's ridiculous how easy it is to beat this guy after you were cowering in fear in the most difficult stealth section of the game. Another thing that bothered me is how utterly uninspired and generic the soundtrack is. It's beautifully written and scored but it's utterly forgettable and generic. there is maybe one, possibly two pieces on the whole soundtrack I remember at all, and they were variations on something from the previous game. This is forgivable for most games, But not Castlevania a series which has always had an extremely memorable soundtrack.Another odd thing is how arbitrary the things you can climb on and things you cant seem to be, giving a linearity that's even more irritating, but It's a standard of the genre so it is not so bothersome. I dislike how few platforming sections there are, honest platforming and it lacks puzzles compared to the first one.And one last flaw I noticed, was how much I hate enemies that require a certain power to defeat, though thankfully those enemies are either rare or this can be gotten around by clever gameplay. In addition, nto enough moves interrupt enemies for long enough making it too easy to be overwhelmed in situations you shouldn't be, and there simply isnt a large enough variety of enemies compared to the first game.Now onto the positives. The Art Direction of this game and it's implementation is breathtakig, it's simply magnificent. And is definately the strongest points  of it. The animation is fantastic, the atmosphere is gorgeous and captures castlevania to a T, while reminding me of Devil May Cry, and Vampire: The Masquerade, this all creates a neo-gothic feel that perfectly suits this game. The Combat is very good, and very polished. A skilled player can defeat most enemies completely untouched while keeping an very strong level of  challenge. the only drawback of the combat is the lack of stunlocks hits on groups of enemies causes far too much interruption, but this can be argued adds to the challenge, and I am a bit inclined to agree. The game feel is a bit light, but otherwise the sound of the fighting. I particularly like how it is a better Devil May Cry than the latest DMC game, and still retains all of the castlevania feel. The Characters are all excellent, and the story is beautifully told, and has much pathos even if it's a touch predictable. All in all, it fits together in a really excellent way and creates an atmospheric, fun, rich experience, if a touch too short. It starts with a whimper and ends with a bang. Many great boss fights and difficult enemies, and no shortage of action.To sum up, Castlevania Lord of Shadows 2 deserves is an excellently designed and executed game with a haunting and engaging story, a rich atmosphere, a fairly deep and well done combat system and plenty of gameplay and is well worth the money. Visuals 9/10- Excellent art design and execution, well done animations, Rich, beautiful enviroments and atmosphere.Sound 7/10- forgettable if well done soundtrack holds back what otherwise is an excellently voiced experience with quality foley .Gameplay 7/10- Lack of enemy variety, with some flaws to an excellent combat system as well as lack of platforming, combined with not enough puzzles for my liking hold back slightly what is an extremely fun experience, the tedious stealth sections at times could've been an improvement were they better executed and designed but otherwise it is another black mark lowering it's scoreStory 9/10- Excellently written, solid concept and unique spin on the castlevania formula, it is at times quite predictable, but it is so well executed it makes up for it, it is truly heart-warming, wrenching and breaking at times. With truly unforgettable moments, there is better stories out there, but not all that manyOverall= Solid 8/10  "

												When I first saw the reviews come out for this game I was a little worried, though I did really enjoy the first Lords of Shadow a few years back. Bought the game anyway and surprise, it's the reviewers being crap at games and reviewing again. LoS2 is, like LoS1, a game that takes the best parts of various action games like God of War and it works out great as a result. Dracula is a great choice for a protagonist and is made a much better character than his main Castlevania counterpart in both abilities and personality. The story isn't too weak either, it's there, it does the job so you can't complain either.A lot of complains were aimed towards the stealth sections in the game, sure this seems like an odd decision but it works, and despite what reviewers say, it's not as inhumanly hard or excessive as they say. There's probably 5 stealth sections overall, they're all incredibly brief and are there to act as a bit of variety to prevent fatigue from constant fighting smaller enemies. Although it is easy to see why reviewers proclaimed the stealth section involving Agreus as the scourge of gaming, it requires you to use multiple skills you have gained so far, but the game doesn't tell you. Thinking is too hard for reviewers after all.Overall, Lords of Shadow 2 is a solid game and definitely deserved a better reception than what it got.			"

												I have played the game for 5 hours. I haven't made too much progress. If I would have listened to all the reviews I read I wouldn't have purchased this game! I went out on a limb and purchased for PC. Castlevania: LOS2 is a mixture of Darksiders 2, and the God of War Series! However, this game is very story driven! At the beginning of the game it can be a little off putting when you have to do the things in stealth mode. However, from my perceptive it's okay because I am into the story, Zobek even tells you that you are not up to strength. However, as I stated I am biased. I would encourage the fan base to get the game. I find it worth it, I like games that pull me in....this is one of those games.			"

												     Over all I found this to be a spectacular game and would absolutly reccomend it to any player who enjoys their games with good story and characters. As said the story is fairly interesting. You play as Dracula on a mission to destroy Satan in order to stop a demonic invasion and finally be able to rest in peace. The voice acting was absoluely fantastic and the characters were completly believable and not at all flat. There was nothing weak with the characters.The Graphics and animation are also superb and the player is presented with stunning visuals all around, especially with the scenery which presents a gorgeous display of gothic architecture and other surroundings which will leave the player feeling fully immersed. Combat was intersting in that you could not simply just plow through a horde, but actually have to take the time to defeat them. I was playing on easy and defeating casual enemies was even then not just a simple task. Every enemy took time to kill. Quite a few boss battles took place and every boss was also an interesting character, who took time to defeat. Though I didn't find too much of a strategy nessessary, they still took time to defeat and it was enjoyable. The game is quite long and I feel that there were some parts the developers should have left out and even some parts I found completly unnessessary. For instance, there is at least two occasions where you are practiacally playing hide and seek, which I didn't feel was really nessessary or even enjoyable. Aside from this I feel it is a very well developed game. While I do not feel is is a classic, it was undeniably an enjoyable expirence that I can highly reccomend to anyone looking for strong characters, good story, and outstanding visuals.			"

												Awesome 3D Castlevania game.  Not many people care for the story but I enjoyed it.  Lords of Shadow is a reboot of the franchise in a way I really enjoyed playing as Dracula.       Pros: Combat, bosses, controls (played with a gamepad), story (for a castlevania game I loved it).  Cons: Stealth sections are not as bad as a lot of reviews make them out to be but it does break away from the style of the game.  That me might have to wait a long time before we will get another Castlevania game.			"

												Recommended to any fans of the series.Lords of Shadow 2 does not particularly exciting. But it is another good entry in the series. There really isn't much here to eclipse the original. The game mechanics are basically the same. The few new features feel a bit shoehorned in.Still, the gameplay is fun. The story is OK. The artwork is as gorgeous as always.If you're a fan of the series, especially the original Lords of Shadow, this is another good entry.If you're new to Castlevania, there are better entries in the series to look into.

												Overall a great game. Deviates a lot from the classic castlevania we all know and love but draws enough from the lore while giving unique insight into dracula's minions to create its own to be entertaining in its own right.  Graphically interesting, fantastic voice actors and great music round it out nicely.  Its not perfect, but most of the flaws that LoS2 suffers from is due to lazy porting from consoles.If you have a xbox controller  its strongly recommended to plug the sucker in, all the prompts and events are only shown as xbox controller buttons making its annoying and frustraiting at some intervals if you haven't memorized what keybind is what xbox promt. (Such as one of the devices you interact with early in the Toymaker's area, where you press B, X, or Y repeatedly with the buttons alternating now and then near randomly.)			"

												After hearing about the negative reviews that this game received from the game critics, I was a bit leery of firing it up.  Thankfully, many of the Steam user reviews were positive, so I gave it a try.  Of the three Castlevania games on Steam, this one was easily my favorite.  I actually enjoyed the modern day setting quite a bit.  Most of the achievements are obtainable with a bit of dedication.  Overall I thought this was a more polished game from a game play perspective than the first Lords of Shadow game.  As far as the DLC goes, the only one that adds to the story is Revelations.  The other three are ok, but you can live without them as they are cosmetic mods mostly.  If you enjoyed the first Lords of Shadow game, I think you'll appreciate the improvements that this game offers.			"

												This is a great game. The most important thing in my book however, is that it's a great Castlevania game.Graphics are great. And with the included HD pack, i don't know what more could one want. The battles are impressive, with huge, imposing bosses, and well-detailed enemies. The sound department is one of the most important aspects of the game with some great actors in thevoice acting department. Robert Carlyle does a splendid work as Dracula. However the most important aspect of the game, and where it succeeds is where Lords of Shadow 1 failed. Lords of Shadow 1 was a very proper game, graphics, sound and gameplay, but it used the name Castlevania in vain. I hated it for that. This, has Castlevania, running through its black undead veins. Castlevania, is in the atmosphere. In the dark vampirik feel. Good Job Konami. Reminded me something of the Blood Omen Games, and that is a good, good thing. I know now, that Lord Dracula will return in Castlevania, and he may or may not be in a Lords of Shadow game, after this title i have stopped thinking that this will be a bad thing. Definately recommend, to old fans and new.			"

												I recommend 100% the game, especially for those who have finished the first Lords of Shadow. The story of the first is better, but Lords of Shadow 2 has a great story too! Besides, it is much better to play as Dracula than as Gabriel. Not to mention that the end of Lords of Shadow 2 gives a wonderful satisfaction, superior to completing the first game.People criticized the stealth parts very much. I think because it breaks the Hack'n Slash rhythm of the game to a situation where you have to use the brain. And, let's face it, it's not as difficult to overcome these parts as the people are complaining about. I personally enjoyed even the stealth parties. I liked Kleidos, and I liked the open world with a relic to help you find the secrets that you can leave behind unintentionally, and I enjoyed playing with Alucard.Worth every penny. I would love to play as Drakul again.			"

Vampires, vampiresFirst of all, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is a vampire game, vampires are the main protagonists of the story, and not just some vampires, in this game you play as Dracula (THE Dracula), you basically play as the main boss in the game where hardly anything can harm you (except the guards, those things can obliterate you at any time).Generally this game gives you the taste of what it means to be Dracula. Transforming into pack rats, turning into mist, commanding bats, travelling between two eras in the world (visiting the Dracula's castle is probably best part of this game), and drinking blood, loads and loads of blood (which you will need to use all the devices in the castle).Stealth sectionsMany people hated these parts, especially considering that as an unstoppable vampire you have to hide before the aforementioned guards and you also have to take a cover in the front of some bosses despite the fact that you will normally fight them, later. I personally liked the stealth sections as they give a little variety to the gameplay. Plus being able to transform into rats, throwing swarm of bats or even possessing bodies of unsuspecting guards is the most cool thing you have ever experienced.The trainThis is one part of the game where I am going to give you one spoiler. The reason is simple, I needed help there, as well. There is one level where you stand on the train and you have to avoid various obstacles in the tunnel. After spending over 20 minutes in this level I decided to check the discussion and figure out what I am actually meant to do. So, after a couple of minutes of avoiding getting smashed to the face there is a short section without any need to jump side to top to avoid hits to the head. When that happens, simple jump to the side of the train and crawl into the window that is there (the same window you could have seen during the cutscene with the guard and the demon).Graphical overkillThe graphics of this game are simply epic. The Dracul's castle is probably one of the most stunning things you will ever see in your life, the whole experience of exploration is just breathtaking. If you don't believe me, just notice that this is my first review ever and I have decided to use it for this game.			"

That being said, the gameplay and player progression is extremely dull and boring. Fights are very repetitive and smashing buttons again and again is not fun. The only cool gameplay element in the whole game imo are the stealth tasks where you are asked to infiltrate some place without being detected.I'd recommend this for the story, but definently not for the gameplay.

												This game's main flaw is its story.  The ridiculous aspect of Dracula in crazy sci-fi context isn't even utilized in a way that comes off as genuine balls-to-the-wall action game like DMC or Bayonnetta.  Certain levels force stupid stealth mechanics that don't make any sense if you’re supposed to be DRACULA.  Regardless of that however the graphics are still nice and flashy and the half of the game that takes place in the castle still feels like Castlevania to an extent.  The other half is all right when you're in the streets or in a boss battle and at least the enemy design and set pieces are badass looking.  I loved the first game especially for its time through and through, but this one takes some serious fan boyism to enjoy.  7/10 wouldn't melt my brain with convoluted ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t again.			"

												Lords of Shadow 2 fills in the story around the time of (mostly after) the first Lords of Shadow game. LoS2 takes place in a combination of the modern world built on Dracula's castle and the past. While playing LoS2, I never really felt a sense of progression, I just felt like I was playing. It's not a particularly difficult game but it does have some stealth scenarios that can be annoying. The boss fights aren't particularly intuitive, just hack and slash and avoid getting hit. The modern environments weren't really my cup of tea but I thought it was fun that they used Dracula's castle as the foundation of an entire city. The past environments were nice and the graphics were done fairly well.I had no performance issues with the game (played with an i7-950 & GTX 780) and no technical issues; it worked very well for me. I played with a gamepad, as any sane person should do with such a game.Took me just over 16 hours to complete. I didn't collect all of the items and upgrades, but probably most of them. Reading the lore is probably the best part of the game.Can't really say I highly recommend this game unless you're a Castlevania fan. Don't hate it, but probably won't replay it.			"

												Disappointing game, overall. I was highly looking forward to it, as I was one of the (seemingly few) who greatly enjoyed the first LoS, along with the 3ds sequel. However, the sense of exploration and discovery that really pulled me into the first game was lost, here. I think the decision to include a modern day component led to a disjointed, stifling experience. Gone are the beautiful, sweeping vistas of the first LoS, replaced instead with repetitve, boring hallways/corridors. However, my biggest complaint is the developer's decision to include forced stealth sections. Absolutely attoricious, and felt wildly out of place in this game. Would not reccomend to even fans of the LoS series, unless deeply discounted.			"

												At first, I was a bit miffed by the fact that this game becomes anachronistic (Brotherhood version of Liberty Prime], Gabriel in the future), but the story ties it together nicely and it fits together with the in-game lore. The game itself is played out across two worlds (the ""mission"" world and Gabriel's Castle). Both worlds are free-roam and you can backtrack as needed to explore or to get items previously missed.Pros:- Option in menu to turn off QTEs. This made the first game really annoying with the constant QTE prompts; now it's optional.- Great story.- Fantastic soundtrack.- Combat is more streamlined with upgrades. The mastery system forces you to change up your attacks so you get to use all the combat moves.Cons:- Lack of puzzles (I enjoyed the puzzles from the first game).- Lots of backtracking (re-exploring and getting items from areas already explored).- Modern setting sometimes feels un-Castlevania like.

												First off metacretic scored this game Wayyyyyyyy to harshly. Like a lot of people I gave it a 100 on there to boost it up to its real score. IMHO would be about a 85/100 good; not great but still a very fun game. As mentioned there are a few brief spots that are kind of trying and could have been left out but I guess I didn't find these anywhere close to the level of annoyance that some players did. I mean some players were real up in arms about the stealth addition. Honestly I thought it was well done. So all in all great game totally worth buying and playing from where I’m sitting.			"

												Take this thumbs up with a grain of salr; this game isn't for everyone.  But I can easily say that this is my favorite 3D Castlevania game, and the best I've seen out of the series since Dawn of Sorrow.  It has the emotional poignance of Bloodlines/Circle of the Moon, the dizzying grandness of Symphony of the Night, tightened up combar from the first game, and unlike LoS1, Castlevania-appropriate (not to mention gorgeous) art and music...when you're in dracula's castle.  When you step outside you get to hear Patrick Stewart do cold reads of Johnny Test screenplays before you play a mission exhumed kicking and screaming from the bottom of Arkham City's cutting room floor.  I actually started to resent Alucard (?) in this game bc whenever he (? the wolf) showed up, it meant you were done in the Castle for a while.  If LoS was in the middle of the road between pleasing Castlevania fans and presenting new material, this is squarely in the ditch - sweet fanservice and incongruous and confusing new material are presented almost side-by-side.  If you still want to play it knowing that, then you'll love it, but you have to have a super high tolerance for weird and frustrating design choices (as high as a Sonic fan's).  It ain't easy bein' dracula.			"

												Overall a good game, as many have said the first Lords of Shadow seemed a bit better and well planned.  This was fun by all means but the story felt lacking.  I didn't find myself driven to seek out secrets as they were more tedious to go back and find than enjoyable as i felt the first game was.  Fighting is very fun, combos and new skills make it feel solid and tactical.  There was some parts that annoyed me greatly to keep no spoilers ill make this vague....you are tasked with sneaking around in a few spots if you fail you are one shot killed.....only to then (seconds later) fight the same enemy and dominate them....I know its a game but this forced  game play mechanic annoyed me greatly.  Also the city/castle are hard to navigate, I remembered seeing places I could come back to later on to get upgrades but getting to these locations a second time seemed much more difficult then needed and I found myself just pushing forward instead.  Finally the story does tie everything up but the ending battle and conclusion felt....""eh"" to me.  All the other fights felt great, similar to the original game they had a nice massive scale to them with a nice evily twist given your charcater.  I picked this game up on sale after seeing iffy reviews about it at launch I held off for a few months and im glad i did.  This game to me is worth playing, its not bad by any means its just lacking in some areas but I would not have been happy if i dropped full price on it.  Bottom line, worth playing but dont expect to be blown away by it.			"

												I got it severely discounted because of all the bad reviews it got. I actually had fun. A hardest level difficulty run through took about 12 hours. There is some backtracking when you get new abilities, but its common in these types of games. The fighting is fun and fluid. There is enough completionist things to do to add at least 10 more hours: puzzles, finding things, battle challenges, etc. There is also the DLC, which i will wait for a steam sale to get.			"

												I love vampires, I love story.Castlevania gives both (though sometimes weakly).The story has large gaps that leave you wondering what your doing, before jumping to it's ending.While the fighting system is decent and the overall gameplay is enjoyable, I didn't like the constant backtracking (seriously, every new upgrade has you retracing your steps for that secret you couldn't reach before)Still, it's solid enought for fans of Castlevania and Vampires alike.To me, that makes it worth it.6/10 "

												Late with the old reply. This game is superb. People hate it because the ol youtubers disliked it. They replaced puzzles with short stealth sequences which is much more enjoyable in my opinion. Except for the sneaky garden mission. F**K that mission. It takes everything that was great about the first game and improves upon it.			"

												Lords of Shadow 2 is ostensibly the last game in the Lords of Shadow trilogy created by MercurySteam, and possibly the final game in the Castlevania series, due to Konami moving on to more ""profitable"" ventures. On paper, this game has all the ingredients needed to send the series out with a bang; amazing graphics, expanded combat and upgrade system, larger and more explorable world, great score, and stellar voice cast. However, when taken together, it doesn't quite reach the heights of the first Lords of Shadow game. One of the biggest problems is the story, which is all over the place as the player jumps between the past and present, represented by the enormous castle where Dracula resides, and the modern-day, gothic city. While MercurySteam's attention to detail and graphical prowess shine in both sections of the game, the city just wasn't as compelling as the castle, and every time I had to go back to the city to complete an objective, I sighed. This point extends to the gameplay in the city as well, which boasts uninspired and frustrating enemies, and stealth sections. In truth, the enemies in the city weren't actually that bad; I just felt that the castle's enemies were much better designed, and fit the ""Castlevania"" theme. Despite these issues, the core gameplay and combat is solid, and for the most part, better than the first game. The player is also free to roam around both areas looking for upgrades and collectibles; gone is the chapter-by-chapter format. Even with the story jumping around, it is fairly interesting, and the cast does a good job of keeping the player involved. However, the biggest problem emerged during the last third of the game, where it seemed like interesting characters and plot developments were either dropped or rushed to conclusion, culminating in a disappointing final sequence and boss that paled in comparison to the epic scale and confrontations of the first game. Stretching out some story moments or expanding on all the concepts that the narrative introduced would have made the story feel much more put together and complete. And ultimately, it is this feeling of ""what could have been"" that drags this game down to being simply good, and not great. There are some cool moments, and I did enjoy the experience enough to recommend this game, but it could have been so much more. And that's just a shame.			"

												Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is a good game.  In fact, I'd call it very good if it weren't for a few glaring flaws.  Critically, this game floundered since the media focused on what the game did wrong rather than what it did right.  This game has many extremely memorable moments.  The battle with medusa and the battle with the toy maker immediately come to mind.  However, for a short amount of time,  the game throws some bad stealth mechanics at you.  There isn't much to say about them, the stealth is barebones and feels very out of place in the story, outside of a single instance where it seemed logical.  Luckily, their presence is more like a puzzle in the game than an actual mechanic.  You won't spend much time stealthing around.Now, on to what this game got right:Combat is A+.  It's up there with the best action games imo: God of War, Devil May Cry, etc.  It's more comparable to DmC: Devil May Cry all the way down to the weapon swapping mechanic.  It feels smooth, responsive, and impactful.  The graphics are fantastic.  The art team did a wonderful job in this game and the engine devs did a great job focusing on the most important aspects of the engine for this game.  The modern city looks great and manages to feel victorian while also looking modern, and Dracula's castle is absolutely gorgeous.  The game also runs like a dream (originally played on a gtx 780 with plenty of power to spare).The story is...well it's nothing to brag about.  The premise is interesting, and the beginning isn't too bad, but some cringy dialogue and a painfullly bad ending ruin it.In the end, I recommend this game.  The good outweighs the bad by a long shot.  Critically speaking, it's a heavily underrated game.  It's hard to accurately express what makes the good parts feel so much better than the bad.If you are interested in this game, download the demo.  It's a good representation of what you'll do in this game 80%-90% of the time (minus the exploration).			"

If you are new to the series I recommend buying ""Castlevania: Lords of Shadow"" first. "

												Someone just needs to give Gabriel a hug.This game is one of the most prominent in recent memory to completely break my heart. So much potential in setting, story telling and gameplay squandered. The finale of Lords of Shadow suggested the coming of a great tragic villain. All of the trailers leading up to LoS2 reinforced the drama, the pain, the rage of a man turned into a monster by love.  It was all there for Mercury Steam to knock out of the park. Instead the swung and missed. The sad part is, there is actually some incredible gameplay here. The combat is markedly improved over its predecessor. The addition of vampiric speed and strength to Dracula's style really empowers you. Sure you have probably read about the stealth sections that drag the game's momentum to a squealing halt, and this is true, although perhaps not as miserable as others have suggested. The free exploration of Dracula's castle really improves upon the linear formula of the previous game. So yes, there is much to like here.But oh god what did they do with the the boss fights (a highlight of LoS) and, more unforgiveably, the story. I wont spoil anything here but suffice it to say that the finale not only drops the ball on the conclusion to Gabriel's arc, but does it in spectacularly cringe worth fashion. The less said about the final stage and the ending the better.This game seriously broke my cold black heart.			"

												After hearing about the negative reviews that this game received from the game critics, I was a bit leery of firing it up.  Thankfully, many of the Steam user reviews were positive, so I gave it a try.  Of the three Castlevania games on Steam, this one was easily my favorite.  I actually enjoyed the modern day setting quite a bit.  Most of the achievements are obtainable with a bit of dedication.  Overall I thought this was a more polished game from a game play perspective than the first Lords of Shadow game.  As far as the DLC goes, the only one that adds to the story is Revelations.  The other three are ok, but you can live without them as they are cosmetic mods mostly.  If you enjoyed the first Lords of Shadow game, I think you'll appreciate the improvements that this game offers.			"

												To be perfectly honest, if you want more Lords of Shadow, you're better off replaying the first game.I feel this one really missed the mark, and after reading about the internal struggles of the development team and their near-constant battle with their director, I can say I'm not really surprised.Lords of Shadow 2 is, in every way, inferior to its predecessor. Graphically, it fails to impress. Mechanically, it feels sloppy. The combat is frustrating and choppy and, while LoS1 had its fair share of controller-throwing platforming segments, LoS2 doesn't even justify its own such moments with an equal helping of fun, satisfying ones. I have only put a couple hours into the game so far, and already I'm mad at it. I cannot comment on the overall story yet, but the beginning feels rushed and strange, and I have to feel bad for Patrick Stewart being forced to deliver such a petty script as Zobek. The writing is childish and uninspired, and the semi-animated lore sequence explaining the Belmont lineage is utterly boring.But you know, I could forgive all of that if the game didn't so completely miss its own point. At no time during play did I ever FEEL like Dracula, who is supposed to be an absolute powerhouse, combining strength, speed, and magical abilities to devastate ranks upon ranks of foes. The most basic of enemies can take a monumental beating from any of your weapons, and can even attack straight through your combos to strike you. One minor strike from an enemy, however, will interrupt your combo and send you flying, which makes your stature feel pitiful, even if you aren't taking significant damage from those attacks. These problems are only magnified and exacerbated when, after the tutorial sequence, the story fast-forwards some centuries and resets all of Gabriel's powers, requiring you to slowly unlock them, one by one.Other games have successfully portrayed their protagonists as extremely powerful beings without robbing the game of its core challenge. A great case in point is Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine. Lords of Shadow 2, however, takes the legendary Dracula and nerfs him into the ground, and then poops all over him with bad gameplay mechanics.I'll say it again: if you want more LoS, play the first game again, because you'll enjoy it a whole lot more.

Vampires, vampiresFirst of all, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is a vampire game, vampires are the main protagonists of the story, and not just some vampires, in this game you play as Dracula (THE Dracula), you basically play as the main boss in the game where hardly anything can harm you (except the guards, those things can obliterate you at any time).Generally this game gives you the taste of what it means to be Dracula. Transforming into pack rats, turning into mist, commanding bats, travelling between two eras in the world (visiting the Dracula's castle is probably best part of this game), and drinking blood, loads and loads of blood (which you will need to use all the devices in the castle).Stealth sectionsMany people hated these parts, especially considering that as an unstoppable vampire you have to hide before the aforementioned guards and you also have to take a cover in the front of some bosses despite the fact that you will normally fight them, later. I personally liked the stealth sections as they give a little variety to the gameplay. Plus being able to transform into rats, throwing swarm of bats or even possessing bodies of unsuspecting guards is the most cool thing you have ever experienced.The trainThis is one part of the game where I am going to give you one spoiler. The reason is simple, I needed help there, as well. There is one level where you stand on the train and you have to avoid various obstacles in the tunnel. After spending over 20 minutes in this level I decided to check the discussion and figure out what I am actually meant to do. So, after a couple of minutes of avoiding getting smashed to the face there is a short section without any need to jump side to top to avoid hits to the head. When that happens, simple jump to the side of the train and crawl into the window that is there (the same window you could have seen during the cutscene with the guard and the demon).Graphical overkillThe graphics of this game are simply epic. The Dracul's castle is probably one of the most stunning things you will ever see in your life, the whole experience of exploration is just breathtaking. If you don't believe me, just notice that this is my first review ever and I have decided to use it for this game.			"

												This is a great game. The most important thing in my book however, is that it's a great Castlevania game.Graphics are great. And with the included HD pack, i don't know what more could one want. The battles are impressive, with huge, imposing bosses, and well-detailed enemies. The sound department is one of the most important aspects of the game with some great actors in thevoice acting department. Robert Carlyle does a splendid work as Dracula. However the most important aspect of the game, and where it succeeds is where Lords of Shadow 1 failed. Lords of Shadow 1 was a very proper game, graphics, sound and gameplay, but it used the name Castlevania in vain. I hated it for that. This, has Castlevania, running through its black undead veins. Castlevania, is in the atmosphere. In the dark vampirik feel. Good Job Konami. Reminded me something of the Blood Omen Games, and that is a good, good thing. I know now, that Lord Dracula will return in Castlevania, and he may or may not be in a Lords of Shadow game, after this title i have stopped thinking that this will be a bad thing. Definately recommend, to old fans and new.			"

												Amazing game , tons of stuff to do and very good plot line continuity if you've played LoS 1. Story pales in comparison to LoS 1 but features such as open world and free camera have been added.This game gets alot of unnecessary hate. Play it for yourself and see that its worthwhile			"

												I've been playing Castlevania since the first NES version, and I must say that I am really impressed with this as the conclusion of Lords of Shadow 1 and Mirror of Fate. The graphics (mostly in the architecture) and music are fanstastic. The stealth parts didn't bother me as much as everyone else. I would say the biggest con in this game is that the enemies are all relatively the same strength and kind of boring. I think it would have been a little more fun to whip my way through barrages of weaker skeletons and zombies with stronger enemies dispersed strategically through each area. As it is now, pretty much every enemy takes quite a few whips and combos to defeat -- none of them are particularly challenging, but rather time consuming.Ultimately, I did enjoy this game and would definitely recommend this and the other 'newer' series to any Castlevania fan.

												There are times where I both loved and hated Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2.  I really like the first Lords of Shadow, with the Gothic setting, the fresh character design, the story, and the many diverse/fun situations.  Lords of Shadow 2 is at its best when it puts the player in dynamic combat where you are Dracula, the Prince of Darkness, laying waste to whoever dares to stand against you.  However, the stealth sections felt both tedious and illogical  (why would the strongest vampire on the planet be afraid of some trash mobs, with big guns sure, and pushed to hide?  I mean Satan and Death itself are afraid of him...  I don't get it).  Pros:+ Great artistic direction.+ Dynamic combat.+ Great boss battles.+ You play as mothereffing DRACULA, the DRAGON!!+ I enjoyed both the Gothic & Sciebce Fiction settings. + Great voice acting.Cons:- Stealth sections.- The overall world map is tedious to navigate.- Could have benefited of more combo variety and powers (remember the animation HELLSING, that's a bad♥♥♥♥♥vampire).Verdict: B+			"

												I recommend 100% the game, especially for those who have finished the first Lords of Shadow. The story of the first is better, but Lords of Shadow 2 has a great story too! Besides, it is much better to play as Dracula than as Gabriel. Not to mention that the end of Lords of Shadow 2 gives a wonderful satisfaction, superior to completing the first game.People criticized the stealth parts very much. I think because it breaks the Hack'n Slash rhythm of the game to a situation where you have to use the brain. And, let's face it, it's not as difficult to overcome these parts as the people are complaining about. I personally enjoyed even the stealth parties. I liked Kleidos, and I liked the open world with a relic to help you find the secrets that you can leave behind unintentionally, and I enjoyed playing with Alucard.Worth every penny. I would love to play as Drakul again.			"

												The game is astonishingly beautiful in a lot of places. Great artwork.The controls are smooth, good boss fights. Great improvement over part I in that regard.Never saw a single glitch or crash.I don't see how anyone could give this a negative review, it is a brilliantly made game.			"

												If Capcom & Santa Monica had a son.. this would be him! At first i thought that it won't be like the first one because it is in modern age but this is the perfect Dracula Game! It has a lot better:Animations,Graphics, More Cutscenes which make it more cinematic and reminds me a lot of Dracula Untold!The only thing i hated was the ending.. it was like watching Konami giving up on making games :D			"

												So as my third Castlevania game ever I found this game to be interesting. Obviously my first 2 are the other Lords of Shadow games on steam. Lords of Shadow 1 and Mirror of Fate. I have to start out saying this game at max settings with the texture pack on is beutiful. Atleast the environments are, the character models are about the same as in the first lords of shadow game. But the Marble floors and walls look amazing same with the castle. The gameplay is 99% the same as the first lords of shadow lots of X and Y if you are using a controller, it has full controller support so I dont see why you wouldnt be. There is 1 change which I found annoying. They switched the function of the right trigger and B button on an Xbox controller from the first game. In the first game right trigger was used to pick stuff up and now its B. This threw me off as it is bascially the only controll change. SPOILERS. I found this game to be more enjoyable than the first but I liked the story in the first one more. This story is confusing. So in the first one you were sent on a mighty quest to kill the three lords of Shadows, Werewolf, Vampire, and Grim Reaper man. This one you are gearing up to fight Satan in a modernish city. There are basically no puzzles in this one which were prevelent in the first one. They have been replaced instead with weird stealth sections. Which absolutly make no sense as you are Dracula who is going to destroy Satan but dies in 2 seconds these large mutant guards with basically rocket launchers in futuristic armor. Very annoying. There is also a sub plot with the castle which was destroyed at the start of the game. Then it sort of becomes its own dimension were stupid BS things happen. Like the blood of the castle is trying to keep him there and basically Mutates anything it touches. Also Zobek is a business man now. I am notgoing thru the entire story but its basically you awake its the future you are in modern city, there are people trying to sommin Satan, you beat them and other bosses , then fight Satan and an old god. With weird BS stuff happening in your Castle dimensional realm. I think the castle became the new Shadow plane maybe? Idk it isnt really explained. 8/10 is what I give it.			"

												A new take on the Castlevania series. I know there are a lot of people who don't like this reboot of a classic franchise, but it's still a decent game and fun to play if you can accept it for what it is..			"

												I will say that it looks gorgeous with max settings, and runs slick and smooth on my pc. It also handles ambience and music exceptionally well. It does have some confusing AF storytelling techniques and I'm more than a little lost even having played the previous game. Gameplay is a bit hit or miss... and I feel it doesn't make enough use of the modern scifi setting, relying on weird flashbacks... sort of.			"

												Highly recommended.Good game. It's very different from the old Castlevania game I played many years ago on my Gameboy. This game has well-written story, and well-made combat system. The difficulty levels are well-designed as well. Both beginner and hardcore player can find their good match. Also, I like Dracula a lot. He is super handsome and powerful <3. Have anyone watched ""Hellsing OVA""? He is so much like Alucard lol. "

												Game feels pretty boring for most of the part.The prologue and tutorial area already takes up like 2~3 hours of the game.Lords of shadows 1 is far better even though it was mission based (which actually wasn't bad at all).There are many other hack and slash adventure games on steam that are better.
