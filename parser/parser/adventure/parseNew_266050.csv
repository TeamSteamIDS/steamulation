												Y'know how some games are like ""so bad it's good""? Crap like Blood on the Sand, Deadly Premonition or that one where the President of the USA pilots a mech? Yeah, this is nothing like it.It's complete garbage. It's Cry of Fear with a vaguely racist Eastern European sense of humour. If you're as dumb as me to drop ten bucks on this then you want your head looking at. Are you thinking of buying it and making funny videos laughing over it? Don't bother, pick a game that isn't painful to play. If you want to experience it just wait until Lowtax or slowbeef put it on YouTube.I wouldn't even recommend this try-hard crap to someone I hated.			"

												I was suckered. I was curious as to whether this game would be the B-movie trash fest the makers claim it to be.... It's not. Let's start with the voice actiing... Oh god, the voice acting. Not only is it obvious the actors recorded their lines over a cheap microphone setup, but you also don't understand what they're saying half the time. Sometimes their accents become too thick to decypher (the main character's especially) or for some baffling reason the volume drops to a whisper. And why must my character freeze in place every time he starts talking with a person? Must he devote all his intellectual and physical prowess just to hold a simple conversation?The AI isn't bad so much as very simple. Enemies just come running at you, spawning in from out of nowhere. (Think Aliens: Colonial Marines... better yet, don't) A few bright spots is that the gun play is all right, if nothing new, and the price isn't outrageous, although I'm probably not going to finish this game.Buyer beware. The makers of this game try to hide the flaws in their work under a paper-thin veneer of poor humor and an 'Oh, you're not meant to take it so seriously' frontage. Do not expect much from this product. Don't even expect an options menu (cause there is none, seriously).			"

												Into the Dark: Ultimate Trash Edition is marketed as a game thats like a B-movie. Its supposed to be one of those 'its so bad its good', but so bad because its just freaking bad. There is nothing at all fun or good about this game. From the pathetic voice acting (obviously done with a cheap microphone), horrible controls and ugly graphics its extremely apparent that this POS is just that, a POS. The devs tried to hide their shoddy work under a thin viel that its supposed to be that way, the glitches, the crashes, tasteless dialogue, and terrible AI. This is one of the worst so called games that I've ever had the misfortune of playing and I've played some really bad ones.			"

												Into the Dark is a FPS horror game. The player takes control of Peter O’ Brannon, a detective who is sent to investigate the death of an elderly man in New England. Upon arriving at his cabin, you realise that all is not right and something sinister is going on.The game makes a poor first impression. The game starts with ultra-low quality artwork and a surprisingly small amount of menu options, there is absolutely no configuration options. To configure the controls you have to edit a text file.Gameplay consists of exploring bland locations, completing bland objectives and killing bland enemies. In order to complete the games puzzles, you often have to go back to rooms you have already explored to find that objects have magically spawned there. When you finally get past the obstacle, the game is kind enough to spawn an enemy directly behind you.The graphics are bad. Into the Dark features completely antiquated visuals.The voice acting for the game is beyond awful. For me it was nearly impossible to hear what is being said, it made it nearly impossible to follow the story.If that is not enough, there are several technical issues; invisible walls block a door or you could stuck in such a wall. Loading up a saved game, starting a new level and even just doing nothing: all of them can cause crashes.The best part in Into the Dark is that it includes the complete movie of Night of the Living Dead.My advice take a look at other horror games. If you just want it for your collection wait for a big discount.Sounds 2/10Graphics 2/10Gameplay 3/10Atmosphere 3/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												I'm a huge fan of B-movies and cult media experiences - generally, the trashier the better. I was super excited about this game because it sounded like it was tailor-made for someone like me. That much is true for the content of the game (at least the half hour or so that I saw of it). The problem is that the game is almost unplayable. The sound quality is ridiculous; it sounds like the voices were recorded in one day over Skype. The soundtrack consists of one Midnight Syndicate track on a loop and a never-ending shuffle of footsteps, regardless of whether or not you're moving. There is no way to adjust settings in-game; you have to edit a file in order to re-map controls and the like. Most of the puzzles are solved by pressing up against random objects in the room until you pick up the one you're looking for. Overall, the mechanics foiled what was probably otherwise a funny, kitschy game.			"

												This is not ""so bad its good"". Its not even ""just bad"". It is terrible.I get it is supposed to be a low-budget ""trash"" game, and it seems like it could be fun, but its just too damn buggy and annoying to be fun.I can forgive the boring repetitive rooms and horrid voice/sounds, due to the low budget, the following list is just what annoyed me the most, and stopped me from playing it. any further:- Red Key / Red Door old-skool gameplay, except it is always not clear what the key to proceed to the next area actually is, and sometime it doesn't even appear unless you have done something else first (what was once an empty room can later have a critical item in it), the game even mentions this. This is just plain annoying and no reason why it should exist in the first place. Expect plenty of roaming thorugh the repetitive levels again and again, looking for the next damn interactable object.- UI might as well not exist. Approaching a door says, ""Key Required"" whether you have the key or not. You have to press ""USE"" to open the door. In game hints are pretty useless.- Extremely Buggy. Crashes quite often, saves disappear or corrupt. Sometimes loading the game has zero health and you die straight away, or items are missing etc.- Very imbalanced. Enemies are extremely deadly, but also extremely dumb.			"

												The German language has many wonderful compound words used to describe very specific feelings or situations.  There must be one that loosely translates into ""Nuh-uh, this isn't crap, it's just the way we meant it, YOU just don't get it"" (and if there isn't, may I suggest uwebollvergnügen).  It is this very attitude that allowed the creator of Into the Dark to scam his way into a spot on Steam.Don't get me wrong, I have nothing but respect for people who cobble things together out of spare parts and pennies but simply insisting that your experiment with FPS programming is a brilliant satire game does not make it so.Into the Dark is an amateur, bug-filled, poorly designed, user unfriendly mess.  It tries to be funny.  It isn't.  It claims to be stylistically bad.  It is just bad.  It promises nudity.  Well... if you bought it for that, you deserve the disappointment you are in for.If you got this game in a bundle and you feel you must, install it and derive as much enjoyment as you possibly can from it.  You have been warned.  Whatever you do though don't exchange real money, money you can use, for Into the Dark.An extra note for achievement hunters: Watching the opening cinematic triggers the first achievement.  If you value your % completion score, you will regret ""just checking it out"".			"

												Could not enjoy the game 1 bit. Game is made with the old version of the fps creator which came out free. Only thing that was cool about the game is the vaguely racist Eastern European sense of humour. Im from germany and most of it was just funny. BUt the gameplay sucks, enemys can literally kill you with 3 seconds and 8rounds cant kill the monsters. Voice acting was terrible. Its soo bad you can hear the developer turn on his mic and hear all of the background feed back while he is talking.Is the game worth it: Not at all (I got it free from tremors so im not made at all)			"

												Aside from the fact that the humor isn't my style, what gets this a thumbs down is that it's uncomfortable to play. The screen flickers a lot, like A LOT. Enough that it should probably come with a seizure warning. And even taking a small amount of damage puts enough blood on the screen that navigation becomes very difficult. For people who are into the writing and comedy, it may be worth putting up with those frustrations, but I am very much not one of those people.			"

												This is an indie game... really indie, the production values are limited. The game is still good. It is full of cruel and disgusting humor. A bit like a trash slasher movie mixed with Soylent Green. And completely politically uncorrect.The gameplay reminds me of... well take ""Evil Within"" and remove 99% of it budget, add jokes that are so deep that they will never appear in an AAA-title - and you will get Into the Dark.Although technically simple, I was still thrilled by the atmosphere. The fighs are not easy to win, at least in the beginning. And the sound effects are extremely well done. The speech on the other hand... it is so bad it is good again.			"

												Even with my limited time within the hands of Into the Dark: Ultimate Trash Edition, I knew that I'd made a bad choice. Like B-Movies, some B-Tier games come in a couple of flavours - The first is a product made with heart. It's flawed, but you have fun because it's a pleasure to watch. The second is a cash in piece of nonsense, made by people who take one look at a genre of horror and want a piece of that pie. This game falls into the second catagory. Oh, how we chuckled as an image of a developer told me 'read the f***ing manual'. Oh, we giggled as I had to change any settings within the .ini file. Oh, how quickly I uninstalled the game as I tired of trying to navigate pitch black rooms with little to no sense as to where I was going. And Christ, the voice acting is so poorly recorded (Do these people not google 'Microphones' before hand), it's offensive. Avoid like the Plague.			"

												Tried to open an ""automatic grate"" and got wrecked by a glitching mutant.0/10 Wouldn't play again.Absolutely horrible game. Funny and bad enough to sit through the horrendous intro sequence (bad artwork, amateur voice acting with static in the audio,) and try out the gameplay. Firstoff, you get stuck when certain sequences happen, like when you talk to your omnipotent partner, your feet become frozen to the ground. Then there's a sequence that is scripted so poorly you are ready to uninstall the game (which I did.) You have to get through an automatic grate (what the heck is that?) and find a switch to open it. But when you get close enough to the grate to find this out, if you didn't happen to trigger the text that told you to open this grate beforehand, you trigger an enemy to appear, who quickly shreds you to pieces.Bad artwork, sub-par graphics, terribly scripted events. Save your money and your time and play a title that the developers bothered to finish.			"

												This was a most unfortunate impulse buy I made after taking the game's supposed hilarity at face value. The game, when it works, plays like a very hastily and poorly modded fps from saaaaaaaaaaaaay ten years ago? Twenty? I dunno. It's bad. But they have my money as well as the cash of all the poor peeps above and below me on the review list. So, at least someone somewhere is happy because of this game.Pros:-Short download time?-You always hear your footsteps. This may not seem like a pro, but I list it here because the game a) doesn't have many/any pros and b) because I would like to attribute the never ending clunking boot on wood floor sound to the protagonist constantly dancing in place off screen. I'm choosing to imagine that this is the case rather than that it is just another example of horrible programming. Because I'm a glass half full kinda guy. And I have a massive imagination.-Maybe the creator's finished off a house payment cause bought their game? Maybe they had a nice lunch? For two if they're supes a' dupes frugal? Maybe that cheapo twofer lunch turned in to a fruitful, marital relationship for them? Maybe you would have gotten into a car wreck or died horribly if you'd gone out and tried to do something worthwhile instead of taking the time to buy and download this game. That's right. It's a possiblity. If that was the case, this turd sandwich just saved your balogna grubbin' life. Totally plausible.  I'm going to imagine that's the case so I can sleep at night with this still residing in my Steam library, mocking me with its existence, a constant reminder that I paid for it.Cons:-After purchasing it, you have to get someone else to buy it too or you'll die in seven days. Luckily, for you at least, this game has sucked out my will to live.-Suuuuuuuupah buggy. And not in a funny or enjoyable way with craptacular renderings, objects comically going through walls due to poodoo collision, and other crazy visual effects that you can document and laugh at so much as an, ""Oh, there's my desktop and an error message. Again."" kinda way.-Some settings require adjusting an .ini and the game tells you as much. Lollios in a box of lols, true believers.-You pay for it. Like, this would be an okay game that somebody pops out for free as a means of getting their career up n' runnin' but ten daru is pricey for what plays like a buggy mod of 007: Goldeneye with improved graphics. Feel free to put quotation marks on ""improved"" if you're feelin' picky.-Think of a con. Flip a coin. If it's heads, it has it. And my money. It totes has my monies regardless of which side of the coin you see.-You feel like a failure after buying this game. A rube and a failure. With ten fewer dollars in your bank account. That you'll never have back. You coulda got a value meal at Wendy's, large and with all the fixin's, but nay. NAY! You fell for paltry advertising, you skimmed over descriptions, and totally failed to look up the background of an unknown game. You instead went all Fry meme style and said, ""Take my money!"" And they took it. Oh, they took it. And now you feel ashamed everytime you see this game listed in your library. Mocking you with it's lame achievements. You don't want your Steam friends to know you have it. Heck, you can't even complete the game just to feel like you used what you bought because it's a crashtacular crashmo with extra crash gravy on the side and crunchy crash chips on top. So, instead, you describe your failure in a review, putting your own purchasing experience in the third person so you don't have to consciously own what ya did.-You waste, like, five minutes writing the game a bad review because it totes took ten dollars from you that you'll never get back and you're all butthurt over it.

												Usually I dont play more than 2 or 3 games per year, no time for more......so perhaps I should have been more picky before throwing myself into the dark here.Or better not.It is hard to tell what the game actually is. I could write a book about it and still it wouldnt cover all aspects.Is it the next ""oh look how bad it is"" experience like surgeon or goat simulator?Nope.Is it a trash game as advertised?Yes, it has a certain B-movie atmosphere, it is extremely cheesy when it wants to be, but its not something that feels put together cheap and quickly. The sheer amount of small details hidden in all parts of the levels tells otherwise.As well as the fact that political events from the last three years are covered and the game had been in development since 2011.Is it a horror game?It has jump scares and goosebump moments, but thats not the essenceIs it a shooter?You have some challenging firefights, but thats also not the essence of the game.Is it an adventure?Nope, while there are some interesting puzzles, most of the tasks are looking for keys and items that are used by pressing ""Enter"" on a single spot.Is it funny?Oh my god, yes, it is!Is it worth the time and money?For me a clear ""yes"" on that one.Is it a good game?Well, thats the point where things get complicated.If you are one of those players who expect a game to explain everything to you, to lead and guide you, to highlight and show all you need to do, a game that pats you on your shoulder for klicking the button it has highlighted previously, run away and never look back. You have no right to be here.If you dont have a PC that is at least between the min and the recommended specs, forget this game. When I play on my office machine, which is close to the min specs, I get all the bad behaviour people are complaining about - > sloppy physics, stuck monster, horrible AI, sloppy responsiveness. When I switch to my gaming laptop, I get superlethal soldiers chasing me around using elevators and hideouts, beutiful ragdolling, smooth gameplay...If you dont agree to the developers arrogant demand to play the game as righthander with WASD controls, think twice. There is no option menu. And when I tell you no options menu, I am dead serious. All is changed in a script (including screen brightness, which is another, different script), and there are multiple-pages tutorials on how to do so. The devs are supportive, they will even write you custom ini scripts, but the sheer blatant arrogance to publish a game without options menu is so amazing that I am not even mad.If you stop playing a game because of occasional crashes, turn around here. They are rare, some can be prevented, there is always a savegame to load afterwards - but you wont get through without experiencing them.If you are a success-driven finisher, a player who is dedicated to ""beat"" a game as fast and efficient as possible, spend your money on something else.Read the following lines:""Mc Carthy""""Necronomicon""""Maniac Mansion""""Nikola Tesla""""Giana Sisters""""Commodore 64""""George Romero""""Project Paperclip""If 4 or more didnt ring a bell, you are wrong here.However, if you made it so far without being sorted out, and if you are not cursed by either an IQ below the average room temperature or the unspeakable someone could call ""typical German humor"", you might enjoy this game to an unhealthy degree. Because it is unique, it is funny, it is intriguing - if played right. And that means taking your time, reading the ingame notes, the mission notes (triggered by ""M""), tinkering around to follow the hints, reading most of the paper pieces hidden on walls, floors, drawers, listening to the dialogues (oh my god, that voice acting alone will either brake you or make you laugh) and, most of all, trying out even the most stupid things. Like getting drunk before a fight or playing a piano in a brothel full of zombie hookers.The reward is a mixture of excellent jokes, insane easter eggs, funny references, a trashy B-Movie-storyline, shameless backtracking, dozens of ""WTF"" moments, some boobs and ♥♥♥♥♥s, even more trashy cutscenes and. if you get them, some really intelligent, subversive and cynical political statements.Plus ""The Night of the Living Dead"" to be seen in an ingame cinema, full lenghts, accompanied by some skeletons who claim to be extras from the movie.I still cant tell if its good for you, because so much depends on who you are. My personal opinion is that this game, in all its trashy quirkyness, is among my all-time-favorites and gave me plenty if really entertaining hours, hopefully there are more to come. The developers should be slapped for their lazyness, arrogance and disrespect for comfort functions, but afterwards I would praise them for something that is in its better moments far more entertaining than any AAA game today.Also, I am not stating ""All people who dont find this game to be funny are stupid"" as some other ""fans"" do, I go with ""People who dont find this game to be funny are people I wouldnt invite to my parties"".I love this game, but I cant tell if you will, too. At 10$ asked, you should try it yourself.PS: An interesting side note on the reviews. While they are mixed, there is a significant difference in the positive and negative reviews: Most positive reviews talk about the flaws, too, they warn, they tell ""the recommendation depends on (insert variable)"". Most negative reviews tell outright ""its bad"" or even (gosh!) ""Its not funny"" in a way that seems like the writer wants to tell others what to think. Some even bash those who like the game.So, while they certainly failed to create a perfect game, the devs perhaps suceeded in creating a playable hater detector :D			"

												It can be interesting and as long as you go into it expecting low quality everything you won't be disappointed, However stability is not great as I experienced upon death on the second level and finding that the save for level 2 crashes the game when I try to load it. For me this is one of the worst types of bugs and a game breaker. I hope it's not a regular occurence as I won't play much further if I'm forced to keep repeating large chunks of gameplay. As it stands I'd give ""Into the Dark a 5 out if 10 score, If the bug was a one-off I'll add an edit to the review and improve on that score.			"

												A strange, weird and bizarre game.This CAN be one of the best games you have ever played. If you get the more intelligent and subtle jokes (next to the brute-force attacks of questionable taste), if you take your time to examine the locations and if you are intelligent (and educated) enough to get at lest 50% of the hundreds of references, hints and conclusion hidden, this is an awesome, outstanding, one-of-a-kind gaming experience.If not, you may end up like dozens others having played less than 1-2 hours and ragequit the game, whining about crashes, bugs or ""how bad it is"". It is NOT. It has some annyoing bugs, some funny bugs and occasional crashes.The gameplay is quite questionable and pretty dumb in its core, but has its highlights. The art design is quite good, also most of the visuals contribute to their respective scene - rooms that should be ugly are ugly as hell, the bonus level on the other hand looks as awesome as the surroundings should be.Yes, this game has all the ingredients that you could hate from the bottom of your heart. It is buggy on occasion, it is rough, unpolished and offensive. But it is also an amazing piece of art and intelligent entertainment. "

												Latest patches have improved game greatly, given us an options menu.   Also, a friendly mutant taught me Latin.Enemies are quite tough, but there isn't that many of them.  (yet, anyway) There are enough health packs in the game, this is handled quite well by the game.  It's different, quirky, and a heck of a lot of fun.  If you're looking for another run and gun shooter,  this isn't it.  Very hard to categorize, a bit of adventure game, rpg, and of course FPS.  Don't know why my time played is so low, it should be more like 5 -6 hours.  I had some CTD problems with early version, latest seems rock solid.   I did have one crash when changing levels, but it saved just before exiting level before, no problem.Really, if you did have a crash and lost some progress, that would be a feature, as it would had to game replayability.   ;)			"

												I get that the game is trying to be ironically bad, but it's not, it's just plain bad. It takes forever to load, sometimes you end up in a immobile non-dead state. Unless you hear and comprehend the lame 'clues' you'll never figure out how to progress. The audio is terrible, 'music' and background sound effects are loud, but dialog is really quiet and no adjustments for that. With thousands of better games out there, play any of those instead, heck play solitare.			"

												Game runs on old fps engine = motion sickness.The healing in this game is really annoying, pauses your character and you sit through a short 5 second stiching sound to heal everytime.The aim/accuracy with guns is horrible too.Combat feels like shooting cardboard boxes AI.Puzzles are not interesting, you just basically spam the use key to pick up hard to see keys/items and try to open doors.

												This ""game"" is a perfect and sad example of what is wrong with steam these days. Pure mess, far away from being a joke even, that would be even a shame to be published in 90s as a shareware demo. Honestly there is zero good things about this piece of rubish,  this thing (I refuse to call it a game) is totally random and EXTREMELY unpolished and nope, it is NOT playable at all. +nothing-no basic options in the game (you have to edit .ini file to get to it)terrible ""voice acting"" (recorded via cheap mic with horrible, pretentious accent)gameplay stops when there is a voice played in the ""game""barely any fun from a choppy, terrible gameplaylooped music that gets annoying after... few minutes of playterrible, absolutely terrible animation of enemieslack of any interesting story0/10 = piece of s to the maxThis is nothing but a simple , very unpolished piece of garbage and shouldn't be sold as a ""game"". Please do yourself a favour and avoid.			"

												To be honest, I don't WANT to recommend this game, I will, mostly due to pride, but I really don't wanna. It's not worth the price tag, it's not that great. As a fellow FPSC developer, I loved the idea that a game made in my engine got some manner of ""success"" on steam. It's really funny, and really kitschy and indie, but that's about all this game has going for it. The graphics are bad in comparison to most other games (even most games in the price range), and the gameplay is nothing special besides a few semi-interesting puzzles. I recommend this only for those looking to see the technical limits of the FPSC engine in the ""graphical"" sense.@the developer: You can be proud of squeezing so much out of such an underpowered rag, and creating a believable, well thought out tale, but when it comes to the artistic side of things (aesthetics of scenery, custom non-model pack media), or the actual ""funness"" of the game (number of moments where I'm smiling, unconcerned that I am playing a video game), it's nowhere near worth the price tag. Had this game been free, it would have been compared to all the other free games i've played, and I would've loved it, but being a 7$ game, It gets compared to other AWESOME games that I've payed 7$ for like chaser or E.Y.E. or Hover: Revolt of Gamers, thus shining a bad light on this game.tl;dr: ok game, technically amazing for the game engine you used, but I would have preferred it to be free, even if it meant it was 1/4 the length. you could've definitely squeezed just as much humour and told the same story.

												True to its description, Into The Dark is to video gaming what B movies are to Hollywood. It's campy, littered with bad jokes, and bears an undercurrent of German jokes most Americans really won't get (and maybe aren't meant to). The puzzles are almost painfully simple, at least at first, and the setting is hastily thrown together (with love, I'm sure). But let's face it, you're not buying this game for triple A production value, famous voice actors, and revolutionary graphics -- you're buying it for the same reason you watched Mystery Science Theater 3000 and Iron Sky. It's goofy. It's fun. It's a playful little romp that will have you facepalming at times when you really should be pulling the trigger oh god it's the Nazi zombies again and you're dead and haven't saved the game for half an hour. Buy it. Play it. Put it down and never touch it again. And remember that no other game in your library, past or present, will give you an experience this uniquely nutty and bad.			"

Posted: April 29, 2015
												I can appreciate the class of games out there that are soooo bad they are good. A great example of this is Rat Hunter (FPS) or Harvester (old point and click with FMV). I heard a lot of people say Into the Dark was a buggy pile of poop but was over the top, outrageous, and entertaining. I can put up with poorly made buggy games, but this game is in the class of:So Bad, that is really is Bad.The game is terribly frustraiting, with a lot of senseless, extremely poorly executed puzzles that are game stopping.Often, you will find yourself referencing a walkthru or reloading because you die so easily in the same room for any random reason. In FPS games, IT HAPPENS, but the load times are long for an old looking game like this (looks 15 years old). Nothing is explained well, you pretty much run around a series of rooms trying to figure out how to advance to the next room/rooms. This makes progression extremely slow and cumbersome. There are a lot of other features, situations, humor, etc., but you can never appreciate or enjoy them because you are too busy trapped in some place because there is no clear way to get out. I don't expect hand holding but the game is very vague and the mechanics are so poor they do not marry to what you need to do to progress. A lot of times, any in-game speech or text alludes to what you must do, but the game level doesn't match up with what they are talking about. ""Put the bomb in the hole under the door"". There are lots of doors and none have a hole - for example. The mechanics are extremely inconsistent with the game engine so prepare to screw up a lot.In fact, the puzzles are so bad, there are pictures of the game developer in the game giving you hints.In the level I mentioned, the other problem was just learning that you have to make a bomb. In a prior level, you could shoot an explosive ""cube"" from a distance to blast through. In another level, you find a cube, but it doesn't explode if you shoot it. So the rules change for that level without the player being told. You see some explosive gas tanks but they kill you regardless of distance. Once you get the bomb making materials, you have to put in on a lab table, but you are not told that, or which one. You just have to use the walkthru.  If this was some game where you are told there is a way to craft things, and these are the hotkeys, then that would make sense. But this is designed to operate as a simple FPS, so YEAH, the puzzle solutions totally do not marry well.The generic monster enemies charge you and pound you to death.There is no way to sneak around them and if you blow your ammo, you are screwed.That's fine, but sometimes, you can die in 5 hits or 1 hit. It's pretty random.Same with the enemies, one monster took 3 hits to die, another took 8.Headshots, heartshots, stuff like that don't even matter. So it's all random.This means, even if you conserve ammo, you can still use up your ammo, and still not bring the enemy down.They can also randomly spawn.If you want a very challenging PUZZLE game, give it a try, and don't use the walkthrus (even with, still challenging). If you want a run and gun FPS, pass. It's not that kind of game.It's too bad, if the game didn't have so many puzzles slowing it down, it would be much more enjoyable as a horror FPS. What's GOOD though: the dark grittiness, the cheapo-creepy atmosphere; I even enjoyed the bad voice acting.I surmise the obstacles were designed to MAKE THE GAME FEEL LONGER.After playing the ""Into the Woods"" free ""game"" that came with it,  the flaws of Into the Dark start to make sense. Into the Woods: you wake up in a forest and aren't told anything. No problem with that. You explore some ruins, find some ammo, a key, then bad guys spawn to kill you. Each small area is gated so you must find the key to get to the next one. It can be anywhere, laying in the grass, in one of many ruins, etc.When you finally get to a certain area, the game ends. EXTREMELY short.Now, imagine that indoors in cramped rooms, hallways, and puzzles mismatching with the FPS mechanics to SLOW PROGRESSION DOWN, instead of the outdoor distances you have to run to find a key laying in the grass somewhere.Add to it: they're very small glitchy levels with puzzles you often don't even know exist.Previously, this game was put out as a horror FPS. I noticed they now say it's an Adventure/FPS. LOL.Also, look at the description 11 levels but 67 puzzles. That's a lot of puzzles for such a small game with small ""levels"" (again, more like a collection of connected rooms).Thumbs down primarily due to:-Long Load Times-Puzzles that you didn't know were puzzles and that couldn't even be solved the way they need to, the way described, in a limited FPS game environment-Never got to see the much touted boobies and hookers!

												I see that there are a lot of people claiming that this game is the perfect B-Movie-Experience. Unfortunately neither these gamers nor the developer unterstand how the whole ""So bad it's good""-thing works. Watching a bad and unintentionally humourus movie is like seeing someone fail and that is genuinely funny. It's like watching a skateboarder trying to do a trick but falling on his face over and over again. You just  know it is not the morally right thing to do but you still find it funny. Playing a bad game is more like being the skateboarder. While a game is still a guided experience someone else pulled out of his ***, you are in control and have to adapt to the scenarios the developer is throwing at you. That is why seeing a ""Let's play"" of a game like ""Ride to Hell Retribution"" is fun to watch the whole way through while actually playing it quickle dwindles to pure frustration.""Into the dark"" has no redeeming feature whatsowver. Even the humour is never as smart or self-aware as it wants to be. Refering to quantum physics and popcultur isn't funny without a context, it's just trying way to hard. However the game doesn't stop there: The controls are slow and clunky, the key bindings very uncomfortable, the graphics subpar and WAY to dark and the shooting mechanics unimpressive and overly frustrating with enemies often spawning behind you and clipping through virtually every object. The puzzle design shall not be named as such, with unintuitive solutions and keys randomly appearing. And if you still want to play it, get ready for the same one-minute piece of music repeated over and over again, even during menus.""Into the Dark"" is a bad joke that will be gone soon and rightfully so. If you want a B-movie experience I recommend ""House of the Dead: Overkill"". Comes without headaches.			"

It's no longer just another shooter, but a story that exists and unfolds inside the most convincing and elaborate and artistic game world ever conceived. Into the Dark is the sign of gaming realising its true cinematic potential.

												I brought INTO THE DARK today and played for thirty three minutes after watching b-movies all morning and it was an eerie transition as i played INTO THE DARK feeling as i had gone from watching to being inside a b-movie. Love the atmosphere with the mix of seriousness and campy adult humor. The voice acting is great to hear because of its authentic natural sound instead of something that feels too polished and scripted. Kind of like the difference between raw VHS and shiny clean BLU-RAY quality.Music grabbed me by the throat and has not let go as soon as I heard the first notes at the intro scene. The amount of interaction with the environment was a welcomed unexpected surprise. Love the amount of detail of use with the health kits :DThank you for INTO THE DARK and looking forward to your future work. Paying this little for something so great is a bit guilt inducing ha ha.

												I am REALLY divided for this one game...On one hand, it crash awful 1/4 the times I load a save.I load a save, 3/4 of the time because ""monsters"" kill you (me) in 2-3 hits and indeed, it takes a full ammo clip of the regular beretta to go down...This is really the frustrating part. I am angry right now, writing this review...Yet... There is something holding my interest behind all this God damn annoyance....I do not know... I want to uninstall this but I keep coming back getting killed and client crashed...? WHY!			"

												I`ll be honest: I am a freeloader, one of those gready ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who lurke around ModDB and IndieDB and download every free game they can get and every interesting demo version published. I don´t buy more than 2-3 games per year, and the only reason I signed up with steam was the free key I got for having bought the Into the Dark Desura version almost a year ago.And even I tell you, that this game is really great value for the little money asked.First of all, forget all the morons who write bad reviews after playing less than 2 hours or having unlocked less than 40% of the achievements yet. Judging the game upon such impressions is like judging the old Star Wars movies upon the flying text in the begininng.Second, you have to deal with the fact that the game won´t make it easy to change the controls if needed (but the default ones are good enough if you aren´t left-handed). And you have to deal with occasional crashes. These are not a big deal, as long as you exit the game after dying and follow the guidelines posted, you won´t have more than 2-3 crashes total. all of them on loading a new level. And the game creates savegames prior to the exits, so no big deal. The game itself is weird, beautiful, excentric and strange. You have to look around carefully to get all the beautiful and fascinating details the developers crafted into the levels, and it´s totally worth it. The shooter part works really good as long as you have a fast PC, and some of the puzzles are quite interesting.But, most of all, the ingame bonus content, the jokes, references, gags, political messages, slapstick moments and dialogues are over the top. Yes, Pete has a horrible accent, but that´s part of the game - and even part of two puzzles. Yes, the voice actors are amateurs, but they talk naturally to each other, instead of actors who read their lines alone in the studio. The visuals are ugly where showing ugly places, and stunning like the Playboy Mansion where beauty is asked for. From a technical point of view, the graphics are clearly above par.You would have to be either stupid, ignorant or a heartless ♥♥♥♥♥ with no humor at all to find this game NOT amusing, entertaining and funny.The Desura version was my best buy 2013, and the Ste4am version is indeed better.If you have the wits and knowledge needed, and some good nerves for occasional crashes, it´s a best buy for sure.

												If Troma Studios were in the game making business, Into the Dark: Ultimate Trash Edition would be a highlight of their oeuvre. Into the Dark encompasses everything a 'B' movie fan adores. If I had one wish, it would be that Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz experience a playthrough of this game and adapt it to the biggest small screen they could.			"

												You either love it or hate it - there is nothing in between.The game shows several features that can annoy a player who expects the same behavior like in any other common game. As an example, instead of offering a settings menu, it simply draws its GFX settings from your graphics cards driver settings and the resolution from your displays native resolution. Clever idea, but if you want to override it, you have to go into the setup.ini hell (which is explained pretty well in the forums and the manual).Enter is the default key for any environment interaction, so you have to let go your mosue to interact.Stupid? On the contrary, that gives a good feeling that you are right now doing something in the game where you need both hands and cannot shoot in the meantime.The developers also tricked many DRM- and Steam-opponents like me to hook up with steam by giving free Steam keys to Desura buyers. Not sure, if this is a good thing or something evil.All those facts ignored, the game is still a matter of personal taste - and the intelligence of the player. If you got the wits and the basic knowledge to at least most of the jokes, and if you are a player looking around carefully instead of rushing through the levels, there ain´t many games out there more entertaining than this one.It´s filled with bad jokes, sinister jokes, references, political messages and a dense web of connections between all those, with so many details and depicted thoughts it can blow your mind. While it looks ugly, the consistency of the art design in the levels is pretty good, and most textures are extremely detailled, from the technical point of view the graphics aint bad at all.The crashes are annoying, but not game-breaking, as there is always a savegame to go on.In the end, the conclusion will always be ""You either love it or hate it"".However, for 10$ (or 2,50 in the Gala bundle or 6$ during the summer sale) you got the movie ""Night of the Living Dead"", a song by Nox Arcana AND a game with 6 - 12 hours of playtime that you will either hate or really enjoy as guilty, trashy pleasure.Not hard to recommend at all.

												a Pretty solid horror game or at least it has its moments from what i know it was made for the oculous rift and playing it with one would be horrifying. it trys to do things in a different fashion and i believe it does some things very well, however the controls take a bit of getting used to and there are no options menu so changing out your keys envolves actually going into the directory to adjust them properly the voice acting could use a bit of work but thats just my opinion and the in game ""real old timey videos"" make for a weird yet good feeling to the game. but overall its a solid play and at 10 dollars its really not a bad buy.video below

												DEAR DEVELOPERS!I read your warning message saying that into the dark uses up nearly 2gb of memory and can not use any more. I noticed the main .exe is not set to large adress aware (which means it can't use over 2047mb system ram even if it wanted). If you check the game .exe in CFF explorer you will see this http://i1324.photobucket.com/albums/u607/RandalMcdaniels/laa_zps3c475aa5.jpgYou see where it says ""App can handle >2gb adress space"" is unchecked?Which means the application can not use more than 2047mb of system ram. All you have to do is check that box and save the changes to the app and it will solve the problem.You can also just use 4gb_patch which does the same exact thing.			"

Hard to play, because I want to figure out how it ends, but the game-play mechanics are often outdated or make no sense.

												This game is an odd little fellow: On the one hand, ""Ultimate Trash"" quite hits the mark, and expecting deep and extensive game mechanics is beyond its point. But on the other hand, you will find yourself having fun with all the side blows, hidden remarks and strange events you will be facing that it lets you discover. But be warned, half the fun is finding everything there is to find, and it certainly won't present all its beauty on a silver platter for the lazy CoD-Player to be consumed. And be to look up a *lot* of stuff on wikipedia when it comes to historical and/or political references. At least I had to, and the depth of several findings in there only revealed itself after getting to know the details of e.g. McCarthy era America or ""Project Paperclip"".Don't expect a lot in graphics, it is sufficient and functional, no more. But the attention to detail the Devs put into every single room, every single table, yes even every single rack standing around is just astounding, and makes the world more alive in your head than any stunning graphics dazzler puts in their levels.All in all, definitely not a game for everybody, but recommended nonetheless!

												Choking hazard: Never play this game while eating or drinking. Both jump scares AND laughter could kill you. Sometimes at once.Dislike hazard: Not suitable for casual gamers, comfort-zone-huggers, minors, linear-gameplay-lovers, hasty players or outright stupid people.If you got a proper IQ, sinister humor, a basic knowledge of history and the patience to explore the environments, the game is awesome. Might take some levels to get into the mood, but then......trash, humor, horror, comedy, action, puzzles and more easter eggs than you can imagine. You name it, you get it. Also some nasty glitches.EDIT 1:The game gets better with each level, but it also shows some shortcomings in the process of progressing.While the visual appearance becomes really nice from level 4 on, the backtracking is a little bit too much for my taste. If you use it for the neverending search for easter eggs and jokes, it seems fine, but if you want to go to the next level asap, it can get annoying. However, I love the amount of small details woven into the level design and the props you find there.			"

This game is a trash-gem. sometimes it is a little bit stubborn, but compared to all teh ""always the same"" AAA-Shooters this game has a soul. Okay, a dirty, drinking, zynic and complete nuts soul. but a soul.So buy it, play it, laugh.Don't belive me? Look out for the ""Lets Play"" Videos on youtube. First, they were mocking that game, but then they fell kinda in love with it and played it all the way. so be warned, even if the lets play video are from an earlier version, they contain MASSIVE spoilers.You have been warned.

 I bought this, m8s. In a bundle. This is punk rock as sh*tDepending on your view this can either be a good or a bad thing. I don't understand why everyone feels the need to point out that the developers said it was like a B-movie, but I'm going to do the same thing. In fact, I'm going to go further and say that it's more of a C-Movie. If you're not into underground gore flicks, you're probably not going to enjoy this game. That genre translates well into this medium.Not B-horror, but C-horror and no budget horror. Look up a movie called Zombie Bloodbath by a Director named Todd Sheets - I think it's up on Youtube for free right now along with some other stuff. That's the genre we're talking about here. The worst recordings, the bottom-of-barrel editing. This game has it all, but tops it off with the worst voice acting I've ever heard. There are two ways to do horrible voice acting - good or bad. In this case, it's pretty good. I was asked to review the game...Not by the developer, but it came up from someone I know, and it had been awhile since I've picked it up and played it - so WHY NOT, I figured, I'll play it again. Sometimes the humor in it can be way, way too much to deal with - that's just the nature of low budget/no budget movies put into a game. The mini game doesn't work at all.Never has. The game is huge...5 gigabytes is ridiculous for something like this. If you want something a little different...If you want something a little different, you should look elsewhere. If you want something a lot different, you might like this. As other people have said, this game feels a lot like something you yourself could make. In fact, it seems like something you yourself could make with very little effort - even though a lot of effort probably went into it. It's made with Game Guru, which I still maintain doesn't make a game bad - and it's pretty goofy. There are some really bizarre hiccups in the game that should really be ironed out, but if you can deal with closing and reopening a game a bunch of times, they're not too bad. It's okay - get it in a bundle, or something. For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here! "

												I got the game on desura based on a let's play video, where the two guys just wanted to make fun of the game but then got so fascinated that they made a full series and played through the whole game. I know exactly what it is, I understand the spirit behind this sub genre and I enjoyed the game more than 90% of the games in my steam library. thats why I just bought it again and will give it another run asap, since I am sure I missed so many references and jokes during the first time. If you are not a fan of satire, black humor and bad taste jokes, you should probably stay away from this as you woulnd´t get the special charm.If you liked first person shooters that where a little rough around the edges back in the good old days and you can appreciate well made cheesyness and tons of funny little details you should give it a try!

												Repulsive, puerile and stupid.  So why couldn't I stop playing?  This game has got a lot of flack and I do understand where they're coming from, given the obvious technical limitations of the developer (not to mention, a very lacking QA effort).  I myself was tempted to ragequit after the 3rd time the game bombed to desktop.  But to those in a similar situation, I implore you to persevere!  This isn't at all like the other budget, horribly made horror games on steam.  There is a self-awareness and tongue-in-cheek worshop of trashy horror flicks from a bygone era here that is not without its charm.This game does wear ""rough"" as a badge and it never lets up in turning you from one thrown together cliche to another, and once I got into the pace of it, I was loving it!  Go into this game with expectations of offensive obscenity with a knowing wink and you won't be disappointed.			"

Warning: light spoilers (not touching the story) inside. Into the review: I’ll try to waste as much of your time as possible, so sit down and make yourself comfortable ;)Into the graphics: It’s hard to discuss the thing that does not exist (except God, of course), so we’re lucky there’s too dark to see the trashy and horrific textures or sprites.Into the sound: At first I understood nothing of the narrators mumbling and was about to quit, but suddenly came across this note from devs. After that I had been drinking for three days before the things were sorted out, at least I got the idea that the protagonist must be somehow (magic wand?) converted into a gay and placed into the Playboy mansion. Hmm.Into the violence: You know, I’m from former Soviet Union, so from time to time I had to cover my on-table dog’s head connected to artificial heart with a rag to protect it from seeing many outrageous scenes.Into the racist jokes: Can’t stand them. I hate two things in life – racism and some lower races.Into the scientific value: If you complete the game you will surely solve ‘Schrödinger's cat’s paradox'. Or not. Whatever.Into the monsters: They are really scary. Have a look at this one.  I fought it in the middle of the game, but for sure it would perfectly suit to any AAA horror project as a main boss!Into the achievements: On finding a vintage adult movie I unlocked the achievement “History of p0rn”. I could have recollected one of the first adult movies I had seen in my life – it was called “Look what’s up my @$$”. As for me – a great replacement for the original game title! Into the game itself: On my half-way through I understood that I was in Matrix. Unfair Matrix with agent Smith, but without any call-boxes to get out. Since that very moment I spent all my efforts looking for the way out. I even forgot I had been playing to see some promised boobs and was greatly surprised when suddenly came across them. By the way, boobs were pretty good! (I haven’t posted the screenshot; otherwise everyone will lose any motivation to beat this game;) But even after that my intention of escaping was strong. In a level called “Into the green” I finally managed to get over the fence and breathe the smell of freedom. Beautiful green textures with roses were my reward. As you can see all I had left was a business card of some Henry Von Edelkase, probably, he was a psychologist and I had to phone him in order to forget everything I had seen in game. Not sure, better call Saul.P.S. Really, I love this game very much, it has made me laugh not once during the walkthrough, and I greatly appreciate it. P.P.S. Special thanks for the song “Katusha” in German. P.P.P.S. ‘Marasmus + diligence = decent trash’ (c)			"

												If you're into dark and edgy humor, you will absolutely love this game. Into the Dark offers a sinister atmosphere that melds perfectly with its dark humor, theme, and hilarious easter eggs. The epic story, intelligent references and its atmosphere make up for the random bugs, certain technical problems and the lack of a ""Settings"" section. If you are that type of person that doesn't play games for their graphics and has a background of WWII events knowledge, then you will find this piece of art very entertaining and humorous.9/10 would play again.

												Wow .... Its like if Re-Animator, Frankenhooker, Dead Alive and Evil Dead all had an orgy and from that, came a video game baby. It would be this game lol. Its amazing, its really like playing a B film. Some of the clipping errors can be ""Grrrr"" but the game (and the errors) are presented in a way thats actually acceptible? Odd to say that out loud, but there it is. The game his great fun, funny as hell and sick as any Troma movie (If youve never watched a Troma film ... or any of the other films I talked about at the begining of the this massive run on sentence, you may want to pass on this game. Youve been warned.)Its not the best looking and there is nothing inventive, but there really isnt suppose to be, this a GREAT game for B Horror and Grindhouse-esq fans, if (like me) that is you, then you need to stop reading, you should have stopped reading when I described what the game feels like, if your still reading then FRIGGIN QUITE!!! Go buy it already, you wasted enough time. BUY IT and Enjoy :D			"

												So buggy it's unbearable. Constant clipping, enemies glitching, jittery mouse movements, and inability to change any controls in the main menu. Some controls don't even show up in start up menu (such as melee attack); I didn't even know you could melee attack until level 3. Every time you respawn, your character loses some life because the character model gets dropped into the map a few feet above the ground. Sometimes, the cursor would randomly slide downwards or my character would walk backwards without me pressing any buttons. The so-called ""voice acting"" is atrocious and there are a lot of times where you must listen to their cringy dialogue and you can't even move around. The graphics look like from 1998 and the gameplay is like from 1994. Don't bother with this one, it is so BAD that it is just simply BAD.			"
