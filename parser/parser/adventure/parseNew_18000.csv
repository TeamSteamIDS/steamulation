AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness, Episode One Original Release: 2008 Genre Tags: RPG; Adventure; Parody; Comedy My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 5-10 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Casual gamers REVIEWOn the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness, Episode One is a very amusing indie RPG; and it is splendidly short and sweet.  It boasts solidly designed and enjoyable RPG elements, with a light and hilarious story.  This is a good pick-up for any casual RPG fans out there looking for some lighthearted fun.Technically, this is a parody game— but to be honest it plays better than many modern “real” RPGs that are emerging from the indie realm.  It plays like an old-school, turnbased-combat RPG, complete with leveling-up elements and a mild form of gear upgrading.  The gameplay is definitely fun and the RPG elements will keep you addicted to the progression.  You will find yourself striving to reach that next milestone of development as you play through the hilarious campaign.On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness, Episode One is a Penny Arcade game. The story is fun and funny; it doesn’t take itself too seriously.  It is very lighthearted and the game is packed with hilarious and immature humor.  The characters are likeable, and cartoonish.  The art style is charming and fits the atmosphere of the game perfectly.  It all comes together as a very comic-like production.It is the perfect game for a casual RPG fan that wants to play something light and easy, and may not be in the mood for one of the more in-depth, immersive, and incredibly long RPGs out there.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												If you're into the penny-arcade humor, characters and comic strips then this game will be a very fun and hilarious ride. It takes about 6-7 hours to complete on normal difficulty and the game progression is pretty linear. The story is very penny-arcade in fashion so don't expect anything logical happening at all. That's actually where half the fun is.The combat is turn-based but you need to press buttons in right sequences or pump them up in order to deal heavy special attack damage. It's a pretty fun albeit shallow combat system to be honest for the amount of game we have here. You can also use simple buff items and traps.Other than that, not much else to experience here. You can beat the game on a harder difficulty or try to hunt all the achievements but a short, sweet game nonetheless for PA fans.			"

												An episodal RPG that is in 4 parts. This is the 1st part of the 4 parts. NOTE: BE AWARE THIS GAME IS NOT FOR LITTLE KIDS. There is swearing and other things in it that makes it not good for young children. I would rate it ""A"" for adults only.AS for the game itself, it is a rpg with different skills for the characters and the character you create is customizable and can be used in the next part of the series. The bosses are quite funny and many cutscenes are done like a comic book. In fact the game is based on a comic book i belive. Anyways, it is quite fun and im going to recommend it for funny scenes, rpg type fights and skills, and hilarious bosses.			"

												Do you want to play a fun RPG? Then Penny Arcade Adventure is the game for you.This game it's just great from the beginning: you can create you own character that will actually appear in the comic-cutscenes, and for most of the game you have do deal with fruit-♥♥♥♥ing robots, mimes and clowns. And your only weapon is a rake. Yea.The story is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing and fun, the drawings and the art-style it's really good looking, and each character haves his own personality, expecially the ones that will escort you.The animations are nice looking, sadly they didn't really made a lot of them, same for NPC civilians moving around the city, so some npc might look like duplicated dools staying here doing nothing.The combat sisteam is kinda unique: it's a classic RPG combat like MarioRPG or Final Fantasy, but with some sort of quicktime event that you'll have to do to block incoming attack or to make your special move way more powerful. The items sistem is unique too: did you know that slot balm make you more slow? Me neither.Final Score: 8/10It's fun, it's cheap, it's amazing. Get it.			"

												Blends arcane horror and Penny Arcade humor into an adventure game/old-school RPG with active-time battles and rhythm minigame supermoves.  The world of Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness is fascinating, the story is unique, and the game is usually fun, but it has a few difficulty spikes and it's easy to slip up and lock yourself out of endgame bonuses.

												""If you were going to shoot a mime, would you use a silencer? "" (Steven Wright) Something to wonder about when playing this game!The first encounter with a Fruit♥♥♥♥er was a true WTF moment... No one ♥♥♥♥s my oranges and gets away with it!  No worried... it paid for what it has done!Enjoyed  it so much that I immediately started episode 2. Brought back good memories of when I played Toontown online from Disney.  Same fighting system.  Toontown does not excist anymore, but this game sure is a good replacement, even tho it is only single player. Because of the goodlooking cartoon style used, it really is not problem that the game is a bit old (2008). It still plays like a charm. I found it in standard mode pretty easy (did not die at all) , in higher difficulty it is actually hard work sometimes to kill the enemies (learning that in episode 2 now) . Finished the game in about 10 hours (standard mode), and might come back later for insane mode.   Definitly recommended! Highly enjoyable!			"

												On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness, Episode One is a great RPG title all-round. Humorously written witty dialog with plenty of laughs, as expected being based on the Penny Arcade[www.penny-arcade.com] web-comic, Episode One sets an amusing tone whilst still having an intriguing story of grand adventure and mystery. The cherry on top is the fantastic battle system which requires more involvement than just waiting on cooldowns. Highly recommended even if you've never read any Penny Arcade Comics, Episode Two is just as good and worth playing afterwards.			"

												As someone who was once a fan of Penny Arcade but who has no enthusiasm for it at time of playing, I believe I am in a good position to say that this just isn't a good game.The game is too short and confined.  You visit only 3 meaningful locales multiple times, and those locales are uninteresting.Combat is QTE-reaction based for the most part.  It works okay, but some QTEs are very easy and some are not so enemies are trivialized or a nuissance based purely on this.  Thematics for enemies work fine though, they were creative for the most part (aside from fruit ♥♥♥♥er who is more or less just a meme).  You find items and upgrades but they aren't very rewarding because the scale of the game is too short.  The formula of the mechanics just doesn't appeal here.The world has lots of text descriptions attached to objects in it, but they're all meaningless nonsense weirdness.  Sort of a mix of Hitchhiker's Guide with Jerry Holkins normal melancholy / grandiose style.  It doesn't grate on me, but its still meaningless.  Personally I just don't find his style all that appealing.The thematic of the game... its just Penny Arcade memes with a game as a shell.  I don't mind it, its just not going to be enjoyable if you aren't really into Holkin's writing or a PA fan.  I bought this and the other games quite a few years ago, maybe back then I would have felt the appeal more.			"

												After playing through both episodes, I've got to say that these two games have to be one of my most favorite pair of Indie Games ever. I never thought I'd hear myself give such high praise to a turn-based RPG(of which, I'm not too fond with turn based combat systems.) The writting alone makes these two games worth playing. It brings the humor of the Penny Arcade comics and the fun of an RPG and mashes them together, upgrades feel rewarding, the character customization feature is a really nice touch.(No matter what, your character looks like someone out of a Penny Arcade comic) and the enemies range from strange to down right bizarre. I was never a huge fan of the Penny Arcade comics, but these games are really fun. I've found myself laughing pretty hard at the comedic vulgarity which has a quite prominent existince throughout both of these games. There is a consistant atmosphere spanning each episode with each location being unique and fresh. These gems are a steal at retail price!			"

												Has it really been 4 years since this came out? As a PA fan, I am fail... oh well, better late than never. I wasn't sure what to expect from this, but it ended up being pretty good - not perfect, but satisfying enough for the price and length (5-6 hours). OtRSPoD is an interactive story wearing the clothes of a real-time turn-based RPG. What I mean is that there are never really any choices to make or side quests to take on, like you'd find in a typical RPG. From beginning to end, everything you do is part of a linear path (including a finite number of battles that leave your characters at their max level with full upgrades when completed). That said, I still found it fun, as the battle system was pretty cool. And if you are a fan if PA, you will also love the humorous story/interactions with Gabe & Tycho. It's a short ride and there's not much to it, but as you're slaughtering fruit-♥♥♥♥ers, hobos, clowns and mimes, you'll probably be too entertained to notice any of its shortcomings.			"

Maybe the stoyline is worth something and i don't know, but i do not care anymore: uninstalled and moved to my ""Maybe Later"" category. Could have been the ""Won't Play"" one but i feel like the outcome will be the same.I traded this game for some bundle leftover i didn't care much about but, hey, it's not that better - can't recommend.

No magic or additional skills found, just items and attack in a time-turn based combat.  The story is funny and some of the concepts are really fun & silling.... however the super simple gameplay made me not want to play it.

Foreword: I know most people disagree with my opinion, but I'm just being honest. Please, don't rate it down just because you loved the game =)Short Verdict: An okay humorous short RPG that has all my sympathy, but ultimately falls short. Although not entirely bad, mainly saved by its atmosphere, I can't really recommend it as a game. But I have to say that choosing between recommending it or not was a tough decision. By the way, I played it only because I got it in a bundle, but even so I almost couldn't get through the first hour. Still, I intend to play Episode Two in the future.Pros: Builds an awesome atmosphere, kinda reminded of me Sam & Max Packed with quality humor (I'm not the right audience for it, unfortunately) Funny, interesting characters Nice headquarters with a lot of info, like game stats, dossiers, bestiary, collectibles, missions etc. The artwork is awesome and I loved the comic-strip scenes The BGM is also very good Being able to customize your character is a cool featureCons: Fights are boring and very repetitive and the mechanic is poor, making them a slower process than it should be Mouse controls are bad, both in battle and moving your character around Difficulty is a roller coaster--sometimes really easy, then suddenly unforgiving, then back to a walk in the park Levelling up and upgrading your weapons were really not well implemented Collecting items is way too random and tedious (you have to break items that constantly respawn in the maps) An RPG with limited encounters? Check =( Really, it was an awkward feeling coming close to finish the game and not knowing if I'd be able to do all I had to do in battles. Most cases (missions) consist simply in fighting enemies, which is a bit lame Basically, it's a bad RPG game...I wish it were a point-and-click adventure--I would probably love it! The main story (if you can say this game has one) is pretty shallow and was poorly scripted, like someone was making it all up as they were writingBought on / for: Vancouver Edition by Humble Weekly Bundle for an average of US$ 0.25 (R$ 0,62). Great price for what you get, but I don't think it's worth its full price.			"

The combat was good because it keeps you involved and there is enough variety in your attacks to keep things interesting and your characters progress at a good rate. The point-and-click aspect of the adventure makes for some good detective atmosphere as well!			"

												A fantastic, focused, potential-filled first episode. Precipice of Darkness plays out like a western made JRPG centered around Super Mario RPG style combat with some light (classic) adventure game elements. The story stays on track for the most part and has enough side quests to flesh out characters and keep you interested in the few areas available for exploration. Inventory and equipment management are kept to a minimum with weapons being upgraded through point-and-click adventure mechanics. Just don't expect much of the comic's humor; I guess 4 pane webcomic humor doesn't translate well to a game so the devs just make everything wacky and so randumb.Clocking in at around 7 hours this is a healthy ""episode"" and worth picking up if you like JRPGs. Just don't expect much humor from the PA characters.			"

												Precipice Of Darkness is a turn based RPG with some excellent cel shaded graphics. The game itself is pretty straightforward but it's fun to do quests and collect allies. The highlight of this game are the battles which aren't really difficult but it's fun to team up with these allies and kick some♥♥♥♥♥ It also requires some timing to execute these attacks properly. It works rather nicely.And for an episode it's actually somewhat lenghty. It will take about 8 hours depending on your playstyle (collecting or not collecting). Unfortunately there isn't much replay value, but I guess that's why there's an episode two ;) Speaking of which... I never got around to playing that one...Anyway, get both of them for the current (excellent) price.[Rating: 85/100]			"

Posted: January 18, 2014
												Precipice of Darkness marks the first of a series of games staring the duo from the popular Penny Arcade web-comics. Verdict, a very satifying start.Story- you create the lead character and go on a quest for vengence on a giant robot that steps on your house. On the way, you join Gabe and Tycho, two paranormal investigators, in investigating strange phenomenon around town and ultimatly stop a strange cult of mimes from resurrecting an ancient god. The story combines a mix of Lovecraftian mythos with off-color humor and memorable characters (including your own) in a darkly funny story. Though the begining of a saga, the story is quite short and can be beaten in a few hours. A-Graphics- This is state of the art graphics... as of early release PS2 era. There is really nothing to boast about visually as the whole project was a low buget indie game. Its not ugly to look at but just nothing to write home about. The cinimatics though are in the style of the web-comics and were entertaining enough to look at but all in all, below standard. C-Sound- Music is nicely done but does not really stand out and the game sound effects work well but are fairly standard. Though I will give props to the only voice actor in the game as performs his role exceptionally well, even making me crack up several times in the game. B-Gameplay- This game works on a P.O.C. format that works well enough, but feels kinda clunky. The game would benefit well with controller but unfortunatly doesn't come with that option. Also I find that if I click on a spot with some objects in the way, the characters will run into the object and continue to do so for a couple of seconds before giving up, it was kinda annoing. The battle sequences, though, are very fun and provide a fair amount of challenge as you are forced to multi-task between several characters at once. It does take a little getting used to but it provides a less static battle format compared to other popular RPG's. C+Overall- The game does suffer several flaws such as control issues and short play time among other issues. I found it to be a very enjoyable and entertaining experience worth recommendation. C+			"

It's pretty short also so you might consider watching some gameplay videos before paying a full price of this game.			"

The humor is fantastic, as one would expect from PA, the graphics are ehhh, the game looks fantastic in the 2D, comic like dialogue, but the 3D world is somewhat ugly. The game is worth a look just for the fantastic humor, and it's rumored that a third episode is in the works by a new dev. 9/10.			"

												For those who've been living under a rock (that is to say those unfamiliar with the dynamic webcomic duo that is Mike Krahulik and Jerry Holkins of Penny Arcade) or take issue with having to read a fair deal, this game may or not be your particular cup of tea. It's writing (and by association the ""JokesTM"") was a little bit hit and miss for me, still entertaining but not particularly funny or engaging in the long term. The battle system is challenging enough to keep you engaged for the few hours it takes for the game to run it's full gamut. For fans of the comic it's a pretty interesting diversion, for the uninitiated you may find yourself afterwards balls (or equivalent genitalia) deep in 15+ years of Penny Arcade's archive attempting to understand why a robot is attempting to copulate with an orange.

Or at least that’s everything I gathered in 17 minutes of gameplay.I was in the mood to play something a little bit more hands off, and very light hearted; this game fit the bill perfectly. The character creation was stereotypical and exaggerated and the opening cinematic reminded me a lot of the Wallace and Gromit Telltale series. Sadly, I could not deal with the abominable performance issues for that 18th minute. The cutscenes were fine, but the moment the actual game engine took over my framerate tanked to 20 and never managed to make it past 30. This game is not a bad looker, but there is no excuse for this kind of laggy mess.			"

												Im a big fan of those oldschool turn based RPGs. This game could be bad as♥♥♥♥♥♥and I`d still love it I guess. But well, it isn`t at all. The ""On The Rain Slick"" series is very famous and popular. Brilliant and funny story telling combined with lovely handcrafted charakters. I strongly recommend that you begin your journey on the first Episode to understand the plot around the robots, but I wont spoil you that now ;) PS: My english is not the best and I had a hard time catching the jokes in this game. The protagonists joke in a way which is hard to get when english is not your native language, at least this is my opinion.			"

												I was searching for jrpgs to use with my newish Steam Controller.  The Steam Controller has me buying games again.  I'm a little annoyed this came up under a jrpg search, because it's basically a touch screen game.  So okay, let's play with the mouse, that's fine.  That would work, except for some reason, one extremely essential control is set to the space bar.  So don't plan on playing this on your TV unless you want a mouse and keyboard in your lap.  Not what I'm looking for, I regret this purchase.  A touch screen type game is literally the only thing the Steam Controller can't be applied to yet.			"

												I enjoyed this game and the story, it is just really sad if you are using a mac because this game previously worked for the mac and I managed to finish it on that, but for some reason they've since changed it and somehow broke it so that it no longer functions or is even playable on a mac at all. I have no idea what they did to it but this is just poor form.			"

												I've never really been a fan of MOST RPGs, generally because I don't have an interest in things revolving around knights, magic, princesses, etc. However, RPGs that deal with other subjects and fantasy settings than the standard D&D-esque fare are generally to my liking. This game falls into that category. While I admit I am about 10 years behind in reading the Penny Arcade webcomic, back when I followed it fairly religiously it was great and I enjoyed it. This game is pretty much what you'd expect as far as Penny Arcade humor, personalities, etc. The gameplay is great and the story parodies HP Lovecraft themes as well as has it's own style in that it merges the early teens to thirties Lovecraftian times with a just right pinch of steampunk; pulled off so well that I, as someone who gags at having steampunk genre things forced at me constantly, actually enjoyed the elements of the genre in this game. It just seemed to fit. Overall the game isn't very long, if you didn't take a break you could win it in a day or faster, but it does of course have three other sequels and was meant to be released in 'episodes' so it makes sense and is to be expected. There are plenty of upgrades to attacks as well as weapons for characters, and there are plenty of interesting areas and situations to get into to keep you entertained through your journey. I will say though that I have owned this game for a long time and was not able to actually finish it until yesterday completely because my old desktop's videcard had some sort of critical error glitch at the final boss that prevented me from beating him because not long after starting the battle the game would simply crash. I wish I remembered what videocard I had so that I could warn other users that had it about the glitch, so sorry for that. I of course since I beat it, have had no issues with any glitches or crashes on my newer desktop. Anyways, all in all it's a fun and fairly casual RPG with a good story and I would reccomend it to anyone looking for an RPG that isn't necessarily all swords and scorcerers. Though, there is a bit of dark magic in the game, it all goes along perfectly with the Lovecraftian theme and associated cultists. So no worries there. :P			"

Also, encounters are not random and constant, but you have to, uhh, encounter the enemies, and never see them again, at least in your current save.Ouch.			"

												In the game, you play as your character is you join Tycho Brahe and Johnathan Gabriel in a quest to hunt down a giant robot that has smashed your house. Set in New Arcadia, 1922, you go about the city killing robots, hobo's, mimes, and clowns to find the truth behind the giant robot. The gameplay is identical to many RPG games, but adds a blocking system that shakes up the difficulty at times. The story is very tongue-in-cheek and can make you laugh at times. The game is very short, lasting only a few hours, but the game keeps up. Even if you've never read the webcomic it's based off (Penny Arcade), the game is easy to get into and is lots a fun.			"

												To put it simply, if you're a fan of Penny Arcade you will like this game for the humor if nothing else. I happen to be fond of both Gabe and Tycho's webcomic as well as RPGs in general so this was enjoyable for me.The characters are mostly rehashes of ones from the comic, Gabe and Tycho obviously but also Tycho's niece is in there as an inventor who helps you upgrade your weapons and the Fruit F*cker is not only there in a steam-powered form but also in ludicrous numbers (its one of the main enemies early in the game).Sadly the series was abandoned after Episode Two and will never be finished. They're going to release a novelization of what the third and fourth games would have held but for me its just not the same.Gabe, Tycho, if you ever read this please please PLEASE reconsider and try to have the other two made. I'd love to play them.			"

												Liking this episode so far,the story is okay  to me,the comedy is okay but mostly is tiresome for me. In the game you gotta annoyingly restock on items a lot since enemies do not drop as much and you only get 1x item per object you smash to get a item from.This goes on in higher lvls as well except enemies drop more items. With the bad stuff outta the way lemme get to the good stuff.The combat for this turned based game is very well done,you rely on both strategy of using ur items and your characters to properly take down enemies.Enemies have different weakness's and strengths that you have to account for when you attack,This is where the bread and butter comes in the game.Graphic wise the game looks charming,love the comic style they used for the npc interactions and the variety of enemies and they abilites are fun and funny yet challenging.If you want a fresh look on turned based rpgs outside the fantasy genre, I say get the episodes in and the packs instead of seperate.

												A light-hearted episodic RPG, Precipice is a must-have for any fan of Penny Arcade and their unique brand of humor. Gabe and Tycho fight an army of Fruit F***ers, introduce plenty of Lovecraftian ideas, and some of their own, including cultist clowns. The combat system is light but remains interesting through use of unique run-time events to keep the player focused. The true victory here is the humor, as the Precipice games will keep you laughing, or at least painfully smiling, the entire time you play them.

												To put it simply, if you're a fan of Penny Arcade you will like this game for the humor if nothing else. I happen to be fond of both Gabe and Tycho's webcomic as well as RPGs in general so this was enjoyable for me.The characters are mostly rehashes of ones from the comic, Gabe and Tycho obviously but also Tycho's niece is in there as an inventor who helps you upgrade your weapons and the Fruit F*cker is not only there in a steam-powered form but also in ludicrous numbers (its one of the main enemies early in the game).Sadly the series was abandoned after Episode Two and will never be finished. They're going to release a novelization of what the third and fourth games would have held but for me its just not the same.Gabe, Tycho, if you ever read this please please PLEASE reconsider and try to have the other two made. I'd love to play them.			"

												This is a damn good game for any fan of turn based RPGs, you may not like the fact that it has only a few repeated areas, or the fact that the QTE/turn-based combat is easy at times and annoyingly dificult at others. but if you look past its flaws, you will see a game worth playing, at least if you are a Penny Arcade fan or a turn-based RPG fan.Why do I give this such high praise when I have so little time playing it? Because what little I did play I loved, the humor, the ridiculous story and enemies/npcs, and so on. I was just turned off on the sudden difficulty spike coming from the tutorial and going into your first official battle. It made me think long and hard about how much I am not a fan of either turn-based combat, nor Penny Arcade.Actually, given enough time with PA, I would probably become a fan, I loved the irreverent humor and ridiculousness of it, but the QTE/turn-based combat, while good if you are a fan of that kind of combat, is not my cup of tea. The huge difficulty spike going into the first battle did not help sell the game to me either. But if you are a fan of PA, or turn based combat, or both, and can handle a hard game, pick this one up. If you are not a huge fan of either PA, or TBC, or the ridiculous difficulty spike, then this is not your game.			"

												OtRS:PoD Ep 1 is a game that combines the weirdness and humor of the Mother series with a real-time RPG and the outcome is enjoyable (even more so if you play it without reading into the game first, the final boss and five enemies who you will always fight together are an example, I can't say anything more) but very short.The difficulty curve flucuates at random, the beginning will whoop you a bit as you get used to the controls, the middle (around entering Pelican Bay) is easy, and the end manages to be difficult (an enemy can lower your attack stat for a full minute which makes your attacks nearly useless) and easy still. However, the final boss is a good one, the boss manages to be difficult but not overbearing and as a result, leaves a good taste in the mouth. As I stated a little earlier, the game ends very quickly with only three major areas, all of which are pretty small. Hardcore RPG players may find it easy, but that's what insane mode is there for.

												Despite having a long name, the game itself isn't very long, taking me only 4 hours to beat (but not complete). However, in those four hours, I had a great time with this game. Plus, it's cheap alongside its successor during Steam Sales, so the length-to-price ratio is justified if you pick it up then. It's an RPG that's not completely turn based, where attacks recharge (it's not as stressful as it seemed). You can't play the game with mouse lag, but it was fixed by making the resolution lower. The game has the humor you'd expect, and I found myself holding back from taking screenshots of funny lines. The soundtrack is great and fits the dark but nice visuals. Items and super moves didn't see much use by me; I didn't really need them most of the time. I'm also assuming that most of the game's exploration takes place in the completionist route, since there wasn't much of it for something that LOOKS like a Point-n-Click.Overall, I'd definitely pick up this game during a Steam Sale.

												For a $5 RPG, On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness will meet your expectations (at the time of this review, you can get both Penny Arcade games for roughly $10.) This is no award-winning game, nor does it try to be. This is simply a slightly humorous romp through a zany adventure. To be clear, you don't have to like Penny Arcade to enjoy this game; I personally hate the web comics and found myself chuckling every once in a while. Although the general quality is obviously on a shoe string budget, the lack of any voice acting makes it hard to truely appreciate those few really funny jokes. The gameplay is solid, but takes zero risks and I can't remember a single song from the game which means one of two things: 1). The music is mediocre.2). The music is horrendous.The graphics are pretty subpar, but one cool addition is that the character you make is shown in every cutscene and doesn't feel like a silent protagonist at all. If you're desperate for a barebones RPG, pick it up.			"

												Entertaining if overlong jrpg in a hereto untrodden genre. I can best describe it as ""Lovecraftian parody"".I found it much easier to play with a console controller, and the second game introduced a couple of interface tweaks that ought to be backported. Also despite Hothead Games still promoting the game via steam and console sales, they have dropped the final game and thus left the storyline unresolveable except by reading Tycho's posts to the Penny Arcade website.

There's no stat system or armor or weapons to collect either, the most are a few in game items like concept art or items to upgrade the only weapons you ever get. It's very silly and zany, but that's what kept me interested; very few RPGs have you fighting clowns with rainbow colored blood, mimes, or hobos. If you can get it for cheap and are new to RPGs, go ahead and give it a try.			"

It has mature aspects to it so the cartoony style doesn't confuse those who are buying it for their kids. They use adult language frequently and one of the main enemies is called the Fruit F***er which is basically a juicer that its spout is symbolized as it's male genitals and it spends the whole battle humping the air or your character if it grabs hold. As an adult with an immature mind I loved the game. It is a good rpg whith a very fun story and great gameplay. Just so it's stated there are 4 episodes in this series.			"

												The first in what is intended to be a trilogy, On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness is an enjoyable, if short, romp through a world threatened by annihilation as is foretold in an ancient prophecy. Thankfully (or unfortunately), you, along with Penny Arcade's Tycho and Gabe, are just the guys to save it from the hordes of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥robots, mimes, hobos and barbershop quartets that lurk on every street and pathway.All in all, it's a good combination of point-and-click adventure and RPG-based leveling and combat, with animation, graphics and humor that stays true to the Penny Arcade webcomic. However, there is a bug that occasionally pops up during combat where animation is skipped. In most games, this wouldn't really be an issue, but since your method of defending requires proper timing, this could lead to a few instances of attacks getting through without you having a chance to react. Not a major issue, but can get frustrating on the harder difficulties.			"

												It's like an interactive RPG comic book. The strong point is in the story which is on the wild and crazy side containing lots of fun and originality, but there is a little too much reading for my taste creating lots of dull moments. It's certainly something worth experiencing for the $1 sale price, but it's not something that is going to impress. Good time filler if you are looking for something different to play in between your regular games.			"

												First time i played this it didn't stick, for some reason i hated it mainly because of the combat system. Recently i installed it again and enjoyed it a lot, once you get used to the combat system it becomes fun. It's an adventure / rpg with the characters from Penny arcade... The story is a bit silly, kind of the style of monkey island (something that is rare these days), and the general atmosphere of siliness is probably what sets this game apart from everything else. Don't pay full price, but if you ever see this on a sale it is worth checking out.			"

It has one of the longest titles ever, and that's the true measure of gaming greatness, as anyone who's ever played ""Bakumatsu Roman Gekka no Kenshi Dai Ni Maku ~Tsuki ni Saku Hana, Chiri Yuku Hana~"" (a.k.a.

												Liking this episode so far,the story is okay  to me,the comedy is okay but mostly is tiresome for me. In the game you gotta annoyingly restock on items a lot since enemies do not drop as much and you only get 1x item per object you smash to get a item from.This goes on in higher lvls as well except enemies drop more items. With the bad stuff outta the way lemme get to the good stuff.The combat for this turned based game is very well done,you rely on both strategy of using ur items and your characters to properly take down enemies.Enemies have different weakness's and strengths that you have to account for when you attack,This is where the bread and butter comes in the game.Graphic wise the game looks charming,love the comic style they used for the npc interactions and the variety of enemies and they abilites are fun and funny yet challenging.If you want a fresh look on turned based rpgs outside the fantasy genre, I say get the episodes in and the packs instead of seperate.

												I highly reccomend this bizarre JRPG esque adventure. You play a average joe (whom you name and create their appearance, which is somehow succesfully included in the Comic Book Cinematics) who has to join Detectives Tycho Brahe and Johnathan Gabriel on their Current Investigation. This is a game that's main focus is creating an insane, yet hilarious storyline, if your like me you will be grinning the entire game. The gameplay is no slouch either, going to for JRPG like Turn based combat (no random encounters for those wondering).If you love JRPGs, love Penny Arcade, and/or Just want to laugh, this game will be great fun for you, and if you want more, there are 3 more games to play! (though sadly the guys who made the first 2 stopped making them, though Zeboyd Games made the last 2, and did a Fantastic Job, you will miss the comic book art style and even the combat system, and personally i miss my Created Character)			"
