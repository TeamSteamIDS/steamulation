“Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart … Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside, awakens.” ~ Carl JungThe first time I tried to play this game, it annoyed me a bit. Most beautiful atmosphere, sure. But the camera movements were lagged and inventory interface was downright annoying. I gave the game an hour or so, declared it as ""meh"" and quit to complete it for achievements on a later date. That was before I managed to get into the house. After my success, I learned that I couldn't be more wrong.Anna is a tragedy, adorned with a love story, a murder, a forgotten promise and the cult of the Sacred Feminine. Our protagonist is an esteemed professor of history who gives lectures at a university in Italy. Important to note that he is specialized in mythology and folktales - because this is where social sciences tend to present complications fitting for a horror story. Life goes pretty much ordinary - aside some vaguely disturbing and symbolic dreams that he has been having - until he finds an envelope in his closet which leaves him with a sense of uneasiness. He avoids the envelope like the plague until his assistant conveniently spills tea over it, making opening the thing a priority. Then, he discovers photos of him in places that he has no memory of visiting. And the implication of a woman being there. He takes a pause, and mumbles to himself: ""Anna, how could I forget you, my love"".We learn all this information from our professor's notes, meeting him the first time where he stands outside of an abandoned country house in a secluded valley. This is the house that he's been dreaming of, and he intends to discover more about it at any cost. I warn you: this is a ""be careful what you wish for"" scenario and it includes many disturbing symbolic imagery, knowledge of the occult, and the versions of folktales that Disney wouldn't even touch with a 10 foot pole. So keep reading if you are interested in a kind of dread that Lovecraft would be much proud of.I wouldn't like to exaggerate anything, but the atmosphere is really marvelous and effective. Every detail is carefully put together to arrange the correct mood, empowered with symbolisms and background noises. Drawings and writings on the wall, lights flickering and beaming on furniture, random events and paranormal occurrences within the house makes you tiptoe, and jump at the tiniest of changes in setting. Yes, there are jump scares, but on contrary to a brutally gory display which we are used to, such events are presented elegantly with the usage of either uncanny symbolisms - concerning many, many weird puppets - or the usage of partial objects that would poke your unconscious with a needle like Silent Hill did back in the day. All of this is accompanied by the most beautiful soundtrack, full with suspense and emotion.As for story, all events center the cult of the Sacred Feminine, where female force is idolized like a deity, or even a paranormal entity. I was astonished at the amount and authenticity of lore accumulated in this game. Story and atmosphere combined with the theme of survival horror, I think Anna as a more female oriented version of Amnesia: the Dark Descent. We have a flaw in memory, an abandoned settlement with occult on goings, appearances of most strange and disturbing phenomenon and a mystery to solve at all costs, mostly to our own inconvenience.As for gameplay itself, there are much that lacks, I won't lie. There are books to collect and learn from, intuitions to combine, items to gather and puzzles to solve. Both without a basic background on at least mythology and an understanding of societal belief, the game would feel plain. Puzzles and most items do make complete sense only if you are already familiar with pagan customs. It is a feast to the ones who are interested in the lore, but I'd advice to skip this game for the casual horror game player.If we are to be straight with the negative, controls do suck. Okay, you cannot go wrong with the tradition of WASD, but camera controls lag horribly, and mouse sensitivity is abhorrent. You basically go pixel hunting to grab something you are interested in, and I have been stuck with inventory bugs that makes it impossible to go through your documents for more than once. You save. You quit the game. You restart, reload. This is a thing now. Sorry.Still, if you are persistent enough to endure controls - you get used to it as a nagging spouse after a while - and set aside the 3rd Party DRM that belongs to Kalypso, it is a good game. As a market strategy, a 3rd Party DRM is a really bad call and I've read there are issues of lost CD Keys about this game too. If you are interested, I advise to play the game in a 3-4 days period, complete everything and get done with it, for being on the safe side.Does it worth this much trouble? Most would say definitely not, but I'm still glad that I was stubborn enough to go through with it. The true ending - it has 8 different endings depending on different courses of action you may take - baffled me and made complete sense for me. I gulped down the rest of my coffee and shed a tear, knowing what this whole ordeal was about. A tragedy, a warning, a mistake to be corrected, a demon to be faced... Call it whatever you may. On a last word, I loved it. I loved Anna, the Sabot Maker and our poor professor. I hope you'd give them a chance to haunt your subconscious too.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												Basically you have this adventure game with a pretty intriguing story and a very cool atmosphere.  Sounds like it has a lot of potential right?But let's talk about the controls.  There's idiotic things like not letting you escape out of your inventory by hitting ESC.  You have to hit ""I"" again.  And then there's the inventory itself.  It's very awkward where you have to scroll through a bunch of stuff you have.  The interface could use a lot of work.And now let's talk about ""pixel hunting"".   You know what's frustrating?  Going into a dark room with a bunch of items scattered about the room.  The thing you want isn't an more noticeable and hidden a certain area and it looks just like all the other stuff you can't click on.  So the only way to find it is to move your mouse over every possible item on the screen.  Ugh.  I combed rooms and missed things before and I had to use a walk through a few times to find things.And now let's talk about the worst part of the game.  The puzzles.  Some make sense, many do not.   There's a very thin section of wall you need to break through.  Maybe use a stone or something?  Nope.  You have this metal gear piece.  Maybe you can use that to break through?  It's metal and looks fairly heavy, should bust through.  Nope.  I have a full canteen, that should be kinda heavy...  Nope.   Solution?  You gotta use a tree branch to break through.  A tree branch!  To break through a wall.Yes, that makes sense, right?  The whole game is full of puzzles that barely make sense.   The other use for a tree branch?  There's a knife lodged in a wooden table.  You want that knife.  Your possible tools to get this knife blade out?  Your hands.  Nope, you''ll cut yourself, that makes sense.  An axe!  Let's just chop it out.  Nope.  A shovel?  Maybe you can whack it out or pry it?  Nope.  Ah ha!  I found a woodworking tool!  That's gotta be it.  I mean how else do you get a knife out of a WOODEN table!  HAHA YEAH RIGHT.  Obviously you would use a tree branch to get a knife out of a wooden table.Good puzzle games, when you figure them out, you go ""AHHHHH!  That makes sense!  Why didn't I think of that?""  Anna, you can actually play with a walk through and be like ""uhhhh, ok, I don't get it but sure whatever.  I guess it might make sense maybe?""  That's what made the Lucas Arts games so much fun.  You might have NO idea how to pass a certain part of the game but if someone tells you the answer or you brute force the answer you think ""Oh my god, that makes sense!""  I remember in Monkey Island where I couldn't figure out what to trade the head hunter.  So I offered him everything in my inventory until it worked.  And when the item that worked was offered I had to laugh because it made complete sense once I thought about it.  Anna, I used a walk through heavily after figuring out how terrible the puzzles were.So basically, do not recommend this game in the form it is in now.  Now, if they went through and fixed a bunch of things and redid a lot of the puzzles, I think this could be a very good game.   It's just fairly minor things that need fixing, but a lot of things.  Inventory fix would be very easy and then it's just fixing the puzzles.  It almost feels like it would only take a week or two of work to fix the game completely.It's a shame too because I think the story and atmosphere is great.  If you are a HUGE paranormal / occult story fan, the game is worth playing for the story.   Just make sure to have the walk through available for you so you can just play through the story without any of the frustration.			"

												Anna-It has an eerie story, a few ""jump scares"" that we're tastfully done, but overall the game wasn't fantastic. I spent a few hours banging my head against some of the puzzles, as even though you're given a LITTLE direction, it's not enough half the time. If you're looking for a pretty game, this is it. Anna has it's own DRM, along with Steam, which some might find obnoxious. I forced myself to 100% it, alot of it in offline mode. I would have to give it a 4/10, it did spook me a few times and give me the ""WTF is that?! OH♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; moments. The story could of been a bit more fluffed, and the puzzles given a little more direction. I spent most of my time, wandering back and forth in areas for a bit trying to find that TINY clue I needed to move on.I recommend googling a ""Walkthrough/How-To"" for this game when you get stuck, or go slowly your first playthrough. Pay attention to every tiny detail.My opinion on the matter, this game could have been more.			"

												This game is absolutely beautiful graphically. The shadows, the feeling. Good graphical design. Audio also is very good. Also story writing. Reading the journal first time was long but very interesting. So storytelling is also good.What this game lacks of is UX-design or User Experience. Seems like Kalypso or whatever company had no money for UX development. Inventory is crap. Searching a pixel on 1920x1080 in darkness is hopeless time waster. Even the inventory items look like crap. And puzzles. This is all the field of User Experience design. And this game does not have it.Still a quick play through so. Don't buy it if you don't like clumsy UI-s.			"

												Game unusable and Refund Refused, stay away from this developer!   After Three Years I have finally had enough of the intrusive (and highly glitchy) Registration Process every time I want to play this game.  I really liked this game but I have never before come across a publisher who deliberately shoots themselves in the foot to this degree by barring the customers from playing a game they paid good money for.  STEAM should do something about this highly suspicious (and creepy) company who are harvesting personal information and ripping people off in this way.EDIT......I had an important question about my review that I should share with the steam community.  There is no doubt that Kalypso are selling our personal information to third parties.   I got so exhausted from the glitching and inconvinience of the registration system that I created an email for no other reason than to use it for the registration process and nothing else. Sure enough withing days of doing this i started getting spammed from all sorts of buisineses and scams. The only people who ever had this particular email was Kalypso so they must be selling our personal information to third parties.  It should also be noted that I left that particular email fallow for a month before registering it with Kalypso to see if It would get spammed if I did nothing, It didn't. That was evidence enough for me so I quickly closed it down. I made my findings known and took exeption at what they were doing, I asked Kalypso for a refund which they refused.			"

												Plagued by a sudden and insatiable urge to investigate a mysterious, far away sawmill in a remote, Italian countryside, a man tries to uncover the source of his fevered visions and sense of familiarity with a place he has no recollection of ever visiting, despite evidence to the contrary. His search leads him to unearth a gruesome history of the abandoned dwelling and its past inhabitants, and in particular to the story of Anna, a woman who seems to somehow be at the heart of it all. But to what end?A first person horror game set almost entirely within a single, modestly sized building, players are tasked with solving puzzles to both progress exploration and to reveal the story related to each room and/or the part the items involved in each puzzle played in past events. But the deeper you delve into the mystery, the more your sanity and reality are called into question as the world begins to change around you and conspire against your efforts. Presentation is stunning as the visuals, sound and overall design are the beating heart around which this games revolves and reason enough to play it through from start to finish.UI is largely intuitive but can confound on occasion as there's no explanation of its more intricate workings necessary for fully uncovering the story. In fact, that probably also sums up just about every aspect of the gameplay here. Satisfying and frustrating in equal measure, for every part of the game that there is to enjoy, there's also as many flaws as the puzzles and story become increasingly convoluted towards its conclusion. Since quite a few of the puzzles are based around performing rites and rituals, it means the player has no natural process of logic or intelligence to apply to the solution, but instead must pick up on the clues or directions provided by the game, which at times can prove annoyingly obtuse.But don't let that stop you. Despite its shortcomings (one of the biggest of which is the unneccesary DRM which requires that you create an account with Kalypso Media in order to run the game. A process that feels incredibly archaic at this stage in our chosen pastime), that still doesn't stop it from being a worthwhile and gratifying experience, for nothing else if not for providing one of the singular most startling scares I've had in a game to date (mind how you go in the artisan room!). Anna - Extended Edition also includes the original game released prior to the free update which overhauled a massive amount of the game to include a myriad of new content and greatly expands upon the story and its surrounding lore. In comparion, the extended edition makes the original seem like a skeleton without its flesh and really should only be played after finishing the latest version just to see how far the game has come and how much effort developer Dreampainters went to in order to craft an experience that stays with you long after the credits have finished rolling.

												Game is ok, but the controls feel like they are from 1996. Also requires some lame Kalypso(sp?) account before you can play.... You  must also agree to some lengthy TOS when you sign up too, and they try to ""opt-in"" spamming you on their mailng list. until they remove that crap I can't recommend buying it on steam.			"

												First thing to note: This game requires you to input a CD key and create an account before being able to login and play. You have to login each time to play the game through their launcher. DRM is NOT COOL.(((Edit: This review contains some basic spoilers about gameplay and ""scariness"" of the game. I have blatant storyline spoilers marked in brackets below. If you don't want to read any spoilers, even minor ones, pass on this review :) )))This is a tough game to review. I liked the atmosphere of the game, for the most part, and I liked the general direction of the storyline...even though it has problems...but ultimately the mechanics and ""puzzleness"" of the game hurts it for me. There are a lot of little sloppy things, or some poor design choices, that make the game difficult to enjoy, but not impossible to play through. I recommend playing through the game at least one time for the 2-4 hours of interesting experience (it is a bit unique from many games in its genre), but unless you're achievement farming it'll have little to no replay value. After about an hour and a half of playtime I decided I couldn't stand the random item/puzzle hunt and looked up a guide (there is a very good one for the extended edition on Steam, btw). Even using the guide, I still don't understand why I had half the items in my inventory at the end of the game. At one point I had upwards of 20+ items in my inventory, most of which I either never used or didn't know where to use. After finishing the game I looked up other comments and guides and it seems there are just a lot of pointless items in the game thrown in there as red herrings. I really dislike games that do things like this, so it's difficult for me to enjoy it after playing the similar, and MUCH BETTER, survival-horror game, Amnesia: The Dark Descent. If you are really into the idea of a horror puzzle game where it gives you little to no help/clues, then this would be a great game for you. For a horror game, I didn't find it particularly scary. Most of it was ""creepy noises to the sides/behind you and you can't figure out their source!"" or ""something appeared next to me! JUMP OUT OF MY SEAT!"" It wasn't even scary. It was always the same mannequin-lady (I presume to be ""Anna""?) following me around doing the same set of 5-6 poses the entire game. There was 1 moment where a flying mask surprised me a little, but that's about it. The art of this game was pretty subpar which hurt my ability to get ""sucked into"" the atmosphere of the game. Maybe I'm being picky about this, but subpar or bad graphics in a horror game can ruin my experience. The music was pretty good, but the animation felt blocky and choppy a lot of the time. As far as the story of this game, I'm left pretty confused. It has an interesting storyline...if it were fleshed out more. Don't read my spoiler if you plan on looking into this game at all. I completely give away the entire game's plot as well as my problems with it, which would defeat the point of you exploring the game for yourself![[[[[[[[[[SPOILER]]]]]]]]]]The premise of this game, as far as I understand it, is that there is a married guy who becomes obsessed/falls in love with a statue of a goddess (who is supposed to be Mary? or an ancient ""Goddess""? who the guy names Anna? or is actually named Anna? I am so confused about how to interpret her). He more-or-less turns into a cultist and worships Anna/the statue. His wife realizes he's going crazy and destroys the statue. He goes psycho-mode on her and murders her and their two sons (who might be named Castor and Pollux? Lots of references to Greek mythology with them). I can't tell if he loses his memory because of his guilt, or if he just goes so far off the deep end in his cult-worship of Anna that he loses it completely, but...whatever the case is, he regains his sanity and becomes a professor. He starts having crazy dreams and stuff and decides he HAS to visit this cabin (where the game takes place) to discover what is ""calling"" to him. There are 8 different endings to this game, but they can be broken down into 3 categories: You get kicked out/Leave the house, You go insane and ""die,"" You discover that you are a murderer and decide that you *must* live for/die for Anna stuck in a cave beneath the house (where you find her statue as well as ""mannequins"" representing the two sons you murdered). I don't particularly care for most of the endings except the ""full"" ending (going nuts and choosing to die, spending eternity with, the statue/the mannequin sons), which really doesn't help explain/answer some of the questions throughout the game. Who exactly is Anna? Does your character care at all about his wife whom he murdered & apparently chooses not to spend eternity with (choosing Anna over her)? Why are there constant ""moon"" and other Greek mythological references--is Anna supposed to be an interpretation of Diana?Is your character crazy at the end, or so truly grief-stricken by his actions that he can't help but stay in the cave, atoning for what he's done until he dies of starvation/dehydration/asphyxiation? [[[[[[[[[[/END SPOILER]]]]]]]]]]There are many, many more questions the game doesn't bother answering. The game developer says they want the player to interpret the story, which I would be fine with, if they didn't throw so much information at me that I am completely unable to create my own version of what happened due to too many loose ends...

												This game is quite disturbing, that's the first thing I will say. Anna - Extended Edition is a challenging point and click type of game that nudges the survival horror genre a little. I mention survival horror mainly because it seems quite inspired by Amnesia - The Dark Descent, however it does not require you to run away and hide from monsters once in a while. The game does have a sanity meter, though, but other than that it continues down the puzzle road, mainly.You start outside, in the yard of a house - a sawmill, and you suffer from amnesia. What's with all of the amnesia themed horror games these days? Putting that question aside, your first challenge begins. The house is locked, how do you get in? Ah, our first puzzle! The first of gazillions, crazy, disturbing and somewhat illogical puzzles! Although, I have to admit that the original game was worse in the 'illogical' part.Once you get inside the horror starts. This game will mess with your mind. I found myself disturbed many times as I progressed through the game. There are several events that triggers randomly, different intuitions to unlock and combine, a lot of books to read and on top of that Anna has eight different endings! This of course boosts the replayability a lot, if you can stomach going through the game several times.Visually, it's decent. It's not the prettiest one in the bunch, but it has the atmosphere nailed. Graphics are not important when it comes to psychological mind*bleep* games, in my opinion. The sound quality is somewhat lacking at times and there are occasional frame rate issues, sadly. It's not a flawless game but if you can close your eyes to various bugs then you won't have a problem playing the it, despite its somewhat awkward controls.All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by the game but then again I knew nothing about it so I had no expectations when I first started playing it. I will admit that it's not for 'everyone' and it's definitely not a game for the youngest gamers out there. If you'd like to experience a twisted story then look no further - Anna is quite effed up in terms of story. It's a bit like The Cat Lady - you really have no damn clue about what's going on, which will generate a numerous of ""WTF?!""s as you continue deeper into the secrets of that abandoned house.			"

												Anna is an amazing, yet disturbing experience with a unique and engaging story. The game seems relatively tame when starting in the lush green yard of an abandoned house that doesn't look all that sinister from the outside. However, once gaining access to the inside, things start to unfold that maybe you really didn't want to see in the first place. There a many different puzzles to be solved, some requiring a fair amount of reading various notes and books for the necessary clues and information. The music is fabulous and definitely one of the brightest spots in the game and the supernatural events will test your sanity. There are even several different possible endings adding some replayability.I did find Anna to be a little on the difficult side as far as figuring out what items were used for what purpose mostly because there are a lot of different items and sometimes the solutions were far from obvious. Then there are the intuitions which I didn't understand at all without finally reading a guide. It also has an intrusive Kalypso DRM installed requiring an e-mail account and password.Everything told, Anna is definitely a worthwhile chilling adventure that is sure to have you second guessing yourself.

So, I apply using a different email, and would you look at that, I finally got the verification email.  I click verify, go to sign in to their game with my new email, and it won't let me because my game key is bound to my other email address that they won't send a verification email to.

												Could be a good game, but it's just an annoying point and click fest, most of the time you'll feel like exploring every inch of the given map to find all the needed items, and then just trying to use'em in every interactable place... but that's just the nutshell of how bad it is, my main concerns are:1. HORRIBLE CONTROLS, one of the worst I've ever seen, the camera is worst than if you were drunk playing anything else, pretty bad menu interaction, no shortcuts, just awful.2. Pretty bad programmed game, just happens that my pc is good enough to run way better graphics games, but on this one it simply lags for no reason, and I doubt the devs will do anything about it since its problably just a dead game in their hands by now, and no, I don't wanna waste hours of my time to solve a problem that shouldn't be my own, devs should be concerned about it, not me/us.3. Talking about the point and click fest, it sounds so random, you do wanna try to use your head and think how the puzzles should be solved, but no, you better just try most of the things randomly, or you WILL get stuck, just in the 2nd part of the game (this isn't a spoiler at all, it's a pretty short example) when I entered the house, you are supposed to remove a stuck knife's blade out of a table (among other things), so, I have a bunch of objects I collected that I have no idea where they gonna work at all, I have an axe, a huge blade, blablabla, no, they won't remove the knife's blade from the table, but the TREE BRENCH that I got earlier, of course, THIS ONE removes the knife's blade.... that was enough for me, you see? you want to use your head, but you better just randomly try every object you got, oh and be sure to look in every corner, every small inch, because if you missed something, you can be stuck having no idea what to do, no fun at all, I'm sorry, and if you wanna know, I love puzzle games, and I played alot of'em, Zelda, Penumbra, Amnesia, Resident Evil, any puzzle game you guess, is 10x better than this one.

YouTube™ Video: Analog Reviews: Anna 

			Views: 4,179		

			We look at First Person Adventure Horror title Anna. Review by Senior Reviewer Trent http://www.analogreviews.com/# Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/analogreviews		

Amid a string of mediocre releases, large franchises being retooled into more action oriented romps and the trend to make games more accessible, triple A survival horror games seem to be on the ropes. Fans of the genre hold out for the triumphant return of limited supplies, vulnerable protagonists, dark and moody atmosphere, and freakish creatures. Where there is a demand someone will inevitably step up with a supply. Dreampainters has stepped forward with a modest entry in the horror game genre. It isn't a traditional survival horror title but it does promise scares and chills. With such strong games like Amnesia helping to scratch the survival horror itch would seem reasonable that Anna could deliver, right?Anna begins with your nameless, faceless, voiceless character in front of a sawmill explaining that he was drawn to its location. Your character is actually a teacher on leave of absence due to debilitating headaches. He finds some photos among his belongings that show him at the sawmill despite the fact that he remembers none of this. Players can only obtain this information if they bother to read the faux notebook contained in the extras folder of the game folder. The narrative is sparse—almost nonexistent really. While the esoteric nature of the story is intended to elicit curiosity it never offers a solid enough foundation to pique your interest. Not even establishing who your character is or what is motivating him in the game itself ensures that you remain distant from the events in Anna. Anna plays as a first person point and click adventure game. You meander around the game's environments picking up and examining objects in an effort to solve some of the most obtuse and absurd puzzles in video game history. It should be noted that ridiculous puzzles are not exactly uncommon in adventure games but they usually include hints or cues that provide the necessary hints to complete them. Anna, however eschews such formalities, instead forcing the player to combine random items and blindly guess what is necessary to solve the puzzle at hand. On top of this even when the puzzles do make some sense they are often undermined by pixel hunting. It makes sense that you would use your lighter to light the stove but attempting to use the lighter on the kindling in the stove will not provide the expected results. Using your lighter on the stove on the other hand will... It compounds the frustration and makes playing Anna tantamount to an act of masochism.Anna also blunders by failing to offer a credible threat. What is a horror game without some sort of impending doom? There is no way to fail Anna. The “horror” in this game comes from witnessing supernatural events which are rarely effective. They range from laughable (a card board cutout looking character blanketed in PSX era black particle effects) to mildly creepy (a mask whose eyes follow you around the room before appearing as a ghostly apparition behind the character). Anna doesn't do everything wrong though when it comes to effects and atmosphere. Upon making progress and revisiting some areas in the game you will notice that they are changed around. This reduces the tedium in backtracking as well as offering the occasional unsettling imagery. Messages will also appear on the walls and slowly fade away. It's in these brief moments that Anna shines but it isn't long before it's luster tarnishes.			"

												Three separate play attempts, three separate walkthroughs followed to the letter, one game destroying glitch each time.  I cannot possibly recommend a game that won't let me finish it because an important event towards the end cannot be triggered due to some unfathomable glitch.And the 3rd Party DRM?  What fresh hell is this?  Steam itself is a DRM Slavemaster, but at least it works, I don't need temperamental 3rd Party DRM working in tandem that only lets you play your legally purchased game if it feels like it.  I'd consider overlooking that point if the game actually worked, but it doesn't, so I won't.			"

												Anna is one of those first person exploration games that does not have a protagonist with an array of weapons; there are no boss battles, no multiplayer and no high-budget cutscenes connecting one stage to another. It does not mean that it is a bad thing. Quite the contrary - considering its low budget nature Anna is quite a beautiful game; its sound and music are equally good.The story revolves around a professor who is haunted by an image in his dreams - a sawmill that is constantly calling him. He finally decides to set out and seek out the answer - Anna seems to be the name of the woman calling him and while the house is surrounded by a forest and spacious, green garden upon entering the game's tone immediately changes to something much, much darker. Our hero begins to hear more voices and here the game focuses on puzzle solving till the very end.While the game is similar to a certain degree to Amnesia its psychological / horror nature is very far from it. There are some jump scares here and there but those of you already familiar with Amnesia may find these quite boring. However, the puzzles are interesting and the many books we find in the house give us the background of an interesting story. As for the puzzles: it is difficult to know sometimes what to do - the inventory can easily become filled with items and objects can be used not just with our surroundings but their combination is a must, too.The Extended Edition is an upgrade the game received and the only version of the game that can be purchased. One of the new concepts introduced was the sanity meter - again, something reminiscent of Amnesia. Still, while wandering aimlessly and not knowing what to do I could not manage to completely go insane. I understand it would have given an extra ending (the game has 8 different endings, by the way).Anna is a bit rough around the edges - its narrative is not the best and the puzzles could have been a bit easier. The sanity meter is good but as we cannot die we do not really have a sense of threat while searching for Anna in the abandoned household. Also, the Extended Edition could have had an upgrade to its interface as it isn't exactly user friendly.Nevertheless, Anna is an interesting adventure game and while I said it is one of those first person exploration games here we have more focus on puzzle solving so bear this in mind when purchasing it. I recommend it if it is on sale and remember you can always use a Steam guide if you get lost in the narrative / puzzle solving like I did!PS: The game requires a Kalypso account to be created otherwise it cannot be launched!

												Full disclaimer: I did not finish this game. I really really really wanted to like this game. Really truly. However it has some really serious flaws that made me want to stop playing. So I did.First off, the atmosphere and ambiance in this game are phenomenal. It is very immersive and beautiful to look at. The sound design is smart, the visuals are stunning. The way in which the story is told is very nice, very intriguing, and really weaves an interesting world for the player. The horror is excellent. Very few games have made me jump and just physically react like some of the scares in this game have. However, despite all it has in it's favor, it has some serious issues that make actually playing the game exceptionally frustrating. Perhaps the biggest offender, and probably what gets harped on the most, is how completely obtuse and irrationally difficult many of the puzzles are. You will carry items around with you for most of the game without ever having a use for them. Your inventory will be so waterlogged with pointless items that you'll find yourself trying every possible combination of items on a puzzle, no matter how illogical, and when you finally think you've got a solution that makes sense, the game says no, that's not the right answer, continue scavenging every square inch of the house for that one item you missed in a dark corner. Additionally, death is very unforgiving. Granted I got through half the game without dying, but when you do, you get the bad ending, and if you want to continue have to go back to your last (manual) save. You do not make a game with perma-death and no checkpoints, this is not 1995, I don't want to sound entitled but I really do feel like that is just basic game design common sense. And on the topic of death, every time you see a scary event, you lose health. This might be okay if there were more ways to restore your health, but there are not. And in a horror game, you kind of want to check out all the scary things. I mean, they're some of the strongest design points of the game, I'd be loathe to run away from any of them. But no, they damage you, and lead to death, so you should avoid these smart well-made scenes that really make the game experience. This game had so much potential. I am very disappointed that it didn't live up to it.4/10			"

												When I first got this in 2013, my laptop could not handle it. I got a new PC recently, so I wanted to try to run it again. The game demanded I get an account on their website, which was annoying. What was worse is that the game claimed the product key couldn't be used again, so I can't even open the game. Be wary of this game.EDIT: I tried to get a refund and was denied. Went to their website, and there is nothing about this game on it. I guess I am just screwed over $5.			"

More seriously, the game has everything you'll be looking for in a horror adventure game.It's at the same time creepy and beautiful, disturbing and enchanting.Both story and atmosphere are very nice, and all we could wish would be for the game to last more longer. But honesty, as I needed a few playthrough to make it to the end, I can't say it's too short for the price I've putted into this.			"

												*Final review*After completing Anna, I find myself to be... Rather disappointed. It is just too short, and only on the second stage of the game do the puzzles devolve from clever methods to open a door to completely random rituals that will have the player constantly guessing about where the hell are they supposed to go, eventually either swallowing their pride and searching up a walkthrough or getting frustrated to the point where they burst a blood vessel.However, there are redeeming qualities. As I've mentioned before the game has some pretty heart-stopping scares, and the music is quite beautiful and complements the setting perfectly. In the end, Anna just doesn't seem worthwhile. Probably best to give this one a miss.*UPDATE*I am well aware that the developers have updated Anna to the ""Extended Edition"". I've looked into it and this edition still suffers from the same flaws: Puzzles are still completely random, the game is still disappointingly short and the story is still flawed. All they added was a few new rooms and one or two new scares. Whoop-de-freakin'-doo.			"

Anna Story:- A  psychological horror game based on puzzle that relate to memories of Anna named woman. We play a character who find and solve the puzzle to get clue of her. Short game with average graphic.Anna extended edition also included Anna (original version).So you can can play both for different experience its only difference in few puzzle, selection of object and endings. There is 3 endings of the game. No bug but some puzzle maybe tough and irritating. This is not survival horror but we lose hp while fear or experience soul of Anna. Don't worry player don't die if finish the puzzle fast. Negative Point-To complete  game soon or unlock achievement you must need to read guide or walk-through. Negative points of game (according to me) in some puzzle we don't get clue and try to solve casually.  Positive Point:-If you play for achievement you can buy this for easy to earn.  Background music is so obsessive. OverallI think its playable one time if you like horror game. Better buy this  game on sale.			"

												This is a game that tries -and fails- to be a first person horror experience. There's a disturbing story, nice graphics (though the bloom effect in the daylight sequences is bothersome) and great sound design. The atmosphere is here but the puzzles are nothing short of frustrating. You need to hunt for pixels and rub them against other pixels and most times it's not intuitive. You end up spending a lot of time trying to find solutions to puzzles, so any sense of urgency is utterly lost.Worst of all, still, and SPOILER ALERT, I suppose......You can't die. There's 0 threat in the game and you eventually catch onto it, ruining any tension that might have been built up. My recommendation is: skip it. Play Amnesia instead.			"

												Anna is a wonderful looking game that has a lot of potential, however the developers haven’t seem to fix its many problems. The game at the moment is pretty much unplayable due to the horrid lag you get from just looking around and enabling Vsync doesn’t do anything. Another issue with this game is something that has come up recently which is when you try to launch the game it asks you whether you want it windowed or not and the resolution and so forth, regardless of those settings the game is determined to make you suffer by ignoring those settings and playing in extremely small window. So as for buying a copy I would recommend that you wait till (if ever) the developers fix its issues. The lag is not only with the mouse in looking around but also moving around as well. Also the developers haven’t fixed anything with the game since I bought it which was like a year or two ago. However if you are a Linux user some of this my not apply to you because that seems to be what they are focused on fixing, but if you are a Windows user your outta luck. Like I said before this game has a lot of potential, the developers  just need to work on it more.			"

												Apparently, Anna has mixed reviews, and I totally understand why. It has major flaws, which may be repulsive for a lot of people. To be honest, I gave up my first attempt of this game after trying to like it for an hour or so. The unbearable defects that are commonly complained about in the negative reviews of this game: lagged visual movements (poor optimization), ugly UI, and the awkward control. On the other hand, despite the incompetence in those aspects, this game is outstanding in my opinion.The soul of Anna as a game, is undoubtedly its story. Our nameless protagonist, an archeologist, is haunted by reoccuring dreams and déjà vu of a fenced sawmill located in the depths of a mountainous region in Italy, and a woman who seems to have a mysterious bond with him, called Anna. In his last dream, he finally finds himself inside the fence, and feels the presence of Anna ever closer, awaiting in that very house. A tragedy about love and madness, is to be unveiled. Just like how the protagonist is enchanted by Anna and keeps returning to the mill in his dreams, I somehow returned to the game several times in the span of one year and I finally had the patience to play it through. I must admit, it was definitely worthy.To be clear, Anna is a story-based, atmospheric puzzle game featuring psychological horror.Aesthetically, this game is great. When I was outside the house, it was lively and colorful. Once I stepped inside the house, it became gloomy and depressive. As I ventured deeper, the scene grew even more gruesome and macabre. The background music and sound effects of the game are executed perfectly and make significant contribution to the atmosphere. The chirps of the birds, the chatter of the brook, the rustles of the leaves outside the mill, and the creaks of the doors and the floor, the whispers of the ghosts inside the house, combined to be one of the most unforgettable immersion that I had ever experienced in a game. There're lots of reading in this game as well, from the protagonist's personal journal to books about fairy tales and cult rituals, varying from two or three pages to more than ten. Some people may find it tedious to read so much in a game but I enjoy it most of the time. The stories and lores in this game are actually interesting and well-written, and sometimes they're related to the puzzles you'll need to solve.The puzzles in this games are generally vague and abstract, which makes sense as most of them involve ritual procedures or cult traditions. It may take you plenty of time trying to figure out the correct combination of items and wondering what to do next. I'm kind of regretful for resorting to a walkthrough late in the game becuase I had been concentrating for so long that my brain probably became fatigue, which broke the immersion and reduced the sense of achievement each time I solved a puzzle.The game has 8 different endings so there's some replayability if you wanna try them out. It took me 5 hours to finish my first complete playthrough (assisted by a guide in the fifth hour). It's better to beat the game within one or to days to get a more continuous experience.Overall, Anna is not for everyone, especially the ones who don't care much for the story in a game and those who are just looking for a casual game to kill some time.That's about all I have to say. Anna you're flawed, yet you're beautiful in many other ways.			"

												This game was a huge dissapointment to me. I usually like point-and-click games and am also a fan of horror games, so I assumed that Anna would be a great fit. Boy, was I wrong.While the game looks pretty and you can feel that is desperetly tries to have a deep, thrilling story, it fails utterly at it. The story is predictable and one that has been told over and over again, in better and more engaging ways. The ""horror"" is hardly able to amount to slight tension and to top it all off, the music and sound effect is horribly annoying;   After 5 minutes in the first room, I  wanted to kill the person I was supposed to be reaching  and the looping music was driving me mad.In addition to the bad sound effect/music and a dull story, you have to battle with (often) ridicilous and illogical puzzles and sub-par controls, and to top it all of, you have to log into your kalypso account on startup, of course in addition to being logged on steam.The only good side I can say about this game is that the graphics and lighting are both fine.In conclusion, I would say that taking a walk in a thunderstorm with no umbrella, while having to go to the toilet is slightly more appealing to me than to play this game.

												It's a horror game with find-the-right-pixel type adventure gaming. The interface is frustrating and terrible and requires WAY too many mouse clicks to do basic stuff that you do constantly, especially if you have no idea what to do next and are just trying things out. The quality of the sound is terrible, as well, which is too bad because the sounds and narration is a lot of what is creepy about the game. It sounds like they recorded all the voice acting in a bathroom or something. The graphics, especially the grass outside the house, were nice to look at, though, and the music was decent. The story was really disturbing, which is to be expected for a horror game, but dang, this is bad.			"

												This review will be about Anna - Extended Edition. I also played the original version tho im not going to say anything about it. I mean why play the old version when you can play the updated and polished one?Story 8/10The story revolves around a man with amnesia who dreams about an old sawmill in the mountains and a woman he can't forgot - Anna. To find his lost memories, the reason why he lost them and the true identity of Anna, he finds himself at this place again. In order to do so, he's got to solve misterys/puzzles and keep his sanity while witnessing a lot of supernatural phenomena to get his way through all the rooms in the sawmill to eventually find out the truth.Everything will be told to you through voices you hear throughout the game, books you'll find and read, notes the protagonist will make about certain things and with your own intuition. The Extended Edition has 8 different endings which i'll not put on display here so don't worry about spoilers. I enjoyed playing this game while discovering all the different endings and making conclusions on what exactly happend there. The story is not made that easy so you don't get bored after the first time playing it because you already know whats going to happen, but also not that difficult that you can#t understand everything. You will have a great time playing this gem if you pay attention and take your time to read certain books/notes you find throughout the game, because this game is certainly not something you can rush through and expect to understand everything. I enjoyed the story and everything around it and can only recommend it.Gameplay 9/10You see everything from the 1st person view, you have to explore the area and find clues and objects to solve puzzles/riddles in order to progress in the story(If you played something like Amnesia you will have a better image of what i mean). Theres no healthbar in the game so you basically can't die, but theres a bar that shows you your sanity.Meaning if you witness to many harmfull events, the game will end with a rather unsatisfying ending, depending on how far you got.[/i]the gameplay is easy to understand so nothing really there to confuse you. The only thing i would have to mention is that in the beginning the controls might feel a bit off when you are trying to use the objects you found and when you are trying to interact with your enviroment, but that will go away after playing for a bit so no serious problem. Only bad thing i would have to mention is that sometimes the phenomena you witness are bugged. Well leaving the 2 buggs i witnessed aside the game has a solid, simple gameplay.Sound 6/10Dialogs are voiced really good, everything is easy understandable and just fits the situations. Backgroundmusic and sound effects are not especially good or bad. The game also features different background music while exploring the sawmill.Overall the music,dialogs sound effects are good. Nothing special that will be stuck in your head but im not going to use that as a negative point for the game. What i really didn't like is that you can easily notice when something is going to happen, because most of the time theres a change in music slightly before something happens. Personally i think that is the worst thing about this game since it takes away the fear, which..well.. should be in a horror gameConclusion 7/10Taking everything into account im giving this game a 7 out of 10. The story is enjoyable and interesting enough to make you feel like you want to know everything and get all the different endings to find the real truth. Gameplaywise there isn't much innovation but also nothing really bad to say about it.All in all i had a great time playing this game, playing it multiple times to learn more about Anna and her story. Some of the phenomena scared me for good the first time and some of them even for the second and third time :D. I can really recommend this game for people who like horror point&click adventure games. But don't expect the great horror, if you do, choose something else because this game is focused more on revealing the good story with some nice scare-jumps to push up the mood of the game a bit. "

												Anna is a first-person puzzle / adventure that perked my interest in the genre.The basic story involves exploring a house, and getting to the dark secrets held deep within its maze of puzzles. Through the use of books and notes found in the game, we learn more about the characters involved in what happened here. The whole environment has a surreal feel about it, at times beautiful, other times chilling and supernatural. At its heart it is a tale about obsession, the cult of the Sacred Feminine, and worshipping a woman like a goddess.Gameplay involves picking up items and figuring out what to do with them, made more interesting by the creepy ambience and the feeling you are being watched. The mask is definitely right up there as a spine-tingler, and I'm not talking about just how ugly it is. I found myself stuck at least two or three times, so if you don't run to a walthrough at the drop of a hat it is pretty easy to rack up the gameplay hours trying to figure out what to do next. Moments like these are ideal for if you're eating breakfast or having a cup of coffee.Starting the game may seem dull - this is because you begin the game outside the house. Don't let this fool you. It can be pretty, or pretty boring depending on your mood. Once you get inside things start to get interesting. Imagery gets a bit busier - you have a lot more things to look at compared to the open spaces of outside. In the latter half of the game the supernatural events kick in to high gear and things really start to get interesting.Want to know more? I don't want to spoil it for you. It may be short (depending on how fast you do the puzzles), but I found it an enjoyable break between longer games. It has its scary moments but these aren't too bad - you won't quit playing out of fear at any rate.Other points to note: I had no problems getting the game to run on Windows 7, I don't even remember the DRM that others have mentioned. Controls are not the best, granted - but I didn't have any game-breaking bugs.			"

												Anna: Extended Edition represents the natural maturation of Dreampainters debut title. Italian developers corrected the most bitter points of their previous work in order to create a deep and complete game, an homage at the same time to the never-dying adventure game genre and to the most deep and sick horror.Anna Extended Edition has brand new accessible puzzles, a larger area to explore and stronger narrative material. Its so much richer compared to the standard edition that even those who have already finished the original game will find many good reasons for a second play through.In this Extended Edition Dreampainters has given a more professional look to Anna. Now the Italian adventure is also less cryptic and more understandable, although many plot points are still unclear and some puzzles must be solved again with a lot of trial & error.Anna Extended Edition improves the basic title from every point of view. The game is one of the best Horror Adventure available on the market.			"

												I tried really hard to enjoy this game but I just couldn't.The puzzles are frustratingly random and the game makes you spend a lot of time looking for items, you'll find yourself backtracking and checking every single shelf over and over again a LOT. Graphics are beautiful and the OST is pretty nice but out of place. The game has some programming flaws and bugs, most of them game breaking.If you're looking for a horror game, this is DEFINITELY not what you're looking for. Even if you're looking for a puzzle or adventure game, there are lots of better games you should check out first.Don't buy this game. Just don't.I'd give it a 2/10.			"

												This is a game with an awful lot of problems. First off, you need to sign up for a Kalypso acount. I don't think anything else needs to be said; if we already have steam, we should not have to sign up for third party DRM systems. The other major problem is that unlike Amnesia, Portal and the Talos Principle the puzzels aren't intuative at all; I strongly advise against playing the regular edition due to the shear insanity of the puzzel logic and this is the area where I think the EE makes the most improvments. Despite that there's something special about the atmosphere of the game that keeps me coming back and the music is truely wonderful in my opinion. While Anna can't quite match the dread instilled by Amnesia and Alein isolation it is capable of some scary moments; one mid game encounter never fails to make me jump, i think you'll know what I mean when it happens. So despite the problems I am prepared to reccomend Anna EE, though i can't blame you if you try for a refund on it.			"

												Mmnnn... it's not good. It's not good at all. And I don't like saying that, because it looks good and detailed, does some things unique and is indeed rather creepy. But it just fails horribly as a point-and-click adventure game, so it's not actually fun. It's the kind of adventure game where you're just looking around for that random thing that's clickable, and where the puzzles tend to not make much sense. Without a walkthrough, it'd take AGES to beat the game.Which is a pity.			"

												Instead of testing my logic and analytical skills, this game seriously tested my hand-eye coordination instead (lame, I know). The movement in this game gave me a literal headache that I may just have to take sleeping pills to knock me off to sleep.The movement was just horrible and even though I tweaked the mouse speed setting, 30% mouse speed was still pretty fast that I felt like my eyeballs were already crossing from how I had to keep up with the dot. When I lowered it to 20% mouse speed, it felt like I was playing on an a Windows 95 computer. I couldn't seem to find balance with the mouse speed which would prevent me from getting a literal headache. I felt like I wasn't walking either. I felt like I was sleepwalking/floating while dreaming. Not sure if this game actually intended to do that since this game was talking about dreaming about this girl named Anna. Dunno. As much as I want to continue on with the game and experience the game further (and to give merit to my playtime on this game), I had to stop playing before I gave myself a self-induced brain aneurysm from the clunky movement. It also feels pretty strange to be pressing ""esc"" and ""i"" for inventory purposes. It just didn't feel right at all. I found it pretty annoying. Also, what's with the account registration before you can play this game on Steam?Unfortunately, I can't say much about this game since the game gave me physical discomfort and annoyance that I just had to stop before worsening my headache. If anybody can give me tips on how to make this game run smoothly and save me the head pain or something, I will gladly give this game another go and perhaps revise my review.			"

												It`s really a mess, but a very pretty mess with some very scary moments. Things never really come together and the puzzles are sloppy and poorly constructed, leading to wandering and frustration which sucks the horror out of what could have been deeply unsettling. I liked the atmosphere and uniquely creepy happenings, but eventually hit a point where I didn`t care about solving things myself anymore and just wanted to see the ending. It might scratch your itch if you`re running out of horror games to play, but it could have been much, much better. I can recommend this loosely for scaring me a few times, but overall can`t suggest it for anyone but the most hardcore horror lovers.			"

												There is a movie called ""Lady in the water"".  Sometimes when I can't sleep, I will throw that movie on and I will knock out before the opening credits start.  I think I found my new sleeping aid.This game is crap.  The controls are clunky, it is in the horror genre but is not scary in the least.  The sound bytes for doors opening/moving wood around need to be lengthened because the loop is too short.  Opening a door once makes the same creaking sound about 3 times before finishing.  The graphics look ""nice"" but nothing to call home to mom about and the whole story line is just...not interesting.  I played for about 20 minutes before breaking out the walkthrough just to get it over with quickly.Also...whats with the DRM?  The game costs $9.  Why did I have to create an account on some site just to start it up?			"

												I'm a little torn with this game. When I saw the preview I said, ""YES! This looks like some really freaky horror s***!"" But when I played it, My first reaction was one of ""... Huh... That was a thing, that happened...""To be perfectly honest, I'm not entirely dissapointed with the game, but I feel like during the development somebody forgot to ask, ""Hey, I get that we're working on a horror game but... where exactly is the conciquence?"" Don't get me wrong, some legitimately freaky stuff goes on but, it felt more like I was in one of those Haunted House attractions more than playing an actual game. Now I can defend something like Dear Esther utilizing a minimalistic game approach because there was an interesting story woven into the visuals being presented to the player, but this game doesn't seem to really have a story minus ""Demons in a shack... maybe?""I guess it's supposed to be like a 1st person 3D Point-and-click Puzzle adventure, but even then there is a lot of context missing from the puzzles, hell I spent almost an hour trying to figure out how to get into the cottege. If it's on sale and you want a short-lived horror experience then sure, pick it up. Otherwise, it's just kind of ""blah"" as far as horror games go.			"

Very Short and BuggySo, the game itself was good and it had a decent story. However, it was very short and unplayable. Allow me to explain.A vast majority of all players experienced the dreadful graphics glitches as soon as you enter the house. It was technicially playable, but it would near cripple my 8 core CPU gaming rig...I'm not sure if this was ever fixed, but I know I waited 3 months and never got a patch. There was a workaround, but it's not what you think.The extended edition also includes the option to play the original Anna. This version did NOT have the house bug, but it was almost like playing a different game! The interface, story, and puzzles were very different and had an unpolished feel to it.So, basically, I never actually finished the extended edition...			"

												This is honestly one of my favorite games in a way. It is such a haunting and engaging tale. There are reviews complaining about the inventory or whatever, but honestly, I have had no issue with the inventory or never felt like I had to ""pixel hunt"". Just be observant and think outside the box. I have played through this game 3 times for the different endings and simply to experience it again. It is an amazing game that is clearly not for everyone. If your complaining about the ""UI"" and can’t enjoy the game for what it is based upon the fact that they spent their budget on the AMAZING soundtrack or gameplay instead of the UI (that isn’t actually bad in the first place) then you should go play a game that cost half a billion dollars to produce like Destiny and leave real game lovers to enjoy an incredible experience that can really stick with you if you let it. I love this game and would rather pay 9.99 then 59.99 for a game with a great UI but no real substance. Plus you support indie artist who are trying to make great games that don’t have endless DLC's or any other form of money grab. 9.5/10 for damn sure			"

												Jesus. I don't even know why I bought that game, I don't like horror games/movies.Anyway, this is more horror in the sense of 'damn, but that guy has one hell of a screw lose', rather that horror as in 'omg, I'm going to die!!' To be honest, it feels more realistic, since people are more capable of one time horrors, rather than going on killing spree with a hook/chainsaw/...I don't regret playing it, though. It's interesting, and easier to concentrate on the storyline, when you know you're not in danger of dying. And the mix of supernatural/superstitions is really fascinating.On the ++++ size: the musics are absolutely magnificent.On the -- hand: the puzzle sometimes have no sense/are not intuitive. To be honest, I finished the game with the Steam guide, because I wanted to get it done and know the ending.(fun fact: it took me to more than half-way through the game to realize that I was playing a male character and not a female xD )			"

There are a number of different endings which may be a bonus to some people but it did lead me to a rather confusing conclusion that I didn't entirely understand at first without reviewing the other endings.Also, the horror elements are interesting at first but don't seem to have any real 'threat' so become meaningless as soon as you realise this.There were a lot of things I liked about this game but unfortunately it didn't quite gel cohesively in my opinion.

I didn't think too much of the plot and the puzzles are a mixture of 'find small object in dark room' and 'do non-obvious stuff based on what you read in books that can be found in dark rooms where you might not notice them'.   Some people like 'hidden object' gameplay but I'm not much of a fan.More to the point; it's quite glitchy.

												Anna - Extended Edition was one of the earlier games that I got on steam due to it being in a Humble Bundle years ago before I started to collect steam games. Due to the earliness of me getting the game, I am writing this review years after I played it. However, I do remember quite a bit about this game and my hours played do not include the offline hours which would total to around 2 or 3 or 4 more.At the time, I remember that Anna had some decently nice looking graphics and okay movement (at least on the outside of the house). However, the game was quite annoying in finding out what to do next as it didn't really give me lots of hints as to where and what. I also did not like the item usage controls but that wasn't too important. As I figured out what to do in Anna and started to progress through the story (which wasn't too straightfoward at all), I never really felt the scare which I expected that I might feel. Sure some parts were dark and creepy, but Anna never allowed me to feel the scare that games like Dead Space did.Overall, if you enjoy progressing through a story and playing through some creepy situations, go with Anna. However, unless it is on sale, I would not recommend this game.Rating: 6.4/10Recommend: on 75% sale or better only			"

												That's the last time I will buy a game with ""mixed"" reviews. The main problems are:1/  The clunky menus. This is evident even when you start the game. It takes about 16 mouse clicks to get going EACH TIME, which shows the designers simply have no concept of the player experience. Game play is largely ruined by constantly having to deselect inventory items, click through unnecessary text which blocks all other mouse actions, and closing the inventory by typing ""i"" instead of escape, all clicks requiring a little delay before the next action will work. 2/ I didn't find the pixel hunting too bad, but there is far too much randomly trying things in the inventory as some of the ""solutions"" are counter-intuitive. I am a seasoned adventure game player and like to play without walkthroughs but this just isn't worth the effort of doing so.The game isn't bad looking but the ""atmospheric sounds"" feel like they just threw in random effects for a bonus. That's really the problem, it just doesn't feel genuine, it's too formulaic. The real giveaway is the trite writing in the diary, which reads like a schoolkid exercise. Give it a miss.			"

												Before you can start the game you have to sign up for an account and log in with a password, it gets really annoying eapecially when you have to keep restartig the game to deal with issues mentioned later.While playing the game every couple of minutes the lighting breaks and flashes a very bright strobe like light everywhere. This can be quite painful for your eyes if you were playing the game in the dark. I'm using an nVidia card so the excuses of Intel GPUs not being supported doesn't explain the problem. I have checked and made sure that the game is using my Nvidia card. If this happens to you, you will have to repeatedly exit the game and restart to get a few minutes without the bug, sometimes, this doesn't work.I had an issue where I tried to play the game on a large TV screen at 1080p a bit away from me and all the text was too small to read.The overall atmosphere is good, as is the music, there is a good mix of jump scares and creepy storylines but the game is very short and you'll probably either follow a guide or spend quite a bit of time wandering around wondering what you should be doing.While the game can be enjoyable if you can get it working I wouldn't recommend it due to the game breaing lighting bug, it's not worth risking your money for a game you might not be able to play.

												I'm disappointed to write a bad review mainly because Anna is potentially great. Certainly, some games make really easy puzzles, which even a toddler could solve, but I doubt that making puzzles so strange and unusual will help. Whatever I thought was logical, the gameplay didn't. I simply couldn't go far in Anna without googling a walkthrough. The music killed the atmosphere. Seriously. It ruined it for me to the point I turned it off in the settings, and that made things a lot better. But that's not to say the music was bad - it just didn't suit this game, in my opinion. Next - the oil lamp bug. I have no idea if that was just me, but I had to start all over again and follow the walkthrough directions religiously because if I did anything else, my oil lamp would go straight to hell, and it's plretty damn dark is that house, so... have to start again because I just can't see a thing. Another bizarre bug: the walls started to flash so brightly, my eyes were about to bleed. I think I did everything starting from changing game settings and messing with my graphics card to pretty much performing a sacred ritual to the gods of mount Olympus. Didn't help.Overall: puzzles, music, bugs. You wander around the house clueless. Taking the flashing walls, it absolutely killed my motivation to continue playing Anna. Which is sad because there were moments I enjoyed a lot, like looking though the eyes of the three masks. And the goddess mask turning around as you go. Still. Disappointed and would not recommend.

												After putting the game off for a little while due to the fact that I just wasn't feeling up to it to play it, I decided to come back to it to finally continue the game. Unfortunately lots has changed with the game including the unfortunate DRM method in order to play it. This being said the game (through my personal experience) isn't TOO bad though I have little say in it as for I only progressed so far until I decided to take said break. The first room is already cryptic enough in terms of puzzles but the atmosphere does a good job with the dark and creepy vibe. One thing I will say though is that you will find yourself looking at walkthroughs if your puzzle solving skills are not 110% which is one of the reasons why I do not recommend it.But the MAIN reason why I can't recommend this is because the moment you decide to put it off like me, you may suffer the same fate as the game will decide to render itself unplayable. The CD key is, you guessed it, one time use. And guess what? So is the email account! What a joke. There's no way at least to my knowledge that you can re-activate an already registered account. The server itself most likely erases your account due to inactivity which I can understand but at the same time lock you out of the game possibly forever.I was looking forward to coming back to this beautiful horror game but unfortunately the ""best new changes!"" doesn't like people who take breaks.Overall it's a nice little horror game but don't pick it up UNLESS you're sure you'll be dedicated to finishing it without putting it off for a few weeks!

												Basically it's nice as a horror game, but the problem is in the puzzles you need to solve in order to make progress in the game. Surely you have to be carefull about your surroundings wchich they provide small needed items and other details, but some puzzles and combinations of items are really wierd, with no common logic. The story while it starts nice, later in the game, it gets to be confusing. You solve the puzzles but do don't get the satisfaction for uncovering the truth behind the story. Well, perhaps it's because i went a bad ending, that i didn't get the story. It has 8 endings..!! Some books you are supposed to read, which they provide clues, were hard to read for me due to the type of writing. I hope with another ending i could fill the hole plots. I would give 4/10.			"

												I keep seeing reviews putting this game down over the DRM that goes out of its way to be non intrusive. Would it be better if it wasn't there? Sure, but it doesn't really detract from the experience much if at all. As far people claiming how difficult the puzzles are, they must be pretty dull. The puzzles are just challenging enough and they're even spelled out for you in-game. Almost all of the longer more complex puzzles are laid out for you in various books and notes, complete with pictures if you're not much into reading. This game does a good job of maintaining a spooky atmosphere with a variety of events along with an always present AI that pops up unexpectedly. It has some tasteful jump scares as well as creepy audio that keeps you on edge.Story isn't bad and it's fun to piece things together to get the true ending. It's not a grandiose story, but it's short and sweet.I don't regret picking this up and I honestly found this much creepier than Outlast, Slender, or Amnesia.			"

												Looks good and all, but it makes Tetris feel like a heart-pounding hyperspeed thrill ride in comparison. Also, how to strengthen the atmosphere of a ""dream""? Make puzzles with intuition-defying, random solutions. Brilliant. Wait, the opposite of that.			"

												Not worth the time, the story is average, the graphics are nice, but you aren't going to be scared at all. You are going to be frustrated. This game floods your inventory with crap then expects you to combine items seemingly at random to progress in ways which seem to make no sense.Unless you want a fun few hours of reading a walkthrough to find you were meant to run around gluing magic leaves to walls, play a well made game instead.

												I wanted to love this game, but I can’t. At the beginning it looked so beautiful. Outside the mill exploring everything around to find a way in. This was one of only a few logical puzzles in the game. Most of the time you use your incommodious inventory to combine, examine and use your items. The game has good terrifying situations or sets you in depressing mood, but you have so often walk around and try to click on everything, just to see if you can use it. There are eight endings in the game and I found a few, but I will not play it again to find them all. The story is interesting and the more you remember, the more you think: “WTF?”. But overall it bored me and I was glad as I finished it.			"

												Just finished this, a solid 7 hours of play.  Nice game really. For the price, go for it, don't look back.PROS: The mood is excellent, very easy to sink into.The musical soundtrack is amazing.  Really.The first half of the game has very fun puzzles and you will need to stop and think.The story is engaging and the lore and documents you find bring a lot to the mood.The graphics are just great, really nicely done.CONS: The second half of the game. That's it. Many aspects that were good prior to that point suddenly take a drop:The narrative becomes confusing, it's hard to reach a definite conclusion.Some of the puzzles become... how can I say... not hard but simply senseless. Some I solved by pure chance.  ALSO:You can't die. This eventually removes all the fright potential from the game, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Instead of being scary, this game is unsettling.  Really, bloody unsettling.9/10 - Would worship Anna again.			"

												The game is interesting, I'll give it that.  Definitely great in the creep factor, but this game is not something you can play without watching a playthrough or reading a guide, and that really annoys me.  I should be able to figure some things out, but that's not really an option for this game.  There are several different endings and I've seen one and was able to achieve another, but I was left thinking, ""That's it? I spent all this time for this to be the way the game ends?"" So I didn't really feel like I achieved anything other than finally reaching an end to it.  The controls are laggy as well.  I might give it another shot to explore other endings, but I wouldn't really recommend this.			"

												10/10 the best Horror game ive ever played. The Tone is unbelievable. The music is Masterful. The puzzles are amazing. Lets slow down and look at it slowly. Anylizing what we can at a slow rate. The beginning you are outside of the house. An experience i absolutely LOOOVE!! The feeling that i had when i first saw the absolutely stunning visuals is indescribable. This game gave me the chills to an extreme extent when you go inside. Confusing and daunting. I remember how many times i jumped when i saw something that freaked me out. Too many times. Now looking at this game critically. The puzzles are extremely confusing and sometimes make little to no sense. But its not until you finish the puzzle that you realize it did make some sense. Not enough to say that it was just you being stupid, but enough to make you feel like saying ""Ohhhhh"" A lot. This is the first game. The original, unextended edition. Its got amazing visuals, enough to make me feel like my chest is rising. Never before have i felt the inate need to jump into a world. The Ambiance is unreal, aboslutely the best part of the game. Extended Edition:This is where it starts to fall a little bit. This still has the beautiful and even enhanced graphics of the original, but the puzzles were changed. Making people, like me, who played the original to completion confused and a little upset. But nevertheless understandable, after all this game is definately changed. The original you can sink many hours into, the enhanced you can sink twice or triple that amount into. The ambiance is even better and the sound is sublime! Now the hard part for me. The downsides of this game. The Puzzles. If you played other Puzzle Games this will STILL be a challenge. I love Puzzle Games and this one is definately one of my favorites, but you could have played a million puzzle games, all through to completion and this will still stump you multiple times. The story is confusing so dont expect to understand it fully until replaying the game keeping all the past reasonings in mind. Second this is not User Friendly. The Inventory is just as confusing as the puzzles hell it is an awful inventory. How you may ask? The UI is not pretty on the inventory screen, in general actually, its pretty unfriendly to users. Again, How? Well its one of those inventorys that you need to be really finicky about how ot use things, especially in the Extended edition. Its difficult to explain without using it yourself. I found it wresteling with me every now and then but i worked around it. Finally the best part of the game the reason you should totally get this game!                      ITS                  JUST                   AWESOME!!!That may seem like a childish response but its true! Again, difficult to explain. The downside to this game that a lot of people need to understand is that it take a LOT of slowing down. You need to take your time with this game. If it was charged for more, i would say save your money unless your a huge fan of Puzzle and Horror games. This game definately warrants 10 bucks. Absolutely. Play one or the other first. Id reccommend the first one first because its shorter and the game is a little easier to understand. Unless you want to dive Headfirst into a game with gorgeous graphics and a downright amazing story (Once you understand it). If nothing else, buy this game for the Soundtrack. Because OH MY LORD!! THE SOUNDTRACK IS ABSOLUTELY ♥♥♥♥♥♥IC!!! I love games with an amazing Soundtrack, and THIS!! THIS is in the top 3 for me! "

												I was raised on puzzle games, growing up with Myst, Adventure Co., and Lovecraft, so I was hopeful about this game. But I must say that it was wholly disappointing and I really had to force myself to finish it. Everything that I will briefly mention is negative, unfortunately. It was not as beautiful as I had hoped, and I found the levels to be mostly dark and ugly. The music was pleasant enough, but often seemed to clash with what was actually occurring. The story itself was very ugly. Be prepared to not only read about but also participate in pagan rituals (and not really have a clear idea of why you’re having to do them). I felt very, very uncomfortable doing these. Finding out who the characters are is the main goal of the game, but there really isn’t any personal connection to the characters, and no real motivation to want to know them. They are just a mystery. The puzzles are ambiguous and I found that it often became an inventory click-fest. The inventory I found to be one of the biggest irritants. There were about three pages of inventory items, half of them red-herrings and dead ends, and I was constantly scrolling back and forth, equipping and unequipping items, and waiting for the game to load while doing so. That became quite tedious, as did having to read and reread the slow-loading item descriptions that may or may not change the second and third time you click on an item. The text itself I found to be the most irritating part of all. Generally I love to go around collecting books and letters. In this game, I cringed every time I found a book, knowing I would have to read it. The books were generally a mash of useless, repetitive, uninteresting words that you nevertheless had to read through to find a recipe for some puzzle. Not only are they in a rather difficult font to read, the attempts at sounding archaic—filtered through a poor translation—were extremely distracting and unpleasant. The one thing I appreciated was the idea of mouse movement being a sort of feedback for the reactions of the player. However, all that means is that looking around when events are happening will get you killed. In other words, whenever something interesting happens, you are supposed to freeze and look at a wall (I guess). That really isn’t fun. Since a sanity meter was never mentioned, to me this just did not make any sense in the context it was used, and I would have appreciated being told why I was dying. I love scary games with great story. I did not find this game to be at all frightening. It was mostly just uncomfortable and I felt no investment in the characters or their progress in the game. I hate to give such a bad review for a genre I really enjoy, but I would suggest avoiding this game, especially if you are not particularly interested in pagan deities, blood rituals, and fertility cults.

												This may be heavily subjective but I did find Anna boring on occasion. There was not enough motivation to work through the puzzles and the mystery. If the story even can be called a mystery since I found it pretty straightforward. I am sure there are things to think about, to connect. Anna just didn't help me care. It could be more interesting for witchery enthusiasts :P. I found myself looking at a walkthrough a few times since I couldn't be bothered to waste the time. Some parts of the game can be quite obscure.But there are interesting moments. Some moments of sinister ambiance. It is not completely forgettable. Anna isn't necessarily a bad game. But it's certainly not something I'd want to do again.			"

To be honest, playing Anna feels like trying to solve a Rubik’s cube when you’re colour-blind. I think most of the puzzles are way too far fetched for the average player and ruin the spookiness of the experience.			"

												Anna, at least I found, is a pretty confusing mess of a game that doesn’t really know what it is trying to do. At first, it seems like a very cut-and-dry Unity based adventure game (think Gone Home, or Slenderman for its control scheme/layout/control feel). As supposed to those games, however, there is a much lighter tone (at least at first), but once you pass the first true puzzle of the game, the whole mood changes. Gone is the bright, beautiful scenery, replaced with a drab, plain shack essentially. Once in the new setting, more horror based elements start to present them. These aren’t necessarily fear-inducing (which is what I believe this style of game is commonly used for), instead it just has an overall creepy vibe. The creepy vibe is sometimes subdued by the absurdity of the scares at some points (“walk into a room, ooooh there’s blood on the wall! Isn’t that scary?!”). Sometimes, they do have a really effective moment (there is one puzzle I can recall upon completion, a floating mask will follow you around, with the sounds of muffled breathing coming from behind you until you turn around), but these moments are far and few between, and not enough to set the mood. Although these horror elements are going on, there is very soft and relaxing guitar music playing, which partially breaks the immersion with the game. There is also never really any sense of danger (for one, you can’t die, but this is common in these sorts of games). I found there was always just a one off scare, then more relaxing music and adventure-esque puzzles (The first puzzle involves putting two pieces of a mirror shard in an eye hole in the wall, using a pine cone to make an iris, burning said pinecone to “burn the left side of the door to reveal a keyhole (I never gathered this occurred when playing)”, then putting out the eye with a filled canteen). In terms of the story, it follows a person being drawn to the cabin by a mysterious voice to be revealed as “Anna.” Exploring through the game shows that she was an ancient goddess that would lure men into worshiping her, then killing for her pleasure (very similar in narrative to the ancient cult of Diana of Italian mythos). In terms of the endings, they tend to go against the norm that each ending gets progressively worse and worse for the main character as it goes on (the happier ending is the easiest).In conclusion, the game seems to be slightly confused in terms of what it is trying to do. The story was very horror-esque, but at no point did it really feel like it was truly immersive into this role. The music (although nice) didn’t really fit into this game, as well as the different scare tatics implemented.  Overall, I cannot recommend this game for many. If you are a fan of much slower horror games, maybe give this a play (it’s not very long either, clocking in at about 3-4 hours), but as a general note, I cannot recommend the game.			"

												I have not played many horror games, so I am pretty new to the genre.  I think the last one I played was Amnesia, so take my comments with some salt.  This game is pretty, I especially liked the first outdoor area.  It was bright, colorful and gave you a sense of nature that was very impactful.  But then you go indoors, where it is dark, mysterious and creepy.I really think that the developers did a good job making this scary and foreboding, but the puzzles seem designed to be deliberately obscure and hard to figure out.  You have to read every book you find and try to decipher poetic and cryptic entries and apply them to your surroundings.  After spending a ton of time on one puzzle, I gave in and looked up a walkthrough.Then I encountered one of the many progression ending bugs.  Without a walkthrough, it is very easy to do things in an order that will cause you to be unable to progress due to some script not running and a necessary item or switch will not spawn.  This apparently happens a lot, and while there were some legitimate scares and a general sense of unease, the bugs killed any hopes I had at finishing this game.  Worst part is, the bug I encountered wasn’t even one mentioned in the walkthrough, so apparently I found a new way to have the game break.  I liked where it was going and it is an ambitious game as far as moving parts, but I think that ended up biting them as evidenced by all of the bugs.Can’t recommend it.			"

												Good - Interesting story, setting, atmosphere, multiple endings, and things happening.Bad - Game is nigh impossible to complete without a walkthrough especially once you get upstairs.  Puzzles often make little sense and unless you walk around trying every object on every spot, you won't figure it out.  If you miss an object you need to pick up while exploring rooms (and there are a lot of things to pick up), you'll get stuck.  Inventory eventually gets to a ridiculous size.  I had 2 1/2 pages of inventory items at one point (each page holds 16 items), so I had 40 items to try out at every spot.  Also of note is that the game gives you many objects which have no use whatsoever, so they sit around the whole game clogging your inventory and making you waste time trying them out in areas.   Some mechanics are never explained which can really screw you over including your health and combining objects.  Your sanity meter (which is not explained is your sanity) is your health.  If this gets drained, you get booted out of the house and game over.  Hope you saved recently.  Also, you get various memories throughout the game that you're supposed to combine with one another.  The game gives you no hint that you should be doing this or that you're even capable of doing this.  Combining them is the only way to get to the ""True"" ending.A potentially good game ruined by some non-sensical design choices.			"

While I usually enjoy games in this genre (Its most akin to point and click adventures, like Myst), some of the puzzles make so little sense that I believe it is impossible to beat with a good ending, without the use of a strategy guide. That isn't crafting a complex and thought provoking game, it really feels like a short coming on the development side. The inventory system is sloppy, and by the end of the game you have over 20 items in your inventory, and while many seem interchangeable, the game is very specific about which item is used where, without much logical following these necessities.

												I played up to half o the game, which is an okay game, but let me tell you what truly sucks here: the developers.The game is glitchy; slow; I tried several combinations of graphic options, to try to figure out why, and apparently the shadows seem to be causing a major overhead on everything. Disabling shadows and some crazy light effects make the game faster, and I even mentioned that in some threads - but even though developers were following the said thread, no comment was made on that note.Achievments do not work on Linux. This is a known bug, that the devs acknowledge, but completely ignore. After a lot of insistence, I obtained a reply from a dev - saying that the achievments are not an important issue. Which makes me wonder what is an important issue since none of the issues have been fixed for more than 1 year.After some investigation, it seems like these bugs all come from Unity engine, but devs don't even bother to tell that to us. All in all, it seems to me that we are dealing here with highly amateur developers who are incapable of tracking and pacthing flaws in their softwares, and even worse: unable to reach the community.

												I wanted to like Anna, and to a degree I do, but I feel that it tried too hard to be something big.While I did enjoy some of the puzzles, the story, and the atmosphere, the controls and gameplay were creative, but distracting in some areas. Did the game scare me? Sorta. Spooked here and there and having the wood lady suddenly appear next to me did make me jump (not to mention having a few nightmares about her following me). There are some scenes in the game that I feel are just so forced. It tries too hard to be scary to a point it's almost laughable and the gimicks get old. Some points are just plain annoying. Any fear I had just turned is to annoyance and anxiety of having to waddle through several rooms because I missed something and I have to avoid damage. It had potential and it hit some decent marks, but overall it was an experience I could live without.			"

												The game is beautiful. If you have the opportunity to try it, you'll realise that it sucks. I don't understand the logic of the puzzles (maybe i'm stupid so I won't argue on that point anymore). Menus and interacting architecture is just out of comprehension. To use or to combine items seems way too hard to do to get used to it. I dropped this game even if I wanted to go on because of these reasons. So the game itself is sound, but playing it is a pain.

												Anna is a game in which you play as some random guy who's having a dream, maybe, about wandering around a creepy old sawmill full of vague occult imagery, riveting puzzles like ""put some water in your canteen and then pore it on a fire to get a key"", a spooky woman's voice who accuses the unnamed, uncharacterized protagonist of being a bad person who may have done A BAD THING in the past, and lots of other totally deep and meaningful things.If the above paragraph sounds at all interesting to you, get some better taste. Don't play Anna. "

												I feel bad rating down an indie game, but I think it's appropriate in this case.I suppose the best way to describe it is to simply treat it like a sandbox horror and not a puzzle game.Firstly I would like to establish that this game DOES have some VERY good moments (creepy poltergeist moments when you run affoul some of the 'spooks' like the wooden mannequins). But overall the game isn't actually remotely scary at all.That aside, the gameplay is awful. The interface is very clumsty and requires a ridiculous amount of precision. It is supposed to be a 'puzzle' game, but the puzzles are completely nonsensical. There are little to no clues for solving most of them, you just spam trial-and-error with every silly combination of materials until something happens, and then you must repeat it a number of times just to get one puzzle done (and believe me, a lot of the combinations are the most inane and arbitrary you could imagine- like sticking a pinecone into a mirror and lighting it on fire to open a nearby door- and that's the easiest one). Basically, you don't ""Solve"" anything, you're just supposed to ""know the answer"".Furthermore, after playing through the game, you just get the 'bad' ending, because you didn't solve the 'other puzzle'. After watching the solution played on youtube (the guy spent over an hour randomly punching in combinations until they fit together), I decided it wasn't remotely worth it and uninstalled it.			"

												At first I was so frustrated by the Kalypso DRM and nonsensical puzzle solutions that I wanted to kill my in-game avatar any way I could. Unfortunately, this feature went beyond the programming capabilities of the developers. Attempts to combine all manner of objects such as 'Hunting Knife' and 'Sharp Fragment' with 'Self' were to no avail. Luckily for me, Dreampainters Software predicted my frustration ahead of time and presented me with the only logical choice for someone in my situation;to walk away. Thanks to this genius design decision, I was able to complete their game in just over an hour and continue idling for cards.			"

												Hmmm...I dunno.  I really, really don't know.  It's got a good setting for a horror game, and a lot of creepy ideas...but somehow, just isn't that spooky.  And the pace at which your character walks around is AGGRAVATING, especially in all those long, winding tunnels at the end.  And the scenery isn't anywhere near as spectacular as the similarly-paced and similarly-themed Dear Esther, and nor is the story as intriguing, so...it's all a step in some kind of ""right"" direction, but just never seems to quite reach its intended destination.  Which is...a poignant, slightly disturbing ending?  Again...not quite.  But its heart is most definitely in the right place.     Maybe the ""Extended Edition"", which I'll admit I've yet to play, will rectify some of the shortcomings (including, one hopes, all those typically obscure ""adventure"" game puzzles which don't necessarily make all that much sense, even once you've somehow bluffed your way through them by humouring every remotely viable solution you can possibly think of)!  And I do look forward to the next release by Dreampainters, 'cause the intent is all here...just not the execution.  Better luck next time.Verdict: 4.5/10.			"

												This game. I was hoping when I put it in that it was going to be the next Amnesia, but sadly, it’s not even close. It’s like a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ adventure game with horror elements, but it isn’t scary in the slightest. The controls are terrible and a lot of the puzzles don’t make sense. The one interesting thing about this game is that it tracks where you focus on and adjusts the horror accordingly. For instance, if you’re fascinated by a drawing on the wall, soon you'll start seeing it everywhere. But one interesting mechanic doesn't make a game. The tone frequently switches from peaceful to creepy, and it just doesn't mesh well. Don't Waste Your Time.1/5 "

Anna, however, didn't do that. We spent about an hour wandering around trying to figure out how to make things work, then gave up and went to watch a youtube video for a hint. We ended up just watching the youtube videos for the whole game, because none of the puzzles made any sense. A point and click horror game with no sense to the puzzles just ... makes no sense. Instead of bonding through a shared horrifying experience, we bonded over how senseless it was.			"

												This recommendation  isn't a hard ""no"" - more of a ""maybe, leaning slightly towards no"".I very much enjoyed Anna's story and mystery. Inventory management is a little cumbersome and the game fails to properly communicate some of your options, so it might be a little difficult to get into if you're not used to some of the conventions of adventure games. The music is strong and moody, but sometimes doesn't quite seem appropriate to the situation. It may take you several playthroughs to see all the endings, which can be annoying, but the game isn't that long so it could be worse. Actually, overall I spent a lot of time thinking ""___ isn't great but it could be worse"" for almost everything except the story.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2013/10/anna-extended-edition.html "

												First of all, this is not puzzle game, but low budget first person point&click adventure (a very typical one), with clunky controls. The main problem is that this adventure takes every textbook design aspect, even the bad ones and just applies them with very little thought. By the first 15minutes of the game you will be in your inventory combining stuff with a stuff, running around the house to figure out what to click next, because you just missed something. Point&click adventures without logic behind their actions usually end up as a very frustrating experience and so does this game. I could possibly forgive this problem (because I do like adventures), but as you progress in the game it gets more and more tedious. Inventory gets bigger, more rooms to visit... so many illogical possibilities open up.The game also wants to be horror experience and so is trying to be like (for example) Amnesia with its ""sanity meter"", but in the end it forces you to miss a lot of the cool and ""scary"" stuff around you, because the game is built upon events that will spring around you and so when you stop and look at some of it, you will lose a portion of sanity. Sometime you will even lose sanity seemingly by itself... making you to even more to focus on the running around blind to the scenes around you. Do you hear a scary sound? Quickly run walk away, it might be something cool for a change.On the other hand, the story seems to be interesting even if the delivery is bit of a mess. Level design is very fine, with bits and pieces done wrong. Music is very good, and as voice acting goes, it will not offend you even though script is totally forgettable.Simply put, the game is not well designed. It has very pesky and completely unnecessary DRM. Technical aspects of the game have their share of problems (I guess Unity engine implementation done wrong) and to this day my Linux version still does not work properly, for some reason I could only walk around in the garden.

												Where to start?While this game looked promesing when I first heard of it, I'm really disappointed after having it played for a while. The windows version is DRM protected by some perma-online nonsense from what I've heard and the Linux version (which I played) is as buggy as it can get.On decent Hardware with latest kernel and proprietary graphic drivers this game will just glitch out permanently. All (scripted) cut scenes run in slow motion. What should be a short (couple of seconds) screen shake lasted for minutes on my system. Some textures (e.g. the water) are just missing and the lightning I awful. Depending on which point of the game I start the screen is either way to heavy on red or yellow.TL;DR This game would be OK for horror fans if the Windows version wouldn't be DRM contaminated. Non-Windows gamers I hearthly recommend NOT buying this game. Steam offers a couple of better scary games than Anna. Go get those!PS: Support has been ignoring my emails for a while. By ignoring I mean ignoring my issues with responses of the like ""update drivers"", etc. After over a month trying to get something from support they wrote me that the contacted the developer.

												Definitely happy that I didn't pay full price for this. The atmosphere is done really well. There's always a feeling of unease, and when stuff starts happening around you it's pretty insane and unsettling, which is great. However, I feel like without the guides I found online, I wouldn't have been able to figure out a lot of what was supposed to be done because some of the tasks are so convoluted. The story itself isn't that bad, but it i very predictable and when the character starts to piece it together, they kind of play stupid and it's frustrating being 5 steps ahead of the character. I think the game looks pretty, and that was one of the reasons I wanted it, and it will be more enjoyable to replay and try to get different endings now that I have a better idea of what to do. There is some replay value to it, because there are several different endings you can get, but other than trying for different endings, which some people might not try to do, there isn't replay value. My biggest complaint though, is that if you play it on Windows, you have to register or sign in to a Kalypso account. Every. Single. Time. You. Launch it. It's a minor annoyance the first timme. After the second time it gets old. It's bad enough having to set up an account, but it's made worse by needing to log in to it every time you go to play. Only the people who play it on Windows have to sign in to Kalypso though, so if you don't play on windows, that won't affect you. Overall, I wouldn't recommend the game, especially at full price, unless you like confusing tasks and predictable stories.			"

												This game  never ran on my computer, ever.  I contacted the company, and the fixes they sent were just files I already had on my computer.  No explanation for why the game would not run, it just never progressed beyond a blank (black) start wiindow. First and only game that I've bought from Steam that would not run.  No refund, of course.UPDATE: Got a new PC. Looked promising that it might run on this one. But when I tried to register my account, it said 'that email already in use,' and wouldn't allow me to register. So I can't play. Seriously, what idiot at Kalypso thought forcing people who've already bought the game to register additionally to play it was a good idea!?			"

Randoming losing mental health due to event seemingly unconnected to your actions doesn't help, either.			"

The puzzles are also try everything on everything until something happens. i got it on sale and I'm glad I did because it would feel like a waste to buy it at full price. I'm not saying don't get it I'm just saying if you like story and atmosphere get it, but get it on a decent sale if you can.			"

												I've invested a little less than half an hour into this game after it became abundantly clear that this is not something I can enjoy. I love a good adventure game and after playing Amnesia, I've bought this game -thankfully on a sale- to satisfy my urge for more scary, adventure-y goodness.  Unfortunately I was disappointed.The game starts with asking you to create a Kalypso user account (which is essentially an extra layer of unneccesary DRM); something we don't need nor will probably ever use. It is noted on the Store page for the title however, so buyers beware.  In the game, your character moves in a fashion that I could only call unnatural. I don't know if it is due to the FOV or something else, but I felt literally nauseated after playing for 15 minutes. I normally don't get motion sickness from first-person games, especially ones with a relatively slower movement speed, like this one. But since I've spent very little time with the title I can't tell if its a fluke or not. The user interface is horrible. It simply is badly designed, so much so that I had to check if it was a console port or something(It isn't). It is completely counter-intuitive, hard to navigate and use. In an adventure game, this is unacceptable. The options menu is very barebones, it feels like the developers made it as an afterthought, quite reminiscent of a bad port instead of the PC exclusive title that we have.The puzzles are very contrived and illogical(unlike say, Monkey Island, it really doesn't have any redeeming qualities, such as being humorous). By the time I managed to go into the house(you start outside at the beggining) I've already lost my interest in the game.  I don't care  if the game opens up or gets very scary afterwards, I simply didn't see any reason to stick with it any longer. The game looks pretty and it ran on my machine smoothly without any problems. I haven't encountered any bugs. The sound assets used were quite good. All in all, the game might get better later on, for all I know. But I didn't want to struggle with the bad UI and the uninspired puzzles to get to the meat. I uninstalled the title immediately after exiting it. I would recommend the prospective buyer to watch a gameplay video so that they can decide if the problems I report are relevant to them.If you're a fan of the genre, you might want to pick it up at a sale. But I can not, in good conscience, recommend this game.			"

												This is one of the best adventure/horror/escape the room games I've ever played. It's amazing how much they put together to make a single house seem so menacing and creepy.Yes the controls and interface suck, but nothing that makes the game unplayable. It seems most people are complaining about its technical quality and how they felt its puzzles were too hard, so if you're looking for an easy story driven or survival horror game, with smooth game-play, action or good looking graphics, this game is not for you.It will, however, please the old fans of ""Myst"" and Sierra's 90's horror adventures such as ""Shivers"", who look for terrifying atmospheres and challenging puzzles.

While the game it self isn't very long if you are a mastermind in the arts of puzzle solving, it has some flaws as you will have to solve puzzles which doesn't make much sense and there is a lot of combining in it. This is however not a complet puzzle game, you will have the chills all the way through the game as scary event will tear your insides apart. The developer did a great job making the game scary without scaring you away.I love such scary games and even though I am not much of puzzle fan i do recommend that you try this.

I like the psychological aspect of this game, the way i knew there is no death, there is no losing, and there won't be a monster chasing me, but still i was terrified. I simply recommend this game to whoever that is tired of monster and blood games, and want some horror in a smooth pace.			"

												Wow, what a mess of a game.  The brief outdoors portion is pretty, but the rest is nothing to look at.  The story is convoluted, impenetrable, and boils down to a reveal that has been done to death in far better movies and video games.  The puzzles are the very worst of adventure game logic, rubbing things in your inventory against other things until something happens - and I say that as a fan of King's Quest! The translation of this game is shoddy, which may have contributed to my enjoyment (or lack) of the story.  There's a few moments of good horror game scares, but they're overused quickly.  In fact, that sums up my experience - a few moments of good game design, buried in way too much mediocrity.			"

As for the experience the game is wonderful in that you can get far by just doing methodical research and reading books you find. It is not particulary easy game though. If you can get all the achievements then you have sure done quite a long days worth of work getting them. In the end i prefer Amnesia type games where the objectives are more clear and finding stuff is not that central to the game. I dont particulary like the huge inventory you got as the game progresses and the card combinations that reveal thought about yourself is just bad.			"

												It has a LOT of truly scary, very good moments. I like this game, mostly. But my problem isn't with the story, or the graphics, or any of that, it's simply the fact that this game does not make clear what certain interface elements are, and it makes for a huge problem later on. Unless you're prone to save scumming, so to speak, and big into going back and forth in your save files, this is going to prove to be a problem for you, I guess that if you read this, it'd be alright too. But there's some sort of sanity meter in the form of a creepy eye in the item select screen. Now, for the first few hours of gameplay it didn't move, and I honestly thought it was decoration. But later I found that it in fact was not, and by the time I had, it'd gone down too much for me to meaningfully continue the game. If there's some way to replenish it, I haven't found it. I tried staying in light, like other games have you do, but that didn't really work, so I cannot continue playing because a cutscene draws some of my sanity meter and I instantly lose.			"

												I like the horror elements of the game, the graphics, the music, the atmosphere, and the story. The game is very immersive and there are parts of the game that were pretty scary. But the inventory management system is a constant pain in the butt, often requiring four clicks in the items menu just to see if something works. The puzzles make absolutely no sense and as a result leave the player feeling frustrated and annoyed instead of terrified. Furthermore the incomprehensible puzzles slow your progress down to a crawl. When you're not searching the cabin inch by inch for a needed item, you're asking yourself ""how in the hell is that supposed to work?""I recommend just looking up a video walkthrough and just watching that instead. You'll get the story and experience of Anna without the headaches, frustration, and guesswork needed to complete this game.			"

												I'll try to write a good review about Anna, pretty much like how this game TRIES to be a good game. In fact, ""trying"" is the whole theme of this game: It's a game that TRIES to be clever. It's a game that TRIES to be scary. It's a game that TRIES to offer a well-balanced challenge. It's a game that TRIES to be immersive. Sadly, it fails, leaving this Amnesia♥♥♥♥♥point-and-click adventure knockoff a title best left for the dust mites.			"

												I loved adventure games back in the old days of PC. I liked solving puzzles and I also like horror stories.I've attempted to play Anna three times, quite desperate to get into it. In the end, I found myself not satisfied in any category - the gameplay is boring, the horror isn't exciting and I very quickly lose the drive to solve any of the puzzles. I'd love to see the story until the end, but I know I'll just find myself reading the guide just to get through it, and there's no fun in that.Personally not one I'd recommend.			"

The game does not provide a sense of ""chilling"" and is by no means ""horrific"", what it is however is a gigantic group of puzzles that make so sense whatsoever, forcing the player to click around randomly until they are lucky enough to somehow move forward through the game.I am yet to try the ""extended edition"" as my first playthrough was incredibly mind numbingly boring.

												I don't even know where to begin with this wretched title.  The physics are a fetid pile of dung, objects get caught on things that may or may not exist in the scene, the player movement is akin to shuffling about with giant magnets attached to your feet, and to top it all off it's not scary in the slightest.  For an attempted horror game, that last point is pretty important.  Scare moments are akin to things leaping out and yelling ""boo"" and tend to be amazingly predictable.  I found myself constantly frustrated and tired by the inability for this game to do anything but a few visuals correctly.			"

												Well... this game was on my wish list and I was excited to play it... but for some reason I didn't find it as engaging as I wanted too.  (Played extended edition version)This is your basic - First Person puzzle solving adventure/story board game.   I generally like those, even more because it is somewhat a scary/horror style.However after playing it a few timee for a couple of hours.  I found myself not wanting to play it.  It starts out and the outside, first floor/couple of rooms are fun and the puzzles seem somewhat logical with few moving parts.Then I went upstairs and back downstairs... I had suddenly 30 items and none of the puzzles made sense and the cryptic journal books didn't help.  After wondering around, putting on masks, melting wax, and burning gold... I didn't want to play anymore.It played well, good set up, atmosphere, and puzzles, but it ran away from my attention midway I think.  Guess it wasn't for me?  Perhaps for someone else who has more patience than I do.			"

A Not-So-Horror Game! [KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]Game is a pretty standard point-and-click adventure in a nice 3D environment... It had a charming appeal on me so I finished it in a couple of days - all the 8 endings. There are not any combat but there a couple of scary encounters, but I won't ruin your fun describing them!Puzzles are nice and unobtrusive but they don't always make sense, so you will often have to try every item combinations to advance in the game. There is also a help system if you really don't have any clue what to do. You can die, but it really requires some efforts (and this is a plus for me!)...Music is nice and so are the special effects. I did not encounter any bug - maybe they have been fixed in the latest patch.Ok, the game is not a masterpiece, but the story is nice and the gameplay is addictive. I found it worth playing.Best played with Keyboard and MouseRecommended Buy Price < 8$Score 8/10 "

												Anna's developers seem to be operating under the assumption that modern adventure games need to return to their roots, and that the best way to do that is to reintroduce pixel hunting and hours of rubbing every item in your inventory against every other item. While there's some truth to the argument that we as gamers have become spoiled by too-obvious gameplay hints and on-screen tutorials that follow you from the first five minutes of a game all the way to the final boss, the solution is not throwing out everything we've learned about game design over the last 30 years in favor of pointlessly frustrating authenticity.

												After finishing through the ""Truth"" ending I felt so compelled to write a review on the game. To say the least, this gaming experience had its unforseen ups and downs. It balances out in the end, but overall it was a gaming experience I do not often have.For one, let us start with story. What the Serious Heck, I mean seriously, What the Heck! This game had a amazing storyline that is at first not obvious to gamer's eye and WOW! The ending! Personally, one of the better storylines that leaves you hanging at the end. On this, the game could not seem to fail at all...That is until we hit Gameplay... Gosh, that was annoying. You will strangle yourself much like that creepy tree event does at some points. Ugh, I thought this would be fun, not tear out your hair. While it is fun to explore the house, the things you are supposed to be doing is unobvious and you often get stuck. The puzzles were fun however and when you get to some of them they are interesting and a challange. It is the grab the hook you missed in the other room kind of thing that got me annoyed. This is a horror game so let us mention scares. Anna is not a jump scare kind of horror, although there is a few instances. (I HATE YOU TREE LADY!) Overall, the atmosphere, the spectacular audio, and the creepy events that leave you scared to move foward for a few seconds are what get to you. The backstory and some rooms also really add to this factor. Graphics were a problem for me for the the first hourish of gameplay. The graphics were not bad in any way what so ever. It was a certain glitch on my computer that made me almost end the total go through. I did solve this however, but had to play on a small window screen. 800x600 to be exact. Not too much of a problem although it caused some google searching and experimentation to fix the problem.The last thing I want to mention is the music and sound. Those both really took me in and freaked me out! Not to mention the game giving you ten songs of theirs to listen too. Wow, however composed the music did a excellent job. Not forgetting the ingame sounds that send chills down your spine. This area earned a perfect score for me in the game.Overall, I say play it. The game has its bugs and can be annoying however! The story is not to be missed and the sound/audio/atmosphere/ and so much more really make a excellent game.TotalStory-10/10Gameplay-5/10Scares-8/10Graphics-7/10Audio-10/10Overall 40/50Play the game, expect some frustration however... Just remember, the other stuff in the game make up for it!			"

												I've always found this game to be oddly... Charming, in a way. It brought me to love a character whose face you never really see, whose voice is all you hear, and whose name resonates in your mind like a song stuck in your head with every step you take. Overall the game stuck with me because of the ambience and mood of the world as a whole. The story itself is somewhat unremarkable, but the way it's told is another case entirely, and very nicely lends itself to the style of the game. Overall I recommend it for a once or twice off enjoyable experience.			"

All around, it's a fun game, but some of the visuals don't make sense at all. Halfway through, if you read everything you get, you can pretty much guess a part of what's going on. The different endings were all interesting to a point. I still missed one ending...Good game, worth playing through. There's an achievement for not using the internet for help, but I don't get how that works. I had to get a walkthrough about 1/3 of the way in, since I was totally stumped.			"

												I really like Kalypso and their Tropico series. Never tried other genres made by them, so I tried horror. I be blunt - there's no much of horror. More of random ambient sounds, suddenly moving object and atmosphere trying to be scary. There's a lot of unclear puzzles tossed everywhere, without any hint or sign, forcing you to circle in two small rooms. Maybe if you are very prominent in puzzle games, you can have some fun there, but I spent about two hours clueless.Want puzzles without any hint, where you need to think about everyhting? Good, play it.Anything else? Go away, it's not the game for you.			"

												This game is a straight-up adventure game that should appeal to anyone that is a fan of those types of games.  I found it a fun diversion from my usual FPS and RPG games.  The developers put in a phrase that says, It Makes No Sense, when you are doing something wrong that kept me laughing as I tried multiple things to move the story forward.  The game is short, like scary short, like is $10 worth 3 hours of play, kind of short.  The story gets ""BIZARRE"" as you continue and I had some 70's flashbacks on many levels.  The blacklight room art caused quite a bit of amusement in my home!!  LOL!  I bought this game on sale for a couple of dollars down from  $10 and I don't feel like I was cheated.   Just understand that this game is very short and can be easily finished in 3 hours or less!  The story is actually interesting and I found the game to be fun to play.  If all that sounds good, then play on :)			"

												The game while its got a great atmosphere the puzzles aren't that hard although some solutions as others have said don't make any sense at all like at the start you cut a rope with a knife to open some small doors and behind those doors is a concrete wall. Now behind that concrete wall is some gears that operate the door allowing you to get in the building but you need to use a small weak little wooden twig to break though a concrete wall....told you its not very realistic or logical.Lastly this game does have a lighting bug that pops up now and then where any light source gets insanely bright and flashes for a couple seconds but mostly happens after the game has been paused for a while or if you use the steam overlay(Shift+Tab) for a while.6/10 Overall its a decent game with ok atmosphere but don't expect much			"

												When I first booted up this game my expectations sat somewhere between one of those dreadful mobile hidden object games and Amnesia the Incompetent Descent. Suffice to say I had no idea what this game was.Though a bit rough on the eyes, Anna is a surprisingly enjoyable puzzle adventure game. Though I never played them as a child, I imagine this game would be vaguely nostalgic to those who grew up addicted to the likes of Myst and the spin-offs that arose from it's success.In Anna you explore a world in the first person view, while solving puzzles in a classic, retro style point and click fashion. Luckily as far as I have seen, there is no absurd Sierra logic behind the item combinations.Driving the gameplay forward is an underlying narrative that's a bit of a mix between horror and psychosis with some supernatural sprinkled on top for good measure. I can't say that I have too strong of an understanding of the plot thus far, but I'm interested none the less.			"

												I've always found this game to be oddly... Charming, in a way. It brought me to love a character whose face you never really see, whose voice is all you hear, and whose name resonates in your mind like a song stuck in your head with every step you take. Overall the game stuck with me because of the ambience and mood of the world as a whole. The story itself is somewhat unremarkable, but the way it's told is another case entirely, and very nicely lends itself to the style of the game. Overall I recommend it for a once or twice off enjoyable experience.			"

												This game is way far from the kind I'm addicted to, so all pros and contras mentioned below are nothing more than how the thing are looking through the scope of my (casual player's) perception:The main con worth mentioning is being totally out of option to kick asses all the game through or get busy with any other equivalent kind of action. That's the worst part :). Another (lesser) issue I had(first couple of times i tryed to play it) was about the game play ""rhythm"", which lead me to some difficulties with balancing immersion and progress through the story. Too many dead ends and game-critical fatalities followed by annoying false endings you cannot skip(or save game reloadings).Pros are more prolific. The game's mood is a mix of gloomy, grim, mournfool and melancholic ones, and so is the look of locations you're doomed to spend most of your time in-game. Music, voice acting, the sense of things you discover along the story are all of the same colour. Yet there's a lot of impressive beauty put into it.The storyline seems very ambiguous, especially one in the extended version, giving much more information, mostly of the kind which makes things even more obscure than they were before you got ""updated'.  As a result, it looks like one (relatively clear) story with random elements of two others attached to it to increase the volume of content. Not saying it's bad, this simulation of mysteries yet-to-reveal greatly contributed to my own interest towards what the game was trying to tell before i found out enough to figure things out(though i'm not sure this rate of clearness is really enough for it, even after checking what wikipedia says :)). Anyway, the whole thing is impressive and immersive enough to make me want to get that ""you've completed this game 100%"" achievement.After all, I've got myself loads of worlds to save, locations to clean sweep and a variety of hostile asses to kick in other games with much more obvious game stories.And than get back to this one and finish what's left of it to complete.Recommended, good game, 8 of 10 ---------------------------Вообще игра не из тех в которых я стандартно рублюсь, так что все за и против, которые я перечисляю ниже это не более чем то как она смотрится через прицел моего (как случайного игрока) восприятия.Главный косяк это конечно то, что в этой игре не надо(и нельзя) никого валить на всем ее протяжении, и нет какого либо другого эквивалента активной деятельности. Это главный недостаток :)).Другой, (менее важный) раздражавший в первую пару заходов в игру фактор, это некоторая сложность нахождения баланса между погружением в мир игры и успешным продвижением по сюжету. Многовато тупиков и фатальностей, приводящих или к периодическим просмотрам занудных неотключаемых ложных концовок или к перезагрузкам с сейвов.Плюсов побольше.Атмосфера в игре - смесь мрачного, зловещего, печального и меланхолического начал, как раз в тон окраске локаций, в которых проходит бОльшая часть игрового времени.Музыка, озвучка и сам смысл элементов сюжета, образно говоря, все того же цвета. Однако во все это вложено и немало мрачной красоты.История  кажется во многом непонятной, особенно в расширенной версии, где информации гораздо больше, но в основном она вся того рода, после которого начинаешь понимаешь чуть ли не меньше чем до того, как тебя ""проинформировали"".  Похожа она в результате на одну более менее понятнуюю историю, к которой приделано несколько случайных элементов от пары других историй ради увеличения общего объема. Не пытаюсь сказать что это плохо, эта симуляция тайн, которые предстоит раскрыть лично мне изрядно добавляла интереса к тому, что эта игра пытается рассказать до того, как я узнал достаточно, чтобы начать что то понимать в сюжете. Не уверен правда что имеющейся степени понятности для этого достаточно. Даже после ознакомления с тем что по этому поводу пишет википедия)).Но в целом игра впечатлила и заинтересовала достаточно для того, чтобы хотелось ее допроходить до ачивки ""вы завершили эту игру на 100%"".  У меня в конце концов хватает игр с гораздо более очевидными сюжетами, где можно спасти миры, зачистить локации и надрать всевозможные вражеские задницы.А потом вернуться к этой и допроходить до полной ясности.Короче в целом рекомендую, игра хорошая, 8 из 10			"

												Anna - Extended Edition review: Anna is a spooky as hell game, it's not much more than a point-and-click adventure game, yet it is so much more than a point-and-click adventure game. You play an 'amnesiac' who is drawn to an old abandoned sawmill, where some really disturbing events happened and you need to discover who you are and why this 'Anna' calls to you. The main gameplay mechanism is - pick up items and combine/use items on things in the environment to progress the story. I found that some of the puzzles were kind of absurd, like use a stick to smash through a concrete slab, but for the most part they are fairly consistent to the world. You will run into puzzles that you might think are completely absurd, mostly the ones dealing with occult rituals, but once you know the story and can decipher the metaphors everything begins to connect. This is what I found most entrancing about this game and it kept me thinking about the story even throughout the day.Now, I have not yet unlocked the 'True Ending' yet, so I still don't even know everything about the story. But I have received the 'Good Ending' and I am not going to spoil anything, but once you understand the ending, it really is a, ""holy♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;, kind of moment. Despite still wanting to get the 'True Ending', I am hesitant, since this game gives me serious anxiety. It is not jump out of your seat scary, or will have you screaming in fear. But the whole mood of the game has this lingering malice that is always present, like a evil entity is constantly watching you. There are also hallucinations that sometimes occur which can have some disturbing imagery, or the god-awful sounds, specifically that women dying in the bedroom (you know what I'm talking about if you've played this game) that can really drive you mad.I laud the Italian dev team for the unique story, and the fact that the more you play - the more you discover; there are details in every corner and each one adds something to the story. The aesthetics are also well crafted and blend with the environment. It really feels like an old abandoned European log cabin in the woods (not the movie). And as a matter of fact Anna has a tone similar to a Grimm fairy tale. This is not going to be a game for everyone specifically the less patient or possibly the Amnesia fans. I can easily see some players getting bored with the game, to scared to play, or annoyed by having to look up a guide to solve some puzzles (I had to use a guide several times). But I still do highly recommend it, if you are looking for something new and spooky with a rewarding story, then Anna is for you.Recommend.			"

All around, it's a fun game, but some of the visuals don't make sense at all. Halfway through, if you read everything you get, you can pretty much guess a part of what's going on. The different endings were all interesting to a point. I still missed one ending...Good game, worth playing through. There's an achievement for not using the internet for help, but I don't get how that works. I had to get a walkthrough about 1/3 of the way in, since I was totally stumped.			"

												After finishing through the ""Truth"" ending I felt so compelled to write a review on the game. To say the least, this gaming experience had its unforseen ups and downs. It balances out in the end, but overall it was a gaming experience I do not often have.For one, let us start with story. What the Serious Heck, I mean seriously, What the Heck! This game had a amazing storyline that is at first not obvious to gamer's eye and WOW! The ending! Personally, one of the better storylines that leaves you hanging at the end. On this, the game could not seem to fail at all...That is until we hit Gameplay... Gosh, that was annoying. You will strangle yourself much like that creepy tree event does at some points. Ugh, I thought this would be fun, not tear out your hair. While it is fun to explore the house, the things you are supposed to be doing is unobvious and you often get stuck. The puzzles were fun however and when you get to some of them they are interesting and a challange. It is the grab the hook you missed in the other room kind of thing that got me annoyed. This is a horror game so let us mention scares. Anna is not a jump scare kind of horror, although there is a few instances. (I HATE YOU TREE LADY!) Overall, the atmosphere, the spectacular audio, and the creepy events that leave you scared to move foward for a few seconds are what get to you. The backstory and some rooms also really add to this factor. Graphics were a problem for me for the the first hourish of gameplay. The graphics were not bad in any way what so ever. It was a certain glitch on my computer that made me almost end the total go through. I did solve this however, but had to play on a small window screen. 800x600 to be exact. Not too much of a problem although it caused some google searching and experimentation to fix the problem.The last thing I want to mention is the music and sound. Those both really took me in and freaked me out! Not to mention the game giving you ten songs of theirs to listen too. Wow, however composed the music did a excellent job. Not forgetting the ingame sounds that send chills down your spine. This area earned a perfect score for me in the game.Overall, I say play it. The game has its bugs and can be annoying however! The story is not to be missed and the sound/audio/atmosphere/ and so much more really make a excellent game.TotalStory-10/10Gameplay-5/10Scares-8/10Graphics-7/10Audio-10/10Overall 40/50Play the game, expect some frustration however... Just remember, the other stuff in the game make up for it!			"

												Now this game totally makes sense...-NOT! I mean to get through this game without the walkthrough is just simply impossible. Even the brainiest people would not exel for the simple reason that there is no logic that you could follow. So that would be the negative bit.  Now on the other side though... THE EFFECTS ARE SIMPLY AH-MA-ZING! I'm having fun taking screenshots in the game. Which means that there is good art work put in to that game. Very pretty to look at. Specially outside and few places in the house as well.  Also I personally love how scary it is. I mean it just makes your hair on your back stand up. It makes me scream uncontolably in every 5 minutes and then if there are other ppl in the room they jump as well coz my screams are real. Filled with real and utter terror. But it can also be that I am a scaredycat... Hmm... I suppose ppl are different but one thing is for sure. When you want difficult puzzles, great(difficult) storyline to follow(in this game it means to figure out yourself whats it actually about) and a game that sends shivers down your spine(if not all the time then at least couple of times definitely) then ANNA EXTENDED EDITION is YOUR GAME ;)			"

												This game is a technical mess when I played it last...First off, this game is so awfully optimized that as soon as I stepped in the sawmill, my framerate dropped to about 15. I fiddled with the options for a long while, and even at the lowest settings the framerate still refused to go back up. My PC specs are fairly high, as I can run most other games with 60+ frames.Second, I experienced multiple bugs right when I jumped in. Several things were off about the lighting as well, where as if I stared at a light for too long, it ended up growing and growing in brightness, until I finally turned away from it so it would go back to its normal brightness.Finally, when I actually DID get a decent framerate (which ended up being only outside of the sawmill), movement felt unnatural; when I ran over certain objects, I'd end up getting hopelessly stuck.All in all, if you're REALLY curious as to what this game is, either look it up on Youtube, or wait until this game's on a rediculously low sale.

												I know it's been a long time since I wrote my previous review, but now I feel the review didn't describe the game enough.Anna is a game where you explore clues and where you try to find a mysterious woman named...well...Anna.Graphics:The graphics are downright gorgeous. This is something where you can close your eyes and feel that you are in the atmosphere. While they seem beautiful at first in the first scene of the game, it goes down towards the mystery and the creepy, scary side.Music:While this game only has a few tracks, the music is beautifully well done with acoustic guitar, violin, and piano. This is the kinda music you want to listen to while you're getting into the game or relaxing and touches your soul.Gameplay:There are two versions of the game: Original and Extended. The Original is more simple than the extended. It just focuses on items and getting through the game. The Extended, however, is more complicated, as there are more places to explore, more types of items to explore, and decisions and explorations that can affect the ending of the game. The upside of the Extended is that the story goes deeper.With the differences aside, there is some weirdness with some items of the game. You have to combine items you didn't expect that go together or used on something, or items that are well hidden. This can be a downside for simple players or people who don't wanna spend so much minutes on figuring stuff out.Story:The story goes into a sort of mystery and cultish feel with going back to some parts of the past. Yes, this game has some jumpscares, but in a perfect amount. I don't want to get into details, but the story is simply looking for a woman you can't get out of your head and you have an obsession. Not a crazy, sick obsession, but more of a desire just to be with the woman.In conclusion:Anna is one of those explorative, story gems that is a must have in your library and must be played. The graphics, music, and story melt perfectly into the pot that makes it a masterpiece. While the gameplay might be a bit annoying, the rest of the game will encourage you to delve further to solve the mystery.			"

												Anna - Extended edition is a horror/adventure game without deaths and chasing monsters. Instead it pressures a player with a ghastly, dark athmosphere where paranormal things happen and twisted hallucinations appear. The story begins at a courtyard of a homely cottage surrounded with beautiful peaceful landscapes. At the first moments the game explains a bit about a male protogonist's background with few sentences, which reveal that man suffers amnesia and has somekind of overwhelming obsession on the cottage.""This is the house which keeps appearing in my nightmares. ...How did I end up here anyway?""After the short perioid of relaxing puzzle solving strange supernatural things begin to happen: these events will not leave in dropping food cans nor mysterious voices, but instead take increasingly scaier features which I won't list here to avoid spoilers. I'll just say that this is about a very terrifying game where it is really hard to make yourself confortable.The gameplay in ""Anna"" is excelent and offers various interesting puzzles, whereas some of them honestly were a little dumb and far fetched. Luckily though player is provided with customizable hint system which can be turned on/off whenever player wants. As in many other adventure games during quest the inventory is filled with many items, which can be examined and attached together. As a new innovation player also gathers some thoughts and conclusions that can be blended together to see some details about the story.Anna - Extended edition surprised me as a game and especially as a horror game, which storyline eventually sorted out to be sad, but also inspiring. I hope that the develeopers carry on with the same genre.			"

												Anna is a puzzle exploration game with very clunky controls. Puzzle solving and story are the focus of the game and it does a good job with both, but it is mediocre at best in every other area. It does have multiple endings so there is replay value for those that enjoyed it.I recommend this game for anyone who is a big fan of puzzle solving.. to anyone else who wants to check it out, I recommend grabbing it when it goes on sale.5/10			"

												This was a really weird game.

All I can surmise is that this guy falls in love with an ancient goddess and kills his family over it. Kay..... It was mildly spooky and I did enjoy it, but I couldn't play it without a walk through.Also, the fact that I had to REGISTER AN ACCOUNT TO PLAY THIS GAME was incredibly upsetting. I almost didn't play because of that.If you can get it for cheap, why not pick it up. I'm going to go make sure I don't get spam from the stupid devs now....			"

												I really want to like this game. I love the atmosphere, I like the puzzles, I want to know the story.  But the game is not supported, it is technically broken, and it is unplayable.On my previous Mac it would run for about 5 minutes and then freeze.  I even tried to play it like this for a while -- constantly saving and reloading while I walked around, trying to solve the puzzle. But I finally gave up.Before writing this review I installed it again, booted it up again. I have a new machine and thought ""maybe they fixed it.""  I ran it windowed, let it show me the un-skippable opening animation again. I clicked new game -- and the window went out of focus. I licked back in the window, clicked new game again, and again was outside the window.  It had somehow captured the off-set to my mouse and refused to re-acquire it.I'd like to play this game and give it a good review, but it just does not work.Owned it for a year, never gotten to play it.  Glad I bought it on sale.			"

												This game is way far from the kind I'm addicted to, so all pros and contras mentioned below are nothing more than how the thing are looking through the scope of my (casual player's) perception:The main con worth mentioning is being totally out of option to kick asses all the game through or get busy with any other equivalent kind of action. That's the worst part :). Another (lesser) issue I had(first couple of times i tryed to play it) was about the game play ""rhythm"", which lead me to some difficulties with balancing immersion and progress through the story. Too many dead ends and game-critical fatalities followed by annoying false endings you cannot skip(or save game reloadings).Pros are more prolific. The game's mood is a mix of gloomy, grim, mournfool and melancholic ones, and so is the look of locations you're doomed to spend most of your time in-game. Music, voice acting, the sense of things you discover along the story are all of the same colour. Yet there's a lot of impressive beauty put into it.The storyline seems very ambiguous, especially one in the extended version, giving much more information, mostly of the kind which makes things even more obscure than they were before you got ""updated'.  As a result, it looks like one (relatively clear) story with random elements of two others attached to it to increase the volume of content. Not saying it's bad, this simulation of mysteries yet-to-reveal greatly contributed to my own interest towards what the game was trying to tell before i found out enough to figure things out(though i'm not sure this rate of clearness is really enough for it, even after checking what wikipedia says :)). Anyway, the whole thing is impressive and immersive enough to make me want to get that ""you've completed this game 100%"" achievement.After all, I've got myself loads of worlds to save, locations to clean sweep and a variety of hostile asses to kick in other games with much more obvious game stories.And than get back to this one and finish what's left of it to complete.Recommended, good game, 8 of 10 ---------------------------Вообще игра не из тех в которых я стандартно рублюсь, так что все за и против, которые я перечисляю ниже это не более чем то как она смотрится через прицел моего (как случайного игрока) восприятия.Главный косяк это конечно то, что в этой игре не надо(и нельзя) никого валить на всем ее протяжении, и нет какого либо другого эквивалента активной деятельности. Это главный недостаток :)).Другой, (менее важный) раздражавший в первую пару заходов в игру фактор, это некоторая сложность нахождения баланса между погружением в мир игры и успешным продвижением по сюжету. Многовато тупиков и фатальностей, приводящих или к периодическим просмотрам занудных неотключаемых ложных концовок или к перезагрузкам с сейвов.Плюсов побольше.Атмосфера в игре - смесь мрачного, зловещего, печального и меланхолического начал, как раз в тон окраске локаций, в которых проходит бОльшая часть игрового времени.Музыка, озвучка и сам смысл элементов сюжета, образно говоря, все того же цвета. Однако во все это вложено и немало мрачной красоты.История  кажется во многом непонятной, особенно в расширенной версии, где информации гораздо больше, но в основном она вся того рода, после которого начинаешь понимаешь чуть ли не меньше чем до того, как тебя ""проинформировали"".  Похожа она в результате на одну более менее понятнуюю историю, к которой приделано несколько случайных элементов от пары других историй ради увеличения общего объема. Не пытаюсь сказать что это плохо, эта симуляция тайн, которые предстоит раскрыть лично мне изрядно добавляла интереса к тому, что эта игра пытается рассказать до того, как я узнал достаточно, чтобы начать что то понимать в сюжете. Не уверен правда что имеющейся степени понятности для этого достаточно. Даже после ознакомления с тем что по этому поводу пишет википедия)).Но в целом игра впечатлила и заинтересовала достаточно для того, чтобы хотелось ее допроходить до ачивки ""вы завершили эту игру на 100%"".  У меня в конце концов хватает игр с гораздо более очевидными сюжетами, где можно спасти миры, зачистить локации и надрать всевозможные вражеские задницы.А потом вернуться к этой и допроходить до полной ясности.Короче в целом рекомендую, игра хорошая, 8 из 10			"

												I tried out this game recently after a friend said I would love this game,and MAN was he right :).The plot is about an unnamed man(the character you play as),who has recurring nightmares about a sawmill and a woman named Anna. As you investigate the sawmill,finding various items and intuitions(basically little bits and pieces of your character's memories),you begin to find out the whole story of just what happened in the sawmill,who Anna is,and just what our character did to Anna,witnessing several horrifying events as you piece together the truth.The characters are pretty good,especially that wood mannequin that looks like a woman(I can't reveal who the mannequin is because of spoilers),which creeped me out/scared me several times in my 10 hour playthrough. xDThe music is really good,especially the music that plays during when you're outside the sawmill,and the credits themes.The atmosphere in this game is amazing,where one moment you have that music from outside the sawmill playing,making you feel all safe,and then the next there's some creepy music with that mannequin woman right in your face. The gameplay is pretty great,which involves solving dif puzzles to progress,and after Stage 2,a sanity meter is added,which lowers the longer you look at a""creepy event""(an example would be looking at the woman mannequin for too long).The puzzles are kinda challenging your first time through,and the difficulty of the puzzles really depends on if you know what you're doing,and have the items you need(which sometimes your first time through you can miss,believe me I missed about 4 items in Living Quarters,and had to go back there 4 times xD)Overall,this is a VERY good horror game that I recommend to everyone,even those that haven't played horror puzzle games like this.9.5/10 from me :)			"

												Anna Extended Edition- Explore The Darker Side Of Human Psyche.Hey there! Thanks for reading my #2 Review, on Anna Extended Edition. I kind of liked Anna despite the fact that it received Mixed reviews, I honestly feel this game is a gem, and a must-grab during sales and of course, a must-play in your library. What is Anna? Anna is a first person immersive puzzle horror that revolves around an unnamed protagonist who finds himself in front of an abandoned house because he saw that house in his dreams. That's stupidity at it's finest, but I would personally go there if it's a woman calling, and same stuff happened here, he heard Anna, calling him. This protagonist enters the house and roams around, doing stuff, and discovers what really happened, and to be honest, the ending wasn't what I expected, but it was sad. It was not predictable.Descriptive Analysis! Anna Extended Edition is developed by Dreampainters. The developers are Italian-based. The company is totally indie, by totally I mean, TOTALLY, T-O-T-A-L-L-Y. This game fits in the definition of Indie. So, I was browsing their site, here you go, http://dreampainterssoft.com and saw, ""To design and develop the best narrative games with the highest possible quality.”And they did, Anna is a hidden gem. The company seems to be composed of fairly young people with minimal experience, and Anna being their first game, and to be honest, they did exceptionally good for their first game. The game is minimalistic. No HUD, Good sound effects, a nice BGM and good visuals. A good combination, something like I want from games. This game is extremely narrative and hence you should not buy it if you don't like slow narration. As you know, I'm a soundtrack-♥♥♥♥♥ and hence I would just play this game to hear the beautiful soundtrack. So, let's start now.Gameplay-The game is a typical FPS. This is the first game I've played in narrative category, and the second one being Dear Esther(I didn't like Dear Esther). I guess I haven't played enough games to set standard for grading, but still, it's good. Unlike Dear Esther, you solve actual puzzles. You click stuff, you examine stuff, like a Point 'n' Click with FPS. There is an inventory system, and a journal system where the protagonist's darker side is hidden. They're really long, really, but to understand the storyline, I recommend you do that, and complete the game at your own pace. Typical WASD controls. Mechanics and Features-The game is psychological horror so don't expect jump scares. The game gets predictable sometimes but you would still pee in your pants, that's because it's happening exactly the way you don't want. The game won't throw stuff at you directly, but in a random pattern, same places, same stuff, but random moments, when you won't be expecting them. I literally put down my headphones because one such encounter scared me, not 'to death' but still very much.The game has good collision data, and physics, although, physics don't matter much, but still you would notice some bugged out places in the game. Like a floating chair(NOT PART OF THE GAMEPLAY, ACTUAL BUG BUT STILL SCARY).Another feature I liked is the 'Truth' feature. You have to examine stuff to remind the protagonist what really happened. This makes you think what is worth examining, although you could examine everything. There's another minute feature that still adds some fun, exiting the house. Instead of an average horror movie where the door gets locked, you actually have a choice to exit the house, but the game would end and give you an ending depending upon which moment you ran out of the house. There are achievements for rational thinking like this too!The Plot-The plot is boring at first, until you enter the house. Nice BGM with bright colours, my ideal holiday spot, but once you enter, the colours fade, you enter darkness, you'll poop your pants. The storyline is intriguing, but not at a level you'd want it to be. It's narrative, slow and easy to understand. The storyline has a few plot twists, the ending itself is one. There are multiple choices, depending upon how you play the game, which alters the final ending. But let me tell you, you won't feel happy. None of the endings is like how you would expect. I kinda expected Anna Ressure..*oops* No Spoilers.Difficulty Level-A bit difficult since you don't know what to do unless and until you read the journal, carefully hear the narrations and use common sense.OVERALL!Graphics-Good. Not bad. It's an indie, I don't care about graphics but it deserves an 8/10.Gameplay+Mechanics-Narrative, Slow, Multiple choices, random encounters. Deserves 7/10Price-I don't have a problem buying it at 10$ but you should wait for sales.Soundtrack-Pls, the one aspect I loved the most <3. Buy the soundtrack. Worth the money?Yes, kind of. IF you're a Dear Esther fan or into atmospheric, narrative, horror, psychological, you should get this. Assuming you're new to narrative ones, I'd like you to give this one a try. I don't think you would regret it. Well, if you liked my review, join this group:-http://steamcommunity.com/groups/JustAnotherIndieGamer "

												Great atmosphere that is dark and creepy, but the game couldn't figure out if it wants to be an adventure game or a horror game.The puzzles are fairly obtuse and often have you trying to translate books written by a lawyer or pixel hunting for something you missed.Health doesn't have a place in a game like this, and any time limit doesn't either.  You don't have any explanation for what is damaging you and seemingly get randomly punished....for exploring.So basically...don't explore or look around and you're fine...sort of.  But then what the hell is the point of the game being a mystery if you can't explore without being punished?The health system is just sheer incompetence and a severe misunderstanding of the genre.That aside, the story feels weak and the first time you get expelled from the place you are left wondering wtf?  I put on a mask, then was literally not allowed to leave the room where I'd be hit by something that wrecks my health....because ""I can't leave now, something it about to happen"" after 5 minutes of waiting.

												Anna is a great indie horror adventure. The game has a good storytelling and a nicely designed environment, enhanced by the excellent sound. You can play the original version (which is really short) or the extended edition.The extended edition features more environments, more hours of gameplay, more puzzles, enhanced graphics and an improved interface.In Anna you are  trying to discover why this place is so special and who the woman with the name Anna is. For the progress you are searching your surroundings for items that you can use to progress and to solve puzzles.The puzzles are interesting, some clearly more challenging than others, but mostly solvable.Fans of the horror genre should give Anna a try.

												I was trying hard to like this game, or at least trying to actually play it to see what it is. But that task is just impossible, because this game is an horrible technical mess!First you have to spent an hour just to familiarize yourself with the clunky controls and the horrible mouse sensibility. After that you think your problems are gone, but they're not... you found a lot of things you can do with your collected objects, but very soon you realize they don't make any sense, so you start to search and try every bizarre combination to try to solve simple puzzles and this take long, much more long than your patience.The worst is... every new room i entered i got struggle with a buggy blinking environment lights that makes me literally close my eyes to not being blind. Sometimes it stop in a few seconds, sometimes don't, and i found me running or shaking the mouse trying to stop the madness. Sometimes i had to go to options and click every button, then it stops.It is really a shame that game being published this way, because i really like the mystery mood, but it's really impossible to play. In the Steam forums you see any decent answer either by Dreampainters or Kalypso Media. You just don't get any support, unless a false statement that is a Unity problem. You buy a broken game and it's your own problem, they'll not fix it.Also, you have to make a Kalypso account and login in a launcher every time you start the game, even with no online resources. This publisher is one of the worst i ever seen, they don't have any respect or care with customers. I'll skip any title  under their label forever.			"

												The game is ok, not really scary and the puzzles sometimes makes sense in the developer's view but doesn't make sense to the players. You encounter puzzles like that a lot in this game so be prepared to consult some walkthroughs.Needless to say, the graphics is good and it has nice atmosphere that most horror adventure games lacks.The Wife Doll is also creepy so be watchful.Not really trying but a fun game nonetheless.

												A beautiful game with wonderful visuals. The game has an eerie atomosphere that drags players into it. Which leads to the player not wanting to stop playing but rather trying to escape it by beating it. I would without a doubt recommend getting this game and playing it alone..........			"

												I am torn with this game. I suppose I just couldn't get into it, but I will give this game credit where it is due : it is very creative and this ''Extented Edition'' is a vast upgrade over the original. It is also gorgeous and is a real work of art, so I REALLY recommend this game for anyone (like me) that believes games can be art. It is a very mature game, not for the faint of heart, and not for the easily bored.It was also VERY freaky, and it just got freakier and freakier, to the point that I started to feel just as insane as the character I was playing. Yeah, you're not supposed to look directly at the freaky♥♥♥♥♥♥that pops up to scare you. You have a kind of insanity meter, and its game over if it runs out. You then get the bad ending, which was my ending. Couldn't finish the game you see, but that wasn't really the reason.The reason I don't REALLY want to recommend this game, but I will anyway due to the aforementioned points, is the puzzles. They make little to no sense. The whole game is heavily cryptic, to the point of insanity... and I guess its kinda the point, but I couldn't even get passed the first area without a walkthrough, and I don't think that's a point in its favor. Yes, you'll sometimes find a few clues in the form of books as to what to do next, but they are vague at best, or seem to have no connection with anything at worst. I just went in circles, revisiting room after room after room (once I finally unlocked them), not understanding what to do until I finally saw too many hallucinations and it was over. I guess there's two words to describe this : beautiful... but weird. VERY WEIRD.So, I am tempted to continue this game, but it is as a big freaky impassable wall of nonsensical puzzles, which only the metaphorical industrial drill of a walkthrough can penetrate, which kinda destroys the immersion it tries to create. And if you do get through, blood will spill out and you'll go insane, then its game over. That pretty much sums up my experience.THUMBS UP FOR ARTSYNESS THOUGH. I will not replay this though. Give it a try... if you dare...			"

												This game has a few issues. It doesn't start off on a good footing by making you sign up for some account that serves only to advertise another game before you start. The game itself is beautiful with a very dark, sinister atmosphere. The inventory system is not very good and the way of moving objects is useless. The puzzles are nigh on incompressible. The built in help system does nothing except either tell you to do things that you have already done or tell you things there are no help at all. I am not the best puzzle gamer, I will generally reach for a walkthrough more often than necessary but here quite early on I just gave up any attempt at solving the puzzles and followed a walkthrough in its entirety. There is a health meter but the game is really not that clear on what injures you so losing health just feels arbitrary. Through the game you collect intuitions and offers no explanation as to what they are but you need to work this out to progress to the final endings. All these things do not mean I did not enjoy this game, the mystery and the story kept me wanting to carry on. The multiple endings add a bit of replayability This game also comes with the original Anna so you can play that and realise that the terrible inventory, controls and incomprehensible puzzles are a significant improvement on the original. Completing certain endings on the original is dependent upon random events you have no control over happening which is annoying. So overall I am giving this a thumbs up, it is flawed but pull up a walkthrough and enjoy the atmosphere and story.			"

												For me, Anna was a very confusing game, especially at the start. I mean starting outside in the pretty lush garden, very confusing.. Not saying it is bad. but also that you have to find certain items.. It's a puzzle game, with horror and adventure.. Getting past the first part wasn't too tricky.. getting the achievement.. the same really..Second part.. much more confusing.. more difficult to figure out.. And I am now at a stand still..But for me the game really is something worth playing and getting through.I am not into horror games usually and this game scares the **** out of me.. but I'd still recommend anyone to play this because it really gets you on your toes..There really is a lot to this game and I am sure that it'll become even weirder the further in I get.But as of this moment it's above average really.

A first person puzzle solver/thriller.The dark story and in game environment/music/events will more than likely give you goose bumps and you still wont be able to stop playing. It's cheap to purchase and I think it's a must buy for any gamer interested in this genre.The game has some aspects which are not at all obvious and I must admit I fell into the trap of referring to the steam forums for help on a few occaisions. Anyone attempting this game should seek some tips before starting but not spoilers (from someone who has finished it), and give it a red hot go without further help.			"

												Weird, Glitchy, and Confusing.A glitch I ran into was that I was able to force a door open via physics manipulation (just grabbing the locked door and spazzing out with the mouse basically on numberous points) that was magically sealed and that I was not supposed to be able to open until a puzzle was finished. This big of a glitch makes me thing there are likely more software related issues, as on the steam forums many complain about unstable performance. But my experience was that game ran fine at most times with any lack of performance possibly my hardware setup.Graphically the game looks good. But its a very very small scope type of game, but it looks nice and isn't hard to run.Its most like one of those DOS text adventure or later on when point and click type of adventure games came on. But unfortunately like some of them this game can be very confusing.  Eventually puzzles can amount to just randomly clicking on stuff until you get the right combo which is just a waste of time. At points some elements were really interesting in the puzzles, but more often than not it just made no sense or was illogical and confusing.  The books do help some but they only give you an inkling and the tips system if your stuck but have an idea of what you have to do is next to useless.The seemingly random events such as stuff popping up or happening was interesting. And for the most part good. Look at something only to look away and back and its moved or gone. Gives a very creepy feeling that you are not safe and the world around you is alive. Which alot of games falter at and end up with a static feeling enviroment. As you progress the game world changes around you.The only problem is that puzzles are just anti-intuitive at times and just to much and thats pretty much all the gameplay. Just walking around and interacting with things that are apart of puzzles. The story is spooky ghost sprittual stuff from what I can tell. But I didn't really get it.If you want a confusing puzzle game where you pretty much have to google atleast some part of the puzzles or waste hours trying to figure them out then I suppose this maybe for you. Sure the game could possibly draw you in, but once your there your stuck at a puzzle while you want to adventure in a world unlike one your used to.Something I think this game could have been really great with is some top notch narration for books, and other parts where there is onscreen text your intended to read. Also making the text in as small and biteable chunks as possible instead of a giant wall of text paragraph that the in game books are. This would make them less of a chore to read and with the narration it would be possibly pleasurable to listen to if was anything like Bastions narration.			"

												This game is a excellent example of the survival horror genre. It is reminiscent of the Nintendo Gamecube cult classic Eternal Darkness in that it is puzzle based and very much focused on horror that is in the main player characters mind rather than stalking zombies, or deadly plagues, or the apocalypse. The atmosphere is spooky and intimidating and the player has a wide variety of options in game that effect what achievements they get as well as the final outcome of the game. The only problem is that the controls are a bit touchy and there is no controller support for this game. Overall this game gets 4.5 out of 5 for horror ambiance.			"

												One of the best games ı've ever played. But if you are a casual adventure/horror player don't try this. This game is way deeper than amnesia and others. It blends puzzles and narrative really well. And also visual effects are just amazing. I really congratulate the team.This game made me wonder what if the video game industry funds this type of games that I think immortal pieces of art. At old times when everything is not about graphics and action, artisticly rich games such as monkey island, grim fandango, sanitarium etc. produced within the mainstream, but now only independent producers create such rare games with really insufficient funds. I hope that virtual reality tech to clear the way for these kind of games.			"

												Anna is a first-person adventure/horror game. What I liked most is the suspenseful atmosphere and the story. Game's setting changes drastically over a few stages: first you find yourself outside a wooden sawmill, observing as the sun glistens from a calmly running stream. You feel intrigued to get inside the house and learn of it's secrets. Once you're inside - it gets pretty spooky. You solve puzzles and trigger scripted and random events to progress in the story. The puzzles are satisfying but usualy don't make much sense and are not really intuitive. I had to look up a few playthroughs to solve some puzzles - couldn't come up with solutions myself. Once you reach a certain point in the story, the setting becomes really grim. With an unholy presence in the sawmill and ambient sounds that chill down your spine - the experience is quite satisfying even for a horror junkie. The game has multiple endings which adds some replay value. All in all, Anna is a decent game with some flaws regarding puzzles, but if you're up for the challenge and have plenty of spare time to come up somewhat ridiculous solutions to solve puzzles - get this game. 7/10			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This game is a Psychological horror with Puzzle exploration. Interface/Menu/SettingsThere are multiple Languages.There is a mouse Sensitivity (I do recommend to keep this at low, otherwise you could get a punishment).There is a Resolution Size and Quality settings.You can play this game in windows mode or Fullscreen.Main menu music is decently okay.You can turn the subtitles on or off.You are able to turn off or on the help system.You can change the controls.About the game.There is Dark atmosphere.Some ""Scary"" Events.Deep interesting good Storyline.There are Subtitles.Speeches are voiced over including with subtitles.Some Puzzles COULD be difficult.There is a ""help"" System for incase you get stuck. However, you are able to turn this off.The game has Multiple Endings.Sound is okay.You can use the mousewheel to scroll through items. But opening inventory is faster.Other things.YOU NEED A KEY IN ORDER TO PLAY THIS GAME - HOWEVER YOU GET THIS ONE AUTOMATICALLY ONCE YOU HAVE INSTALLED THIS. This requires a Kalypso Account.i have complete the game and it is very good. You might want to get this with a discount however.Just a Hint, do not turn the sensitivity of ur mouse high. Keep it at low, because you will get punished for it if you have it on high.Playing in window mode is not always super in this game. Because if you are scrolling around, there is a chance that you could click outside the border and click your desktop instead.Playing on lower resolution graphics, might be easier to find items.There are ""Time based event"" (SECRET) achievements.Sometimes you get stuck at something and that is really annoying. No, you can't jump!Game is short.Let's Try Video:

												Intresting story and good horror elements. But I think that some of the puzzels where a bit hard and illogical. Its better in the extended edition, but there are many hard ones and there more of them. I did not like the ""life bar"" which took me a long time to figure out it was a lifebar which maked it very hard in the end becouse its hard to get it back. The story feels slow since you just walk back and forth between a few rooms a lot when you are trying to figure out the puzzels. And that wooden figure who keeps changing places when you are not looking freaked me out during the whole game(the most scary thing in the game except the goat mask and the most cheap one!). The game has its very good atmospheric moments.			"

As for the horror part of the game, it only gave me a few good jumps. Now the question would be: Would I recommend this game to anyone? My answer: If you want a puzzle game that will keep you attached for a few hours, then yes. But if you're not, still give it a try, you might just injoy it.			"

												Anna - Extended Edition might not be the greatest game that has ever been made, but it delivers a certain enchanting experience, which left me wanting to know everything about the story. The plot starts out confusing, but it unfolds as the player starts putting effort into the game, making it a great experience to puzzle together different elements of the story. The game rewards players who collect and read all the notes and books (and who experience all disturbing events) with a small cutscene to explain the deeper meaning behind one of the main characters, something a completionist like me highly appreciates! Overall Anna is a enjoyable game for those who like the experience a deep and thoughtprovoking story. Although the gameplay might be a bit boring and offsetting to some, it is worth the price that is being asked for it!			"

It reminds me of the joy I got when I was younger for figuring out something all by myself. I'd suggest this for anyone who likes to be scared and gets scared easily. All my guys friends were equally jumpy.			"

												Anna is a first person horror/puzzle story that journey's through a dark past. The visuals are beautiful, and the attention to detail is great. The game has good replayability because there are multiple endings and there's a very good chance you are going to miss things the first time through. I've experienced a couple bugs, so save from time to time; this will also help you go back to find things you missed. The game really requires you to spend a lot of time playing around with objects and your surroundings, so unless you don't like to immerse yourself in a world, I highly recommend Anna.			"

												I emersed myself in Anna [Extended Edition] for hours. Scary, yet casual, with no combat. Exactly what I prefer, if you have similar interests in PC games as I then I would highly recommend this game. While playing I found it somewhat difficult. I don't claim to be the smartest. I had only played 63% of the game until getting kicked out of house from ""losing my mind"". I do plan on re-playing soon. I believe I saw enough to form an opinion and it's as enteraining as it is scary. I do have to mention I get scared fairly easily, but I haven't played a game that has scared me as much as this one.. THANKS :]			"

												tldnr; if you like these types of games, you will like Anna. It's solid, especially if you can pick it up on sale. If you don't like these types of games, then of course you'll be disappointed. 8/10The story was original and interesting. Most of the bugs that are described in the negative reviews were part of the original game and have been fixed in the Extended Edition. Music and atmosphere are great. It starts out really creepy, and by the time the creepiness wears off, the game is about 75% over and the story has progressed to the point where it's not intended to try to scare you anymore. I thought the game really transitioned well between these two points.  "

												I do recommend it, but I couldn’t have done it without the help of some walkthroughs. The puzzles are often not based on common sense, but on some sinister dark knowledge of witchcraft it seems. So I guess I used about 50% doing walkthroughs. It is dark and deep  and I really like the music and sound effects, they really add to a good experience. So if you don’t use walkthroughs I wish you good luck, but if you’re not afraid to get a little online help every once in a while, it’s ok. The story is good, and once you’re inside you really get sucked into it! I’ve done my first playthrough now and had one of 8 endings. Not the final ending though, which I’ve seen on youtube and is really worth trying again in the not too distant future. The thing I really missed was the experience you have in Amnesia, Among the Sleep or Outlast, where you occasionally have to run for your life. I have to add, there isn’t really anywhere to run or hide :p but despite this, the music, fx, story and puzzles make it creepy as hell. Whenever I play games like this, with bad or average games, I sometimes start to wonder when it’s going to end. With Anna, I was sad it had already ended :p Totally worth it!   "

												As someone fairly new to the Indie Horror genre, I won't say I am even qualified to review such a game. However, with no background/experience in said field I thoroughly enjoyed that everything wasn't laid out for me with a ""now go here"" arrow overhead. This game was perfectly done in my opinion. After one full completion and figuring out there were multiple endings just made me want to play that much more! It's hard to want to explain just why this game was such a great buy, but to put it as simple as possible, you are fighting to forget what you think you remember while clues keep telling you the truth.

												This is game is really cool because it takes a while to get into, but once you're in you're ♥♥♥♥ing in it. If you played Sanity's Requiem on Gamecube all those years back, you'll be familiar with the idea of your character's sanity being important to maintain or else you lose the game. The same goes with Anna, for as you explore the story and the sawmill you also bear witness to supernatural events (most of which are not alarming) which damage your sanity. I think this game is brilliant because the setting changes dramatically over time as you progress and make little decisions. The darker your choices, the weirder things get and the more supernatural events you'll see. This is the kind of game where so much care and thought has been put into backstory and trivia that you can't help but lose yourself in it, and that makes it really enjoyable. Brilliant and well worth getting! *****			"

												Pros:- Good Atmosphere - Very Silent Hill inspired story- Great soundtrack- Beautiful graphics for an indie game- Many endingsCons:- Confusing plot- Just puzzles and no action/monster pursuits at all-  These puzzles may be hard for many users who will not follow any guide ( i had no problem with this but it's what i heard by friends )- Many puzzles don't make much sense, you will have to guess rather than think- English translation isn't THAT good ( it's a bit spanglish even if the game is italian)- Very indie voice acting- Just one location to explore, and it has few rooms.- Terrible open/close doors controls- Needs an ingame tutorial for the insanity bar and logic buttons- Too many games like this style nowdays ( Slenderman, Amnesia,etc) and it can't be really compared to them.I have got this game for less than 2 euros, so that's why i am recommeding it, but i won't do it anymore when price will go back to 6 euros.

What first brought my attention to this game was the large amount of negativity people pointed towards this game for being 'a walking simulator' or 'having no gameplay and thus it isnt a game'. Those statements are completely false. Anna has alot of exploring, item collecting, puzzle solving, reading books and notes left in the game in order to complete and progress further into this game. The story and atmosphere are both unsettlingly great and interesting. This game is worth your time if you are into horror games or point and click adventurers.			"

												This is a ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful game that's hurt by awkward controls.  Before I say I love the game, it should be acknowleged that the logic behind the puzzles is nearly nonexistent and follows dreamlike rules where the impression of connected events is enough to trigger the next thing.  Also as it's been noted, this isn't the most directly horrifying game.  Not in the raw tension Amnesia sense, or blood and guts sense.  However, it is one of the best examples of an unnerving and disturbing atmosphere, aided by the nonsensical dream-puzzle logic. Honestly, for $10 it is worth a playthrough.			"

												I got seriously creeped by this game, I still havent unlocked the other endings yet because I need to be a brave girl xD. Really enjoyed this game and was impressed that it managed to be creepy without just shoving jump scares at you constantly. Would like to play more games like this in future. Well done Dreampainters.			"

												Are you kidding me??? I just installed this piece of sh*t and yes, I played only FEW MINUTES but that is more than enough for me to HATE THIS GAME ALREADY.So first, you have to register who-knows-where to play a game you paid for. I had to give someone my e-mail. Why?There is NO volume setting in the options, only ""music"" which doesn't even work in menu, it's still loud as f*ck so you basically trying as soon as possible to start the game. Game starts, it's also f*cking loud and the sound effect are horrendous! You appear next to this creek and you think: ""Is is sound of a water flow or UFO landing mixed with alien conversation?"". It's THAT bad. You can get much better sound samples on free websites. Also, the sound doesn't even correspond to visuals, since the creek is actually pretty deep and the audio make it seems like it should be really shallow. Horrible horrible horrible.And guess what, here's the best part. You can't even QUIT THE GAME!!! I'm not joking. You go for ""quit the game"" and you CANNOT CLICK on ""Yes""! Well, you can click but nothing happens. I had to Alt+F4 that sh*t!Avoid this, it's not worth a Euro!			"

												Das Spiel finde ich höchst interessant, hat auch eine wunderschöne Grafik, leider steigt der Schwierigkeitsgrad im Laufe des Spiels massiv an, oder mir fehlt einfach das nötige Verständnis zur richtigen Schlußfolgerung.Ich bin jedenfalls in der Mitte des Spiel nur weitergekommen in dem ich mir aus dem Internet die Lösung herausgesucht habe. Ich möchte jetzt hier nichts verraten, aber für mich sind einige Lösungen sehr ungewöhnlich und haben mit den Elementen nichts oder sehr wenig zu tun.Wer also wirklich tagelang knobeln möchte und ein bißchen schockiert werden will, der sollte hier mal reinschauen.

												Anna - Extended Edition is a unique and extremely creepy adventure game.  In fact, I thought that the audio and visuals were even more disturbing that the arguable more famous Amnesia.  The story is interesting and unfolds gradually as the player interacts with different puzzles and objects in an abandonded house, piecing together the mystery of what happened there.  There is no dialogue interactions in the game but the storytelling is well done without them.  The steam overlay, widescreen resolutions and steam achievements are supported but unfortunately the controller is not.  Anna's strength is also it's weakness, it is maddeningly difficult to figure out how to solve the puzzles.  In fact, this is a game that is nearly impossible to complete without the assistance of a walkthrough video.  However, the several possible endings based on the choices you make bring some replayability to the game that is often missing from adventure titles.  In all, Anna is a succesful but flawed entry into the genre and should be considered by anyone who enjoys a difficult adventure game.			"

												Good psychological horror / puzzle adventure game - I don't want to give away any spoilers, but I will say that I had more frights in this game than even Amnesia TDD (well, maybe - Amnesia is damn good, you should definitely play it).Remember - headphones should be up loud and the lgihts should be off - if you're not psyched out to get scared you're doing it wrong.It's not a terribly long game - Steam reckons it only took me four hours to unlock the Truth ending, and some of that was walking around trying to find some object I had missed because it was right next to (and looked like part of) another much more interesting object (ye olde classic puzzle adventure game problem). On a positive note the game doesn't wait for you to make progress to decide to give you a scare, which nicely avoids the boredom problem that many adventure games have in that situation.It's actually probably for the best that it wasn't any longer - like many psychological horror games the scares have less and less impact as you get more used to them. By the end of the game I wasn't jumping whenever XXXXXXXX happened any more, which makes me think the length was about right (although that was in my second sitting - I'd recommend playing through the whole thing in one sitting if you can).Also, there are intuitions at the top of the inventory screen. I only mention this because I didn't notice until I was almost finished the whole game and it seems like they might have an influence on the ending.One annoyance I had with the game was that some of the cutscenes are unskippable - including the expelled ending sequence which happens when you lose too much sanity. Unfortunaly at one point I had saved a game with almost no sanity left and I had to keep sitting through that ending and reloading over and over until I was able to make some progress before the game threw another random event at me.One final warning - this game includes some 3rd party DRM. While it's far from the worst DRM scheme around it's still unwelcome - you will need to create an account with Kalypso before you can play.I also had some technical issues with my controls (the camera spun by itself every 5 seconds), though it mysteriousely resolved itself after a few attempts to launch the game.

												This game is bad. The objects you are supposed to find are hidden in not very noticable spots, the graphical glitches makes the game impossible to progress, and it costs $10. This game is not worth playing even if it was free. Lets put it this way, it took me like 15+ mnutes to find everything to get into the HOUSE. That should have been 5 minutes tops and straight into the horror. Once the graphic glitches start, it makes the game impossible to progress because you CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. There are games better than this for like a dollar and this one makes you spend 10 on it. 2/10 Bad game.			"

												Anna - Extended Edition does psychological horror better than any title I have ever played.  The sound, music, narration, story, design - all these things are absolutely remarkable, and Anna should be played by anyone who wants to see how a game like this should be done.Quite unfortunately, the entire game is left in ruins due to an insulting puzzle-solving mechanic.  If the other features build the perfect arc, all that's necessary is a keystone that'll just keep those things in place.  It doesn't exist, and worse, this was reportedly done on purpose.  You repeatedly pick up items that you'll never use.  Puzzles make no sense and worse, there's no effort for them to do so.  I tried my damndest to get through the game without a guide, but it's impossible.  Unless you plan to hammer away at this title for a solid month for hours on end each day, you will never figure out each puzzle.  Worse yet, there are multiple endings depending on how you play the game - and nothing is explained to you at any point.  There are useful guides online, but I'd imagine even THEY needed help before writing it, or they went into the game's code to make sense of it all.The only way I can recommend Anna is with a guide.  There are some on Steam and you can find some on YouTube.  They are non-negotiable.  If you want to enjoy Anna, you have to abandon your sense of integrity when it comes to solving puzzles on your own and use a guide.  If you can accept this, Anna will give you a new understanding of how games should be made with regards to every other feature.Specifically the horror.  This game, numerous times, sent chills down my entire body.  They started at my neck and spread throughout my body and to my arms and legs.  Yet, not once though was I afraid to continue.  I never thought I shouldn't do something because something's lurking around the corner.  This game does horror better than any other title.  It exists on a level above all others.  There are no jump-scares or smash cuts to scary images.  While I might react quickly to a zombie or monster in another game, in this there are no monsters.  The every-changing environment is enough to scare you.  One feature in particular is a visage of a woman made of wood that changes position and follows you.  It never attacks you, it's simply there.  Yet each time it appears in a place I don't expect, even if I was just looking there, it managed to get me almost every time.For this reason alone, I recommend Anna.  Everything in the game is fantastic.  The one thing that is completely absent, and insultingly so by design, is sensible puzzle solving.  If you can stomach the fact that you'll need a guide from the onset, this title is thoroughly enjoyable.			"

												Despite the some of the special effects feeling a tad dated, I can honestly and with a straight face say that I have never reacted to a game like I reacted to this one. I can understand that many may not feel the same way upon playing, but my friend Skye can attest to the fact that I was yelling in shock and anxiety repeatedly while make my way through the game. The sound design is phenomenal in that often when you hear a sound there's nothing there...but sometimes there is...and it's that 1-in-10 moment that makes you jump out of your seat. The same principle is applied to the 'inhabitants' of the sawmill. These elements combine to create a living, unpredictable, and malevolent environment that continually surprises and engages you. My only criticisms extend to the occasionally insane difficulty and abstract nature of some of the puzzles, and the lack of explanation of the so-called 'intuitions', which, given how pivotal they are in regards to your experience, lack any in-game explanation as to their importance or function. The Extended Edition has many improvements over the original (longer game length, more puzzles, increased graphical quality) and, in my opinion, completely redeems the experience. 8.5/10.			"

												Personally, I found the story pretty immersive. Wasn't so fond of some of the long texts since they felt like a break in the actual gameplay, but they were generally interesting to read. I didn't get very far, however, because some of the puzzles were rather obscure; it was very easy to miss one little thing and be stuck for a loooong time. Since there are barely any tutorials for the Extended Edition, it made it that much harder to figure out what to do when I got stuck (which happened fairly frequently). Granted, though, I'm not that great at puzzles. So although I'd recommend it, it's certainly not for everyone, especially those with little time to play.			"

												An artistic, visionary psychological horror game with brilliant storytelling.  The atmosphere is both unique and bone-chilling.  Keep in mind that pretty much every negative review comes from people who lack the capacity to solve its puzzles and understand the game.

												Stay away from this. How can they price this 10 euros...it is technically primitive in both graphics and interface. The 'gameplay' is not game nor play, and the solutions to the 'puzzles' are not those of a reasoning mind. The atmosphere is a bit creepy and ok, but really i don't even care to see the second ending. Another 'indipendent game' that tries to achieve something artistically 'different' from the mass. Sorry, would prefer something less experimental.			"

												Intro impossibly slow. Crashes at the first attempt to look around. [2016/10/15] Fade-ins/outs still take 30+ s each. Looking around has jumps in between. Intermediate scenes take 1+ minute before starting while you can do nothing. Did some development myself - never would publish such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ UI- shame.			"

												The plot is a little uncertain to me. Like, it's a dude searching for some chick, and I think the house meant something to them, or maybe she's dead? Dunno. After that it's kind of like, ""oh hey, witchcraft! Or is it insanity? Or... BOTH?!"" And then I'm unsure what the events that transpire are actually supposed to imply. Maybe it's more clear in the extended edition.Despite not having any real idea of what the hell was going on half the time, or why I was doing what I was doing, or what I was doing was supposed to mean, it was pretty cool. I don't know if it's a ""puzzle game"" so much as an ""exploring and following instructions"" game but it was still rather compeling and exquisitly stimulating. The scares are subtle, and few did more than make my heart flutter, but the ones that got me made me scream like a 12 year old Justin Bieber fan (or possibly, Justin Bieber).			"

												Fun scary game.  However, the events are just buggy and annoying to get too.  It seems as if certain scary events will only occur within a certain time frame of the game.  So this makes it a big pain trying to figure out when you can get an event, and when you can't.  With none of the walkthroughs explaining the timeframes of each event, you will be wasting a lot of time trying to get these events when you can't.And also, there was a certain ending that was a big pain to get too.  During the red shift event, you can no longer get one ending.  The problem was, no matter how fast you went through to get to that point, the stupid red shift would occur.  Didn't matter if you sped through everything to get to that point in less then 5 minutes, red shift event will happen and completely prevent you from getting that ending.  Annoying.Otherwise, a fun and scary adventure game.			"

If you play this game you may have to think... alot because this game requires common sense and logic but this game still can keep you on the edge of your seat (depending on what type of person you are).

												I fully reccomend the Extended version. This was the way the game was meant to be. The confusing puzzles have been redone to make more sense, and there is logic to the game now. Fully enjoyable puzzler with an interesting story and eye-gasmic detail. Glad to see the developers listened to the community and fixed what was needing to be fixed.			"

												Anna isn't just any horror game. It's a first-person point-and-click puzzle horror game. I didn't think I'd actually experience fear, but it happened. Oh did it happen. The game doesn't rely on cheap ""jump scares"" (even though there were some), rather using its dynamic atmosphere to keep you feeling at constant unease. While it could have simply thrown you into the sinister sawmill from the beginning of the game, Anna let's you start outside in a gorgeous peaceful environment. This stark contrast really adds to your distress once you're inside the sawmill. From there, things quickly get darker and stranger.As for the minor negative aspects of the game; scrolling in the inventory box was annoying (had to click on up/down arrows, couldn't use the scroll wheel), there weren't any dedicated examine/use/pick up keys, nor mouse buttons (had to use a context menu), and of course, you had your typical absurd point-and-click puzzles that would either cause you to brute force the solution or look it up in a guide. Although to its credit the game does have an in-built hint system. I can also see that some people would find the slow walking speed tedious (I didn't). Some may argue that the overall game should not cause any fear since you quickly learn, by design, you can't die/lose and have an affect with any encounter; all you can do is simply look or (in vain) try to interact with an encounter. However, Anna does make it work and I'm not sure why. Perhaps it's the fact that you're ill-equipped and very limited in your interactions/movement, coupled with its powerful atmosphere? Overall, it's a decent game. Mechanically and aesthetically it achieves what it needed. The game should run you for ~4 hours depending on how fast you go through the puzzles.Thanks to kewpahtrewpah for kindly gifting me this game.			"

												    !Minor spoiler!Anna is a mentally horrifying, horror adventure game that scared me ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥… I’m a wuss when it comes  to horror games so don’t take my word for it when I say this game is excellent…You get a bunch of these types of games like Amnesia and Outlast, but games like those use a scary monster with a big mouth and twitchy or slow and sluggish movement to scare the living daylights out of you when it BURSTS through a wall or suddenly appears behind you..Anna does what it does, very differently… It slowly builds tension and ever so slightly increases the eeriness of the environment and scares you using things like chairs and bursting steam pipes…If you had to personify games like Outlast and Anna: Outlast would be a creepy old man with a knife staggeringly approaching you in a dark alley and no matter where you turn, that old man is there, staggeringly approaching. While Anna on the other hand is a woman, standing with her back towards you slowly turning around until you see half her face expecting the rest to be horribly maimed, but instead it’s a perfectly normal woman with a loving look in her eyes. Then you suddenly realize that the thing you should be running from is the big ♥♥♥♥ing wooden “mom-doll” slowly emerging from behind the woman, reaching for you with her branch arms…I recommend this game for anyone into adventure and horror...

												Anna is a first person adventure game involving the supernatural and psychological horrors held within an old mountain sawmill/home that has fallen into disrepair.  You play as an, apparently un-named, history professor who has been mysteriously drawn the sawmill by a strong feeling of deja vu when he finds pictures of the place in his closet, despite having no memory of the place.When I watched the trailer on Steam I noticed that most of the objects in the game aren't even animated, and almost passed by this game because of it.  While it is true that there is almost no animation outside of physics objects, the mood and setup was all that's needed to emerse me into the game.  Also, because many of the objects are stationary, it led me to question whether the house is in fact haunted or if the man I was playing as was going insane.  It's obvious that this was an intentional choice as the game uses clever placement to ensure that you're not looking when certain objects move or materialize, which to be honest did make me jump a few times.The story of what happened at the sawmill and the ways in which I was required to reveal it are also better than I expected.  The things I was required to do to find out the truth made me question the sanity of the man I played as, and the truth itself is something that would probably cause the average person to go insane.  None of that ""Timmy fell down a well and died and now he's a ghost that feels betrayed"" crap.What little music is in the game is very good and, along with the sounds, enhances the experience of the game.My only negative criticism is that some of the puzzles require ridiculous logic to try to solve on your own and there are usually clues for each one they are either hard to find or not nearly enough to get you close to a solution.Recommended for anyone who likes adventure puzzles, solve it yourself stories, and psychological horror.

												It's a first- person adventure game that takes place in a tiny sawmill.  Don't let the small size turn you away, though.  It can take a long time to solve all the puzzles that this game has to offer.  The puzzles range from practical challenges to Pagan rituals, and you'll have to carefully search the saw mill to find every item you'll need.  Supernatural events occur frequently, and they can lower your sanity, much like in Amnesia.    I should note that this is NOT point and click.  You move around freely like in most of the first person games we're used to.			"

												So, I know this game got some pretty bad reviews by big critics. I'm going to have to stop you there.At first glance, this game appears to be an incredibly confusing and non-intuitive system. Sure, you've got the basic menu, click and point and click item use mechanic, you can walk and look just like normal. Crouching, but no jumping. And then you look around and realize you have no idea what you're supposed to do. Or that you do, but you can't. Perform the ritual? Ok, sure... how do I do that? What am I missing?Well, yes, yor objectives can be pretty obscure. More importantly, it can be easy to miss crucial items you might need, depending upon the path you choose. But, if you're careful, check everything twice, and read everything at least once (journals, books, letters, etc), the answers are all there. Experiment with things, and eventually, with the knowledge you gain from the protagonist's intuitions and documents scattered about, you will find the way.Keep in mind that in the original game there were only three endings, with one ""true"" ending. The extended edition has eight, giving moer variance than ""leave now, leave then, or win the game."" You can reach the end in the extended edition and STILL BE WRONG. It means you missed something along the way. But maybe you like that ending better. While there is a eries of events that must be performed to progress at all, the steps you take in between can matter greatly. Will you scour the depths of hell to find Anna? Or will you leave with your sanity and your life? Or perhaps you will follow in the footsteps of the Sabot Maker? I don't know, but if you don't choose carefully, you'll find your carelessness chooses for you.3.5/5, for obscurity but ingenuity.			"

												I'm still in the early stages of Anna, but I wanted to review it so far.The game is interesting. I don't have a problem with the controls except the mouse sensitivity is kind of weird, but it's not a big deal. The graphics aren't bad, and the settings and sounds are creepy, which is good. I still don't quite understand the story quite yet though, like what all the voices are talking about in game, etc.The main problem I'm having with this game is the whole problem solving/puzzles thing. I didn't think it would be as difficult as it is. There should be better hints or something. I often have to use a play-through guide to figure out what to do next. It's rather confusing, and it feels like it takes me forever to figure some things out. So, if you like problem/puzzle solving games mixed in with some exploratory horror and mystery, then I would recommend this game for you. If you don't, well, you probably won't enjoy playing it.			"

												Parts of Anna, I flat out love. However, Anna gets a lot of things wrong. ****You have to register an account with Kalypso just to play this single-player, offline game. ♥♥♥♥ you, Kalypso! It's like Ubisofts ultra fail DRM that does NOTHING to combat piracy, but does ♥♥♥♥ their paying customers over.****  It is very poorly optimized and the very modest graphics tax my video card as bad as Battlefield 3. The shadows moving on the walls look like dark, dancing squares. An average computer from five years ago should have had no problem generating the grpahics, if the game was coded properly. Also, the inventory usage is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Combining items and even just getting a description of an item kicks you out of inventory and you have to go back again. Also, the story is a bit of a muddled mess. From what I gathered, the dude you play as killed a bunch of people because he's a stupid crazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Now that I'm done ♥♥♥♥♥ing about the crap, Anna absolutely NAILS the proper tone for a horror adventure game. There is no dying in the game, but it was very unsettling and there are some decent scares. It was good enough that I did make sure to only play it at night in the dark with headphones on. I completely love these types of spooky ghost story point and clicks. Anna took around 5 hours finish. I am eagerly anticipating the developers next game. This game like a nice juicy steak garnished with turds. If you like horror point and clicks, definitely get Anna when it's on sale.			"

												Personally, I like it. The graphics in the game are extremely beautiful and it is kind of challenging. I also justl ike the atmosphere. What the ""The Blair Witch Project"" (the first one) and ""Anna"" have in common is that they're just both creepy. Not necessarily scary but nevertheless, I still like it. However, I have to complain that the mouse is kind of sensitive and the game tends to lag a little behind, especially when it is in the highest quality. I may also add that I don't like it how we have to create an account to play this game but it's worth it. So, if you like creepy, atmospheric stuff, this game is for you.			"

To much of guessing what to do to make something happen and moving forward, Especially in 3D enviroment from FP view. If it wouldn't be badly implemented... Here it was. I was rejected by game. This game is to much of a try your luck type.But I guess some people may enjoy this folklore Italian legend.			"

And the game itself seems really good and interesting, but maybe I am just too dumb to play it. I'll better stick to tactics, strategies, rpgs and shooters...

												Short: Strange game, well worth the cost.Long: Spooky with the odd very nicely done jump scare. Not that many jump scares, which is nice, otherwise they don't work that well :) One or two were (for me anyway) genuinely unnerving. On the Extended version though, after a certain point the spooky factor gives way to pure puzzle solving intrigue, and some of what should be ""spooky"" actually becomes quite comforting. (This may be a measure of insanity after playing the game for hours).Some of the puzzle solving is a case of ""how on earth was I supposed to figure that out?"", especially when it comes to trying to unlock all the achievements, but I'd still suggest getting as far as you can with it before interweb searching past a bit where you're stuck.An odd game. Somehow manages to maintain a replay value which is rare. For best results. Play at night, on your own, preferably in winter with a storm outside.			"

												On release the game felt as if it was incomplete but later with some updates the game felt complete.Having to compete with other horror-type games like Penumbra and Amnesia this is unique in its own way. Based in Italian mountains the story and plot is simple to revolve around a house, figuring out the reason(s) you are there and obstacles that you face.The game arguably can be an experience for visual effects, atmosphere, music and the story itself rather than 'logical' fix and solve problems like many other games but it is still good and grows on you.

												This game confused me at first, until i found out that I can inspect items for details  by right clicking them I couldnt figure out why things were working when randomly clicking made it work.  Learning that the things at the top of the page (intuitions) can be combined to put the story together also helped in figuring things out.  I have played it for 2 days and gotten 5 out of 8 endings and want to play it again to get them all and see what I missed. This game has just the right amount of creepy, a story that was interesting enough that even when i had figured it out I wanted to know the details and nothing was spoiled, and a lot of small details that if you are looking will surprise you.Turning mouse sensitivity down in the game helped a ton with sanity.  ;)			"

												Turn off every lights, get your headphones on and get immerged. It would start like a classic and graphically naive point and click adventure. But it was just until you scratched its surface. Random events and noises, flashbacks or hallucinations will keep you in the dance to a point where even opening a new door would feel like a mentaly exhausting effort. This whole game is a force feedback effect, more you push yourself deep on it, more it gets back to you straight where it hurts.			"

It's not a jump scare, make you scared to continue the game kinda game, but more of a Look into the Story, and Feel the Characters Pains and Other Emotions; or an Adventure Game with a few spooks.

												Anna was a very short, yet enjoyable game. The story was very well written and the atmosphere and soundtrack were phenomenal. It is rare to find a game with a story so captivating that whenever you are away from it, all you can do is think about what will happen next. It took me about 6 hours to beat Anna and I unlocked one of eight possible endings. As for the horror aspect of the game - Anna will make you jump a quite few times - the scenes were well thought out and weren't cheesy like any of the FEAR games. Anna incorperates a 'Sanity Meter' similar to that of Eternal Darkness on Gamecube, the more unnerving images that your character sees/experiences the more sanity is drained from the meter, resulting in more horrific images. If the Sanity meter is depeleted the game will end. You can replenish Sanity by completeing various puzzles throughout the game. Just a heads-up, puzzles range in difficulty from Easy to ""♥♥♥♥ this, I'm looking up a walkthrough"". Anna was an ejoyable gaming experience and well worth the cost of admission, give it a shot.

												After getting bored with playing titles that I would consider as ""AAA"", I tried to give Anna a try. I've actually played this game several times, but only solving a few puzzles and never entering the house. Once you get pass that, that's where the thrill begins.Goosebumps! Something I haven't had in a game for a while. Yes, it's the same atmosphere you'll get when if you played Silent Hill for the first time on the PS1. There's no combat action though, and it mostly involves solving puzzles and reading journals. Maybe doing some trial and errors just to see how something would work. This game requires some brains to play.I'm playing this game on its maximum settings and the environment is truly fantastic. The background music and sound effects add to the eerie atmosphere as you uncover the truth about who Anna is.It's possible to save at almost any point in the game. So this can be something that you play for 10 minutes, take a break, then come back to later.The only caveat in this game is it doesn't have controller support. It's very much made only to be played on a PC.  There's also the annoying login/registration screen that you need to deal with before starting the game. What gives? I already bought the game! Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a scare.			"

												This is definitely worth a purchase for the folks who like a good constipation aid. Well above Amnesia on the ""Curl up and cry softly in a corner"" category.The story is pretty interesting depending on which ending you actually get. And getting the ""good"" (and I use 'good' in the loosest possible way) requires a lot of work.The puzzles you're required to solve in order to progress are anything from simple to ""I've been stuck in this room for 7 ♥♥♥♥ing hours, dammit..."". Not to say they aren't solveable, they just require a lot of searching and gathering of items. And downright odd combinations of items. Advice? Read every single book you find carefully.On top of that, the puzzles are made all the more tricky when you're in a constant state of fear that when you turn around next, something will be stood right behind you. Don't get me wrong, there's no 'health', per se, but you have an Amnesia-style sanity meter. Which depletes because of randomly occuring ""events"". Each and everyone pretty damn creepy.Overall, terrifying game but pretty damn good. Worth the purchase.P.S. I now ♥♥♥♥ing hate wooden mannequins.			"

												This is one of those games that if you play it in the dark, you genuinely do get a bit jumpy- and the way you handle the controls seems to effect the sanity of your character- which messes with the way you play. Very mysterious game,  great environments; the puzzles are possibly TOO complex? It's like a horrific version of myst with added point and click item use. Anyway I give it a 6.5/10  would have been higher if the scare-tactics were a little more related to actual gameplay as opposed to time played.			"

												This is an interesting game. On the surface it seems like an indie company's exposition, but this game offers a refreshing horror experience. Instead of making looking at ghosts the main mechanic (a la Fatal Frame), this game lures you into sense of security, realizing that what you see is frightening only after the image has seeped into your mind. Let me be clear, the controls are awkward and the graphics do not have the polish of a big title; Anna makes up for it in character and some good scares. Just when you think it's safe to look...she looks back.			"

The puzzles are nonsensical, the graphics are unfinished, the story dosen't develope very well, there's only 1 good scare in the game and the facade of the mechanic of having to combine one item with one item to create an item to solve a scenario is just tedious. This game has 3 endings and once you complete all of it, there is no replay value from here on it. Because of it's confusing game structure, the game for me, dosen't leave me wanting more. This game, along with Q.U.B.E., is one of the most confusing games I have played so far. 4/10.			"

Puzzles are in fact pretty hard to resolve, since many of them are just... illogical, but that is part of the reason I like this game for: it's not like all the other horror games, you can be sure of that. On the bad side, I didn't like the graphic and the physic engines, a little too old-looking for a 2012 game.			"

												I wasn't expecting much from Anna and what I got was a surprisingly strong Myst-style adventure game with a heavy atmosphere and strong presentation.  It's not often a game can deeply rattle me but Anna has some legitimate scares and freakout moments by smartly employing insanity effects you often can't predict and organically using events that happen behind you.  My largest complaint is that the puzzles can be pretty obtuse -- not because they're actually difficult but the darkness of the game and detailed levels make it easy to skip things you wish you had noticed.  This aside, play the extended edition version of the game with a pair of headphones and immerse yourself in a fantastic 3-4 hour experience any fan of adventure and horror games will love.			"

												A great concept marred by bitterly pityful execution.What starts out to be a promising logical puzzle horror adventure game turns out to be a completely irrational, illogical set of clicks and attempts by the player to try to guess what the developers intended to happen with little or no feedback at all. Even the in-game hints system is vague at best.The controls for inventory and using items is very annoying and lacks fluidity. The forced walking speed is an annoyance, especially when there is a fair amount of backtracking throughout the game involved.You also can not describe this title as a horror survival either, as its not possible to die.Some nice touches of horror brushing through the gameplay but very weak and suspense is not sustained properly in-game, which causes the scares to be cheap jumps rather than actual in-your-head horror. Not very obvious but there are 3 different endings which is always a nice touch to implement into any game.I'm a fan of this genre so its great to see games like this get developed and out into the commercial world, especially by independant developers but if unpolished titles like this were released out often the genre would be soon dead and forgotten.Worth a couple of quid in the sale and you have an interest in horror type games, but avoid paying full whack.

												This game is very tricky to recommend, but I feel it's worth a shot for anyone who misses the OLD discovery games. I've been getting flashbacks to the unbridled madness of titles like Lighthouse, and am not sure how I feel about that.Thus far it took me most of half an hour just to get inside, because I was admiring the scenery and completely failing to find the item I needed to advance the entry puzzle...after that I have fled just to see what happens, then later was kicked out of the house. (Two endings down!)Puzzle difficulty and exploration difficulty is all over the place, the books help a bit but this is definitely an indie game and the built-in help is there for a reason. I really wish the inserted voices were better, they are bordeline tolerable but a major chance of adding atmosphere was lost there. There is some bad english in places, but it doesn't smell like a fanfic or amateur translation...the most critical story elements got the extra polish they needed and are a delight to read.In closing I would say that while the game is not very player-driven so much as event-driven, time management and NOT INVESTIGATING STRANGE NOISES are a big priority for me in starting my next run. It seems a reasonable amount of sanity damage may be avoided by not triggering/witnessing supernatural events.At this rate I am willing to start fresh and attempt to beat it cleanly two more times, then it's time for shameless abuse of outside help.

												Oh my gosh. I don't know how to properly describe this game. It's beautiful - and I don't mean just when I have the graphics cranked up. The story is compelling, and even though I wanted to flee the house so many times, it was worth every jump (and scream) just to keep unravelling the tale of what happened in the sawmill. I finally beat it two days ago and I'm still sleeping with the lights on. I call that a victory for Anna.If you have a dressmaker's dummy in your bedroom (like I do), may I recommend moving it to a closet? You'll thank me later.			"

												I first bought this game both out of curiosity and because of its low price, and in the end I don't regret my choice: Anna was an intriguing game, and quite creepy too, with good music and a nice dark setting. Puzzles are in fact pretty hard to resolve, since many of them are just... illogical, but that is part of the reason I like this game for: it's not like all the other horror games, you can be sure of that. On the bad side, I didn't like the graphic and the physic engines, a little too old-looking for a 2012 game.			"

												I wasn't expecting much from Anna and what I got was a surprisingly strong Myst-style adventure game with a heavy atmosphere and strong presentation.  It's not often a game can deeply rattle me but Anna has some legitimate scares and freakout moments by smartly employing insanity effects you often can't predict and organically using events that happen behind you.  My largest complaint is that the puzzles can be pretty obtuse -- not because they're actually difficult but the darkness of the game and detailed levels make it easy to skip things you wish you had noticed.  This aside, play the extended edition version of the game with a pair of headphones and immerse yourself in a fantastic 3-4 hour experience any fan of adventure and horror games will love.			"

												This game is amazing! Once I started this game, I didn't stop until I had finished, it was that good!It takes a little while at the start to get into what you have to do, but once you get into the sawmill, that's when it starts to get interesting and really fun!The puzzles are so fun to complete, but admittedly are sometimes irritating when you can't find an item! But once you finish each puzzle, it starts off a new motion, the next part of the story.The story is very well presented. The further you get into the story the more you start questioning everything. Nothing is as it seems.It's a rather creepy game and has some parts that make you jump. The amount of times I screamed during the game was ridiculous! By the end you think every little thing you do is going to cause something to jump out at you!It also has different pathways to choose and different endings based on what you choose to do during the game, so you can play the game multiple times and get different results (and different achievements) everytime!I had my reservations about buying this game due to all of the bad reviews, but I'm so so glad I bought it anyway! This game is perfect for those who love puzzle games and creepy/weird/disturbing stories with a plot twist that you don't see coming!			"

												I enjpyed this game a great deal, but I'll readily admit that it's likely going to be an acquired taste.  The in-game lighting can make it difficult to locate some crucial quest items and even with the available online help, required tasks may still be pretty esoteric at times.  That said, the game drips with atmosphere, looks pretty, and has a great musical score.  The multiple endings are also a nice incentive to replay the game to unlock more of the interesting in-game lore.  If you can stomach its quirks, Anna is a decent way to kill a few hours here and there.			"

												Anna is a game to reckoned with.  You want scary? This is it.  You want disturbing? This is it.  You want a dark storyline devling into the darkest corners of the world?  This is it.  This game is fairly well done, although the games interface is lacking, it makes up for that by scaring the s*** out of you.  Great storyline, borderline Satanic, and very, very interesting.  UPDATE:  Since the Extended Edition update I have had about 5 more hours of gameplay than my initial review above and I thought it prudent to expand on what I was saying considering the additions made to the game since then.  The Extended Edition update truly was an update and added genuine content and changes to the game.  The graphics were updated and the game looks more beautiful than ever.  The sound was revamped just a little bit, which is a ever welcome update.  They also modified the actual gameplay itself, smoothing out the previously clunky controls and making it overall easier to handle.  The actual game area itself has been altered just a little bit, moving things around in the game world as well as adding even more possible endings to a grand total of 8 different ending available.  The UI is a little iffy, but with the new controls and new graphics and the story line itself, the game really makes up for it shortcomings in other areas.  Still a solid 9/10.			"

												After getting bored with playing titles that I would consider as ""AAA"", I tried to give Anna a try. I've actually played this game several times, but only solving a few puzzles and never entering the house. Once you get pass that, that's where the thrill begins.Goosebumps! Something I haven't had in a game for a while. Yes, it's the same atmosphere you'll get when if you played Silent Hill for the first time on the PS1. There's no combat action though, and it mostly involves solving puzzles and reading journals. Maybe doing some trial and errors just to see how something would work. This game requires some brains to play.I'm playing this game on its maximum settings and the environment is truly fantastic. The background music and sound effects add to the eerie atmosphere as you uncover the truth about who Anna is.It's possible to save at almost any point in the game. So this can be something that you play for 10 minutes, take a break, then come back to later.The only caveat in this game is it doesn't have controller support. It's very much made only to be played on a PC.  There's also the annoying login/registration screen that you need to deal with before starting the game. What gives? I already bought the game! Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a scare.			"

												Anna was a very short, yet enjoyable game. The story was very well written and the atmosphere and soundtrack were phenomenal. It is rare to find a game with a story so captivating that whenever you are away from it, all you can do is think about what will happen next. It took me about 6 hours to beat Anna and I unlocked one of eight possible endings. As for the horror aspect of the game - Anna will make you jump a quite few times - the scenes were well thought out and weren't cheesy like any of the FEAR games. Anna incorperates a 'Sanity Meter' similar to that of Eternal Darkness on Gamecube, the more unnerving images that your character sees/experiences the more sanity is drained from the meter, resulting in more horrific images. If the Sanity meter is depeleted the game will end. You can replenish Sanity by completeing various puzzles throughout the game. Just a heads-up, puzzles range in difficulty from Easy to ""♥♥♥♥ this, I'm looking up a walkthrough"". Anna was an ejoyable gaming experience and well worth the cost of admission, give it a shot.

												It's not worth the $10 unless you really like this type of genre.  In it's defense, the game is pretty creepy and its story is...interesting.  As you progress the puzzles make less and less sense though, to the point where I was literally going to each usable item, and using everything in my inventory on it until I found something that worked which progressed the story.The in-game help system is helpful but a lot of the time when I really needed help, it just says ""Nothing comes to mind..."".  By the end I was so damn frustrated with the crypticness of the illogical puzzles that I just brought up the walkthrough.The controls are really annoying but I actually got used to them after a while.  The physics are terrible and make no sense, but luckily dont play a big role.			"

												A fun game if you enjoy exploration and story telling with a creepy atmosphere. My only complaint is that after a certain point in the game, you can no longer casually explore without your ""panic meter"" (that's what I keep calling it) filling up and eventually getting you killed. I wasn't a fan of being penalized for taking my time to explore and read. Overall, I found the music to be really relaxing and beautiful, the atmosphere often creepy (this is a good thing!), and the story was decently satisfying in the end despite really hustling through parts halfway through (see above). If you're a horror fan, I think this game is worth your time and money!			"

												I REALLY liked the idea of this game. I had a really hard time getting it to work on my computer. Get it on super sale if you can and you enjoy short horror games that don't rely on jumpscares to get a rise outta ya.			"

												There's alot not to like about this game. It uses the kalypso DRM, which annoys me, especially when it's already on top of steam's... so if you misplace your steam OR kalypso login, you won't be able to play. The game is kinda clunky an unclear in spots. And you can't skip the intro scene, and it's not especially exciting your later times through the game, if you want to get all the endings. A few of the puzzles are pretty non-intuitive too. Now that all the technical problems are out of the way... this game was a work of art. And I don't say that often. It's pretty uncommon there's a game that can draw me into the story and mythology like this one. Faudraline says it better than I can though, look at her review. But not too closely, because she has some spoilers.			"

												Time to beat: under 5 hoursPlayed with keyboard and mouse. Easy to control.Bugs: none that i encountered.Story: meh. Motionsickness factor: I felt sick to some degree. Probably from the entire game being enclosed in a small house. :XFear: the game was creepy. Ambient sounds were alright. No jump scares at all, just things suddenly there that weren't there before...which at times took me by surprise. This is NOT an Amnesia-type game. It's not even action. It's more narrative.This game has MULTIPLE endings. I only did 2. So with 8 different possible endings, I suppose this game might have replay value. I do not feel compelled to complete all 8.I needed to consult a walk through on several occasions. Some things just aren't very clear on how to proceed with the tasks. (example, the 'Intuition' icons at the top of the inventory screen, I had NO IDEA what they were for. I thought they were chapter markers.) I suppose if I took the time to read all the 'documents' and 'books' in the game, perhaps there would have been some indication or hint on the tasks, but the fonts used were bloody awful to read, sooooo nope.SO...would I recommend this game? I think I would say yes, but maaaaybe get it on sale and DON'T expect this game to be full of action and screams. It's really just slow paced and head-scratching.			"

												This is a slow, short puzzler. You walk, you click, you experience the mystery.There are chilling effects, a few jump scares and lots of foreshadowing.I can beat this game in less than 20 minutes because I am a speed runner. Fans of Myst should pick up this title to have a little fun, the Devs are working on a ""sequel"" as of now.The bad: some puzzles can be a little hard to follow, and not every thing is given to you as a hint. there is a lot of alchemy involved here.The inventory can be misleading.The readables can be misleading once they have passed their prime purpose.Right click a lot.

												Weird visuals and cult like accoutrements are only the visual trappings of a horror game. Anna fails to deliver an actual horror game experience with the lack of any imminent threat to the player and relies solely on atmosphere that quickly loses its charm when you try to complete nonsensical puzzles.

												Anna is... weird. But a pretty fun kind of weird. A bit slow at parts, but enjoyable on the whole.The key things to bring along when playing Anna are observation and inference. There are a lot of puzzles whose required solutions are fairly subtly hidden, so you'll need to keep an eye out for objects and/or connections between things you've seen or found most of the time. This is made that much more important by how Anna takes a lot of different occult material and remixes it into its own pocket mythos, making any supernatural points of reference the player may have a bit less useful here.Speaking of remixes, if you've played the non-Extended edition before, there are some new and remixed puzzles from the original version, so keep that in mind. Solutions have changed slightly, or at least, it felt as such. To be fair, it'd been a while since I finished Anna originally, so it could just be failures on my memory's part.Despite its occasional drifts into the obtuse, Anna - Extended Edition is a fun, sometimes frustrating romp through lingering dread and ambient menace. The encapsulated nature of the story presents something different from most rehashed horror trope-fests and is worth trying, if only to get your brainmeats flexing for a bit.If you want a taste of the game, here's a -really- old clip of me exploring the starting area in the original version.

												As a person who has always been afraid of horror games, this game was quite the catch I needed to help me overcome that fear. There are no monsters like Amnesia or other horror games. It is purely puzzle-driven, with some psychological fear factors added into it. The scenery is beautiful, the music is wonderful as well, though at times it seems like it does not fit the atmosphere of the game. However, I think with how soft, and beautiful, the music is, adds to the atmosphere of the overall game.Now, a couple of things I did not really like about this game. It felt WAY too short... Maybe even a little rushed at some parts. I feel there could be so much more done to this to help aid the story along and to add more to it. I also hated some of the puzzles. I had no idea what to do for some of them, and eventually had to give in and look up a guide. There are a couple of puzzles that give hints, but other than that, nothing. The controls are rather easy to remember. The inventory is another issue that I had. There were some items that were SO pointless to have that the end of the game, and even throughout the game. Aside from the few cons and issues I had with this game, it definitely terrified me to play the first couple of times. I have played through it numerous times for different friends, all which have liked the ctual story. Personally, I would have to give this game a 7.5/10. There were some things that could be improved, but overall I think it was a very interesting, very plot-twisting game.			"

												Anna was a very short, yet enjoyable game. The story was very well written and the atmosphere and soundtrack were phenomenal. It is rare to find a game with a story so captivating that whenever you are away from it, all you can do is think about what will happen next. It took me about 6 hours to beat Anna and I unlocked one of eight possible endings. As for the horror aspect of the game - Anna will make you jump a quite few times - the scenes were well thought out and weren't cheesy like any of the FEAR games. Anna incorperates a 'Sanity Meter' similar to that of Eternal Darkness on Gamecube, the more unnerving images that your character sees/experiences the more sanity is drained from the meter, resulting in more horrific images. If the Sanity meter is depeleted the game will end. You can replenish Sanity by completeing various puzzles throughout the game. Just a heads-up, puzzles range in difficulty from Easy to ""♥♥♥♥ this, I'm looking up a walkthrough"". Anna was an ejoyable gaming experience and well worth the cost of admission, give it a shot.

												This game confused me at first, until i found out that I can inspect items for details  by right clicking them I couldnt figure out why things were working when randomly clicking made it work.  Learning that the things at the top of the page (intuitions) can be combined to put the story together also helped in figuring things out.  I have played it for 2 days and gotten 5 out of 8 endings and want to play it again to get them all and see what I missed. This game has just the right amount of creepy, a story that was interesting enough that even when i had figured it out I wanted to know the details and nothing was spoiled, and a lot of small details that if you are looking will surprise you.Turning mouse sensitivity down in the game helped a ton with sanity.  ;)			"

												Athmospheric puzzel game that takes the player into a mysterioussaw-mill in a middle of nowhere, no way out but to push inside the buildingin search for anwsers to this occuring dream and the women named Anna.Graphics is wonderful and nice to look at when particular effects take place.The feel of the game is mysterious and slightly scary, with weird things happeningaround you, accompanied by a well done music by the Chantry band.The puzzel elements are overly challenging, the game not giving any general hints(unless you wait for 5-10 min for the games option to kick in)and some of logics behind them escapes from general players mind.(Use a acorn on a eye to burn it so it may unlock a door.....oooookay...)Story in the game is intriquing and can pull the player to wonder the mysterythat happened here, althou that is generally spoiled more or less once the1st strange drawings appear on the walls.Still, kept me going just to see what´s happening and the ending,kinda of a let down, was still interesting.Suitable for more old school puzzel gamers (Sierra moon-logic ahoy!),and not really worth it´s price as it currently is.4/10			"

												I'd recommend this if you enjoy puzzle games. If you've ever been to an escape room kind of thing in real life then you'll love this game. You might want to get a couple of friends over or at least have a guide you can refer to when you get stuck because it's a pretty hard game. A lot of things are easy to miss and still essential to being able to progress further.The controls feel wonky at times and the game can be buggy but then again it was made by kalypso (the same people who made tropico). The way you use items and handle your inventory is probably the most uncomfortable part. Your character can't jump or run but you can crouch with C. The way you open doors feels kinda like Frictional Games, but you can't right click to just perform an action and need to drag instead. The game also makes you log in to kalypso's platform so I always had to launch it in windowed mode and then alt+enter after logging in so it wouldn't crash. It's a great game but it could have been way better.  "
