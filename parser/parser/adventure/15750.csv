												The Stranger won't play by your rules, pardner.A fascinating little game that actively refuses to be pinned down. It's a third-person FPS, but not really, because you are usually shooting tools rather than bullets. It's a personal story of a bounty hunter who's only in it for the money, except when it absolutely isn't. It's a methodical game of eliminating enemies with stealth and cunning – whenever it doesn't happen to be a game about massive explosions. Not even the tutorial seems to grasp quite what this is. Odd, but sort of brilliant at the same time.			"

												This game quickly became a stapple of my childhood back on the original xbox. I remember waking up early before school and playing before the day had even begun. Its a fantastic blend between 1st and 3rd person view that no other game has seemed to capture.  It looks great and plays even better for its age. And the crude, dark humor really makes it a part of the Oddworld universe. I will never forget my first runthrough of this game. One of my top five games of all time, hands down.Buy it.			"

												As someone who missed this game when it came to the original XBOX, this was my first time playing it and I must say it is fantastic! When comparing this HD version to the original, you can see that this is one of the best remastered jobs out there. The game still looks very good by today's standards with all the settings cranked up (via Nvidia Control Panel).This game also has one of the most innovative mechanics I've come across in a while: live ammo. You must hunt your ammo. This is a really cool twist and the ammo variety is quite great. The bounty system in the first half of the game is really fun and the second half succeeds as an action game as well. The blend of third/first person is also done particularly well.It's hard for me to really have any complaints witht this game. I was just surprised at how much fun I had playing it. If you missed it the first time or even played the original, I highly highly reccomend picking this title up. Here's hoping a sequel can eventually be made to expound on this Wild West gem.			"

												I use to see this game a lot at the video store as a kid and it really intrigued me but not enough to hire it out, never really gave it solid try and I regreted that decision until now. Thoroughly enjoyed playing this game in its entirety, the Oddworld universe is represented extremely well in this game with its dry humor and incredibly dark setting. There is not much of a connection between Strangers Wrath and the other Oddworld games beyond small refernces to products manufactured by the Glukkons and Vykkers (Bad guys in the previous games) spread throughout the Mongo Valley, but this detachment from the other games is not a bad thing as it gave the game an ability to explore more of the Oddworld universe and what inhabits it.Some bad things about the game, well the actual story and gameplay was enjoyable and the PC port controls were really smooth but trying to get a controller working on my end was an extreme pain so I just gave up.  The soundtrack was freaking radical, whenever the tunes started it really helped set the scene but the downside to this was the music sometimes bugged and stopped playing for me! In short if you can't be bothered reading whats above (Sounds better in my head). I really recommend you get this game if you are a fan of the Oddworld and its dark setting. If you just found the first two games a pain in the egg to complete this is a refreshing ride.[8.5/10]			"

												The gameplay was surprisingly good and offers a unique experience.  The graphics and environment offered a unique experience that would be expected from an Oddworld game.  Fair warning to those with AMD machines, as I ran into some pretty annoying bugs that caused me to crash to desktop multiple times, and I found others with similar machines had the same problem.  If you can put up with this small annoyance, I'd definitely recommend this to anyone. [9/10]			"

												This is one of the only games I've gotten every achievement in, and although it's achievement system is broken, I found it to be a very worthwhile experience.This is one of my favorite games from 2005, and I am shocked how well it holds up a decade later.Could not recommend it more, definitely the best Oddworld game.

												This is a port for a 11 year old Xbox game and I haven't found a single glitch. Incredible, right? Well what's more incredible is that this game fluidly, equally, and seemlessly blends both third person and first person gameplay in a hilarious, epic story about a badass bounty hunter. But there's more about this bounty hunter than meets the eye. This game was made when people still cared about making GOOD games  instead of cash grabs and you'll love it.

												This game is an adventure / FPS hybrid. You switch between the modes as you explore the strange Oddworld landscape. So you would do some jumping puzzles and then blast away the enemies with your crossbow. The crossbow is powered by live animals which you pick up as you travel along. You can pick up stingbees that rapidly fire at the enemies or spiders that web them and many more. The mechanic is a bit bulky because you constantly have to switch between 3rd and 1st person. The world itself is beautiful with various landscapes from forests to deserts to icy tundras and mechanical fortresses. It's a very fun game but a bit frustrating sometimes even on normal difficulty. The battle before the final boss was pretty ridiculous with enemies chain stunning you so you have no chance to survive (except luck). I would still recommend this. 7/10			"

												Stranger's Wrath is an interesting shooter slash third person game to say the least. You take on the roll of a mysterious bounty hunter named Stranger who is trying to gather 20 000 Moolah for a surgery he says he ""needs to survive"" but not more is said in the beginning of the game. He hates guns, and uses nothing but his crossbow on his hand with unusual live ammo like Fuzzles and Bolamites. PROS:unique game style+- 13 hour gameplay (on hard)Great visuals(I have to put this in) The way Stranger sprintsCONS:Most non-story achievements are brokenGame can be glitchy (in the end levels for me)CONCLUSION:Stranger's Wrath is an awesome game for anyone looking for something different in the FPS genre and just need a break from typical shooters. While the mechanics between first person and third are unsure what the game is supposed to be, they work together well enough to make the game enjoyable8/10 Silky Drawers			"

												Beware users of Intel drivers, this game will immediately crash under many circumstances. Mine happened to occur after the Oddworld Inhabitants logo came and left, leaving me with an error stating the Game Has Stopped Working. After doing some research, it appears that this port of OSW from Just Add Water (JAW) has only recieved one patch since this whole debacle started about a year ago, and since then, nothing from what i can tell. They seem content with leaving this game behind, with numerous issues, as the only dev comment I've seen on my particular issue was roughly eight months ago.Other frequent issues I've seen thoughout my research include:-Crashes occuring in the tutorial level-Game succeeding in loading main menu to only show a black screen.-Instances where Stranger does not move-Taxing on graphics cards. Possibly poorly optimisedThis is all extrememely disappointing as the game was a classic from 3 console generations past, and probably one of my favorite games ever made. This makes the fact that I will be contacting Steam for my money back, much more aggrivating.If you must own this game, check out it's offering on GoG.com, as I have heard that they include the non-HD version of the game with the HD port, and I've heard that this may run better. Or, if you have a console that this port was re-released on, buy there. I've not seen issues for those ports.Support Oddworld Inhabitants by buying their stuff directly, such as their recently released OST for Strangers Wrath. Please do not support JAW, or at the very least, don't support their PC endeavors by buying this port. The port is utter trash that it will only work for some of the people who paid for it, and JAW is as well for not stepping up to fix their problems, and leaving a classic like this in such a horrible state.

												[8/10] - Just Add Water's console-to-PC port reawakens the 2005 Xbox release with better visuals, audio, and stability on the PC... for the most part. Stranger's Wrath is a fairly straight-forward action/adventure strategy game that introduces a unique gameplay mechanic where your ammo consists of tiny creatures each with a distinct ability to distract, devour, and destroy your enemies. The game allows you to seamlessly alternate between a third-person view for ease of mobility, and a first-person view for shooting the critters at foes and obstacles. Every level brings on a diverse challenge that can be approached differently each time and delivers enjoyable boss fights that can be demanding enough to make you rethink your strategy. The story is interesting and comical and introduces twists and turns that completely change the atmosphere of the game without going too far out into the bizzare. It IS an oddworld, after all.On the downside, Stranger's Wrath suffers from some aggravating glitches and performance flaws that remind you of the horrors that follow game ports. Issues such as loading errors, frame-rate drop, achievements not unlocking, textures missing, and incorrect subtitles are littered throughout the game. Stranger, the protagonist, has poor voice acting and every creature of the same species has the SAME voice-over which easily breaks the personality of the subservient characters, and diminishes the quality of the game itself. There is not much progression other than unlocking unique ammo and some minor upgrades. Most of the more interesting unlocks are not revealed until much later in the game, but at that point it really starts get a lot more exciting and fun.Overall, I found the game to be satisfying to the end. Playing on hard and attempting to capture the enemies alive rather than dead makes the game challenging, but not at all frustrating. With a little patience to tolerate the technical flaws, Stranger's Wrath can be a very enjoyable experience. Out of all the games included in the Oddbox anthology, this one is by far the best out of the four.			"

												Stranger's Wrath is a really mindblowing and innovating game. Being 11 years old it still hold gameplay and mechanics, that are solid to this day. This game was so far ahead of its time.As a player you will get a huge amount of content, a huge variety of ammo and loads of different ways to complete the levels. You play as a bounty hunter and you are equipped with a crossbow, that uses ammo in forms of critters that you hunt. That means you shoot down bad guys with spiders, fuzzles or even bats! You choose yourself how you will deploy this ammo, as they all has their own purpose; wrap them in web, deploy as a living mine or shoot a living skunk that makes the enemy throw up. The games really leaves you with a whole lot of choices. You even get to decide if you want to kill the bandits, or catch them alive for a bigger bounty.The enviroment is great and I don't usually like deserts, but I found this one fun and exciting. It was in no way empty. As the game progress you are taken from the desert to the forest, temples, jungles and even more places, so the scenery constantly changes, with a lot of lore and detail, which keeps the player constantly occupied. Together with a lot of content and challenges, this really wraps up a good experience. I found to have ZERO problems playing this game and had no crashes at all. I was even surprised of how well and good the control and camera were. I felt it was made for PC. I did experience only getting the 'Easy'-achievement, even though I finished it on 'Hard'. All other achivements worked and I am sure this is not a common thing. The Achievements are fun and interesting to complete. They are realistic, but hard, so I would recommend doing them. Fun and a good challenge.For people who played the previous Oddworld games: You are in for a treat! Even though Abe and Munch is far away and not present, the keen eye will spot references and items from RuptureFarms and such. Even some of the wildlife that lives in these parts, also exists in Abe's part of Oddworld. The two are woven good together and the old-school fan will surely feel some nostalgia when noticing those things. The story is as always extremely good and really reflects on things from our real world. The game has a great message that is delivered with an awesome storytelling and interesting gameplay.This game's mechanics and content easily beats todays big games. They have always been very creative, the guys behind these games. The game is also very re-playable, which games rarely are.9.5/10*Would have been 10 if the Hard-achievement had worked for me. "

Teal DeerDevelopers: Oddworld Inhabitants Publishers: Oddworld Inhabitants Initial release: Dec 2010Genre: FPS, Action#Worth/NotWorth: #CautionAdvisedExposition, Concurrence and SummationWARNING: Contains live ammunitionOddworld: Strangers Wrath is quite a departure from the previous Oddworld games. No side scrolling or rescuing other inhabitants. Well, not in the same way at least. In Strangers Wrath, you play as a bounty hunter and for most intents and purposes his name is stranger. Early on it is established he desires a surgery (to live). It is left ambiguous why exactly. As a bounty hunter you have the ability to switch between first and third person camera views. In first person mode you have a crossbow; You have different sorts of ammunition used for various purposes. Some examples would be laying traps, stunning, doing heavy damage and immobilization. The thing is is that the ammunition is live. No no, actually alive. They are animals and insects you are firing. You even must hunt them yourself. Though you can buy them from the general store should you desire. Your base ammo, the one that is always there (as in infinite) is zapflies which also have the ability to charge if you hold (as in stop firing) for a bit. Which gives you the ability to always deal some damage as well as stun should you completely run out of ammo. Since you have a lot of options when it comes to ammo, you also have the ability to capture enemies alive as well as bounties. With the difference being more moolah (the actual name of the currency in game) To be spent at the store on ammo and more upgrades like faster regen for stamina, clip extenders and overall more stamina. Stranger is rather impervious to damage (relatively) he actually can die very easily however he can literally just shake and the damage is taken away. With the exchange being stamina; So it's important to keep track of. Now, the reason I don't outright recommend this game is after a narrative twist the game has a sudden difficulty spike I wasn't terribly fond of; suddenly favoring capturing enemies alive as the more effective option rather than the more difficult one with higher reward. Also your ammo bags have been reduced (if you got them) but now capturing enemies restores ammo. It's a weird switch that I don't think everyone will be okay with especially if you were really enjoying the game loop before the twist.THE GIST The HD retexture is much appreciated. The game looks and plays very smoothly. However the difficulty spike won't appease everyone. Much to my chagrin.Follow my curation for more "

												Oddworld: Stranger's Whrath HD is a first/third person game. You are a bounty hunter who works his way up from capturing and turning in wanted criminals for Moolah. The reason why is becasue he needs an operation quickly but it costs 20,000 Moolah. You play a character simply called Stranger who uses like ammo to trap his enemies which is the only way you can turn them in.+ The game looks great and live, throughout the game every place looks great and diffrent which keeps you intrested. The option menu is good since there is alot of diffrent options for the grathics so most computers can run the game. + Storyline works well and since you will get paid differently depending whether you capture them dead or alive, but of course its harder to capture them alive bt you will get paid more. You also get to choose what bounty you want to go get which give you more freedom.+ There is a good length in this game since its around 10 hours on easy, 12 hours on medium and 15 hours on hard. This a good amount of time, you will get more time if you try to bounty everyone and explore the surroundings thoughout the game.+ Stranger's Wrath can be a hard game at times, first few hours are fine but then it starts getting alot harder and you will die alot at some points in the game. Its at a good level of difficulty since its not too hard that you want to give up, the game will make you want to get though the hard parts which makes it very rewarding when you get though it.+ The controls are good and work well with the keyboard and mouse, you can also change the keys to what ever you would like which is great since they can be changed to your liking. Only problem is that Stranger's Wrath does not have controller support.+ The music is great, it fits perfectly and does not get boring or repetitive. The music mainly plays when your exploring or when your fighting bosses, this works well because it really fits in with the mood of the scene. You can get the soundtrack from the Oddworld website for free.+ Having Steam Achievements and a good story means that there are some Replayability in the game since you can go back to complete all the achievements or just play th egame again. There is not much but there is enough.+ Stranger's Wrath is ten years old now. The HD edition is now five years old. It still holds up and looks good to this day. I dont think it will look outdated in some time now.- The PC port is bad! Really bad. Most computer will be able to run the game but the main problem is that the frame rate is always really low... I get around 25 to 30 on a R9 280X. It you want the game then be prepared.- For some reason Stranger's Wrath HD is really buggy, the original game isnt but this is. There are lots of bugs and some of them are game breaking. Since they dont update the game anymore you will have to put up with it... Real shame is I love the Oddworld franchise.Overall I would say Stranger's Wrath HD is a great and fun game that most people will like. Its original and diffrent which is whats great about Oddworld. I rate Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD an 8 out of 10. I would recommend the game if you can put up with the port and the bugs.			"

												Overall it's a very good game, first played it back when it was released on the Xbox and I loved it then and I still love it now. I will not be giving away any spoilers because it's a game that everyone should play at least once, when I first picked up this game on Steam the only achievements were to get the bounties and now they added more and I think that’s great to see. However hearing people complain about that some achievements are broken does confuse me because all of them but one worked fine for me, The one that is broken for me is Sekto Suicide (at the time of writing this review) I went through the entire game three times (on each difficulty) and I earned the correct achievements for each difficulty, But when finishing it on hard mode to find out it's broken did ♥♥♥♥ me off a little bit but still does not hurt my love for this game and Oddworld games as a overall. I would give the game 9/10 only because like I said at the time of writing this people are having problems with earning achievements. If it ever gets fixed then change that nine to a ten! Basically...GET THIS GAME!			"

Bounty huntin' platformer that's mostly a first-person shooter where your only real weapon is a crossbow that only fires living ammunition. There's a third person perspective but I only really found myself using that perspective for travelling and checking from behind cover. It ain't a traditional Oddworld game though it does take place in the same universe.Each town you go to has a bounty you can take to earn moolah which can be used to get yourself some upgrades or other possibly useful items. Each bounty or boss aren't entirely unique to one another though there can be an enjoyment had in each of 'em. After a town's been exhausted of its bounties you move on to travel to another town with bounties you can accept. Finding your next objective for the most part isn't always obvious or pointed out either. Directions are generally figured out by talking to townsfolk. Each type of ammo is used strategically whether you're planning on being sneaky or just straight up running in firing hornets at full auto, taking in baddies dead or alive, it's up to you.The stealth isn't very in-depth so learning from and manipulating it to your advantage shouldn't be very difficult especially since the AI can be as dumb as the characters they portray.

												Stranger's Wrath, (or for that matter, pretty much any Oddworld game) I have too much respect for. This game's art style and play style is astounding and I just can't give it enough applause. My favorite thing to do within the game is beating the poo out of Redneck-Chicken-People until they flip out and run into their houses, eventually they'll call you a ""P-e-c-k-e-r"" and start shooting at you. Anyway, I've had this game on the original Xbox since I was a wee little child and I just LOVE it. They have remastered the entire thing in HD and it looks amazing, I HIGHLY recommend this game more than any other game on steam, please get it... Seriously.. Get it now... You P-e-c-k-e-r.			"

												Have you ever wanted to step into the boots of a stone cold bounty hunter bringing in criminals and making piles of cash? Then this might just be the game for you. Oh and it takes place on an alien world where everything is crazy too.This game is great fun; it starts off a little slow but once it gets rolling you will have a hard time putting it down. Set in oddworld you know it’s going to be crazy. Every mission and town you go through has its own little narrative and everything seems to be an adventure all culminating in an epic tale of vengeance and surgery…..yes.I loved the bounty system, it’s one of my favourite things in any game and in this one it’s great. Take people in alive and get paid more money, even bosses can be brought in alive. It just adds another layer of challenge to the title. Something about collecting them all drove me to obsession.The story and world are obviously fantastic, neither are expanded on greatly but they add a sense that there is a lot more going on in the world around you and you are just carving your way through a very tiny part of it. The character you portray is a man of few words and that just adds to the mystery of who he is and what he wants.Now we talk about the weapon, you only get one but with the HUGE amount of ammo (living critters you catch and shoot at bad guys) you will not be disappointed. It is one of the most unique weapons I have used in any game and with all the upgrades you can get throughout the adventure it always seems new and fresh.The combat is fast paced and seamlessly switches from third person fighter to first person shooter. Both have their place and neither feels tacked on. There are tons of environments to explore and fight in and so many enemies to kill or capture each with their own personality. And the difficulty could be pretty brutal in places.I would recommend this game if you have a few hours to spare and want to get taken into a world that’s more crazy and odd than most. The npc’s are huge chickens for gods sake. On sale you have to have this.Have Fun ^_^ "

												In Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath, you will fill the boots of a strange, otherwise mysterious bounty hunter who tracks down villains and outlaws for ""moolah"" -- Wild West Wanted-Dead-or-Alive style. You'll explore a grand world of frontiers ranging from old Western towns, uninhabited wildernesses and some more modern type industrialized compounds. The game allows you to play in either third person or first person mode where third person view will be used mostly for exploration and first person mode for when it gets down to action and combat. The main character’s name is Stranger and he needs to raise money for a medical procedure he must undergo in order to survive. Stranger will go from town to town through forests and wildernesses, capturing outlaws and fighting his way through mob syndicates...all in the duty of the bounty assignments he receives from the local Bounty Store.The only weapon Stranger carries is a modified crossbow strapped to his forearm. This is a mean weapon and its ammunition is actual living creatures and critters which he harvests from the environment. There are plenty of it crawling and bouncing around. This unique ammunition is also upgraded as the game progresses through its various levels which in turn is a good thing, a very good thing, because crime bosses become extremely difficult to take down later in the game, especially on hard difficulty settings. Other in-game role-playing elements include amour storage upgrades and knuckle dusters.Doing bounty hunts might start to feel repetitive later on in the game and the pattern rather predictable, but the story takes a spin towards something different and totally unexpected. The story. That is essentially what distinguishes the guys at Oddworld Inhabitants from the rest. Their story telling technique. To me, personally, Oddworld's games are treasures. I first played Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee on PC back in 2000 and then later during 2006 I played Stranger's Wrath (maiden release) for the first time on console. The upgraded port of Stranger's Wrath, namely the HD version was first announced in 2010 for release on PC and PlayStation 3, developed by Just Add Water and is one of the more distinctive games released from the ""old"" generation. It's entertaining and fun, story rich, beautiful in HD and demonstrates the passion and love you get from the Oddworld Universe. I'm Odd... I recommend this game!			"

I'm not saying the game sucks, I love Oddworld games and I'm sure this game is as good as the others I'm just warning you guys so you don't make the same mistake I did.

												I would very much like to recommend this game. I certainly can recommend the game itself, for it is an amazing game. An underrated hidden gem when it was first released. But this port is dreadful. My PC has the capabilities to run far more demanding games, such as Skyrim, but somehow falls flat when trying to run a game that was released on the original xbox. When I purchase a game I expect it to run perfectly, as advertised, without me having to fiddle around within the depths of its folders or what not. This does not run perfectly. It is unplayable in its current state. The game will constantly freeze for periods of increasing length the longer you play; the longest being at least 20 seconds. I have only managed to trudge through this to the end of the tutorial until it becomes unbareable. This was a waste of my money, and that's so disappointing to hear myself say as I love the Oddworld series and was willing to support them, but this is simply unplayable. I am yet to find any solution to this problem, if there even is one. I should have just whipped out my old xbox and found an original copy, rather then gamble on a HD remake.			"

												If you like western shooters with a ♥♥♥♥♥in story and dialogue this game is for you. You play as a Bounty hunter, collecting ammo from the wild that is varied in how it works against your enemies (exploding them vs tying them up vs ect), which are outlaws. Collecting outlaws alive nets you more money than if they're dead but it gets hard to keep them alive in certain situations. There IS an actual story and you progress from town to town, unlocking more ammo types and different outlaws.Plays great, looks great, good story too. Worth every penny.			"

												Out of alle the Oddworld games, Strangers Wrath was always the one I overlooked. Didn't have an original Xbox back in the day and when they released the HD version it was riddled with hella bugs. But now I finally gave it a whirl!Strangers Wrath is a unique blend of 3rd person platforming and 1st person shooting. Most of the game evolves around bountyhunting outlaws, those little bossfights give you room for lethal and even nonlethal approaches which you'll want to do to earn more moolah. True to the universe, the world is hella ...odd, one cool aspect is that the ammo for your gun are living critters which you need to hunt to restock constantly. There are almost a dozen different critters to use to give room for the own preferred playstyle. The game never got boring, allthough the first half until a certain reveal might overstay its welcome a little bit. But what happens leading up to the games end is ridiculous and definitely worth seeing.As expected and reported numerously, Strangers Wrath HD comes with some hefty technical shortcomings. This is as barebones as a PC port can get, I had to fiddle with graphical settings for almost half an hour until I had no strange FPS problems or weird bugs like my character not being able to move forward (Tip: turn vsync on!). There is controller support but it's not good, the game lets you rebind all the buttons but prompts show up as JOY1, JOY2. Fortunately the keyboard+mouse controls are totally fine and give benefits when aiming in first person mode.Strangers Wrath is a really really cool game which combines 3rd person and 1st person action unlike anything I've seen before and ultimately -considering it's over 10 years old at this point- left me very impressed. The world and its characters are exactly what you expect when Lorne Lanning gets to work his magic. Speaking of which, he really should make a new game!			"

												After the apparent shortcomings of Munch's Oddesy, the Oddworld crew wisely decided to invest in creating a new hero for the franchise, something that was fresh and fit well into the 3D scene. Abe never felt like he fit in with a 3D platformer and with Munch being tied to Abe... Stranger was a good alternative to explore Oddworld in a 3D envrioment. It was a risk; and one that payed off in aces. It introduces gameplay mechanics and an immersive story that devs struggle, more often then not, fail in leaps to pull off today. You hunt your bounties with live ammo and it's up to you to decide how to do it, or If you want to chuck the bounties in the slammer or get rid of them for good. The more useful ammo, such as bolimites, fuzzles and chipmunks come up quite freqnetly and is often high in the ammo department, while some of the more damaging creatures are rare. The game does push you towards getting the enemies alive through the abundant ammo of that nature and higher payout, but it's also often a lot harder for that route. Which makes two distinct playstyles and either way, you need to get creative. Bosses are often tough, and require good knowledge of your ammo in order to capture them alive. With the game itself out of the way, lets talk about the port.Many people have seen issues with performance, on my 7970, it runs well and I've never seen a problem. BUT. you need to check if it will run. there are some demanding features, such as grass, which will have in game implications if you're forced to disable them as you might not have any idea you can hide over there for example. The achievements in this game are also borked. they will not save progress if you quit. that is to say, you will bounty 250 bad guys and you won't get rewarded for it unless you either play the game for long enough to get it; or you save and farm quick loads so you can bounty one or two idiots over and over.

												Stranger’s Wrath is a really fun and unique FPS/platformer with a great atmosphere. Instead of guns The Stranger uses a crossbow that fires animals and each animal gives you different ways to approach enemies. The difficulty on Normal is actually well balanced, it’s not punishing but you need to play smart. This falls apart in the last section in the game with a stupid difficulty spike where you have to escape an area before it explodes and right after that is a boss fight with two minibosses that can infinite you to death. I did beat the game but because of this I suggest playing on Easy and save yourself some headache.People seem to have some trouble with crashes and the like, but I didn’t run into any. (Though it still is pretty un-optimized because running on high anti-aliasing drags the FPS down.) Overall though despite any flaws Stranger’s Wrath is a fun game. "

This is the game that made me try out Steam and I think it is a game that everyone should try.

												Ok so first off, BEST FPS I'VE EVER F**KING PLAYED. I played this game as a kid, and i loved it. I think i fell in love with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cover! anyways, onto the actual review...""You're the Stranger, a mysterious bounty hunter on a mission to bag the ultimate prize. And you need that money like no one else because there is something very wrong with your health and the only way to fix it is a very costly operation."" Ok so having that goal of (oh no massive spoilers...) 20,000 moolah (yes thats the currency, and yes I know thats epic...) means that you have to resort to becoming a bounty hunter. Now you may think that sounds pretty cool, but think again... it's even better then you could have ever wanted! you are equipped with the Critter Crossbow, (and again it's as epic as it sounds) a crossbow that fires live ammunition, i.e Zappflies, Thudslugs, Stingbees and more! (i think the names are fairly self explanitory there) So equipped with this ammo you set off claiming bounties and slowly earning moolah... but then some stuff happens that if I told you would be incredibly huge spoilers so i won't tell you about them. I highly reccomend this game to anyone who even just vaugly likes FPS games.10/10, would run around like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ animal again.			"

												Having played this game as a child, replaying it was an interesting experience.The gameplay is unique, with the 2nd/3rd person combination and the 'live' munitions concept, although the whole 'run around and bounty some dude' that makes up the first half of the game feels stale after a while, but it is definately bareable and countered by the variety in environments and various enemy boss fights, which are all individually memorable.The plot and dialogue is actually quite good, it caught me off guard with its witty humour, charm and twists.The graphics in this HD update are reasonable given the games age.The music is a little scarce but fairly fitting for the environment, but the sounds used are something i really couldnt stand. NPCs often repeat quotes over and over again, and weapon noises are the same, making for a frustrating and annoying experience occasionally, most noticable the later portions of the game. The game itself is actually fairly short, being a linear action/adventure game, i finished it up in about 10 hours on hard, and it doesnt offer a tonne of replayability outside of steam achievements, and i noted a problem with the steam achievement system and the games save system with collectables.The game is fairly short, but its definately an entertaining blast and rewarding and memorable to playthrough.

												One of my favorite games of all time. An incredible amount of love and thought went into this, and it's immediately apparent. The originality, humor, gameplay, and meaningful undertones all come together to form an unforgettable experience.This game is simply... fun(ny). You can listen in on the hilarious dialogue of any character, laugh at the attention-♥♥♥♥♥ chipmunk farting on your crossbow and being ""allergic to your ugliness"", lose yourself in Michael Bross' amazing soundtrack, appreciate the truly unique design and setting, punch complacent chickens in the face and steal their money, notice the parallels between harmonious peoples being subverted by industrialism and a people out of allignment with nature; the list goes on. The gameplay is intense and both 1st and 3rd-person views are fluid and change seamlessly. The animal-ammo system is as awesome as it is funny, with each animal serving a specific purpose so you have a lot of options on how you defeat your enemies.Being an Oddworld game, the humor is what you'd expect... It's ♥♥♥♥in' hilarious! There's a lot of unabashed humor and when you really listen to lots of characters, things get funnier. I've never laughed so much from somebody saying ""I like oatmeal"" before. Oddworld's humor always makes me happy, and games that make you laugh this much are doing something very right! It's just so entertaining.Is it original? Well just look at a few screenshots of the game and you'll see there isn't anything out there like it. The characters are interesting, and Stranger (the one you play as) is pretty badass. The environments and music combine to create an other-worldy feel, different yet similar to the previous games, but still of it's own. Originality is an Oddworld staple.The story is good, but I don't want to reveal anything so I'll just say it has heavy environmental undertones. It's in no way preachy, but the connections between native peoples being killed off by a more powerful and ""civilized"" culture is definitely there, and it makes you think. This is a fictionized example of a very real and re-occuring issue in humanity. To me this is the icing on the cake, because not only is this a great game but it promotes a more positive and sustainable direction for humanity; living in harmony with nature and not against it. Since this game has so much sentimental value to me, I don't see many downsides, but other people might. If you're not invested in the story or experience then you might feel the gameplay style gets repetitive, but I think if you invest yourself in it, you'll find more than enough to keep you entertained throughout the game. Just pay attention to some of the aspects of the game mentioned above and hopefully you love it! It doesn't have much replay value unless you find each playthrough a novel and enjoyable experience. If yous liked what ya read, or feel like punching open a stall door and beating a Wolvark to death with your face while he's taking a ♥♥♥♥, you'd probably like this game, ya punkass. I knows I do.

												I played this on original Xbox years ago once and it made me want to play it again.I'll admit, the game is a little strange. You play as a guy named ""The Stranger"" who needs ""moolah"" (money) for an important operation. This game is Wild West themed, which means that the best way for you to make money is to collect bounties for cash. So you're a bounty hunter, collecting the biggest bad guys in the area. You get more money for capturing them alive than you do dead, and the best part is that even the minions can be cashed in.You don't fire guns though. Instead, you are armed with a dual fire crossbow that uses live bait as it's ammo. There are spiders that act as your lasso, bats that act like grenades, bees that act like machine gun rounds, and much more. It's a pretty cool take on the western theme.The world is filled with weird creatures instead of people too. You're some weird like guy that looks like no one else around, the major towns are filled with chicken people (they are really annyoing and have very cliche lines), there are weird native people that are like 2 feet tall, and then there are the bad guys which basically are all the same looking.It's cheesy, weird, annoying at times, but somehow still fun. Definitely an older game. If you can stomach this kind of stuff, it might just be a game for you. My advice if you can't decide whether or not to buy it, find some videos or pictures online of the game and get this game for cheap (like $5).			"

												Strangers Wrath is an interesting game to say the least. It's an FPS platformer that switches regularly from first and third person. What's unique about the game is the main character doesn't use guns. Instead the player uses a crossbow that fires small animals known as ""critters"" that do specific effects on enemies. As a result the game is a lot more stealth based then one might expect from such a title.That isn't to say it's not without it's flaws. It's fairly obvious early on that the game was designed with a child focus. The voice acting is fairly uninteresting and all the characters are portrayed as stereotypical caricatures of typical Old West characters. However it is a very well polished game, especially with it's HD re-release on Steam. Just remember it was originally exclusively an xbox game and as such wasn't designed to use a keyboard. I recommend using a gamepad as a result just so the Third person to first person jumps don't throw you off balance.			"

												I never got to play this on the original Xbox, so I am playing without nostalgia-vision. But I must say, this game is a quirky, unique fun experience. It mixes elements of FPS, third-person platforming, stealth, and action into a different and fun game.  I love the idea of the live ammunition, and each kind proves its uses in different situations. The game adds different elements of play as you progress, adding more thought and fun to the mix.Visually, the game looks pretty good. It's not state of the art graphics, but for a remastered og Xbox game, it looks pretty damn good. Story-wise, Stranger's Wrath has an interesting story about a seemingly selfish protagonist that sees its plot thicken. What really brings the game together is it's Western-style setting. Oddworld is a very fitting name for the setting, but it's a cool one. All in all, Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath is a unique genre-bender that proves that other devs should take the risk once in awhile and break the standard format when it comes to making games. And the current sale price makes it a steal! Definitely worth adding to your library.			"

												One of my favorite Oddworld games prolly the one I played the most next to Abe's Oddysee. This game's gameplay is just awesome you find little critters that you use for ammo. You can go the non-lethal approach which nets you more Bounty. Afterall you're a Bounty Hunter. Worth the purchase.			"

												An Action/Adventure/FPS hybrid from the developer Oddworld Inhabitants and published by Electronic Arts, Stranger's Wrath was a new direction for a franchise which had traditionally consisted of macabre puzzle games starring the character Abe.Stranger's Wrath takes place in a western-inspired world where you play as ""The Stranger"", a bounty hunter who must collect enough money for a life-saving operation via capturing outlaws.What makes this game unique is it's combination of the first and third-person perspectives which gives an interesting opporitunity to combine precise 3D-platforming and first-person gunplay via the use of a crossbow. Instead using conventional ammunition, you collect ""live ammunition"". Small animals that you capture which carry a range of different effects from provoking an enemy to a more convenient location, to blowing them to smithereens.Overall it's a great game which is too often brushed over, and easily worth your time should you have cash to spare.

												IMHO the most underrated Oddworld game out there - I played this game on the original xbox when I was maybe 12-13? Who'da thunk it I'd play it now when I'm 21 years old and still love it just as much as I did back in the day. Aside from the nostalgia factor it really is still a beautiful looking, smooth playing game. You don't just hunt your bountys, but your ammunition as well, giving a whole new meaning to the term FPS.  Laughed my ♥♥♥ off when I played it ages ago and still laughing my ♥♥♥ off playing it today, I could reecomend this to anyone, you really can't go wrong for 10 moolah, and I'm guessing it will be on sale a few times being an older game and all. By all means pardner start hunting them bountys gettin' that moolah.PS - the fuzzles might look cute but... don't try and pet them			"

												Very awesome, classic game. Very original ideas for the weapon and weapon types. I love it so far and I know it is going to continue to be awesome. Besides a little stuttering that happens sometimes I think only when going to a new area (might be something to do with texture loading), it runs flawlessly at 60fps at 1920x1080, controls are super smooth, and the game is outrageously fun. One of my favorite new games that I wish I would have played a long time ago. I stole this game at $2.50.8.5/10Note:I read through most of the negative reviews and saw that a lot of people have performance issues and crashes, and some can't even play past the intro. I am sorry for their luck because this game is really great. They are probably having problems because they use Windows 7 still or something, I'm not sure. I can report that it runs fine with no crashes for me on a i7 3820 @ 3.6ghz, 16gb ram, gtx 970, windows 10 pro.			"

												I cautiously recommend this game.It's obviously a very big departure from previous games in the series. No followers to rescue, no puzzles to solve, instead it's a surprisingly successful mix of FPS combat and third person action. The first-person third-person mix works really well and the controls are quite good (I played with an xbox controller). The combat can get a bit tedious at points, but overall it works.However the biggest problem of the game is this: the story establishes very early on that your character needs to save up a lot of money. At the same time it throws a bunch of upgrades at you which collectively take a huge chunk out of your wallet. So I ended up ignoring upgrades for a while because it was looking like it was going to take a serious amount of time to save up that much. But here's the thing: you don't need to save any money at all. Luckily I got sick of saving up and Googled it, but I can't even imagine how frustrating it would be to save up for two thirds of the game, skipping many useful upgrades, only to find out that it was pointless.This is such an obvious design flaw, I don't know how they left it in the game.

												A short, glib review. The problems with the game are relatively few. The movement controls in 3rd person can be clunky. There is a level toward the game's end that is confusingly difficult, and frankly sucked to play over and over again. It is a timed escape sequence with what seemed to be 30 seconds of grace time before it became unwinnable.The story is well done. It was understated at some points though, if only because it reveals things from the get-go. Delightfully quirky and quite charming. The ending was pleasant, too.Mechanically interesting, especially for the game's age, letting the player screw with the enemy AI in a number of different ways.Not my favorite game, but it will be worth remembering, which made it worth playing.

Not a review of the port itself. I was very fortunate in being able to have a rig which supported a smooth port experience. However, there were still occasional visual glitches and the game crashed every time after I died during the last few segments of the game. So even at its best performance the game runs only adequately.I wish I could say I enjoyed this game more. The most creative aspect of the game is using the creature ammos to capture or kill enemies. This dead or alive bounty hunting mechanic is the core of the gameplay, but it barely gets developed upon after its introduced, and what's worse is that they ditch several mechanics after the halfway point of the game. The game can be played in the 3rd as well 1st person perspective, but all the 3rd person perspective is for is very basic 3rd person platforming and combat, as well as traversing the levels faster. The game has a currency which the plot informs the player is very important, motivating the player to capture more enemies than they kill. This makes for interesting gameplay, as it takes longer and is more risky to capture enemies alive than it is to kill them, but alive enemies pay out more. The earlier levels are also built around a combination of stealth and cover, which combined with the creative crossbow tools, gives the play options in how to complete a level. There are also upgrades and ammo to buy, giving you more to do with your money.Without spoiling anything, about half-way through the game money stops mattering, your upgrades stop mattering and capturing enemies alive doesn't really make a difference anymore. This is a problem as multiple of the player's tools is built around distracting and stunning enemies as well as killing them. The dead or alive element goes out the window, and the game becomes a very generic console fps, complete with parking garage level design. It feels like the game ran short of time or budget and lost everything which made the game unique as a fps.Overall the game is enjoyable but bland. I would ultimately say that the game is average, but since I can only recommend or not recommend a game, I can't really recommend an average game when there are already so many good to excellent games to play on steam, especially in this genre. For Oddworld fans I would say its worth at least a single playthrough, just so you can have experienced another aspect of the Oddworld universe. As a fan of the first two games on the playstation I was dissapointed that not as much of the same atmosphere was found in this game, although that might be a consequence of the xbox graphics still not being able to provide the same amount of detail as the prerendered environments of Oddysee and Exoddus.FPS fans can pass on this game, but Oddworld fans should see this game through at least once. That's assuming of course they can get this port to work, since it is infamously unstable. Otherwise skip this port and find it on the original xbox.			"

You have many RPG elements with upgrading weapons, health and so on by buying stuff from the store and getting far more money from catching the person alive rarther than dead.I highly recommend this to any fan of the oddworld series.

												A ""so bad it's good"" game. I got to a point where I encountered an unbeatable mini-boss and rage uninstalled.I was looking for charming and unconventional yet got outdated and tedious. The different weapon types were fun for a while, but the rinse-and-repeat level design and same-old-same-old ""bounties"" got really old. Plus, the last stages seemed so far removed from the original Western theme of the game that it was almost like two different design teams just spliced a game together. Think the Borderlands world without the fun.I could only recommend this game if you're feeling nostalgic and want to play something that was originally released on the first Xbox in 2005. Thankfully, games have evolved since then and there are tons of better titles to play these days.			"

												This game aged like Milk.Stranger's Wrath has a concept that on paper and for a 15 dollar purchase seems like a fun experience. Shoot critters instead of guns, set traps, hunt for outlaws. Sounds fun right?The execution is unforchanately poorly implemented. The game suffers from hit detection errors and missing sound effects. A first person shooter requires precise aim and I never felt like my shot was quite hitting the mark, I found myself clipping into walls frequently which is especially annoying when being pelted with bullets and trying to take cover. I spent the second half of the game being unable to hear Stranger speak and having his punch attack missing its sfx. The last third of the game becomes a monontus mess that I felt obligated to finish to justify my purchase. Go into an area, kill everyone, rinse repeat. The semi final boss has got to be some of the worst game design I've ever seen. Being webbed up and continously stun locked isn't fun or interesting as a boss fight, it's just frustrating. I remember really loving this game as a child on Xbox, but I see that was also just another case of nolstalgia glasses. This port is garbage, and the game hasn't aged gracefully.

												Fun game, the way you can kill or capture enemies is done in a cool way. Same goes for the ammo you collect; you use creatures instead of bullets. How awesome is that ? The game has an open world feel to it, but it's not. It just gives you the illusion that it is. Anyway, you do quests and they mostly end up with you having to capture or kill a boss, along with their henchman. This is a port from the Xbox version but all things considered, it still looks pretty good. Sound is also good and as you can tell the gameplay is still nice and fresh. By the way, the company that released this version will also release a HD patch later this year, so things will definately look sharper then (and, if I recall correctly, models will also be updated). But I recommend you buy it, HD patch or not.[Rating: 86/100]			"

												Stranger's Wrath, well, were do I begin. I'd like to point out that because this is an HD remake that the graphics and sound are fantastic, but what about the game. Well, you learn early in the game that the protaginist bounty hunter, Stranger, has an urgent medical problem that needs to be taken care of, otherwise he will die, but the procider will cost 20,000 mullah(and in the game not only will u receive at most 500-1000 mullah at max from bounty hunting, u are constantly buying upgrades(unless u want to cheat by constantly beat up the towns-folk))(not to mention that the only resemblense to the other oddworld games with this one is Vlukkons and the Glukkons(yep, not even the Mudokuns apear in this installment,but it doesnt matter)), so Stranger is forced to do more bounties. Thats all I'll say about the story. The gameplay is also fantastic due to the genuies 1st/3rd person style gameplay with the Critter Lancher, one of the best weapons in gaming history due to fact that it can lanch any critter Stranger can fit on the hand crossbow and use them as ammo(the lightning bugs are the only critters that u use to farm critters and also have an unlimited ammo). The other elements are also done very well, as how you have to capture enemies and bounty people alive to get a lot more profit(its the dead profit times by high timing numbers like 5 or 4 or 3 or even 6). I dont know what else to say, get the game in the Oddbox(since buying the game by itself is stupid, seeing the Oddbox is 10 USD and Stranger's Wrath by itself is 10 USD), and play this magnificent game as well as the others now!

												(Played game on Xbox years ago so dissregard the hours) Very fun game, fast paced but not like any other Oddworld game. The weapons are intresting, you use live ammo to kill/bate/capture enemies. It's very short and there is not much replay value maybe 6-8 first time, it's very linear but keeps you on your toes.Pro: Fun, Fast paced, Intresting and unique story and gameplay.Con: Short and not much replay value.

												You know, it's sad really. I really wanted to like this game due to the creative weapons, location, and characters, but there is one HUGE issue with this game that kills any enjoyment: It is the most poorly opitimized game I have ever played. It's main issue is that the game will constantly crash at random intervals (sometimes after 2 minutes of gameplay). I'm still stuck on the first level thanks to those crashes! As for the controls, it's the same issue, but I can look past that. I can even look past some graphical issues (including one odd one where if you take a screenshot, it does a weird duplication to said screenshot). What I can't look past is the constant crashes and poor optimization. Heck, the developer of the port is doing nothing to fix the game! For as much as I wanted to like and recommend this game, I sadly can not. AVOID THIS GAME and pick it up on the original Xbox instead! It's better optimized, runs better, and is dirt cheap!			"

												There's a few people having issues with this game crashing on them. Seems to be due to multicore processors, from what the forums say. I would be one of those people. Had it where every time I would launch the game, as soon as I stepped on the first marker at the beginning the game would crash. This occurred no matter what options I set the game to, and I'm not about to go messing with my BIOS for a game. On top of all this, the devs don't seem too interested in even so much as responding to customers about how to go about fixing this. Sent them an email regarding the issue almost a month ago and never received a response back. Seems as though they've abandoned any support for this game whatsoever. You're better off getting the game on mobile, as they've at least responded right away after I accidentally emailed the mobile devs.			"

												Rating: 7/10Overview: Third/First Person Action AdventureThe Good:+ The game certainly is original in terms of its character, world and story. + Game controls between first and third person and does a great job switching between the two. Third person is mostly used for traversing the environments while first person is used for the crossbow to kill/capture enemies. + The premise is simple, but nicely executed. You collect a bounty and then proceed to go hunt it down, usually with a lot of enemies and obstacles along the way. The game is linear and you can only hunt one bounty at a time but each bounty is unique in its own way.+ Each bounty is unique, like a mini boss battle, each one requires special tactics. You can either kill or capture the enemies. Killing enemies is easier but nets you less money while capturing them is the opposite.+ Use money to upgrade your character+ Unique ammo, your crossbow can hold two types of ammo at one time. The Average:Graphically the game is decent, it certainly isn't ugly but nothing really stands out. The story while decent feels like it never meets its potential. It's hard to care about the main character, villains or anybody else. The Bad- Broken Achievements, exiting the game makes you lose your achievement progress. - I really hated the voice acting. - Game crashes after every death and load in the second half of the game. A reoccurring problem for many users with no fix in sight, making the game almost unplayable. I solution is to quit the game before you die and continue from the main menu. Conclusion:For some reason this game reminds of me of a Rare game back in the day. Animals that talk with cute fuzzy ammo to collect. A fun game with some serious technical issues that should be fixed. Given the age of the game its surprisingly holds up pretty decently.   "

												Well, in Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath, you play as a certain bad-♥♥♥ bounty hunter called the Stranger. He is SO BAD-♥♥♥ because he enters towns full of civilian poultry to whom he can MURDER as he pleases. As he commits genocidical acts upon various towns in this fugkeen MASSIVE world right, he opens his fat mouth and utters a cheesy kick-ARSEEE one-liner in his deep lobotomized vocal features.

												let me start out by saying that I love this game and the oddworld franchise as a whole. with that being said, this port is garbage. I can run games far more demanding than this one with no issues, and there ARE no issues until the game decides to crash for no damn reason. it's horribly ironic that a game company called ""just add water"" made this port that numerous people have had debilitating problems with since its inception. luckily I only paid $3 for the oddboxx on sale, but I still paid for it. this would be acceptable if it was a torrent from a sketchy website, but this is a purchase I made from steam. take out the trash, guys. no one should have to pay for a lazy, broken port from an amateur ish company that doesn't do oddworld inhabitants justice. if you care about your customers, prune the trees they eat from.

												Pretty fairly good game so far, played the game back when i was a kid and didn't thought too much of it tho.The game is packed and bursting with a lot of style from the intro sequel you can get that, aside from everything the gameplay has a pretty nice flow and a very decent level of effect when it comes to the charisma of it's characters going beyond the stranger himself to enemies and bosses. It't truly one of the last games too keep itself true as it mixes the good things about modern gaming (as they were striking it) as well as the good things from old games, oh and the crosbow is just amazing.

												this is the best oddworld game if you ask me, and the best game on the xbox too, which isnt saying alot but believe me this game is great.   1st person shooting and 3rd person platforming may take a little getting used to, but you feel unstoppable when you master it. and despite that the game stays challenging, thanks to a system where you have to hide  and press a button to regenerate lost health. gunfights are intense and are made more intense by your ability to move like a bullet train out of 1st person, and its gets even MORE intense as it goes along.  nothing out there can match the uniqueness of strangers wrath.this port is ok. the major bugs i ran into were one that made a boss glitch out like crazy, and another pretty bad one near the end of the game that made loading at a particular location impossible (its a large room with a conveyor belt and snipers). some people had worse luck but i could work around the problems i had. i say you should just play whatever version you can get your hands on fastest.

I would play it again in an instant if I did not have so many games that I need to play. I am actually disappointed that this is not Overwhelmingly Positive.I REALLY hope that they make another Stranger game.P.S. - I did have a launching issue for awhile after I bought it, which was some time ago, but after some wait time, I tried again and it worked perfectly from then on.P.S.² - You know a game is a good classic when you make references from it in everyday life, and I actually do that.

												Surprisingly a great ""Oddworld"" game, I said that in quotations because I was expecting this to be a departure of what makes Oddworld's storyline great.It starts off cowboy-ish, but it does eventually grab that Oddworld feel in the story and scenery.The gameplay itself is also great, it is not a generic FPS. You dont just get guns that hurts people, you get ammo types that knocks enemies downs or wrap them up, and you're rewarded for ""capturing"" enemies rather than killing them which I think makes for interest tactics on overcoming the enemies.Lots of PC port problems though. Lots of people reports crash, but the big problem for me was frequent framerate problems, would drop to the 30s sometimes. I think running in Windows 7 fixed the problem, but some weather effects will bring it down.			"

												Stranger's Wrath HD is a great remastered game. It's not just a last gen game that has been upscaled for higher resolution, the character models have been remade from the ground up and the environment have more art assets, looking astonishing compared to the Original Xbox. The story is about a Steef named Stranger, set in the Oddworld universe, who is in desperate need for an operation, in which he became a bounty hunter to catch criminals to cash them in to meet his requirements to get it. Gameplay wise is a mixture between 3rd person platforming which also focus more on fighting and using agility, and a 1st person shooter in which you can switch views anytime seamlessly with a touch of a button/key. Instead of typical guns, you are equipped with a crossbow and you use live ammunition in which you can either buy in game or hunt for them. There are now a bit more features compared to its original release, such as unlocking concept art, new easter eggs, and select difficulties. Fan of Oddworld games and newcomers should definitely pick this game up!!!			"

												Avery unique game, you play the role as a bounty hunter in oddworld, trying to save your money for an operation. You can play in both 3rd and 1st to get the job done. You use a special crossbow, which uses bugs as ammo, and different bugs give you effects when used. For example you can use a spider to spin a web around a bandit, and while he is binded you can capture him, alive.			"

												I remember playing this on Xbox a long time ago and absolutely loved it. So when it came to PC, it was really a no-brainer that I wanted to show support and pick it up again. I was a little bothered by some of the controls for PC and didn't play for a while.HOWEVER, somewhere down the line, the game was patched and it added a few nice little options to the PC port. And it is now completely and competently playable without a gamepad! It's still just as beautiful as a decade ago, when I first delved into Oddworld!			"

												Just buy this game right now. Wonderful remaster of an original Xbox game (still looks fine by todays standards but nothing exceptionaly graphically). Innovative gameplay that uses 1st and 3rd person very well. There's always a variety of ways to get your bounty which makes stealth and brute force both viable options. Also the dialoge is very entertaining and flows naturally to the point where it feels almost cinematic (but in a good way). Couldn't recomend this game any more.			"

												   Stranger's Wrath originally launched for xbox in 2005, only playable at 1360x738 because if you set it higher than that the screen looks a bit upward and tilted to the right to the point where the menu is barely seen, the game can lock 60 fps but the screen tearing is making my eyes bleed, and if I dont play with the v-sync, the stranger sometimes stays foot without moving and I have to jump first to start walking again. In the tutorial level when I used the squirrel bolt the enemy didn't even walked to it, it stays there and don't even move to the cross area where I'm supposed to lure him. Seriously this is bad ported for PC, the majority have a similar issue when i google my problems, how can people rate this version so positive? nostalgia maybe...			"

												I played the living hell out of this game on the original Xbox, it was FANTASTIC! And the game itself is.HOWEVER, Sadly this port of the game is amongst the worst damned ports in PC history,I am running this game on a GTX 770 and it frequently drops below 30 FPS, and this is on LOW settings.Try turning AA on, even the most basic form of it and the game suddenly runs at a nice and steady 4 fps, good! I wanted the game to be more like a slideshow anyway.The keyboard and mouse controls are just terrible so if you're going to pull yourself through this you better have a controller ready and even then things are very very sluggish and being precise with your aim is impossible, for those of you who did not know this game features an FPS mode where you launch various critters at your enemies to cause various effects, you also need to go hunting for these critters to refill your ammo, these guys are tiny, like, TINY, and in order to refill your ammo you need to hit these buggers whilst they're running around on the ground.It's impossible, sometimes I have to shoot 3-4 times before hitting the damned things whilst standing still and this is only when using the controller, using the mouse however it is just fine but good luck walking around using WASD.. So I guess I'll just walk with my controller and aim with the mouse, good!Let's talk about V-Sync, everyone who knows anything about PC gaming knows that Vsync can be a real ♥♥♥♥♥, I personally prefer to always turn it of since I have a high-end enough PC to run mostly anything without any hitches and hey, this game is from 2005, not a problem right? Well I couldn't tell you, because this game comes bundled with glitches, buggs and errors up the wha-zoo including this one wonderfull bug I call V-♥♥♥♥.If you disable V-sync, it disables character movement in the game.Alright I'll let you think about that for a moment, and no this is not something isolated to my system.Turning V-SYNC OFF... Turns of... Character movement? That's right! So ♥♥♥♥ you for even trying to turn it of, why did we even put the option in there? Because we wanted you to know this OUR game and we don't give no ♥♥♥♥♥.Oh and do you have an AMD graphics card? You won't be running this game, at all. So have fun staring at a black screen.I picked this game up quite recently and upon being struck with the glitch-fest that this piece of crap is I started googling around for fan-made patches and fixes seeing as the JAW company obviously gives no ♥♥♥♥♥, there are none, and I came across this brilliant little article from Giant Bomb.http://www.giantbomb.com/profile/blazehedgehog/blog/the-odd-tale-of-why-you-shouldnt-buy-strangers-wra/94292/This is where my mind was truly blown, this game used to be even MORE BROKEN THAN THIS? I don't even..Dear Just Add Water ( The people who ported this game to PC )Fix your ♥♥♥♥, seriously this is unplayable.Want to play this game? Do! it is an absolutely fantastic title, just go pick it up on Ebay for eight bucks, that's even cheaper than this broken mess and you're going to have a much better time.			"

												[size=+2]OddWorld: Stranger's Wrath HD: Review[/size]The Oddworld studios is a great studio that makes the game almost flawless this is the actual remake of the ""Stranger's Warth"" (the original version of the game was released to the XBOX only) to have better graphics and to be in multiple platforms such has Playstaion 3, PC, Android, IOS, Ouya and Playstation Vita.Well let's start with some aspects of the gameFirst stop OddWorld never released a game with the combat they literally just created ""OddWorld: Munch's Oddysee"" wich was the first OddWorld game that had a 3D animation with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera movement, carrying on Stranger's Wrath has a great camera movement, a good combat engine wich you can use the map and it's resources to do it stealth or go aggro all the enemies and hope you don't get killed, when I was playing the game I got really stealthy and decided to hunt the enemies one by one until I reached the boss and I was on hard mode so it literaly made my life easier I din't wasted a bunch of ammo and got captured the boss in ease, the only think I don't like in this game it's the short story it took me 16 hours to finsih the hole game in hard mode thats how short it is, and they are never making a new game about the legendary steed ""Stranger"" since they are focused giving a epileptic seizure to future generations with ""OddWorld: Abe's New 'N' Tasty"" and the up comming remake of ""OddWorld: Abe Exoddus"" wich will literaly make me epileptic (hope not, well they abuse in the lightning again) and forgot to metion that Oddworld was going to relase a game with engine of Stranger's Wrath but with a few changes called ""Oddworld: Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot"" got canceled due to the collapse of Oddworld Inhabitants, but has they got a new team now I know it will be released and people will love the studio wich I still love since I was a child.-----------------BUY THIS GAME GIVE SUPPORT TO THE ODDWORLD STUDIO!------------------			"

												This is a game from my childhood, it's not aged terribly well but I still like it however, I advise people that it's got some warts, most importantly is that there's a Good Chance that your gamepad won't work, on my gamepad it was totally unusable becasue of Bad Bindings on the dev's part, and there's no way to change them. same with the keyboard, there's no way to configure the controls.  This is a MASSIVE design oversight and it makes the game much harder to enjoy like I used to.  so I'm going to say that i don't recommend it, because the lack of flow through the controls that normally lets you zone in is totally broken for me by really poor binding descisions and the lack of forethought that precipitated it.

I also remembered all of my fond memories of the Odd World that's centralized around Abe. But this game just doesn't have the same sort of appeal -- especially since Abe's Odworld is sort of timeless and this one really isn't. It's dated. It's not really that fun at all.

You of all studios should know better than this. This product is BROKEN. Lord knows why but the FPS.. no wait, I mean the seconds per frame is just abysmal, the textures and 3d work look like a leprous clown dropped in and smeared vaseline and poo all over everything before dropping a nuclear bomb loaded with photoshop's smear tool on everything just for good measure.Irony being i've heard this is actually a decent game and wanted to play it but couldn't because I didn't have any interest in getting an X-Box. I still can't play it because this diseased code-vomit they thought was anything other than an utter disgrace and embarrassment was worth pushing onto steam.I think I need to go take a shower to get the disgust off.

My laptop is an Asus laptop that I am able to run Skyrim and Fallout: New Vegas on near flawlessly (with low settings), but it couldn't run this game properly, which makes no sense to me. I even adjusted the settings before starting. Certain parts of the levels would turn completely black, making it nearly impossible to maneuver through the level. Because of that, my saves couldn't be loaded due them being ""damaged"".A lonely tear streamed down my cheek as I requested a refund :'(			"

												Honestly this is probably the worst steam purchase I've even made. The game has been out for years and even though I've waited all this time for a patch, it's still unplayable due to it being a bad port job. Actually, it's become even worse somehow when they updated it to HD. I can't get the damn thing to run over 5 FPS even on the lowest settings and I am running the it on an intel i7 and a GTX 650 TI.I wish I could have returned this broken crap but I had the unfortuate luck of buying this abysmal port job before steam refunds was ever a thing.

												The best console game you never heard of.  Stranger's Wrath was released on the original Xbox, but at a time when other games took most of the attention.  Worse, it was never made backward compatible on the 360.You don't need to know anything about Oddworld to enjoy this game -- it's not a sequel.  It's a very funny and 'strange' world -- you're in this Old West style country populated mostly by anthropomorphic animal-things (many of which are chickens), and you take bounty hunting missions to capture or kill trouble-causing outlaws.  You use 'live' ammo -- as in, the crossbow actually fires live creatures at enemies, which is really funny.Halfway through the game there is a MAJOR plot twist / reveal / change, which brings with it a nearly complete switch in gameplay style.  In most games this would be annoying, but this one pulls it off impressively and makes the game very memorable.  There were a couple hard / frustrating bits, but I loved just about every other minute.			"

												When I originally played it on the xBox it was a great game that I remember very well. When I bought this it was for nostalgia but with the HD remake it felt almost like a new game but still had the same feel to it.In Stranger's Wrath you play a Bounty Hunter who is a stranger to all (Even the player). You use a variety of different insects to capture and hand in the bounty's. You have a choice to either jail them alive or hand in their dead corpses. Dead or Alive their coming with you...The game has an extreme sense of uniqueness using the First-Person shooting mechanic and third person parkour mechanic together in a surprisingly fitting fashion.Overall I'd reccommend this game for anyone who's a fan of the Oddworld series or just looking for something interesting.

												This game is quite enjoyable, though if you're expecting something along the lines of the other Oddworld titles you might be disappointed. This game is more of an FPS, with a small dash of 3rd person platformer (very small dash). In this game you take up Bounties and you can choose to capture your target dead or alive. If you're not too sure about this game, you'll get a better idea of how it is by watching a gameplay vid or two. Personally I love this game and I really like his weapon of choice.			"

												To be honest I did not expect to like this game as much as I do now.The remastered HD version is stunning, really lovely touchups and graphics added.I'm not usually a big fan of shooting games (I prefer meelee combat) but I LOVED Stranger's Wrath.The variety in ammo and techniques you can use are of a wide range and it keeps the game entertaining and rich.At first I was skepitical about the desert area only, then as I played newer regions were available. I'd have loved to have seen more industrialists/regions but Oddworld has always focused more or less on the native's viewpoint.Overall loved this game so much, it's beautiful, it's fun and there's so much to do and change it's really just wonderful.I would definately recommend this as a buy. Oddworld Inhabitants has not let me down on any of their game so far, outstanding work and I'm glad I found them.			"

												Hands down, Stranger's Wrath is one of the finest games that Oddworld has ever created. The fact that it is so massively underrated is nothing short of a tragedy. To this day I still hear echoes of my dumb friends commenting on the pending release of Stranger's Wrath with choruses of ""where's Abe?"" Stranger's Wrath is everything that a game like this needed to be, and everything about it works because Abe is not the central character. It's quirky, hilarious and a refreshingly different take on a FPS style game. One of my all-time favourite games, and if you don't like it we can't be friends.			"

												Alright boys and girls, It's time to take a trip to the feels (Of nostalga) trainBeing that this is one of my most loved games as a kid, on the original xbox i had to see the diffrence of the strangers wrath HDAnd to be honest it dosen't look half bad! Now i may of forgotten alot of the stuff i learned when i played the game years ago but hey i don't care, strangers wrath is one of those games that after you'll beat it you put it down, and go out and do other things for a while like read a book or take a walk ( if you're a casual) that or just play a bunch of other games that kick-♥♥♥, and then after that, you can go right back into the odd world universe and love it. Well at least i can anywayAnd for those who haven't heard or even played any of the odd world games, let me tell you about this one. Imagine a game like red dead redemption, mixed with loony toons adult humor version, with a slight touch of animal cruilty (Cry sum moar PETA) as well as a few touchy feely things that are going wrong with the main character (I won't spoil anything even though you learn about whats wrong with stranger in like 3 countracts into the game) and bam you got this, of course with a few other bits and bobs added to it to give it its own special feelBut in the end, i have to say this game i remember most in all my years of gaming simply due to how unique it is, and trust me, it is! have you played another game where you shoot bugs rodents and other forms of wild life at westernized foes and bag em or tag em while protecting a town of chicken people? No? Then shut up, sit down, and enjoy the ride becuase if there is any copy cat  company that trys to make the same thing, their ♥♥♥ is getting blown out of the water by this game. But seriously why are you still reading this? buy the damn game.Also pro tip: Hard mode is really hard, would not suggest for casual gamers			"

												Oh, OkaySo I'm assuming Steam isn't going to try and fix this port problem with the Oddworld games. This is incredibly frustrating paying for a game that freezes everytime you complete a bounty. I thought Steam was more dependable than that. Do I recommend this game?

												The game is great. However, this is arguably one of the worst ports in the history of humankind. Do NOT GET: unless a.) theres a patch or b.) you have an xbox and you find this game in the bargin bin.Again amazing game. Shamful unplayable port. If you want though grab it, you may get lucky and it may actually run without issues. But for a fair warning of your chances, check the steam forum out on this one first.			"

												I love Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD. I had it on my ps3, but I could not get past a boss because I was only a stupid 13 year old who played Halo most of the time, so I saw that the Oddworld series was on sale for a cheap price, and I picked it up, I have not played any of the other games so far, but Strangers wrath is amazing. I love the switch between first person and third person view for different types of game play, and it was done very well. Platforming is quite simple, and if you have played any other platformer game, this won't bee too much of a challenge. The only problem I have with this game is that the default Xbox controls SUCK! I have tried to change them up, but the meny to do so is very confusing, and most of the controlls stayed the same as before. playing with a keyboard however feels very strange for platforming, but first person is good. I would definently reccomend this game to anyone who loves stealth games, platformers, shooters, and overall wierd games (in a good way). I will try to figure out the config menu, and I will edit the review when I get further into the game.			"

												While not perfect, this game seems to merit all its praise it has received over the past decade.Pros+ Combat, when all comes together, is very dynamic. Different small animals function as your ammunition with their own abilities. Third person melee and first person shooting blend a lot better than expected.+ Platforming and movement can be enjoyable.+ Simple, but rich story.+ Excellent varying environments and soundtrack.+ The game changes its style drastically about 2/3 the way through. To explain how would be a spoiler, but the ""stealth"" and non-lethal takedowns are let go in favor of a smashmouth approach.+ Sense of humor typical to the Oddworld games.+ Well balanced and rewarded careful strategy.Cons- Ear-bleeding-inducing voices. Almost all voices have been digitally altered to be a higher or lower register of a normal human... and altered quite poorly at that. - Early game's focus on ""stealth"" is extrodinarily basic and hard to maintain. Almost all confrontations turn loud.- To get a good reward, enemies need to be ""bagged"", requiring you to hold down control for about 3 seconds on EVERY enemy you knock out or kill. Can get repetitive and annoying.- The late game ammo types, mechanics, and lethal approach were more enjoyable to me than the early game ""tag and bag"" playstyle. Depends what you're into, but this seemed to be the best avenue for combining your attacks.- While there are plenty of ammo types, too many of them serve fairly similar functionalities.- Many boss fights.

												For a game of its age, it's looking pretty sharp with the HD update, leaping forward and distinguishing itself from the generation that saw it born.Stranger's Wrath although being part of the large population of FPS, it has enough entretaining elements to distinguish itself from the rest. The hability to whimsily switch between 3rd and 1rst person, be it to turn tail and dodge some bullets or close in and knock some teeth or simply exlpore your surroundings, 3rd person forces a change in strategy as well as gameplay. As for 1rst person, it is pretty standard with only a few variations and some elements thrown in, such as in a pseudo-stealth combat (e.i. neutralize-don't-kill, hiding) however stealth as itself is overpowered but really REALLY situational (scripted settled foliage) and could be better, maybe system limitations couldn't handle line-of-sight detecting at the time. However most of the combat is done in 1rst person, even though you can get creative and trace and strategy mixing 1st/3rd person, 1rst person is more reliable.As for the lore, even though it moves away from the style and tradition of the rest of the oddworld franchise, it still is rich and organic. A deep world to explore and an even deeper foreground as it forms part of the Oddworld universe, most of it deals with the themes of industrialization, explotation of natural resources and native kinship among others.My only complains are that it has not much replay value unless you really love the world they present (as much as I did, it made me lose the count of my plays), and the inclompete universe as the story has stalled and no new game releases have added something new to said universe since the release of the original XBOX version. Nevertheless on a scale this game has a well deserved 4/5			"

												A finely crafted old school game set in the Oddworld universe and rather different from it's predecessor that was a 2D puzzle/platform game.Stranger's Wrath is a fun shooter/platformer hybrid with an interesting story and a badass protagonist. The game has a lot of influence from western movies in both it's asthetic and atmosphere, yet it has some truly whacky and also sci-fi elements.A must have for those who want some old school fun before all games had to be ""cinematic"", while this game might be linear it dosen't forget that it is at it's core a game and is meant to be fun. There are some good jokes and puns scattered throughout the game between the action and stealth sequences.The later half of the game is more action oriented and has much less stealth, but it's still equally good.

												Buy at your own risk! Many reports of crashing and lack of a response from the developers. I've checked my system compatability, all my settings, and done all the troubleshooting recomendations, all to no avail. When I wrote the developers over a year ago, I never heard back from them. Since then, I've bought a new, more powerful, laptop that made it to the first cut-scene and completely froze up my computer, forcing me to hard boot my system. I can't recommend this game to anyone because, while it was a fun game to play on the Xbox, it simpy does not work for myself and many others on the Steam platform. Also, the absolute lack of a response from the developers is insulting. They don't care about the gamer, they just want your money. Once the transaction is complete, they want nothing more to do with you.			"

												I've always wanted to try this game and, having finally had the opportunity, the wait was well worth it. The graphics may be a bit dated, but the art style keeps it looking pretty decent looking all these years later. It's the puzzle-esque enemy encounters, interesting western vibe, and strange humor that make this game a must-play. Luckily they fixed the equally odd performance issues that plagued the game when it was first released.			"

												<Resolution change might do the trick for you!>What made me a SAD PANDA (Cons):1) Well I tried to play this on my ASUS Gaming RIG thats very much a beast but i got almost near to ZERO FPS unless i toned down the resolution to 1280x and disable Anti Aliasing. 2) The game then started good but may be it's my bad too that i don't prefer to play FPS/Third person shooter solely relying on WSAD movement keys. I generally prefer mouse cursor direction aided with WSAD for shooter games. Its like as if you are using a console controller to play this game. If you are like me you won't have easy time as this game also seems to need lot of planning and shooting in quick time.3) Also the camera in this game also din't help as it slowly auto adjust backs unless you hold on the mouse in that viewPros:1) The game looks amazing. It's hard to beleive this one is xbox classic era while it clearly better than many xbox 360 graphics out there. May be thats the reason this game won few awards for art and technology related stuff2) This isn't a regular button mash untill the enemy dies kind of game. There are lot of weapons and strategy involved in taking down those npc ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.3) If you can deal with WSAD only movements like a MAN then this game may not be that hard to tame.Recommend? YES!! WHY?? Chances are you might be able to run this game ok on lower resolution/graphic settings and in case you don't you can always get your cash refund as this game really deserves to give a shot at it IMHO.

												A solid game which perfectly remains barely aged. The game highly encourages stealthy tactics to deal with enemies, but you can take them with all you have if you prefer. The game has that Oddworld flavor we love (Although a very few species from previous games make an appearance), and despite having just 3-4 voice actors is more than enough to characterize the cast.Now, i have various negatives about the game but they are minor and probably nitpicking. The plot is extremely minor and you won't know what's going on until very late in the game (There's a good quantity of foreshadowing though), and that hurt my interest in the game to get my full interest (Aside the Oddworld brand). The difficulty curve sometimes is out of place as some late bosses or areas can be taken down with ease but a few early ones or previous to those are overwhelming. (Minor spoiler) The game will make you think you need to achieve certain goals but suddenly will take a completely different direction and make you feel the effort was for nothing (/spoiler).It might not reach the level of the original Abe games but Stranger is really up there just for gameplay. Is a good example of a game which goes for playability over plot, specially coming from Oddworld which is known from providing both and instead focuses on a single one.			"

												This game is quite enjoyable, though if you're expecting something along the lines of the other Oddworld titles you might be disappointed. This game is more of an FPS, with a small dash of 3rd person platformer (very small dash). In this game you take up Bounties and you can choose to capture your target dead or alive.

												A hidden gem to those outside of the ""oddworld"" genre. The game Blends third person and first person gameplay styles very well. A innovative weapon system has you shooting a variety of different critters at your enemies. All baddies have a bounty on their head and can be taken in dead or alive for different cash rewards. I love this game a lot, just the villager chickens loose their camedic charm after a little while and become annoying to be around. I give this game though a 8/10.

												Stranger's Wrath has a pretty strong idea of what it wants to be and how to use gameplay to associate itself accordingly. However, it suffers from a few slight issues that brings what is meant to be a climactic finish to a strange wobble.So, plot. You are the Stranger, a lion-looking guy in Oddworld looking to hunt as a Bounty Hunter to save up enough Moolah for a very critical life-saving surgery. He doesn't use guns, doesn't care if they come in dead or alive, and kicks all sorts of ♥♥♥. As in typical Oddworld fashion everyone's pretty self-centered but can be heroic when they care to be and everything's dirty, ugly, and casual. But it's all good, Stranger's Wrath has a heaping helping of atmosphere which really sucks you in, it's beautifully organic.Anyways without spoiling too much, about two-thirds in the genre suddenly changes. Then it stops being a case of dead or alive for bounty and a lot of use for the Moolah you've been making for over half the game becomes meaningless. Even worse, you only retain a small amount of those upgrades you've been purchasing for over half the game and other upgrades are just given to you periodically for free. Normal conventions are thrown out the window, which works given the way the game is framed, but it also completely invalidates its own system in the process. If you were trying to take everyone alive for the Moolah, you don't have a use for Moolah any more, hell you never really had a use for Moolah to begin with. It's just the plot says ""you need a lot of Moolah"" so you save up a lot of Moolah, shelling out for upgrades, and then having nearly all of them taken from you. This is what I mean by identity through gameplay, but again hard to explain without spoiling too much.From that point forward, your arsenal becomes upgraded and more powerful to better suit the ""kill everything"" idea, because they're a pain when they're alive since they're harder to catch while you're getting shot from all directions. And grabbing a bounty restores your stamina, which allows you to heal. Dead guys are faster to catch but disappear after a minute so typically it's better to have them dead if you're moving fast anyways, which you should. Or, you could just ignore everything and run to the end. Only a few situations in the later third of the game require you to fight everything if you're smart and move fast. There's no point after all as the only use for guys at that point is quick healing or more ammo which you'd lose more of fighting to begin with. This is fine given how repetitive and drawn out fights become when nearly everything has to die and there's lots of them.Ultimately I can give Stranger's Wrath a recommendation because it's full of charm and life while also offering a solid challenge. While it has its rough moments, it knows what it is and what it wants to be, it just happens to have difficulty with its own systems the moment you realize a good chunk of them don't even matter. Unless you're hunting for achievements.			"

												Although the story was interesting, The in-game dialogue tends to be repetitive and annoying, especially when you meet the grubbs and their high-pitched voices. The bounty/boss fights tend to be nothing more than the boss enemy spamming just 2 attacks at you repetitively, which is incredibly annoying when the boss is capable if immobilizing you with one of his/its attacks. And sometimes your movement will glitch up and freeze you in place until you fiddle with the controls for several seconds trying to get Stranger to start moving again.			"

When I saw this game debut way back when I was a teen on the verge of manhood. it filled me with such excitement, the very concept of this game. at the time I THINK ""Gun"" was around and I absolutely loved that game. This looked like that with a fantasy twist. So, to the game - It opens up with a cutscene, our Hero is collecting some critters you see him afterwards setting them up on the ground nice like. Orderly. he then procedes to cover them with brush. A few seconds later We see a big ol'fatty chasing something through some wooded brush, vines everywhere. Its quick. Hes consistently popping off rounds with his blunderbuss, an just as consistently missing. Eventually we see what hes chasing is actually our hero, a Feline like bounty hunter. Got the raspy cowboy voice an all. Leather vest, Cowboy hat. He quickly turns the chase around onto the other fella chasing him. He leads him to where he had laid those little critters he collected earlier. Turns out he was just leading the guy on all along. he had a trap waiting for him. Nasty little buggers jump and start gnawing on any part of that bubblin fool they can sink their teeth into. Our Hero, procedes to use another spider like critter to than ensnare his catch. Wanted, Dead or Alive. Luckily for him, The Hero, Known as the Stranger. Does not use firearms.This game is basically Dog the Bounty Hunter with Furries.			"

												Stranger's Wrath requires fairly good hardware to run smoothly. If this isn't a problem, you'll love the game. Having played this on Xbox, I knew how the game should feel. This PC version seems to work excellently!In this game, you are BAD - ♥♥♥ bounty hunter, in every sense of the title. Here, you bag your prey however you like, whether you smack them around 'til ya knock 'em out, or shoot 'em up 'til their dead meat. Along the way, you find harsher environments, though the fight will never be too hard for you to handle.You're Stranger, you don't care what anyone says... you're draggin' their punk-♥♥♥ in, dead or alive.

												This is a game that I really wanted to play ever since it came out on consoles. I have just finished the game and I can say that it was fun to play. This review will be broken up into several partscontrols: controls can make or break a game. When I started this game the controls were all over the place. The shoot/punch button was start capturing was R3 and other weird crap. Weather the game didn't detect my 360 controller layout or what I don't know. It took me a good hour to configure everything correctly but after that no issues were had. The controls are a bit stiff but that is a small gripe and I think its due to it being an older title and being a hybrid game. The controls weren't bad by any means but they did get in the way several times. The camera was so so most of the time it cooperated but occasionally it did not. Overall the controls weren't too bad but were a weak point in my experience of the product.Story: About a 7 out of 10 the story had a lot of personality and spunk although the npcs could get a little annoying and the main character was really bland due to his slow speaking drawl. There was the occasional where do I go or what do I do but by process of elimination or asking npcs you found your way quickly enough. It however did lack any suspense. There's quite a few occasions where you can see whats about to happen an hour or two in advance but it doesn't get in the way too much and the stories entertaining enough to keep you entertained.Voice/sound: Both are done quite well it might be part of the HD remake but everything sounded crisp and nice. There were however npcs that would repeat things like a broken record and during fire fights or another conversation it could annoy the crap out of you. Almost everyone has a voice in this game and even though they all sound the same and say the same thing except for main story line characters the world seems lively.Visuals: Being and HD remake I didn't expect too much I never played the original game so I had nothing to compare it to however the game looked nice and played smooth there were no draw distance issues and the characters all seemed well represented. However there are still some blocky textures and areas that look very similar to each other but being a game from the early 2ks you should be expecting that much. Overall with the overhaul the game looks and feels good. I did however have to change my resolution from 1440X900 to 1200X900 the game just seemed too stretched out and the visuals washed  when on my full resolution settings. Gameplay: The meat and potatoes if the game is not fun to play whats the point right? This game even with some challenging controls happens to be a joy to play. Your character stranger doesn't use guns instead uses a crossbow with “Live Ammo” living animals as his weapons. Each one is unique and each one is useful unlike some games where you will use a weapon or gun once and never touch it again this game makes every ammo useful to some degree. There are ammos that you will prefer to another but other than that the mechanic is very well done. You are a bounty hunter and throughout the better half of the game you collect bounties which are basically you doing boss runs. The game is a bit linear in this manner go for a bounty collect it go for another one repeat. However this is not the full story for this game and the gameplay switches up after you collect the last guy. You can collect your bounties one of two ways dead or alive. Dead nets you less reward but is easier alive nets you more but is harder. Some bosses are almost forcing your hand to collect them dead as they will not go down easily. And speaking of that this game is surprisingly challenging. Even on normal I found myself struggling in some areas. There are clear difficulty spikes during boss battles and in some other areas. However this game can still be beaten no matter which way you play and for the most part (spoiler) it doesn't matter in the end how you bag them I had troves of money left and I bought all of the upgrades too and never needed to buy ammo. The game doesn't change (far as I know) depending on how you play the game. Overall the game is fun to play with very few flaws.This game was fun to play and I suggest it to anyone who thinks they might like this game!			"

												Let me start off by stating that the begining of the game sucks, having to continualy turn in bountys is frankly boring to me, and the clakkers really get on my nerves after a while. However, once you get to the turning point, the game gets much better. The turning point made the game sorta feel a lot like halo in a good way (maybe because it's an original xbox title?). Please give this game a go.			"

												A brilliant piece of underrated, underadvertized innovation during a time when the Inhabitants team had been thrown under the bus by its now infamously-satanic publisher EA. Inspired by shooters, platformers, GTA and an assundry of other games, the IP rings has wholly unique and fantastic despite its various conceptual origins. Oh, and its ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious.It should be prefaced that the game was designed for Xbox, and as such the third person camera will not control in the intuitive fashion you'd assume it would, and the overall port is subpar. The game will (supposedly) be receiving a vast renovation in the form of a patch from its current developers, Just Add Water (JAW). Only time will tell if it will address the sloppy porting of an otherwise masterwork game.			"

												This game is just as good as its predecessors in the fact that it's both Odd, and it's got a whole lot o' world. The reasons i would recommend this game:1) The controls for both first and third person feel comfortable and responsive. (You'll be running round in third person a whole lot just cause it's so damn satisfying)2) The HD remake makes this game looks beautiful, not that the original was a bad looking game for the time by any means, you'll actually think it's a modern day release.3) The game is challenging but rewarding, just like the other titles in the Quintology. You'll be wonderfully frustrated. (If I could call it anything it would be that)4) The storyline aint too shabby either, but I won't talk about that for obvious reasons.			"

												Admittedly, the original port quality of the SD version (now unavailable, which is nice) was atrocious and in many instances completey unplayable. But with a massive failure comes the ability to learn from it, and JAW refined the port quality with the HD release. You'll find none of the original nonsense in this version, just a great game with that classic oddworld feel to it.As ""Stranger"" utilize living ammunition to dispatch your enemies. You can blow them up, fill them with holes, shred them apart or clobber them to death with certain projectiles, or you can go the quality bounty hunter route and take every outlaw you encounter in alive and roll in the sweet sweet moolah. You'll fight your way through farmlands, forests, ruins, facilities and now in beautiful HD, worthy of modern day screens.

												To be honest I did not expect to like this game as much as I do now.The remastered HD version is stunning, really lovely touchups and graphics added.I'm not usually a big fan of shooting games (I prefer meelee combat) but I LOVED Stranger's Wrath.The variety in ammo and techniques you can use are of a wide range and it keeps the game entertaining and rich.At first I was skepitical about the desert area only, then as I played newer regions were available. I'd have loved to have seen more industrialists/regions but Oddworld has always focused more or less on the native's viewpoint.Overall loved this game so much, it's beautiful, it's fun and there's so much to do and change it's really just wonderful.I would definately recommend this as a buy. Oddworld Inhabitants has not let me down on any of their game so far, outstanding work and I'm glad I found them.			"

												It's definitely an interesting game. There are some good and bad, but some of the bad is probably just personal preference, aside from an issue I will discuss later. The graphics seem very nice for an hd remake. Texture quality could be better, but I was satisfied with it. The gameplay was awkward but had a lot of potential. I just wish you didn't have to keep switching from first to third and back to shoot stuff or climb things(technically you don't switch into third person, it just automatically changes the camera to that while you climb).My only real issue with this game is that my framerate was abysmal, despite well exceeding the system recuirements. I had to play the game at almost minimal graphical settings to get a decent framerate. This should be kept in mind if you don't have the greatest computer and plan to buy this game. Otherwise, it's a good game if you're into a somewhat silly storyline and don't mind sub par dialogue.			"

												Alright boys and girls, It's time to take a trip to the feels (Of nostalga) trainBeing that this is one of my most loved games as a kid, on the original xbox i had to see the diffrence of the strangers wrath HDAnd to be honest it dosen't look half bad! Now i may of forgotten alot of the stuff i learned when i played the game years ago but hey i don't care, strangers wrath is one of those games that after you'll beat it you put it down, and go out and do other things for a while like read a book or take a walk ( if you're a casual) that or just play a bunch of other games that kick-♥♥♥, and then after that, you can go right back into the odd world universe and love it. Well at least i can anywayAnd for those who haven't heard or even played any of the odd world games, let me tell you about this one. Imagine a game like red dead redemption, mixed with loony toons adult humor version, with a slight touch of animal cruilty (Cry sum moar PETA) as well as a few touchy feely things that are going wrong with the main character (I won't spoil anything even though you learn about whats wrong with stranger in like 3 countracts into the game) and bam you got this, of course with a few other bits and bobs added to it to give it its own special feelBut in the end, i have to say this game i remember most in all my years of gaming simply due to how unique it is, and trust me, it is! have you played another game where you shoot bugs rodents and other forms of wild life at westernized foes and bag em or tag em while protecting a town of chicken people? No? Then shut up, sit down, and enjoy the ride becuase if there is any copy cat  company that trys to make the same thing, their ♥♥♥ is getting blown out of the water by this game. But seriously why are you still reading this? buy the damn game.Also pro tip: Hard mode is really hard, would not suggest for casual gamers			"

												A solid game which perfectly remains barely aged. The game highly encourages stealthy tactics to deal with enemies, but you can take them with all you have if you prefer. The game has that Oddworld flavor we love (Although a very few species from previous games make an appearance), and despite having just 3-4 voice actors is more than enough to characterize the cast.Now, i have various negatives about the game but they are minor and probably nitpicking. The plot is extremely minor and you won't know what's going on until very late in the game (There's a good quantity of foreshadowing though), and that hurt my interest in the game to get my full interest (Aside the Oddworld brand). The difficulty curve sometimes is out of place as some late bosses or areas can be taken down with ease but a few early ones or previous to those are overwhelming. (Minor spoiler) The game will make you think you need to achieve certain goals but suddenly will take a completely different direction and make you feel the effort was for nothing (/spoiler).It might not reach the level of the original Abe games but Stranger is really up there just for gameplay. Is a good example of a game which goes for playability over plot, specially coming from Oddworld which is known from providing both and instead focuses on a single one.			"

												A finely crafted old school game set in the Oddworld universe and rather different from it's predecessor that was a 2D puzzle/platform game.Stranger's Wrath is a fun shooter/platformer hybrid with an interesting story and a badass protagonist. The game has a lot of influence from western movies in both it's asthetic and atmosphere, yet it has some truly whacky and also sci-fi elements.A must have for those who want some old school fun before all games had to be ""cinematic"", while this game might be linear it dosen't forget that it is at it's core a game and is meant to be fun. There are some good jokes and puns scattered throughout the game between the action and stealth sequences.The later half of the game is more action oriented and has much less stealth, but it's still equally good.

												This has to be one of my favorite games of all time. Very few games make me wish they were longer. Out of all the oddworld games this one is the best. You use a mix of third-person platforming, and first-person shooting. It mixes very well. You spend most of the game fighting outlaws as a badass bounty hunter, but there is a still an amazing story to go along with it. It is also full of surprises. I recommend this to anyone that loves playing video games.			"

												Hands down, Stranger's Wrath is one of the finest games that Oddworld has ever created. The fact that it is so massively underrated is nothing short of a tragedy. To this day I still hear echoes of my dumb friends commenting on the pending release of Stranger's Wrath with choruses of ""where's Abe?"" Stranger's Wrath is everything that a game like this needed to be, and everything about it works because Abe is not the central character. It's quirky, hilarious and a refreshingly different take on a FPS style game. One of my all-time favourite games, and if you don't like it we can't be friends.			"

												A solid game which perfectly remains barely aged. The game highly encourages stealthy tactics to deal with enemies, but you can take them with all you have if you prefer. The game has that Oddworld flavor we love (Although a very few species from previous games make an appearance), and despite having just 3-4 voice actors is more than enough to characterize the cast.Now, i have various negatives about the game but they are minor and probably nitpicking. The plot is extremely minor and you won't know what's going on until very late in the game (There's a good quantity of foreshadowing though), and that hurt my interest in the game to get my full interest (Aside the Oddworld brand). The difficulty curve sometimes is out of place as some late bosses or areas can be taken down with ease but a few early ones or previous to those are overwhelming. (Minor spoiler) The game will make you think you need to achieve certain goals but suddenly will take a completely different direction and make you feel the effort was for nothing (/spoiler).It might not reach the level of the original Abe games but Stranger is really up there just for gameplay. Is a good example of a game which goes for playability over plot, specially coming from Oddworld which is known from providing both and instead focuses on a single one.			"

												This is an OLD game. I want to say first year of the original Xbox old? But it's one of my favorites. You're a bounty hunter that ""has"" to have a procedure done in order to ""save your life"". And man is it fun. The bounties are hilarous in just the way they talk, act, just everything. There's alot of potty humor here, but it's a mock wild west. Why not? And your ammo is living, and almost all of the different types allow creativity to place traps, luring enemies away from the group one by one, or stunning them all at once for an easy Alive Bounty capture. Even though the graphics are dated, the world is still fun to look at, and the characters are still full of, well, character. And you should get quite a few hours out of this, like all good ol' games.			"

												Admittedly, the original port quality of the SD version (now unavailable, which is nice) was atrocious and in many instances completey unplayable. But with a massive failure comes the ability to learn from it, and JAW refined the port quality with the HD release. You'll find none of the original nonsense in this version, just a great game with that classic oddworld feel to it.As ""Stranger"" utilize living ammunition to dispatch your enemies. You can blow them up, fill them with holes, shred them apart or clobber them to death with certain projectiles, or you can go the quality bounty hunter route and take every outlaw you encounter in alive and roll in the sweet sweet moolah. You'll fight your way through farmlands, forests, ruins, facilities and now in beautiful HD, worthy of modern day screens. All the while, enjoying what is genuinely an instant classic and a worthy part of the Oddworld universe.			"

It's an excellent port aside from a few things, such as framerate drops when moving fast or turning fast. Good Keyboard mouse support but using a controller is better and feels right.

												Hub-World Platformer, with elements of Stealth and First Person Shooting.  It starts out slow and stealthy, teaching you about your ""live"" ammo, and letting you get a feel for it; then builds up to a nice mix of stealth with fast and frantic action.  Has an engaging story as all the Oddworld games do.  Highly recommended if you enjoy action and stealth games at all with the weirdness that still to this day only Oddworld Inhabitants could bring.Excellent under-appreciated game by the gaming public at large.  You won't be disappointed.  Unless you hate fun, and you don't hate fun do you?  It does run less than desirable as of this recommendation, but 30FPS at 1920x1200 on average is okay for me, seeing as I can't play it anywhere else these days.			"

												When I originally booted this up in 2010, I played with a mouse and keyboard, and it controlled horribly. I couldn't stand the FPS controls as they were unchanged from the Xbox version during the port. That is to say that the mouselook was tied to a constant turn rate and was not optimized for PC playing.That being said, it recently occurred to me to try with my 360 controller, and it's perfect. This is the game I loved back when I played it originally on the Xbox. I should say I own three copies of this game. 1 here on Steam, 1 for the original Xbox, and 1 on PSN.You should play this game.

												A... unique experience. I love it dearly because I played it back when I was a console peasant, and it was an absolute ton of fun- and it still is! At least to me.It's a sort of platformer with core elements of a shooter, but not entirely dominated by them and it changes form a few times through, but not in unwelcome or unwieldly ways. I don't know why I like it. It's wierd, it's different, and maybe it's not your cup of tea, but would you at least give it a try? Look up a few videos, a few reviews, a few screenshots, and nab it while it's on sale?The one thing I know for sure is that I found it fun, and in the end, that's all it needed do.			"

This game and Jet Set Radio Future are my two all time favourite original XBox games. Other games can easily be described as fun, but only a few can be called a treat. Without a doubt, this game is a treat and more. Live ammo that is literally live ammo! Humourous, entertaining, excellent graphics, highly addictive. Everything you want from a game. Has truly stood the test of the time. Looking forward to revisiting this exceptional game. Shame I have to buy a joystick to play, my only complaint. Surprised it's not controller compatible.

												A big part of my childhood, I've played it on the original Xbox, mobile, and now PC, I still love it almost 10 years later XD, that's how much I love it! It's hilarious, strategy, dodging, bounties, many types of ammo, and of course tons of satisfying explosions XD. Beautiful scenery and great details, amazing story, creative and unique characters with expressive emotions and personality, awesome and intense soundtrack, and come on what other shooter uses live ammo XD. It works completly smooth, easy controls, although I noticed the highest resolution doesn't work well and it crashes fast but it works perfectly on resolution 1280x600. I also noticed 6 achievements are broken and you can't earn them through one try but I did find out a guide on how you earn them but if you are trouble with achievements here are the broken one's: Finder's Filchers, Free The Meat, Get'em, Get'em goooooood!, Stranger Danger, Sekto Suicide. It does make me a sad that it never got enough attention for the work put into it and the Oddworld series it's self, it deserves so much more attention but it's a definite must buy but I hope it gets more attention sometime and more support for a 2nd part or sequel. :)			"

												I love Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD. I had it on my ps3, but I could not get past a boss because I was only a stupid 13 year old who played Halo most of the time, so I saw that the Oddworld series was on sale for a cheap price, and I picked it up, I have not played any of the other games so far, but Strangers wrath is amazing. I love the switch between first person and third person view for different types of game play, and it was done very well. Platforming is quite simple, and if you have played any other platformer game, this won't bee too much of a challenge. The only problem I have with this game is that the default Xbox controls SUCK! I have tried to change them up, but the meny to do so is very confusing, and most of the controlls stayed the same as before. playing with a keyboard however feels very strange for platforming, but first person is good. I would definently reccomend this game to anyone who loves stealth games, platformers, shooters, and overall wierd games (in a good way). I will try to figure out the config menu, and I will edit the review when I get further into the game.			"

												Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath was a surprise for me: I though I wouldn't like it because of the FPS structure, but I was wrong. After playing a while, the gameplay is better than what I thought. Third-person platforming and FPS action... not with guns but with a crossbow with living ammo caught from the wild. You go look for outlaws and capturing them with these in a western-alike style: excellent.  And be sure you think well how to clear an area, or else you are busted. There's also a plot twist in the middle of the game that is very interesting and incentivates you to play until the end. One of the cons I have is that the gameplay can turn out to be repetitive for some people, but still enjoyable. If you are a fan of Oddworld or someone that wants to experience a different platforming game similar to Portal (except for the portal concept and constant first-person view) I definitely recommend it.

												Alright boys and girls, It's time to take a trip to the feels (Of nostalga) trainBeing that this is one of my most loved games as a kid, on the original xbox i had to see the diffrence of the strangers wrath HDAnd to be honest it dosen't look half bad! Now i may of forgotten alot of the stuff i learned when i played the game years ago but hey i don't care, strangers wrath is one of those games that after you'll beat it you put it down, and go out and do other things for a while like read a book or take a walk ( if you're a casual) that or just play a bunch of other games that kick-♥♥♥, and then after that, you can go right back into the odd world universe and love it. Well at least i can anywayAnd for those who haven't heard or even played any of the odd world games, let me tell you about this one. Imagine a game like red dead redemption, mixed with loony toons adult humor version, with a slight touch of animal cruilty (Cry sum moar PETA) as well as a few touchy feely things that are going wrong with the main character (I won't spoil anything even though you learn about whats wrong with stranger in like 3 countracts into the game) and bam you got this, of course with a few other bits and bobs added to it to give it its own special feelBut in the end, i have to say this game i remember most in all my years of gaming simply due to how unique it is, and trust me, it is! have you played another game where you shoot bugs rodents and other forms of wild life at westernized foes and bag em or tag em while protecting a town of chicken people? No? Then shut up, sit down, and enjoy the ride becuase if there is any copy cat  company that trys to make the same thing, their ♥♥♥ is getting blown out of the water by this game. But seriously why are you still reading this? buy the damn game.Also pro tip: Hard mode is really hard, would not suggest for casual gamers			"

												This is an OLD game. I want to say first year of the original Xbox old? But it's one of my favorites. You're a bounty hunter that ""has"" to have a procedure done in order to ""save your life"". And man is it fun. The bounties are hilarous in just the way they talk, act, just everything. There's alot of potty humor here, but it's a mock wild west. Why not? And your ammo is living, and almost all of the different types allow creativity to place traps, luring enemies away from the group one by one, or stunning them all at once for an easy Alive Bounty capture. Even though the graphics are dated, the world is still fun to look at, and the characters are still full of, well, character. And you should get quite a few hours out of this, like all good ol' games.			"

												Admittedly, the original port quality of the SD version (now unavailable, which is nice) was atrocious and in many instances completey unplayable. But with a massive failure comes the ability to learn from it, and JAW refined the port quality with the HD release. You'll find none of the original nonsense in this version, just a great game with that classic oddworld feel to it.As ""Stranger"" utilize living ammunition to dispatch your enemies. You can blow them up, fill them with holes, shred them apart or clobber them to death with certain projectiles, or you can go the quality bounty hunter route and take every outlaw you encounter in alive and roll in the sweet sweet moolah. You'll fight your way through farmlands, forests, ruins, facilities and now in beautiful HD, worthy of modern day screens. All the while, enjoying what is genuinely an instant classic and a worthy part of the Oddworld universe.			"

												Note: Review was written for launch product and before the HD update was available.The Good: Story is decent, using critters as ammo is unique, hilarious dialog, interesting art styleThe Bad: Dated visuals, terrible porting problems, world is limited in scope and very linear, floaty physics make platforming a pain, can't decide what genre it wants to be, extremely hard in most spotsWhile the Oddworld series may have been dead for years now the last creation from Lorne Lanning is a great opus. While the series hasn't been perfect gameplay wise it instills great characters, humor, and a unique art style that can be recognized from the series. Stranger's Wrath was a cult classic Xbox hit, but saw poor sales (as did most of the Oddworld games) due to it's quirky style. You play as a bounty hunter named Stranger trying to collect enough Mulah (money) to get a mysterious surgery performed. The story doesn't get interesting at all until the end but there are two key plot twists that really throw you for a loop and make the story worthwhile.The game is split up into two parts. The first half of the game has you finding 12 different wanted bad buys and wandering around the linear world finding them. The thing that made Stranger's Wrath so unique was its shooting mechanic. Unlike most shooters Wrath has you shooting critters as your ammo and you even have to gather them in the wild. A few range from Zap Flies that have unlimited ammo and can be charged. Boombats are explosive, Thud Slugs are like shotguns shells, and so on. Each critter will eventually be upgraded in the game, but this is a unique approach to shooters that has never been done since.Most of the time you can try to sneak your way around and bounty up bad guys, but the stealth mechanics are pretty broken. You can hide in tall grass and lure the bad guys to you then may wrap them up to get them alive (for more bounty) or just run and gun and kill them all, but you get less bounty. While the shooting may be unique it doesn't really know what it wants to do. There's ammo for stealth, but its not good enough for run and gun action. Finding ammo in crates helps, but you will constantly try to decide which ammo type is best suited for the situation. You can equip any two at the same time for combos, but you can't shoot them at the same time. I would have like to see some sort of combo element implemented with that.The second part of the game lets you have more powerful melee attacks and is all about run and gun really. You get the upgraded ammo types so this is possible, but the game's difficulty is ruthless and you will die a lot. Thankfully the game has a quick save feature so this alleviates it a little bit. I just felt that this game should have stuck to either a platformer or a shooter because switching from first to third constantly can be a bit disjointing, and even jumping around and climbing is difficult because it feels like all the physics in the game are very floaty.Wrath is a fun game, but it feels very dated thanks to the low-res visuals, very linear environments, and limited interaction with the world. The PC port didn't go so well with some hideous visual distortions through the whole game, and no upgraded textures yet (they are still on the way). The voice acting is good and all, but everything just feels so limited in scope that you really wish the world was bigger. I love all the ideas thrown in here, but they are executed a little poorly and the game as a whole doesn't feel as polished as it could be.Overall the shooting mechanic is very unique, but works against itself and the game doesn't know if its a third person platformer, stealth game, or run and gun first person shooter. If it stuck to just one the game would be better, but it is a cult classic and shouldn't be missed if you never owned an Xbox.~Score: 7/10			"

												TBH. I never played an oddworld game in my life before this. an even then you can see at time of review, I only have like almost 3 hours. When I saw this game debut way back when I was a teen on the verge of manhood. it filled me with such excitement, the very concept of this game. at the time I THINK ""Gun"" was around and I absolutely loved that game. This looked like that with a fantasy twist. So, to the game - It opens up with a cutscene, our Hero is collecting some critters you see him afterwards setting them up on the ground nice like. Orderly. he then procedes to cover them with brush. A few seconds later We see a big ol'fatty chasing something through some wooded brush, vines everywhere. Its quick. Hes consistently popping off rounds with his blunderbuss, an just as consistently missing. Eventually we see what hes chasing is actually our hero, a Feline like bounty hunter. Got the raspy cowboy voice an all. Leather vest, Cowboy hat. He quickly turns the chase around onto the other fella chasing him. He leads him to where he had laid those little critters he collected earlier. Turns out he was just leading the guy on all along. he had a trap waiting for him. Nasty little buggers jump and start gnawing on any part of that bubblin fool they can sink their teeth into. Our Hero, procedes to use another spider like critter to than ensnare his catch. Wanted, Dead or Alive. Luckily for him, The Hero, Known as the Stranger. Does not use firearms.This game is basically Dog the Bounty Hunter with Furries.			"

												I had this game on the original Xbox and fell instantly in love. It truly is one-of-a-kind, and if you're a fan of the Oddworld series you should definitely give it a go.			"

												This game is awesome. I played it so much back in the days when I was like 7 year old and completed it back then about 3 times and now this is my 4th time completing it.+Characters+Story+Graphics+Bounty hunts+Cool towns+Humour+1st, 3rd person+E V E R Y T H I N GThis game is just masterpiece! I recommend to buy it from steam sales when it's under 10 euros. I bought this game from steam summer sale 2016 for 2,50 euros. Worth it! "

												A big part of my childhood, I've played it on the original Xbox, mobile, and now PC, I still love it almost 10 years later XD, that's how much I love it! It's hilarious, strategy, dodging, bounties, many types of ammo, and of course tons of satisfying explosions XD. Beautiful scenery and great details, amazing story, creative and unique characters with expressive emotions and personality, awesome and intense soundtrack, and come on what other shooter uses live ammo XD. It works completly smooth, easy controls, although I noticed the highest resolution doesn't work well and it crashes fast but it works perfectly on resolution 1280x600. I also noticed 6 achievements are broken and you can't earn them through one try but I did find out a guide on how you earn them but if you are trouble with achievements here are the broken one's: Finder's Filchers, Free The Meat, Get'em, Get'em goooooood!, Stranger Danger, Sekto Suicide. It does make me a sad that it never got enough attention for the work put into it and the Oddworld series it's self, it deserves so much more attention but it's a definite must buy but I hope it gets more attention sometime and more support for a 2nd part or sequel. :)			"

												this was one of the games i wanted SO BADLY as a kid. a couple of my friends had it for their xbox and i could never seem to get hold of a copy but when i did, oh it was magical. I never did beat it because i wasnt very good, but think the next time i sit down to play through a game in its entirety its gonna be this one. one of the best things about it is even though its the hd remake in my head it looks just like it did back then.

												Enjoyable gameplay and a compelling story. When this game was released for the orginal XBox, it didn't seem to get much publicity or attention, which is a shame. It was good to see it get some love in the form of the HD update.			"
