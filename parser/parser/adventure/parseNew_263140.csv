												First off, I just wanted to point out that - at the current time of writing this review - I am nearing the 100-review mark.Out of all my reviews, I have NEVER been as disappointed by a game's sheer wasted potential since Game of Thrones (RTS) until I stumbled upon Postmortem: One Must Die. Furthermore, this game is currently $6.99 on Steam, and I implore you all to NEVER even consider buying this UNLESS it is offered for free or in a bundle - I received this in a Bundlestars bundle and wanted to give it a try despite the endless amount of negative reviews. I try my hardest not to mention a game's price if I feel it is unnecessary, but DO NOT waste your money on this. I've clocked almost an hour playing this at the time of this review, and I've played through the game a total of 4 times - my first playthrough took about 10-20 minutes because I explored and read everything possible.The aesthetics are not bad, the character sprites and art models are decent; however, there are only a handful of characters in the game. The game takes place in a mansion fundraising party, and the background is decent. The music and ambient noises give a classy, upperclassmen vibe, and this is probably one of the better parts (the soundtrack is actually very good and probably the best part of the game). The controls are very simple, and the tutorial is super quick. There is always feedback on what you can do and when you can do it. There is no learning curve at all - you can literally finish the game in less than 5 minutes if you wish because all you have to do is press Tab, walk up to someone, and then press E to kill them. The game ends within a few minutes after selecting your target (you have a brief dialogue and overview of the epilogue). I am so utterly disappointed by this game. You are an agent of death, tasked with ending the life of one partygoer at tonight's fundraiser. Upon entering the game, you can choose to look into the political conflict and instability plaguing the city/area. When conversing with each guest, you are given a variety of dialogue options, and at the end of each conversation you will be able to ""nudge"" people into a certain direction with your arguments. BEGIN SPOILERS This REALLY interested me at first (I momentarily forgot about all of the negative reviews) - I sincerely thought I had convinced both the Oldagers (lower/middle/working-classmen) and Newagers (industrialists, upperclassmen) to settle for a compromise and decided to kill a foreigner who was interested in brutal animal testing in the name of science and potentially moving on to using cadavers (dead human bodies), whether they were obtained legally or not. After choosing her to die, you are taken to another scene (remniscent of a ""gray-area"" Purgatory), where you have a brief discussion with the victim and reflect on your choices. After this, you are given an overview of your choices, and this part REALLY annoyed me, as you can so very easily determine what the obvious opposite choices/outcomes will be. My first playthrough outcomes: Political turmoil lasted for 3 more years before settling. During this time, violence escalated because I had lightly sided with a young idealist who believed that sometimes violence was the only way to get your voice an audience. Animal disappearances ceased (since I killed the crazy scientist), and the bill for giving the public a stronger voice (especially the lower/middleclass) was successfully passed. Yay.That's it. You LITERALLY kill ONE SINGLE person, and the game is over. I was hoping for at least a few more levels, so you could truly steer the course of the nation, however, this was not the case.I tried a few more playthroughs, and really found that the differences in the outcome were so bland and predictable. Ex: In my next playthrough - Bill for equality was NOT passed, animal disappearances escalated, violence/riots stopped. Wow, that seems like the complete opposite of my first playthrough. There aren't many alternatives. END SPOILERSOverall, this is a very shallow, extremely short, and absolute waste of potential, and I am so disappointed to have experienced this. My only positive thought is the hope that this review will help save at least ONE person from wasting even 5 minutes on this game.DO NOT RECOMMEND.Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

YouTube™ Video: Analog Reviews: Postmortem: One Must Die 

			Views: 5,013		

			Yet another indie gem that has an engaging premise but is it enough to make Postmortem worth purchasing? Senior Editor Trent digs into it to find out!		

The indie scene is more prominent than ever boasting a diverse selection of games that often serve as bite sized reprieves from major triple A releases. While the indie scene isn't immune from uninspired copy and paste designs, there have been a string of recent releases that depart from traditional game design in a major way, challenging what we think of as games. One of the more overlooked releases that fits into this growing segment of games is Postmortem: One Must Die which tries to test players by forcing them to make a single decision that promises to have far reaching consequences. While major releases have tried to accomplish this same goal on a large scale, most have come up short. Does Postmortem's smaller and more focused scope deliver more satisfying results? Playing as an agent of death, it's your duty to take the life of one person from a fund raising gala in a fictitious turn of the century setting on the cusp of an industrial revolution. The nation is split with conservatives that believe in upholding tradition at the expense of progress for women and greater economic development. Meanwhile progressives are riding a wave of industrial prosperity at the expense of  their workers. Both sides have admirable qualities and some absolutely abhorrent qualities which quickly muddies the line between noble and contemptible. Unbound creations has expertly balanced the qualities of each side of the conflict to tear gamers and make who they choose to snuff out a real struggle. Your potential targets rage from an influential member of the media to a young, idealistic student. Each person leans strongly in one direction and by thoroughly exploring the dialog tree you might find that your conversations with these characters may have quite an impact on them in the future... Gameplay in Postmortem simply involves wandering around in an isometric world slathered in Victorian decor, scavenging details from news articles strewn about and talking to the patrons of the gala. Each character has a lengthy dialog tree that will allow you to acquaint yourself with them as well as current events. A wide variety of responses and questions are available and not asking questions can also have an impact on how the events play out. Dialog is generally well written but it can be a bit too purpose driven. Postmortem never creates the illusion that you are just another patron making small conversation, your pointed questions make each interaction feel like an interrogation rather than a conversation. The blatant agenda to your questions never allows the characters to show you who they are, they merely share what they perceive themselves to be.  Your interactions with the gala patrons ultimately culminate in your character deciding who should meet their end. Once your decision has been made, a series of newspaper articles show the results of your involvement at the Gala. It's not the most invigorating way to see the consequences of your actions unfold but there may be a few surprises for some players to uncover based on your actions. Also, a link to detailed player stats is viewable upon completing a play through to show how your behavior compares to other Post Mortem players. A thorough playthrough exploring all of the dialog options will take in the neighborhood of an hour and subsequent playthroughs will take less time. It doesn't take long to figure out what dialog has what impact so many players may not want to take the time to explore every possibility. The beauty of Postmortem however is that you are not required to buy it to enjoy the core experience. By purchasing the game, players are given an extra character to chat with as well as wallpapers, concept art and some behind the scenes development materials.  Like its triple A predecessors, Postmortem falls short of delivering a wholly satisfying choice based narrative. That is not to say that it isn't a worthwhile experience however, it's morally ambiguous world and intelligent and fresh setting remain engaging and some of the conclusions are engaging and surprising. It's brevity makes it easy to pick up sporadically and enjoy. I for one hope that Postmortem is simply an amuse-bouche, tantalizing our pallets for something a bit larger and scope and more accomplished in execution from Unbound Creations.			"

												If this is the extended cut, I have a hard time visualizing what the length of the initial release was.  For all of the promise the premise of investigating several characters and picking one to die carried, the execution including perhaps 6 rooms and less than 10 characters left me feeling as if there was much more possibility to be played with and explored than is offered here.It held my attention while I played it, and I was very interested to see how my decisions might influence the outcome of the game, but ultimately I don't feel as if I got enough play time out of the title for it to have been worth the dollar value I paid for it.

												This is a nifty adventure game for those that like to read. Unfortunately it can be very short or as long as you want it to be, this is because there is essentially one ""map"" and literally you only get to kill one person.The concept behind it all is that you talk to everyone and pick the choices you want. Those choices will then affect the ending you gain. Essentially you then play through again and again, each time picking different choices and the person you ""claim""Overall, there should be more to this game as I was hoping there would be something after the first level but literally the game can last 2 minutes (if you randomly pick someone and don't care about the choices or how they affect the story) or hours long if you decide to explore and go deeper trying to find every combination and choice			"

												Not worth the price IMO. There is only one ""act"" (one level of the game to play through) which took me 30 minutes when I spoke to every person in the room and went into a couple of side rooms. Each conversation with each NPC can become a very long, very boring dialogue you cannot get out of until you go through the whole thing. Conversations would have been more interesting if they were much shorter and not so useless. I typically learned everything I wanted to know early on in each conversation. There is nothing in the game to prevent you from choosing a random target to kill, so you can easily pay $7.00 for less than one minute of gameplay. Overall, this game was an interesting concept which was stuffed with uninteresting monologues and only one act. Not worth the money paid at all.			"

												Potentially a good game, but possibly one of the shortest I have ever played with little to no replay value what so ever. It seems like a fantastic 'first level' but for an extended cut/release? I was left dissapointed. The universe drew me in but the game left me wanting more, It was like watching a film and just as the protaganist is introduced the credits roll. Save your money on this one in hopes for a more final release but keep your eye out.			"

												The country is at war, and the choice you make can change the fate of an entire Nation…. or, you know. Not.In this extremely, extremely, super duper extra short game that is definitely NOT worth the full price you play an angel of Death, or Reaper if you will, sent into a fundraising Gala to reap the soul of one person. Who you reap is up to you: You must move around the only map this game has in existence, talk to people, discover secrets, and eventually choose one person to die. That, or you can go in, pick the first one you talk to, and you’ll be done with the game in under 5 minutes.While the story it’s trying to tell about the nation is great (the socio-political talk and opinions placed into the characters speech and the history of the place is quite deep), and while the idea that who you choose to take in the end might affect the fate of the Nation is pretty darn awesome, the game falls on its face once you’ve played through it once.There’s no new maps, only the fundraising gala, to replay over, and over, and over. And there’s not even a reason to do that. The choice of who you kill in the end is not as important as they make it sound  (it does affect the end, but it doesn't -feel- as important); and not even the reactions of those you kill in the very end are different: they always react the exact same way and say the exact same thing.And this was the extended cut...In all, the game had a great idea, but fell short on the execution. I would only advise getting it if it’s under a dollar (or even less), free, or perhaps bundled. Otherwise, it’s really not worth the money as you’ll only be playing it once and it’ll take less than an hour to get through it fully. Just watch a Let’s Play of it.			"

												Well...Like the reviews say, it is a short one.Definitely not worth the full price, but on a 75% sale for 1,25 euros, I don't really regret getting it.Basically you are one of the many reapers, sent to an event to collect a soul.You're introduced to the case by a secretary, who you can't flirt more than say: ""Tell me about you""She then asks whether you'd like to be seen as a male or female by the mortals, but I'm not really sure if it makes any difference.The guests are the same and the conversation may end up in the same way despite your dialogue choices.It feels kind of clumsy when you play it again and pick different choices, only to see them answer the same way as they did during last time.You CAN just go up to someone and kill them there, but the purpose is to learn about the guests, and then make a choice on who you will collect.The annoying thing is that if you want to see the results in the same situation, only with a different person dead, you have to do everything again in the same way.Talk to same people, pick the same dialogue options, etc. etc.Also, I've only played it 2 times, and both times, the person you kill seems to talk the same way, even if it is a different person...I think that one thing that could've made this far better would have been options to better interact with people, and maybe add a few things that switch by random each time you play.Ultimately, the controls feel a tad bit clumsy, and the game does seem a bit laggy time to time.That may be just my own PC, though.But, in the end, I can not recommend the game for the full price.For 1,25euros though, sure, it gave me some amusement. This could work on a phone, be a reaper and kill a person each time you go take a♥♥♥♥♥♥But when at computer, nah, I don't think I'll end up playing this that often.			"

												The game held great potential and got me very exited to see how the player, Death, could affect the lives of others by choosing one person to die and create such massive change in history. Each character had a story to them and influence that really made you question who you should kill. They all had their pros and cons as characters go, but they were overall interesting, making it hard to kill any of them.However, the biggest drawback, even at such a low price, I don't think it was worth the brief gameplay available. It felt more like a demo than an extended cut as the majority of the game takes place within one house.As Death, you would think you'd have more abilities than inflicting a fatal heart attack on someone, but Death remain rather plain throughout the whole thing.Though there are options to enter rooms you're forbidden from entering, they really seem to offer little to nothing in the game besides the risk of getting caught.Overall, it's a great way to kill some time on your first try, but afterward it just feels like a great effort that was abandoned.

												Game thrusts you unceremonially into a dinner party and tells you to kill one of the six guests you can speak to. You can read a few newspaper clippings strewn about and go into very superficial conversations with the guests, mainly concerened with a conservative/liberal conflict in their imaginary country. Conversations are often ended abruptly and guests would stop speaking to you afterwards, leaving you with very little to go on. Once you've made a choice, an epilogue is shown, presenting the results of your choice and any influences you may have had on the guests due to dialogue options.Overall, it feels incomplete and the story and characters are uninteresting and the resolution is very anticlimactic. Seeing one resolution is enough as it gives you a fair idea of what would've happened if you had done things differently. Game is short, took me a bit over an hour and I did go into all dialogue options and actions available.For a game that handles choices and their consequences better, check The Novelist.			"

October 18th, 1897The country is in turmoil; citizens confused and concerned about its future, rioting, terrorizing, and uncertain of who is really on their side. Amid the chaos, a charity event is being held gathering a group of people from all walks of life and world views. One of them is going to die, and you are going to decide who.Postmortem places you in the role of death, harbinger of destruction and reaper of souls, with the soul task of attending a gala and choosing who's time has come. You aren't told why you have to kill someone or what reason they may have for deserving to die, but there isn't time for you to inquire as the decision is ultimately on your head regardless.In a medium that so often features exorbitant amounts of murdering, rarely with even a slight hint as to its moral or physical impact, it's unusual and maybe even a little unnerving to have such an emphasis placed on taking a single life. Part of that is the characters you meet aren't the usual diabolical warlord or incarnation of evil we are so often put up against; they're just people, flawed but likable individuals who you get to know rather personally over the course of your brief exchanges. It's fair to say that Postmortem isn't much of a game, it's a character study aimed to bring your biases and personal feelings to the surface, which ultimately is what will hold the most influence on your inevitable choice.Feminism, radical industrialism, conflicts of interest between the rich and the poor, and complex political struggles all come into play as you mingle with guests and try to get at their aspirations and motives as well as putting your (occasionally unwanted) word in. All of these play a role in the outcome, which often goes quite unaccording to plan with threads intertwining and actions having unforeseen consequences. It's a fascinating tangle of subplots that works with subject matter not traditionally seen in games, that aside from the sometimes bizarrely candid way it's presented, is handled smartly and intelligently to form a plot that despite typically having no interest in politics I was completely absorbed in.If there is anything I have to fault Postmortem for, it's that for what you are paying you aren't getting much more than you can find for free on the developers website. While the art is improved and some content added, this is still a 1-2 hour game with only marginal replay value if you want to quickly run through the alternate endings, that feels a tad costly all things considered.If you can forgive the price, Postmorten is an engrossing and quite original reversal of the classic murder mystery. The writing subverts many of the usual drab political terminology, leaving an easily ingested script that's all the same requires a good bit of thought do to its heavy nature and implications on your actions. If your adverse to reading I'll advise you to turn the other way, but those intrigued by the concept would do well to check it out as what you'll find is a developed and intriguing tale that offers some food for thought as you have tea and biscuits with your lovely secretary.

												Let me start by saying I actually do recommend you to play this game. It's execution and premise are pretty damn great. However, it remains an underdeveloped idea that is not worth five Euros in my opinion. The idea of saving, ruining or keeping the status quo of a country torn by two opposing sides of an industrial revolution is a great idea, but the game offers but one scenario. One that can be replayed a lot of times, but still, it's but one scenario in what could have been a very deep and amazing political simulator.On their site, you can get the game for free, or pay what you want. I like supporting Indie developers, but the Steam price is way too steep. So I'd suggest getting this from their site and paying around 1,50, which I feel is a fair price for a nicely executed idea that needs quite a bit more depth to justify paying more. "

												You play as a reaper, you must pick one person to die from those attending. This is a very short 'game', you can finish it within about 10 seconds or so if you just select a person at random to kill and choose not to influence any of the people with your opinions. I spent just under an hour reading everything and talking to everyone, and went back through the game to alter a couple of choices to confirm outcome.The developers have released this as a DRM free game on their website in its non 'extended' version - and unfortunately should have stayed as such. It has potential to be a sort of 'cluedo played as death' game; if it was expanded throughout several scenarios. As it stands however it's just too short and simplistic to be considered a full game.			"

												You are death.. This is your first job. There is a party and one of the people must die. Within party there are key memebers of a a civil war. If you do enough research and influence them in a certain way and kill the right person at right time. You can prevent this war claims more life then you can ever do. Great concept, nice matchin sound/music, decent graphic and quick 15 minute max investigation each try you get it. All and all it's just not too badly done. But you only get 1 case in this game thus this game feels imcomplete and sloppy since it's just too short. Even you choose the good ending. It still feels very very unsatisfactory.4/10. Avoid this game since it doesn't bring you much fun. Maybe I will change my recommendation if the developer do more developing make it a 10-20 different case game with more twists.(it will probably not happen).			"

												You are the Grim Reaper himself/herself.You have one task - visit charity Gala and take one life. You can just kill random person and finish game in less than 5 minutes. Or you can spend 1h to have conversation with everybody and explore all rooms but game area is really small.Dialogues are well made and you can have huge impact on decisions made by each person.What a coincidence - every single character you will met in that house will have huge impact on future history of whole fictional nation. So whatever you do - it will have impact on following events.Idea is great. Unfortunatelly i can't say the same about game quality. It's not about graphics or music (which is great btw). This kind of game should have possess great replay value - you can choose different dialogue options and kill different character after all. Not in thas case. First playthrough took me 1 hour. Second one took me 10 minutes. And after 2 endings i knew all the patterns. I don't think this game can suprise me anymore.Can I recomment it - yes. Not in a full price of course as game content is really small. But in discount or as a part of a bundle - why not?			"

You can't open all dialogue options on a single play through though, which is good, so I ended backing myself in to a couple corners. In the end, when I didn't follow my own advice -  I killed the killer instead of trying to influence him - I realized that the game was a little more clever than I gave it credit for. My choice didn't end violence, it actually added to it. A lesson about how we should deal with people, huh? Good game. I do wish there were more missions though. "

												It's difficult for me to write a negative review of this game because it tries very hard to be the kind of game that I enjoy: interesting and original. The following are reasons why this game fell short of that mark.1. Very poor sprite animations. Distractingly hideous.2. An abundance of grammatical and spelling errors. 3. Meaningless conversation choices.4. Lazy variation of endings, despite being the selling point of this game.A few good surprises were had though.1. The ending (nothing more than a collection of news clippings) is altered by more than your choice of victim. Your conversations with the dinner guests can convince them to do certain things which affect the ending.2. The history of the world is well realized.3. No hand holding. You are thrown into the world and left to experiment. The game doesn't make it particularly obvious how to get the ending you want. Killing the guy you dislike the most might actually result in a bigger ""villain"" rising to power. Going to places you're not supposed to might get you in trouble.4. You're free to make tough moral decisions. All of the characters are likable and hatable in the same breath. The game doesn't bludgeon you with a preachy message, nor does it bore you with a simple tale of good guy vs. bad guy.At its total, this game would look great on the drawing board. There are many areas of this game that make the player excited with the possibilities, but it doesn't feel like a completed game. As a free flash game (or demo) this game would be acceptable, but at 7 dollars I can't recommend this to anyone, even the most hardcore of text-based fans.			"

												This is a strange title, because at times it's almost more of a detective/choose-your-own-adventure book than a game. Yes, you play it, but the majority of that game play involves walking around, reading notes and papers, making decisions, referring to your journal, and talking to people.In fact, I should point out that you'll be doing a LOT of talking. If you normally dislike lots of dialogue (which is mostly silent, so no voice actors beyond a word or two every so often) then don't get this game. Fortunately, you don't have to remember every little detail as vitally important information is automatically written down in your journal.The story is you're a novice reaper (okay, get ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" out of your system before you continue reading) on your first assignment. You're told that ONE person must die at the gala you're attending. Admittedly, it's a very small gala, since there's only about six people there.What happens next is you read various notes and newspapers (and even open some safes and unlock doors, if you manage to get the right keys) and talk to each of the six individuals there. Every single person will have varying views on the shakey political situation going on and have something to say -- both bad and good -- about other people there.None of the attendees are ""innocent"" in that each one has their own faults. One man is very sexist and thinks women shouldn't enter the workforce, while at the same time wants more rights for male workers. Likewise, one woman has some very feminist views (as in equality, not male bashing), but is extremely anti-immigrant and wants ""those people"" out of her country.  There's also poor vs rich issues and arguments about whether violence means are justified to change current conditions.In other words, everything discussed in the game is a reflection of real life, both past and present. What's interesting about that is you have the chance to agree with them and further encourage their current point of view or argue a counterpoint, sometimes changing their mind.Once you make your decision about who to kill, you'll see the reports detailing the aftermath. All of your actions -- who you decided to kill and what you discussed with the survivors -- play a role in shaping the future social and political climate.There are some negative points, however. The game uses a somewhat primitive sprite-based 2D isometric graphical style, which for some reason or another, randomly experiences slowdown while walking. The resolutions offered are also limited. There's virtually no mouse support other than clicking on menu buttons, so almost everything is controlled via the keyboard. That wouldn't be so bad if the controls didn't feel clunky. There are numerous grammar and spelling issues in the dialogue. The font used is also small and the letters appear squished together, which makes reading sometimes a chore. That's a huge black mark against the game considering you'll spend more time reading than not. I will admit that I played this on a laptop with a screen resolution of 1366x768, so the font may be easier to read with larger screens and higher resolutions.As far as I know, there's no way to save your game. Granted, the game isn't terribly long, but if you want to see all the outcomes, you'll have to talk to everyone each time you play and some dialogue trees can be very long. So while you could immediately go and kill different people right from the start, you wouldn't have affected anything (other than murdering someone) without talking to everyone first. Post Mortem: One Must Die (Extended Cut) is  currently $6.99 USD on Steam or offered at varying prices on the developer's website. The regular version (which lacks numerous extras, including a new character) is also available for FREE by the developer at http://postmortemgame.com/download/ "

I grabbed it through Humble Bundle and probaby would have been disappointed if I had purchased for full price. Expect about 20 minutes the first time around with maybe one or two more to see what other dialogue and death options would have done.			"

Short ReviewTasked that one must die, you investigate attendees of a gala to pick and kill one person. Times are tough, rife with political turmoil resulting from the events of the Baker's Revolt, 5-Point Plan and the TFF. Who you choose to die will have a profound affect on society. The game is very interesting, allowing you to play God and pick whoever displeases you (politically, socially, morally or personally) to die. You feel this sense of power when you hear of all of the troubles that the attendees are facing knowing that you can easily fix it.....seemingly. Yet, this very short game loses its replayability once you discover the major effects from your choice. ScoreFine- 6/10			"

												This game is very interesting. Not really my thing yet I couldn't help but play it through. A bit short though. I do hope the developers have/will make more games like this with more scenarios and out comes. Despite the shortness of the game there is a bit of replayability to find different outcomes within the game. However it is still short and since it is literally the same story with  you just picking a few different options it may get boring. None the less I found this game to be intriguing and thought provoking. Definitely worth the 1+ hour of time.			"

												This game is about being DEATH and killing someone. You choose who exactly among those who are in the area you are able to explore. You can walk around, talk with people and then stop time at any moment, walk to someone and press a key to kill that character. This game is about choices and consequences. Every choice you make by not only killing someone, but just talking to people and convincing them to do something (or not) will make a difference.So what is GOOD about this game? Incredibly developed backstory and connection between what you do and what you get as a result of your action. Graphics are nice and stylish, this can be told about the sound as well.What's BAD about this game? Well, you have to read A LOT. Creators really tried to tell us as much about a situation as possible, so there are lots of text sources explaining what's going on around the main character. So if you don't mind reading, it isn't really bad. What's really bad is the fact that this game is short. It's long enough to show it's gameplay concept fully and make you interested about it, but too short to fulfill your desire to experience more interesting situations.Overall, I like it. While it's short, it was very entertaining for me, and I like to read, Since I have mostly positive impressions on it, I can't do anything else but recommend it.			"

												I love this game. Its branching conversations remind me of the ones in games like Planescape: Torment, Deus Ex, The Walking Dead, and others like it--there's no ""good"" or ""evil"", just interesting decisions that leave me pondering my choices for long swaths of time.The setting is great; it's timeless in its own way, as it tackles issues of modernization vs. tradition that have confronted societies throughout history. The author claims on his website that his career has nothing to do with his Masters degree in Comparative Ethnic Conflict, but it's clear to see its influence here. A delight for fans of history, moral ambiguity, and great characterization.About the only thing I can knock this game for is its incessant pounding of ""Canon in D"" into my skull, but that can easily be switched off by setting the music volume to 0.

												Good game, I sure had a nice time playing it, not a very lengthy one though. One of the shortest games I've ever played: it will take you no more than an hour and a half to explore ALL the possible options and endings. No exaggeration. I have to admit it does approach an interesting topic, but it's very politicized. If you are not a big fan of social/economic matters or simply believe everything has its place and there's no place for ""serious"" discussions in games, then this game is definitely not for you. Also, you should have something in mind: you will read A LOT (95% of the game); so, no need to mention that if you are not exactly a ""reader"" you should forget about it as well.There is no object interaction, no enemies, no rewards... in short: no challenge whatsoever.  It's all about gathering information(reading, reading, reading...), making decisions about what to say or not to say, and realizing in the end that things won't change as much as you expected.So, with not so many encouraging things said, ""WHY FOR GOD'S SAKE SHOULD I STILL BUY THIS DEMO GAME?""Because it is fun and comes in a cheap bundle together with other fun games. ;]Otherwise just DON'T!

SummaryThis game is laughingly short, with ludicrous impact of short dialogue. Seriously, after talking to people for 10 minutes, you're changing the whole country significantly. Pros1. Aesthetics are decent. 2. Ambient sounds are decent too. 3. It's pretty cheap, although a lot of free games are much more complex than this. Cons1. A very simplistic story with watered-down problems and no complex issues. Conflict between Newagers and Oldagers is like taken out of a very cheap anime.2. Effects of your actions are too predictable. Nothing will surprise you. 3. Kill one person and this is it. Game over. Wanted a complex story? Move along. In the end, I cannot recommend this game at all. Don't waste your money and time.			"

												This game was really interesting, if you can take the time to read. It acts as one of those ""choose your destiny"" types, but your actually choosing the destiny of this country Galia or however you spell it. Every person you encounter effects the story in some way or another, and also, what you choose to say to each person effects the outcome also. I love telltale games, Shenmue, indigo prophecy, heavy rain, games of that nature. So if your like me, then most likely you will love this game too. At first I got kind of irritated at the length of dialogue, but then it I realized it became harder and harder to ""pick my victim"". It also became more and more apparent that what I was saying to these people, and what they were saying to me, was actually the hints and clues needed to determine which character threatens this countries stability the most. You will encounter bigots, sheep, and possibly a serial killer... But every character you meet, if you choose to meet them all, will play an impact on how the game ""ends"". Personally.. I loved it.. For a ""first run""... I see the overwhelming potential. Give the gamer multiple ""maps or scenarios"" with different back stories.... Id accept 15-20 dollars for 4-5 scenarios just like a Telltale game. This game really sparks my interests, dialogue, moral choices, and the ability to effect the outcome of a story HUGE way. Like I said, for a first run, not bad… 8/10.  "

												Since I’m really into history and politics, this little game immediately caught my attention. Postmortem’s basic premise surrounding the player’s tampering with a nation’s fate in times of socio-economic struggle by means of a well-educated decision was just too tempting.In my opinion, the small developer’s team has executed this promising concept well enough to provide half an hour or so of entertainment. Beware though: this is really much more of a visual novel than a “classic” game. There is little in terms of gameplay or replayability. If you’re absolutely certain you won’t enjoy reading about a multi-layered conflict in a fictional (I guess – I for once found it extremely irritating that the names of real places such as Galicia or Lorraine are used) country, which draws heavily from contemporary and historical issues from the real world, don’t bother with Postmortem.In the end, the outcome is a little on the shallow side an, but I can neither say that I am disappointed nor hat I have expected more. Interestingly, the result of my first and so far only playthrough differs in key aspects from both outcomes mentioned in DjSF’s well-written review (which I find enlightening despite not agreeing with his verdict).But is Portmortem worth the price of 5€ (at least in Europe)? In retrospect, I’d probably wait for a sale tbh.p.s.The one thing I don’t get is why this game is rejected by the majority of reviewers for what it is, while titles that are very similar in concept like The Stanley Parable (interesting idea, nice execution, negligible gameplay, very short, limited entertainment) are showered with praise. Personally, Postmortem has probably given me more enjoyment and was, on top of that, considerably less expensive than the latter.			"

												Such a disappointment! The clunky controls and sub-par graphics could have been ameliorated by a compelling narrative or engaging game-play, but ""Postmortem"" lacked both. The characters were unlikable, the setting was incongruous and anachronistic, and the narrative (such as it was) felt like something a high-school student would have thrown together after half-ignoring a lecture on the prelude to the First World War. The creators clearly assumed that only the most superficial of details from the late 1800s/early 1900s would have differed from the present, and it makes the game feel...childish. But the game's greatest failing lies in the fact that, for a game that is 99% text and reading, there seems to have been NO editing or proofreading done! Sentences end mid-statement, words are missing from many sentences, misspellings abound, and the grammar and syntax are often TERRIBLE. The premise offered so much promise, but the execution was sorely lacking.			"

												Postmortem: OMD is a game with an interesting mechanic which can be played using various graphics options (if I recall correctly). The permanent markdown to $2.99 is probably justified.This is not an action game. A playthrough does not last a long time. However, many plays will be required if you're interested enough in the game's premise to try different tactics with different characters.Considering the price and what the developer put into the game to make it the game it is, I'll recommend this... but if it's on sale it's a firmer recommendation than otherwise.

												There is a bloody conflict between Newagers, who care little for history and culture, and Oldagers, who wish to remain set in the traditional ways. You are Death, and are assigned to a fundraising party held to benefit (although the term is applied loosely) a school that was recently vandalized. Guests come from all walks of life, and have their own political beliefs and emotional attachments. Everyone there plays a role in the hostilities, and it is your job to select one who must die -- thus sending events hurtling in a particular direction.You could simply approach anyone, tap them on the shoulder, and that's that. However, the real meat of this game is to investigate each room, ask many questions about events and each attendee, and maybe even sneak a peek at some hidden items. At the end, take a look at your journal and select the one who will have the greatest impact (for better or for worse). Once the deed is done, a series of news articles will pop up and show you the fruits of your labour. You'll also have a brief, albeit rather pointless, scene with your target. After this, you can compare your choices to others, much like in the Telltale adventure games.Okay, let's get the bad out of the way first.1) The resolution options are limited.2) There's a distracting amount of screen tearing.3) The controls are fiddly.4) There seems to be an average of one spelling mistake every sentence.5) Once you've exhausted the 20 or so dialogue options for every character, and there aren't many of them, the game essentially ends. Well, unless you want to stand around and listen to the snippets of classical music that make up Postmortem's soundtrack.6) The political beliefs are fairly simplistic (e.g. foreigners are bad, women don't deserve rights, capitalism is awesome, etc.) and aren't as nuanced, or blended as I'd like.So what's good about it?1) There aren't many games like this. A locked room... er, make that a locked apartment mystery, with no real right or wrong answer.2) A hefty amount of backstory and information links the characters together, be it psychologically, socially, emotionally, etc. A fair amount of thought went into all this.3) It doesn't overstay its welcome. As I mention in Neg.6, there isn't much to do after talking to the people, so you can make your decision rather quickly -- perhaps in 45-60 minutes should you examine every nook and cranny, and draw out every last line of dialogue.I do wish there had been a few more locations. I read a review mentioning attending a protest, maybe also visiting the host's factory, and so forth. Then again, I believe this would only expose some weaknesses in the game's foundation. Nonetheless, with more and/or stronger writers (and an editor!), I think this could work, and work well.Is Postmortem a great game? No, but it's definitely not a bad one. It has a strong premise, and good parts, but is brought down by its linearity and lack of polish. Nonetheless, it can be found on sale often, and at a steep discount, it's an experience I would recommend. Just know what you're getting into first.			"

												An incredibly well put-together game, with refreshing dialogue, music, graphics, and mystery. The story is very fleshed out and there is a lot of information packed into such a tiny game. Many people complain about the length; some even saying it took them 20 minutes to beat. Well if it took you 20 minutes you're FAR from experiencing the full game. I exhausted almost all dialogue options, and searched everything around the house, made my decision thoughtfully on who to kill, and it took me a little under 2 hours. I don't believe game length matters as long as it was the CORRECT length. Now, while Postmortem DID end a bit early, the length was fairly well established and the game ended when it should have, more or less. The characters have rich and thought-out stories and have realistic responses and what you say seems to matter. I would've liked more options and more people, though as far as a dialogue-driven game goes, Postmortem does what it sets out to do very well. Postmortem has incredible potential and I hope to see a sequel in the near future. I wouldn't be upset if they released DLC (fairly priced, of course) which consisted of other houses and events with the same premise: just more scenarios. It was very enjoyable to play through and listen to each character's story and that's saying a lot because I don't usually enjoy games like this, and lately my attention span has been getting shorter and shorter, so it's rare a game captures my attention for this long nowadays. But alas, Postmortem did, and for good reason, it's a great game and if you take your time playing through it and actually make a thoughtful decision, there can be a good amount of impact and intensity to it which makes it a good experience overall. I recommend buying this game if you like murder mysteries (even though it's somewhat backwards since you're the one doing the killing), dialogue and story-driven games, rich characters, charming graphics and soundtrack, and an engaging story overall. I would also recommend waiting until it goes on sale if you're worried about the length of it, as $6.99 is a bit much for a 2 hour game for some people.7/10			"

												A great example of a short, focused game concentrating on freedom of choice, sociopolitical questions and narrative, worth playing several times. Graphics are simple and attractive. I really enjoyed it, both for its own sake and as a fascinating indie experiment in game design, world building and storytelling.My reservation is some grammatical errors and poor word choices, which are especially intrusive in a dialogue based game  with some highly educated characters. It's a great game, but all that would be needed to correct this flaw someone to give a SPAG and character voice check before publishing or on a future update. It's also a bit short for its full Steam price, but YMMV.For all that, I'm a fan.			"

												Totally not worth it, the game tries to build up the atmosphere with poorly written walls of text, just to abruptly end.

I recommend Dysfunctional Systems: Managing Chaos any day over this. If you want the political atmosphere, go for Papers, Please!			"

												Very well-written game. Immediate impression: Very short, technically one level, about 2 hours unless you rush in and do whatever with little regard for writing; no action, just choices; rather interesting characters and a cool concept.Yes, I did not stutter-- this game is super short. You're in a mansion and you're talking to about 7 people about this and that, and you choose one person to die. That's really it. Except there's a good amount of reading involved. So if you hate reading and character development, then steer clear. Otherwise, welcome to literacy!The developers did a great job of making the conversations... conversational. Like many RPGs of our time, the tendency is to give the player only a few options. In Postmortem's case, the only times I felt limited were when I needed to make a solid choice on a morality issue. Yes, you're death, but you yourself are playing. And what kind of topics are discussed in Postmortem? Politics and morality. Ah yes. They cleverly change the official titles of the left and right wing into something more general, but all the ideals are there. Between talking to the characters, we're given insight into several 'current issues', such as xenophobia, feminism, big corporate buyouts, and apparently a bit of gay rights (I somehow got that involved in the end game).I liken the moral choices to that of the Walking Dead game by Telltale. A lot of times, you the player must draw from your own perspective and answer as you would, if you were in that same situation. Unless of course you're roleplaying as something specific. No matter how you play the game, you get to see how your choice affects that world, as well as what little actions you've done while playing (did you gossip about someone or snoop a little, for example).These games are always refreshing to play occasionally. And should you feel like spending a bit of time with a choose-your-own adventure that makes you question your own political/moral standpoint, Postmortem will be a great game for you. Simple and easy to play, but sometimes tricky in the choices you make.For the record, I played as close to middle-of-the-road as possible, and the ending actually kind of reflected that. Awesome~			"

												This is a really interesting bit of player choice combined with some terrific world buildilng. You'll probably want to play it a few times to see how your decisions and conversations effect it's ending. You basically walk around a party and talk to people, influencing their mindset with your responses. When you're done talking to everyone, you select one person to die (as you are Death). From there, you see how your choices rippled throughout the country.Overall, while a little slight, it's a good building block for it's developer - I'd like to see where he goes from here.			"

												In a strange way it reminded me of Star Ocean 2.This game sure has a lot of ways to finish it, and I don't mean just the ending. Each and every single decision affects the entire outcome, that online thing that you check out after you're done killing someone. While I might not have talked to everyone in all the dialogue combinations possible, I found it to be somewhat entertaining, I mean c'mon, you're literally the Grim Reaper. But even though it did provide me with some entrertainment, I won't be endorsing it to anyone any time soon.The single scenario just doesn't work for me, nor does that grinding, in a sense. Even with all the possibilities, it is mostly a text-based game, one which you'll tire of sooner rather than later.All the reading does make the game rather grim...			"

												Postmortem one must die is first of all not related to the adventure game with the name of postmortem don't be fooled.In this game you're the representation of death, can choose male or female skin and sent to a gala party in order to claim one life, any life, there's a total of 6 corpse candidates and each have a lot of story behind them, can even influence them to pursue differnet paths on their careers/ideologies.There's only 2 soundtracks in the game, both very basic and quite repetitive, the graphics look decent with a isometric camera and nice looking character portraits.The drawback is the ending is basically the same no matter who you kill and how do you influence others, with minimum differences according to your dialogue choices, also i can't believe they didn't pay attention to the detail than two of the characters have conversations about female rights points of views yet the dialogue doesn't change at all if you're a female version of death.Game is not worth the 7$ by any way or form, can ""beat"" the game in 3 minutes if you just go to someone and kill anyone, or in 15 if you spend the time to learn everything about everyone and the lore, but since the ending is basically the same, trust me i tried several times with different dialogue options you will get bored quite rapidly, wait for 1$ or less sale or a bundle.

Win in my bookThe characters are interesting, I had to really think on who I wanted to killThe game has a good ""lore"" if you willCons: Needs more contentAfter the first or so kills it wasn't that satisfying((((Spoiler Alert!))))With that being said the kills didn't really have different outcomesEach NPC's personality seemed to fade away when you killed them (Note: You get to talk to their ""ghost"" after you kill them)This is a pet peeve of mine but the language of the NPCs was very modern for something based in the 19th Century.With all things considered what this game really needs is a continuation, for example a new ""chapter"" that goes into another time and place.

												Interesting idea & concept but doesn't really make a good game it would have worked better as a visual novel. Presentation is a bit cheap and gameplay is very short (less than 2hours). Full price isn't that great value for money if it is discounted might be worth a buy otherwise leave it			"

												I admit that I will have to agree with some other reviewers here. It had an interesting idea and concept, the character art is very nice, and it did spark my interest, because hey, this is the kind of game I'd love to play!But sadly enough it fell rather flat. After killing one person, you're done, and that's nothing that takes a long time. Trying to play it again gets repetitive, there's absolutely nothing new to do and whoever you kill you still get the exact same ending.			"

												An incredibly well put-together game, with refreshing dialogue, music, graphics, and mystery. The story is very fleshed out and there is a lot of information packed into such a tiny game. Many people complain about the length; some even saying it took them 20 minutes to beat. Well if it took you 20 minutes you're FAR from experiencing the full game. I exhausted almost all dialogue options, and searched everything around the house, made my decision thoughtfully on who to kill, and it took me a little under 2 hours. I don't believe game length matters as long as it was the CORRECT length. Now, while Postmortem DID end a bit early, the length was fairly well established and the game ended when it should have, more or less. The characters have rich and thought-out stories and have realistic responses and what you say seems to matter. I would've liked more options and more people, though as far as a dialogue-driven game goes, Postmortem does what it sets out to do very well. Postmortem has incredible potential and I hope to see a sequel in the near future. I wouldn't be upset if they released DLC (fairly priced, of course) which consisted of other houses and events with the same premise: just more scenarios. It was very enjoyable to play through and listen to each character's story and that's saying a lot because I don't usually enjoy games like this, and lately my attention span has been getting shorter and shorter, so it's rare a game captures my attention for this long nowadays. But alas, Postmortem did, and for good reason, it's a great game and if you take your time playing through it and actually make a thoughtful decision, there can be a good amount of impact and intensity to it which makes it a good experience overall. I recommend buying this game if you like murder mysteries (even though it's somewhat backwards since you're the one doing the killing), dialogue and story-driven games, rich characters, charming graphics and soundtrack, and an engaging story overall. I would also recommend waiting until it goes on sale if you're worried about the length of it, as $6.99 is a bit much for a 2 hour game for some people.7/10			"

												A short, simple game that should entertain you for a few hours. It doesn't claim to be more than that and it doesn't pretend to be more than that. It's all a game of it's type needs to be and it delivers. It doesn't have bugs, doesn't crash, doesn't try sell you other crap, and it's fun to play. Perhaps this would be unjustified if it was expensive but it's dirt cheap, so if you're looking to expand your indie collection and kill a few hours in the process, this ain't a bad choice.			"

												Duration of this game is not worth the cash.  If this game was less than $.79, I may advise getting it; however, at this current form, don't get it.			"

												Meh. Normally I absolutely love games like this,but I found this extremely text heavy on a subject that basically didn't interest me in the slightest. Like you would greet someone and have to filter through 10 walls of text. I basically gave up and killed someone to end the boredom. ;__;			"

												I really love the game. It's like an RPG in the way you have dialogue choices. There is almost nothing else but talking but...I dig it.Basically, the game is you are Death (one of, not the) and you are assigned to go and take a life at a party. You are assured that it does not matter who you kill but you can talk to them and rind more about each person and the situation they are in, as well as the world. You can base your decisions off that or just pick at random. What they didn't tell you is that your conversations can influence what the survivors do afterwards.As a result your actions DO have consequences. After you could make the situation in the world worse or improve it based on what you do and who you kill. You get a little wrap up on your impact after you finish your mission in the form of newspaper headlines.The game does not take long to play so you can try out different things and see the results. I believe this to be a really neat idea. The game is dirt cheap and it offers an interesting idea. It may not hold your attention for long, but I think it's worth playing.			"

												This game had a lot of potential, but ends up having a terrible case of tell-don't-show, with long pages of dense text that aren't particularly interesting. Postermortem is also incredibly short, even after multiple playthroughs, and with no investment in the characters or story there's just nothing to recommend it.			"
