												This is quite a good game, granted it is old school, real old school. I will caution if you want to play this and start out the Wizardry Trilogy...patience is something you must have! Either that be from making characters that can survive the first parts of the game(even well into the end of the game...) or constant reloading cause you don't want anyone to die from a fight(and thus lose 1 point of Vitality), which is a constant danger, Even with a little bad luck you are in a frustration.With all that aside, I will say never has a game given it a real sense of victory for gaining a level or beating a group of foes...or even beating that game! Frankly you'll need the guide provided to make any regular progress, otherwise you'll lost for a long time. So if you want a real old challenge...this is it! Let this be the start of a real adventure!			"

												This is a great game from the olden days where a game wasn't afraid to kill your characters in the first battle.  Arm yourself with the included manual and hint book (and don't forget to arm your characters while you're at it...they enjoy walking into dungeons without donning their armor or weilding their weapons).  sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.Despite the lack of modern graphics and sound, if you give it a chance, you'll really enjoy it and you can carry your band of characters from Wizardry 6 all the way through 8.  Unlike other RPG's you'll feel a sense of accomplishment because you helped create these characters and develop their own storyline rather than letting the game decide it for you.			"

												Extremely dated, and the dice rolls can fail horribly. You stand a good chance of your party being horribly ill-suited for what you encounter.Wait, I'm talking about my friday D&D sessions.Seriously, though, that's basically what this is. Old-school pen-and-paper RPG style dungeon crawl. I've not played much, I must admit, but what I have played has made me want to play more.I really like the character creation system (well, save the limited and ugly portraits). It's streamlined in all the right places, but leaves options open where it needs them.I haven't even read the manual yet, and I'm having fun! (That was a hard thing to do with games back in the day)			"

												Ah, Wizardry 6. Or, as I like to call it, Locked Doors: The Game. Maybe it's just me, but the doors in this game seem a little hard to open. Having to save before every door is a given; having to reload a save because every door is made of titanium shouldn't be. When you finally pry the door open, you'll be treated to old school monsters like bats and rats that will dodge your every blow as they lay in gentle slumber. No worries, however, for if things get too hairy for you in the depths of this 1990s castle, your characters have the option to run away; which was the default operation of graybeard D&D players who cut their teeth on the 1st edition of the pen-and-paper game. Unbeknownst to you, however, is while you spent thirty rounds swinging in futility at sleeping enemies before they awoke to tear your hide apart, you were set upon by other enemies who ambush you as you run away. Whatevs, you think, I'll just run from them also. Well, when these monsters come to gangbang a party of inadequately-statted paper tigers, they come in droves.Then, inevitably, Death and his SoundBlaster call, as he stands over your tombstone. Yes, a single tombstone, because in the 8-bit era, your horde of characters are buried in the same hole, piled one upon another like firewood, except firewood is useful and characters in the game of Wizardry are not. But, you, my friend, are a true old school RPG fan, and you never give up. You spend hours rolling another party and head down into the depths, uneasy at the strange feeling that you are not playing a clone of Dungeons & Dragons but of the RPG Paranoia, where the Dungeon is not your friend and the assembly line of heroes who engage in suicide-by-bushwhacker is moving faster than that conveyor belt in I Love Lucy. You will never give up, not until you beat this damned game. Because it CAN be beaten—can it? Or is this game like the module Tomb of Horrors, an exercise by game developers to assume the role of a merciless and antagonistic god, presiding over a world whose populace is comprised solely of doomed heroes fresh from the womb that see the gates of a hungry dungeon and shudder at their fate.Addendum: Apparently, there is a tool to boost your ability scores during character creation, which will save you the tedium of hours rerolling your team like I did. It isn't necessary, but welcome, especially on a subsequent playthrough.			"

												Ah, what can I say about this RPG classic? The graphics are terrible, even by the standards of the time, their crude 16 colour EGA awfulness being quickly surpassed by the 256 colour majesty of Westwood's Eye of the Beholder, which followed but a year later. Moreover, in defiance of even the most slender of expectations, variation in tileset is extremely limited - expect to see castles, dungeons, jungles and mines rendered in the same undulating grey brick, with faded tapestries, rooms filled with rotting furniture and the stygian underworld described in bright yellow text rather than sprites. While far more attention was lavished on the animations of your enemies you should be prepared to see the same yellowish-greyish-pinkish tones portray a multitude of demons, rats, amazons, dwarves and dragons.The sound too is also terrible, with no music to speak of and only a limited selection of digital samples to relay the clash of steel on steel, ancient enchantments and the death of your foes. Lest that sound too exciting, be warned this is a game where your enemies die with a bang, literally expiring like popped balloons. Indeed, this was a game where the sound was quickly disabled and the mouse driver not loaded, cursor keys and imagination being far better accompaniments. The plot is borderline nonsense, but expansive and remarkably mature, if such a thing can be said about story involving adultery, murder, madness, a pen that can re-write reality and a half naked she-devil.And the game itself is unrelentingly punishing - this is the only game I can think of where your ability to access some of the more advanced classes, so temptingly described in the manual, at the beginning of the game rests entirely on a combination of luck and pig headedness.  It is also one of the few games I've come across where a party of six stalwart heroes can be bested within seconds of starting their adventures by bats, rats and weeds, where they can fail to pick a lock and find that door locked for good. It is a game where if one of your characters dies of poison then you better hope you have some means of curing them in addition to resurrecting them, because if you don’t they’ll only die again.However, if you've read this far and you consider yourself to be one of the few 'hardcore' CRPG gamers left out there, then you owe it to yourself to download this game and persevere. Nearly 25 years after its release, it stills holds the same dark attraction of stats and skills and spells and equipment and deep, turn-based, party-focused combat that for a few years in the mid-1990s seemed to represent the high point of aspirations for RPGs on the PC.Once you’ve beaten the rats and bats and zombies and Zulus and taken on hell itself and battled through a climatic series of encounters against bosses that feel more like something from Streets of Rage 2. And once you’ve ditched the sticks and rags and found the Avenger and Maenad’s Lance and you’ve got a mage able to launch a tier six nuclear blast capable of incinerating waves of enemies at a time. Then you’ll have found yourself neck deep in that borderline nonsense plot, playing a game that never fails to keep you on your toes, that rewards intelligence and strategy and speaks to the same desire for challenge and depth that until recently games had somehow managed to neglect. You’ll be hooked and you’ll want to take that band of misfits you’ve so carefully tended for the last 40 hours onward to Wizardry 7 and 8 and the fact that you’ll have to spend more than 100 hours to find out there’s no Wizardry 9 will be a bitter-sweet pill to swallow, but probably one you’ll swallow all the same.

												Finished the Super Nintendo version of this game with fan translation patch[www.romhacking.net] (link to patch only, you have to provide your own ROM). I recommend it over the DOS version sold here since it has (slightly) better sound and graphics and... automapping! (It does have however the big downside of not being able to transfer your party into Wizardry 7 and then 8, which is the only way to get some items). The SNES version has JRPG-style controls, too, and a simplified dialog system... which might be a good or bad thing depending on your tastes.Liked:- Designing, equipping and leveling up your 6-character party is just great- Combat is extremely challenging and super enjoyable with a great deal of strategy, many spells and character/monster abilities- Position of characters in combat matters, only ranged and pole weapons or spells and special abilities allow attacking from the back rows- Very good writing in the non-silly parts of the story- Nice sense of explorationDisliked:- Too many random encounters- World is a nonsensical patchwork of various mythologies, novels and just plain silliness- Dungeon graphics are boring, the DOS version has basically one wall texture for the whole game, SNES version has at least some variation- RPG system has some well-known exploits- The optimal way to play if you want the best party/items to carry over to the next game requires reading a lot of spoilersOverall the game grabbed me enough that I soldiered on until the end, but the overall experience left me slighly disappointed. Still, you can't beat that combat and party management, I really want more games in this turn-based style to come out now that we have Grimrock for the real-time side.			"

												I remember that I had this game and it's predecessors on both Amiga and PC back then. This game is one of the dated RPGs, just a dungeon crawl, a lot like some other classics back then (Bards Tale, Tunnels & Trolls etc.). This game was a real chalenge at that time, you needed to draw your own maps. You had to do searches on a regular basis, because some of the treasures were ""invisible"" or ""well hidden"". Of course there was no great and interactive PC/NPC interaction back then - but it already started to show some promise in that direction. In that time it was a great game, but it really shows it's age now. Of course this shouldn't keep you away from a great game, that takes you back in time a real long way. It still can be a lot of fun to play old school CRPG - I loved the memories it evoked as I played it this time. One good advice, Save your progress as often as you can. Sometimes the game has a tendency to hang up, and sometimes you'll be overwhelmed by a random encounter. You also need some time to make yourself familiar with character generation and learning what skills really are important, which race or class has which skills, attributes and perks. Also keep some boxed paper beside you, you'll might have to draw maps - some of them, or loose your bearings and sometimes your life because you ran into an already once triggered deathtrap. Oh, and save often.			"

												I reccomend this game, because it is actually a fun game to play.Not because of nostalgia. I never played it before, first time I tried it - December 2016.Though it is difficult. It does require a lot of work with sketching a map or (the way better idea) to download a modthat draws the map for you and saves it for you (and shows your location, which hand drawn map won't do).Besides, while I am against any walkthrougs in general (unless you are stuck that is), I would reccomend one for this game.The mod disables the option to save and load state in any time you want, so I'd suggest using Daum version to roll your characters (save scum as much as you want with it, to save time) and install the mod than.The game is fun and rich in content, despite it's age (1990). Plus, you can export characters later to play Wizardry 7.And 8 after that :) Wizardry 8 was the main reason I started playing it and I'm pretty sure I will finish it. It is old and cranky.But it's worth it.			"

												HELL IS A CLOSED DOORFirst, your puny bunch of adventurers are mowed down by seemingly unconquerable groups of enemies starting right from the first encounter. Then you face a ton of locked doors that get jammed by just looking at them and block the access to the rooms behind them forever. On top of that, this 'gameplay' is embedded in mechanics that are anything but obvious to a common modern player. However you don't give up and after spending hours reading through manuals and guides to create a party that has a chance to survive the first fights and repeated savescumming to open the doors the game throws at you, you spend the rest of the game staring at only one tile-set. It doesn't matter if you are in the castle, on a mountain, in the jungle or on a river you will see cobblestone floors and walls everywhere. Now what is the appeal to play a game like that ? The beauty of this game is in its sophisticated turn-based fighting system (still unequalled by many “modern” games) beautifully designed monsters (considering the graphical limitations) and interesting, engaging story (It is rather cryptic though and you are mainly left to fill in the gaps with your own fantasy). So if the downsides don't discourage you and creating your own story that liberates itself from being contained in your computer may tickle your interest, grab a pencil and graphing paper, print out the manual and experience a highlight of RPG gaming.(Title is borrowed from the 1st gameplay video of a Let's Play series of Wizardry 6 by DoctorPirx)			"

												The Official Guidebook with all maps, Manual, Soundtrack (for 6+7), character sheet and now-pointless DRM codebook are included in a ""bonus content"" folder in the game's download.Just thought I'd mention that since for some reason steam thinks letting us know there DIGITIZED sound (with NO add-on cards required!) is more important lol. I haven't really played much of the game itself. If (like me) you prefer to not use cheats you need to spend a long time rerolling your characters so you can get a high strength, and I mean hours. Since you need high rolls to unlock some classes (Samurai, Ninja, Bishop, Lord- which is just a Valkyrie but can be male and is kind of crap, etc.) and you need lots of bonus points from those rolls to up your carrying capacity (based on STR) which doesn't go up after initial character creation. Most of your rolls will be 5 to 10 when you need 18s and 22s.That's after you've read the almost 200 page manual to get an idea of what kind of characters you need and will work. The game is very old school, the graphics aren't that great, there's no music (I assume the ""6+7"" soundtrack is actually just from 7) indeed there's very little sound at all aside from PC-speaker ambient noise and metallic clanks. (Time to bust out those Iron Maiden and Helloween albums.) If this sounds like something you'd like, it probably is. If it sounds like something you wouldn't like, then you're probably right. PS- I recommend turning off the mouse and just using the keyboard, it's much faster and easier.			"

The steam version has reused some same sprites for many different characters. For example, the steam version has all these 9 characters look identical  (AMAZULU，MEI-LAI，BRIGERD WOLTAN，VALKYRIE，AMAZULU QUEEN，KUWALI KUBONA，AMAZULU ARCHER，SHAMANESS，PRIESTESS), while the SFC Version has them all look very diffirent.The music of the SFC version is also very cool. (One of the bonus contents of the steam version is the musics from the SFC version in MP3 format, you can check up if you want to know how good the musics of the SFC version are.)Now that I have beaten the SFC version, I do not intend to play the steam version through. But it is good to have. The pdf manual and hint book are cool. The cooleset bonus content is the mp3 musics of the SFC version. I originally intend to buy this cd from Amazon. This Wizardry buddle saves me some 100 dollars or so, by giving it as bonus! Now I can listen to these cool musics when I drive to my working-place.Above all, the steam version is cool, the SFC version is far cooler.

												** Recommended, but with stipulations.  :)Back in 1984 I played the original Wizardry game and fell in love with PC gaming forever.  I played the entire series and enjoyed them all to a point, but 6-8 were masterful RPGs with a connected storyline that spanned the trilogy (you could port your characters from one to the next).  The character depth and NPC interaction was amazing at the time (NPCs remember how you treat and interact with them and it matters throughout the games).  The puzzles and critical thinking you needed to utilize to figure things out were challenging.  It was difficult, no doubt, but after you learned the ins and outs it gave a great gaming experience.THAT SAID, the only way that a younger current generation could ever enjoy this game is to understand a few things:You can't be hung up on graphics, because these are pitiful by today's standards.  You can't expect all the user bells and whistles of today's games like auto-mapping, quest journals, etc.   None of that is there, and you either have to map and journal by hand or you can use the ""Wizardry 6 - Cluebook"" that comes with the Steam purchase and is located in the ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Wizardry6\Bonus Content"" (default) directory.  If you want to experience the golden age of RPG gaming, I'd recommend you do it with this companion guide and/or a walk-through from the internet (there are many and these games have a cult following).  This way you get to experience the great parts of the game, while mitigating the frustrating parts.  You absolutely should research the internet for assistance with the character generation, as it can be daunting, but it quite enjoyable once you understand it.Definitely pick it up during a Steam sale for under $2 and that way if you don't enjoy it, you didn't lose much.** - Just an FYI if you purchase this, you can hit ""Enter"" at the copy protection scheme, as it isn't necessary with the Steam version.

												Wizardry 6 is a must for anybody who loves classic D&D and wants to explore some retro video D&D. You can really feel the sense of playing a party with the computer being a Dungeon Master. A true homage to dungeon crawling with character sheets, a pen, dice and your friends. A pretty robust, if at first difficult to understand, user interface. Between the graphics and UI the age is crystal clear.Take your time to understand the basics of the UI and find a guide to work through it. With no map ingame and no ingame directions going in blind is either difficult or impossible. If you want to get the full (which is a lot) experience read the ebooks that come with.The story is a little rough and sometimes the puzzles are a bit convoluted but if you can trudge through the tough patches you will find a truly immersive and enjoyable game.

												It may quite possibly be nostalgia talking but I played this to death in my youth. It is a deep and wonderful RPG in many ways and although it is dated the basic story and the wealth of items and choices is still enjoyable. This is the pedigree from which games like Legend of Grimrock stem and while it isn't as pretty as modern incarnations it is still very atmospheric.The RPG ""simulation"" is substantially more complex than what is common in modern games and that makes it necessity to read through the manual at least in part. Everything from attacks to spells have modifiers and classes have a diverse set of mechanics. This in turn means that some classes are weak and brittle until relatively late in the game when they blossom into excellent additions. There is no hand holding and the assumptions you make when exploring will influence what ending you will get. The feature to bring the party forward to subsequent games is laudable and it was a novel experience when the game was fresh.I am far less enamoured of the next installment probably because the port to my chosen platform was hideously broken, sluggish and failed to include the party import but the ""Bane"" was installed for years on my PowerBook 165c, infact that old hunk of plastic still runs and this is still one of the games installed.In summary at the current Winter Sale price it is well worth adding to your library just for the hell of it and just while playing enough to be allowed to review it I once again got stuck rolling characters to get that perfect race / profession combination. I find it especially heart warming that the copy protection is still in there even if it has been disabled, while I did own the game the tiny irksome nature of looking up codes lent me to learn some basic 68k assembly.It is highly recommended that you set it to keyboard control only to save on some fiddly clicking as using the arrow keys is substantially faster,.

												The (16 colors only) graphics don't lie; This isn't a modern game with modern sensibilities masquerading in retro clothing.  This is a genuine NES-generation RPG built to essentially replicate D&D on PCs not even powerful enough to run Windows 3.x...I'll be up-front with it: In this game, you start by building a party by rerolling virtual dice, sometimes for hours, until you get stats you can accept in your pre-planned growth strategy that will last the whole game before you even set foot in the dungeon.  If mashing a reroll button (which is made even less convenient by not letting you cancel out - you have to finish making a character before you can try again) to get the stats you want doesn't appeal to you, turn around, now.  Even if you get attributes you like, you can still be screwed by randomly having only 3 hit points on a melee character in a game where a mere rat hits for 5 hp, you have full death on 0 hp, revive items and spells are extremely rare outside the late game, and even if you did, you PERMANENTLY lose 1 Vitality (on characters with an average of 10), which drops future HP growth.  Basically, if you take one unlucky hit, you have to reload.  (And there's no soft reset, you have to finish the combat or alt-tab and force-close the program...)To stop this, you can try to use a sleep spell, and insta-kill the rats, right?  HAHA! NOPE! Enjoy missing against an unconscious enemy about 60% of the time, and then having about a 50% chance that your sword won't penetrate the ""armor"" of the rat.  Then, you have the locked doors.  Highly random, and failure frequently JAMS the door, making it impossible to open except by magic or single-use keys that are rare drops.  At least reloading is faster, here.Unlike other D&D clones, however, skills are train-through-use, not unlike Elder Scrolls.  This makes many skills, like weapon skills, easily trained by merely hitting the target (not that such an event is at all common) while only a few require actually spending skill points on them.  In some ways, this is great, as it means you can power-grind characters all you want.  On the other hand, this means that the game basically just flat-out expects you to power-grind every skill to max fairly early on, and 100 points in a skill isn't necessarily going to mean you succeed.That said, unlike Wizardry 8, there's extremely large room for multiclassing abuse.  This is a game that is more free-form about its character creation specs, and if you gained a single level as a bard, you can continue to train bard music then turn into a mage, take up some spellcasting, then go samurai to continue training as a singing, spell-casting, warrior.  This is also a game old enough that having all the women topless wasn't a major concern, the manual is written as if it assumes you're 8 years old, and rolling a female character means you take a -2 to strength, but, ""That's OK, because women have a +1 to personality and karma!""  (Note: they're both basically useless. That said, the gender-restricted valkyrie class is generally worth it, anyway, and the caster classes don't need strength... unless you multi-class to a hybrid class.) If the idea of ridiculous power-grinding appeals to you, and you don't mind savescumming 'till your fingers bleed, then maybe, just maybe, you'll be the sort of person that loves this sort of game.  I can't even explain why, it's just a COMPULSION.  You'll beat that lock next time! You are so close to making that spectacular ninja-valkyrie or psionist-monk!			"

												It’s hard to believe that the Dark Savant trilogy began 26 years ago in 1990 with Bane of the Cosmic Forge. Resisting these games, I see gameplay elements that were new at the time, but now mark the RPG genre forever. I can’t begin to explain how much this series of Wizardry 6, 7, and 8 ushered in the whole RPG genre. Unfortunately, there are plenty of other articles about how great Wizardry is, and I’m not going to be another re-write. The real question is whether or not Wizardry 6 and 7 are still relevant today and worth playing.Over a period of two weeks in Wales (lovely place for a holiday), with absolutely no internet, I brought out the paper and pencils and painstakingly mapped each tile in my epic adventure. It became apparent quickly that this is the largest drawback of the Wizardry series, especially 6 and 7. While in newer cRPGs it is easier to figure out the map without a physical drawing, the darkness and confusion of 6 and 7 make this incredibly difficult. Every dungeon has many twists and turns painted in the same theme. Essentially, it’s the same wall staring at you over and over again. In Wizardry 6, I spent a good 2 hours trying to figure out how to open a door in the first dungeon, only to find a button on a wall that I hadn’t mapped. Of course, I could never see that button unless I was in the perfect spot. All in all, this makes a very very frustrating experience.What amazed me, however, was the incredible depth of character. There are a variety of classes in Wizardry, each working in a completely different way to the others. The customization of loot and character RNG is far beyond even contemporary titles. I spent 4 hours in character creation alone. But even with amazing character design, the game is brutally difficult. I won’t lie, in true 90s fashion both games are incredibly unbalanced. Some dungeons are a breeze, others one-shot your best characters. I can’t tell you how many times I had to load a save just because I walked into the wrong room and got accosted by pixelated robbers. Please nerf.NPC actions are a breath of fresh air. Instead of boring chat options, you can talk unlimited to NPCs and cultivate rapport. You can even attack them (although that’s ill advised, they hold important parts of the lore and items you NEED to complete the game). Speaking of lore, even with very limited ‘story’ the game still manages to keep a whole universe cultivated. Multiple endings (which were novel in 1990) and multiple beginnings allowed for huge variety in playthroughs, and honestly even the sparsely told story is much better than many RPGs today. I promised to evaluate the state of Wizardry in today’s world, and I hope I’ve made it clear that for all its glory, Wizardry 6 and 7 (which are practically the same game, you can even carry your party over from 6 to 7) is no longer relevant in this age. I simply can’t recommend spending time in a frustrating mess unless you are a true RPG connoisseur. Even then, there are plenty of better games to play. It’s a new dawn, and Wizardry doesn’t have a place in the gaming world anymore. Rest in peace.Final Scoring:Story - 7Gameplay - 7Relevancy - 0Graphics - 3 (unless you're 'that guy')Received a free copy for testing/reviewing purposes.

												Wizardy 6 as installed via Steam on my Windows 8 hangs often during character creation.There are three ways to launch the game when purchased via the Weekly Hunble Bundle: straight Steam launch; launch under DosBox Daum; launch using hand-rolled shortcut.I first wrote my own Windows shortcut and started Wizardy 6 and played an hour using the default parety members. two times the game would hang busy in DosBox and needed force quitting (alt-F9). Other times the game did work Ok, save game and resume game worked as expected.However, when I tried to create my own PC characters I found the game would land in a state with no exit. For example, create a Faerie Priest and set skill points to Mythology, Artifacts and so forth, and the game then asks ""Select a new spell for your spellbook"". At this point the game iis in a cul-de-sac and there is no way to proceed except to force exit DosBox, thereby losing all created PCs!This is sad as the parts of the game that worked were quite interesting. I can only suppose this game works better using a true DOS machine.So, I cannot reccommend this game for modern PCs. I will next try Wizardy 7 and 8 in the hope that one of them proves playable without show-stopping frustrations.			"

												I had the original back in the day but I can't with any honesty recommend this to anyone.  It freezes up often, not constantly, and the starting level has locked doors everywhere that you can't open....I mean everywhere its a mistake in the game and you can't do almost anything without reloading over and over and over....  You can pick a lock only a couple times and it becomes jammed then you cannot open it without a spell that you don't have yet.  Really I'm not kidding I spent several hours trying to fight though this only to realize how stupid it really was.   I leveled up to try and get some more points in skullduggery, lock picking, and I only got one point to spend.  So I have to reload and level again.  By now I think you get the idea.  It's so clunky UIwise and the contant reloading is so stupid, trust me do something else with your time.  Sometimes nostalgia turns out to be just a painful experience.  :(			"

												Wizardry 6 is a *really* old-school style RPG, like, DOS days old.  It's ported well, and I can tell it's a really solid title with a lot of care put into how it's designed; however, it's just too dated and aged for me, as a new player, to get into it.Which is a shame, because it looks like it could be really fun, or was, back in the day.  It's just too rough around the edges for this new player to get into. If you've already played this title in the past or know what you're getting into I'd recommend Wizardry 6 highly for you.  As I mentioned, the port is done wonderfly and it even works well on Linux; but if you're new to the series and aren't prepared to cut your teeth on a new (old) interface then I'd recommend picking up something a little more user-friendly that's in the same vein, like Legend of Grimrock.

												So glad i didn't grow up having to consider games like this RPG's. Terrible in every sense of the word. The UI is awful, nothing is explained, most things are in abbreviations. Escape doesn't go back, and you can't even tell how to exit the game nor save. Steam UI doesn't work and crtl+alt+delete screws up game. Then there's the game. You wander around this dungeon thats confusing and all looks the same. Tons of back tracking and time wasted and apparently you can't progress without basically having to sketch out a map bc there is none. You also need to be taking notes and write everything down. Nothing is explained about the game unless you spend over an hour reading the 73 page manual (fun huh?). So you need to take notes during, read for hours before....I love it when my game is more homework than actual playing. Apparently there are rooms wherw you get 1 shot and die and if you didn't recently save you're screwed, Also you need to spend hours continuously rolling characters until you get a certain # of stats or you lose. Nothing positive to say about this game, except that supposedly there's a lot of play time, most of it probably wasted repetition, and also there is a lot of complexity and branching paths/multiple endings. Don't get unless you hate fun. 1/10.P.s. I almost forgot about this terribly annoying sound effect that happens every 2 seconds and gets annoying after 10 seconds.			"

												Wizardry... A legendary name for a legendary game franchise, created by two U.S.A. college students in their spare time, one can’t help but wonder if they thought or even knew that their game, along with the Ultima franchise, would shape RPGs as we know them today. Probably not. But they did, and whether they knew of the greatness they would achieve is no longer questionable, but one thing is certain: a particular video game publisher out there wants us to remember the fun times we had playing Wizardry (at least from Wizardry VI, the subject of this review, onwards) because we can now purchase them and play them legally from websites such as GOG.com and Steam.Wizardry VI: Bane of the Cosmic Forge came to make our Dungeons & Dragons senses tingle way back in 1990 for the Amiga and DOS platforms. And for a game that’s as advanced as this one is, which is by the standards set in 1990, by the way, this game had a lot of cool features. A complex character creation system, skills that increased the more you used them, there’s more, I’m sure, but I can’t exactly remember them.Gameplay-wise, the game feels like a turn-based version of the RPG known as 'Eye of the Beholder’. When starting out, you must create a party of between 2-6 members, and you can choose their race, gender, class, what skills they specialize in, etc. Now, I’m fully well-aware that in this day and age, most people prefer to play with characters who are based into the story, but for me, at least, this is a welcome change. After creating the characters that will be in your party, you then venture into the castle, where the Cosmic Forge is said to rest. Your party has to fight and build up their skills and experience by fighting life-or-death battles with rats, bats, rogues, and for whatever reason, moving vines. At times, you must use their skills to solve puzzles. It isn’t much, again, by today’s standards, but back then, things like this in video games were unheard of. Using skills, such as Search to find hidden things within the game’s world, could make the game easier or harder, depending on the skills you invested points into.If you came here to see what music you can rock out to while playing the game, you... are totally S.O.L., my friend! The only “music” you can hear in this game is what sounds like the flapping of wings and something banging around on walls. And even then, you only hear it when you’re standing still. Now, when you hit enemies while you’re in battle, you’ll hear what sounds like a weapon of some sort hitting something else that’s metal, but it plays no matter what enemy you hit, regardless of whether or not they wear armor. Again, that’s just a small nitpick of mine, it’s not a make-or-break deal. At least, for me it isn’t.Graphics are actually very-well developed. You can tell what monsters (with a few exceptions) are of what type and in the inventory, you can tell (usually) what type of weapon is what, based on the name and item icon. And while the tilesets in the game are good-looking as well, be prepared to see them A LOT.Unfortunately, I can only in good conscience recommend this game to Hardcore Dungeons & Dragons fans. Or, to someone who has the patience of a saint for all of the grinding you’ll be doing throughout the game, and believe, you WILL do quite a bit of grinding if you want to get even remotely close to the end of the game.

												I'm probably less than halfway through this game, so what have I done with my 34 hours of play time? Rolling characters takes a long time. There is no easy reroll button. Create a character, sigh at his or her crummy stats, delete the character, repeat. I try to play with the first characters I roll, but I die a lot in the opening castle, so I spend a few hours creating a party of 6 elite adventurers, and then die a lot with them. Without the option of rolling even higher stats, I resort to saving and loading the game constantly. Early enemy encounters can be fair or unfair; unfair encounters lead me to restarting dosbox and loading my last save, fair encounters lead me to a phyrric victory, followed by saving, resting, saving, resting, saving, resting, being surprised by an enemy, quitting, loading, resting saving, moving on. Locked doors can be successfully picked and opened, or jammed and forever closed. It takes an average of ten reloads to successfuly pick a lock-- all of the doors are locked; some locks must be left alone until later.The grind doesn't end, but the feeling of helplessness does. After the first few hours of play, i experience a battle that takes all of my strategy, cunning, and items to beat. This victory is not phyrric. This victory is glorious. I am a thirty year old man who stands up and pumps his fist.  With a new confidence, I begin to explore in earnest. The levels are all mazes. They are all connected, so the world feels vast. The world is a maze. The world is a vast and beautiful maze that connects many smaller mazes. The vast maze sprawls like the tentacles of a giant octopus. The small mazes stack level upon level, doubling in on themselves and zig-zagging vertically. Navigating the staircases that crowd each level takes hours. On the screen, the world is endless identical gray, stone corridors. In my mind, it's a dark and forbidding world whose respect I am earning. Some very close boss battles later, each of which took many reloads and ended with a satisfied sigh of relief, I reach the Pyramid. Gone are the Pirates and Lizardmen and Jelly Clouds that populated the castle, and the mountain, and the mine, replaced by a Shamaness and her many subclasses. Native, Priestess, etc. They wear grass skirts and bare breasts. Each encounter makes me wish I could just complete this dungeon and forget that it ever existed, but even with a completed map, navigating the pyramid takes hours. Every time i encounter an enemy, I feel a little bit of my enthusiasm die. I have all the requisite pieces to continue now, but despite the nostalgia and child-like engagement ellicited by this game, I feel that perhaps the spell has been broken.			"

												An outstanding game I played as a kid and rediscovered a year or so ago on steam. In addition to the other comments, some tips, which are also generally applicable to Wiz 7 (I haven't done 8 yet):1. Spend the extra time rolling characters. Spread it out in 20-30m bursts over days if you want. I like to have the following:Lord, maxing strength if possible. (No switch intended. Late-game ebony, mantis, etc will ensure super low AC)Ninja, with enough extra points to assign stats for a guaranteed profession switch to Samurai when needed. Allows maxed Kirijitsu by late game. (One game I made this a super-ranger who went ninja at level 8).Samuri or Monk, with enough extra points to assign stats for a guaranteed profession switch to Ninja. Allows maxed Kirijitsu by late game. Have one Samuri by or after Hall of the Dead, so you can equpi Murusama Blade. Second-best weapon in game (to Excalibur, which pretty much never drops).Rawulf priest with stats to change to bishop at first profession change. Rawulfs can always switch back to priest because they start with 12 PIE. Mage with stats to switch to bishop at first profession change. (I like elf because 10 INT, 10 PIE, making priest-mage switching very easy)Mage with stats to switch to bishop at first profession change. (I like elf because 10 INT, 10 PIE)One mage should pick Knock-knock at earliest opportunity to address lack of thief.I make all casters into ninjas before or after entering the Enchanted Forest (last 'zone') and equip them with the best ranged weapons I can afford (ninjato / cat o' nine tails, depending on available gold). At that point, you can trigger fights at the Temple of Ramm by approaching without a mask. You'll get 2-5 groups of melee-only enemies. Just read your book while holding down return, and your party of 1 Lord and 5 Ninjas will wipe them out methodically.Over the many many years, I have come to the conclusion that you should only play alchemist/psionic if you want extra spell points, or an extra challenge. Their spells are weak and more often resisted in comparison to mages. 2. Profession switches at ideal times. Your casters should switch around multiple times, in a staggered rotation to make sure you have at least one to cast max-lvl iceball and another max lvl fireball. 2a. Waiting at spell point regeneration fountains (L3 in Mines, outside Hall of Damned, inside Hall of Dead) and deliberately generating fights. I like to find a corridor near to these locations, and strafe left/right on the keyboard with one hand while reading a book; can keep one finger a tiny bit above the other relative to the keys and you can rapidly switc. Glance up once every half-page to see if you've met an encounter. Time will fly because you're reading, meanwhile, you are generating a tremendous amount of exp for the brief periods you're paying attention to the game (during the fights). Fill up on spell points inbetween fights or groups of fights instead of resting. You will accumulate an incredible amount of spell points, and way more HP than a caster usually has this way. But it does take patience.  This also generates a ton more gold than you would normally get. This is particularly advisable because top tier spells (ie, Asphyxiation, Nuclear Blast, Death Wish, Word of Death) do not work in the Steam verison of Bane. A fight with five groups of monsters that might be knocked out with a blast or two instead takes 10+ fireballs. Etc.(SERIOUSLY, fix that, please. I beg you).			"

												A great classic kind of hard you play though and get ready to have to map out dungeons seen how ther are no maps in the game. The game runs smoothy and perfect. If your a D&D fan your gonna love it.			"

												Simply one of the best RPGs in steam (if not the best), but its one of the hardest: If i compare *lets see...* Dark Souls 2 to it Dark Souls is like writeing your name down. You have to be very careful with this game because if might cause rage/depression. I reccomend it to any hardcore RPG fans and for 5€ its more then worth it. (Especially baceuse u get Wizardry 7 too). Tip: If u think its to hard or you just don't understand what you are seeing/doing try Wizardry 7 first (but i pref. 6 because u can see the ""level"" not like in the forest at Wizardry 7 what was like a bit washed-up for me) Definetly would risk it with 6 person siting in front of 1 PC and each controlling one chacter. Sounds like fun for me. :D			"
