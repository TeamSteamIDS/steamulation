												Overall this was a pretty good game, guys!!!If you played TLJ (The Longest Journey) then you'll like the story of this game, but quickly realize how big of a change there was in gameplay mechanics of this sequel. As a very big fan of the original, I have to admit, at the start off this game, with the different controls and lackluster main character, I was thinking I wouldn't be a fan of this one and in turn, would end up being disappointed or would avoid the 3rd game, Dreamfall: Chapters- this ended up not being the case. The story is a 3rd person adventure/puzzle (WSAD/arrow key movement, not Point & Click) with minimal fighting and frequent puzzles. The puzzles aren't terribly challenging and only 1 part of the game has you do a lot of back & forth ""fetching"". You swap between 3 roles or characters in the game with the main character being a new girl, Zoe. Chat can be fast forwarded with the space bar, game is saveable at any idle time (non-conversation/cut scene), and, sadly, the game does not allow full screen windowed, which is something I enjoy in many games due to my dual monitor set up.Pros-Game is now realized in a full 3D environment. Graphically much better than TLJ.-Main character, Zoe, grows and changes from when introduced to the end of the game. I really appreciated this as I initially was very uninterested in her.-Story developed nicely. It was slow in the start and middle as it built up. The last couple hours of the game I felt very attached and well immersed.-Puzzles weren't bad and most were easily solved without external assistance. I do want to call out I always use a guide in point & click games because, honestly, I just don't have the time for all the trial and error and I really do enjoy the stories of these games.-Once you figure out the controls, the WSAD keys, Space Bar, and Tab can control your inventory, action wheel, and every other in game action needed- very easy to play from a laid back position.Cons-Movement and camera control gave me motion sickness during the game, especially at the start as I adjusted sensitivity and tried multiple configurations to find the ""sweet spot"". Eventually I gave up and primarily used the movement turn keys to control the camera turn.-The combat was dumb. Controls were clunky and fighting was unneeded. This was during the time where game devs were trying new features and hitting as many check boxes as possible.-Main character was kinda pathetic in the introduction and start of the game. I really felt she started to hit her stride when she arrived at Japan.-Focus mode was mostly pointless and forgotten the majority of the game. A couple puzzles required it, otherwise it didn't do too much.-1 Part of the game had you go fetch quest items, back and forth, twice. I really missed the ability the double click the edge of the map to instantly move- something found in other Point & Click Adventure games (Deponia trilogy & TLJ, for example).TL;DR/Bottom line: Get the original, The Longest Journey, and this game, the sequel, Dreamfall: The Longest Journey, as soon as you can afford it. I highly recommend them both and they go on sale together for $6.24 at the lowest. The 3rd game, Dreamfall: Chapters released 2 days ago (10.21.2014) and is, at the time of this writing, receiving very positive reviews.			"

												I'm very, VERY disappointed.This game is a sequel to ""The Longest Journey"", a point-and-click adventure released in 1999.I bought both games one year ago, and finally got some spare time, enough to play them both.TLJ was simply beautiful. It had good puzzles (and a couple of difficult ones); I instantly fell in love with the world, the characters and the story.Then I started playing Dreamfall.You can clearly tell this game was born in an age when classic point-and-click adventures were dead, and the developers started using different mechanics for them (Grim Fandango comes to mind, but that was actually a wonderful game). Also, Dreamfall was developed in a period when consoles were the main target. This combination caused a long string of very bad design decisions that affect the game negatively.Here are some aspects of the game I'd like to talk about.The ControlsAs soon as the first cutscene ended, I noticed a certain difficulty in interacting with the game. The controls are AWFUL. So awkward and counterintuitive. It is clearly designed with controllers in mind, so I said ""Hey, I'll just use my Xbox360 Wireless Controller"". But it didn't even work. And if you're planning to use one and you somehow manage to make it work, you still need some third party software to bind the triggers to keyboard keys because they won't work otherwise. So, after 30 minutes of googling and tweaking of input options, I ended up playing the game with keyboard and mouse.The CameraOh, the pain we must endure. This is supposed to be a game about exploration, about searching the environment for clues and items to solve puzzles (I'll talk about ""puzzles"" later). The way the camera is implemented makes it so frustrating to even look around in smaller rooms. It just gets in the way. Not that there's a lot to look at, anyways. Gone are the descriptions of places, objects and such. There's so much less. And it's written so poorly.The Main Gameplay and PuzzlesNonexistant, basically. You have a couple of minigames that you will need to play 5-6 times during the entire span of the game (the hacking one, and the lockpicking one). They're both extremely easy.There's never been a single moment where I was stuck in this game. The puzzles, which should constitute a good portion of the gameplay, are instead few and boring. The inventory space is very limited, but it's not a problem, since I don't think I ever held more than 5 items at the same time (counting your mobile phone and a lockpick that you always have with you, so that makes it 3). With some characters, you even play big portions of the game without any item whatsoever. At some point, you feel like the game consists only of walking, talking to people, and watching cutscenes. 10-12 hours of cutscenes.So, puzzles are not a big thing in this one. They instead decided to dilute the gameplay with...Stealth and CombatSeriously, this is the sequel to a point-and-click. It's mainly story-driven. so, WHY ON STARK did the designers think that STEALTH and COMBAT sections were a good idea, I honestly cannot fathom.Stealth sections are EVIL. Note to all devs: DO NOT put stealth ""missions"" in ANY kind of game that does not make stealth its primary mechanic. It's frustrating and boring at the same time, and it just has no point whatsoever. You get caught, you have to redo the section. Now combine this with awful camera and controls. Oh, the FUN!Oh, and the combat. Dull, buggy and boring to death. I honestly don't know why they put combat in this. Luckily you don't get to fight a lot, but still... it's like Serious Sam with crosswords in it. It breaks the flow. Badly.The CharactersYou will control 3 characters throughout the game:Zoe. She's the ""main"" character of the game, and gets the most screentime. Some people disliked her, but I actually liked her since the beginning.Kian. He should play the role of the ""Zelous assassin that will slowly come to question the dubious actions of his religious order"". But he gets at most 20-30 minutes of screen time during the whole game, provided you don't get lost (which is quite hard in this game). They don't give you enough time and depth to actually see his transformation, or to actually care about him in general. Could have easily been an NPC.April. By the Balance, girl. What have they done to you? You suck so much in this game. What a sad, sad person you've become. I loved you in TLJ, you were fantastic. Now you're an empty, self-loathing shell.The StoryNOTE: I don't consider what follows too ""spoilery"", but I will be talking about the ending in a general sense, trying to not reveal more than the necessary.So this game has its flaws, I got it. And I forced myself to play it, because I loved the first TLJ and I really liked the story of Dreamfall. And you get to rivisit some of TLJ locations, and assist to events that you knew happened if you played TLJ. And I think this is just awesome.So I pushed on. And I played avidly despite the awful gameplay because, well, the story is all this game has to offer, and it's actually pretty good.And when the story is at its peak, it all abruptly ends with the BIGGEST, most cruel cliffhanger ever done. It just ends.They managed to close a single arc about an insignificant ""The Ring Girl"" character that you don't really care about during the whole game. And they leave 10-15 threads not just open, but brutally cut. Including the ones about the 3 main characters, whose fate is unknown. Hell, the fate of the WORLDS is unknown. This enraged me to no ends. I played the whole game just to see the ending, and I got NOTHING out of it. It's like they ran out of money and they had to cut this short. And by ""cut"" I mean ""just leave it this way and maybe we'll make a sequel in 8 years where we'll (hopefully) fix this mess"".I ragequit as soon as the credits began rolling.So, TL;DR.Awkward controls and camera management; it's impossible to enjoy the scenery. Then again, you won't be able to analyze half of the things you should be able to in a game like this. Terrible inventory system, but it's not such a big deal since the game has very few puzzles in the first place, and they are all boringly easy. Frustrating stealth sections and dull, boring combat sections, mechanics which were hastily developed and don't belong to this genre anyways. Some great characters but some terrible ones as well. Great story, but AWFUL, rage-inducing incomplete ending with huge cliffhanger.As much as it pains me to say so, DO NOT spend money on this game. It's a 12 hours long, frustrating, and incomplete cutscene.If you loved the first TLJ like me, wait until the last of the Dreamfall: Chapters is released, so that you can at least get a complete story out of it.

												An awesome experience that every gamer should be 'forced' to go through.  This is my third playthrough of this gem, this time on Steam, and I still love it like the first time I played.  If you miss this, then you lose, simple as that.Has its faults of course, but what doesn't? Out of the box setup for keyboard and mouse are terrible, and may put some people off, but once configured correctly as below, its a dream.http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2829471Cut scenes can be long winded, and there is a lot of running to and fro, but the story, although confusing at times, grabs you in, and actually makes you care for the characters you play.  A few of the puzzles can catch you out, due to it not being clear what exactly you have to do to advance, but you can look up little hints, without spoiling the game to progress, knowing that these are just minor design flaws in the interface.Still looks great to this day, and on the whole, is a very rewarding journey indeed!

												As a standalone game, Dreamfall is...iffy. It's not much of a puzzle game - most things are easy to figure out, or require only some running around - but it's not much of an action game, either, as the combat and stealth mechanics are highly simplistic, without any real depth to them.As a part of The Longest Journey universe, Dreamfall is amazing and a huge step up from its predecessor in storytelling ability. Not much of a puzzle or action game? Good, because the puzzles often detracted from the storytelling of the first game, and too much action probably would too.Not recommended at all, or highly recommended, depending on which description interests you.

												This game is so good..no...this is not really a game, this is a journey, to let you experience, to let you feel~This is more than just a game, the story just beautiful, and surreal (certain parts)I do not complain about the ending tho, i think the ending is not good enough as an 'ending' The locaation setting is beautiful, the music is so enjoying, April Ryan is so cool lolWe definitely need more of this kind of game that focus deeply on story development.If you are looking for gameplay like shooting/zombies or whatever, please stay away from this and save your penny, because this is just not for you.If you are more to a story person, I would say  GRAB IT NOW	, it worth more than a penny!Now...I shall be continue my journey			"

												Absolutely stunning game. It also has amazing Nvidia 3D Vision support out of the box. Seriously, I would have purchased this if it was released this year at full price. Great game, great story, and I wish it was longer. I beat The Longest Journey and Dreamfall for the first time this week and it has been an incredible ride.I highly recommend both games! It also runs great with the Steam Controller.			"

												Dreamfall: TLJ is a 3-d third-person point and click adventure game. The game is a sequel to a classic adventure game released in 1998 called The Longest Journey. It is not necessary to play the original TLJ to play Dreamfall, but it helps a lot, since the game universe and many characters are the same. The game is very heavy on story, dialogue, and cinematics, and light on puzzles and gameplay.Story: the story is both the best and the worst I have ever seen in an adventure game. In the last two years I have completed 12 adventure games including old classics and modern indies. Dreamfall has a very complex and compelling story involving several interesting characters, political movements, and the complex game universe. It includes elements of comedy, drama, and tragedy. The story really gathers steam toward the end, resolving one storyline while introducing several more. Then, in the middle of the gathering drama and revelations, the game suddenly ends with no resolution to the fate of a dozen major characters and a dozen major plotlines. This is perhaps the most unsatisfying ending I have ever seen in a game, movie, book etc. Even if they did plan on a sequel, this was just plain terrible. I know a lot of people hated The Empire Strikes Back because of the unresolved plot lines. This is 100x worse.Gameplay: there are a few puzzles that require some thought, but overall the mental challenge of this game is on the light side for an adventure game. It is a little unfair to say that this is just an interactive movie, there are some clever puzzles. Unfortunately there are many times you are just sent on a mission to fetch a particular item and bring it to a particular place. The purpose of these brainless missions is to trigger cut-scenes that move the story along. A lot of the action takes place in small rooms and tunnels. This means the camera that follows you has to zoom in and out a lot. I suppose this is a problem with any 3-d third-person game, but it can make you a bit dizzy. The interface was tweaked to be more ""console friendly"". This makes it a little more clunky for the PC, but not terrible.Fighting and stealth: the developers added a few fights and a few stealth sequences in the game. The fighting is flat out a waste of time. Just stand in front of your enemy and smash the mouse button and you win. Either that, or the enemy is so tough you always lose. The stealth sequences were much better, although they did not really fit in an adventure game. I like to play adventure games leisurely, with one hand on the mouse and the other hand holding a cup of coffee. I don't want action.Graphics: the graphics are dated by 2013 standards, but they are nice, especially the Dreamcore sequence. The close-up shots of faces look the worst. Lots of cut-scenes, some of which are pretty cool.Sound: there seems to be a lot of interesting music and sounds, much better than the typical adventure game.Overall, from the quality of the story, to the quality of the sound and graphics, to the overall scope of the game, this had the potential to be EASILY the best adventure game of all time. Unfortunately the game was crippled by bizarre decisions by the developers: the mega-cliffhanger ending, the introduction of bad action elements, the clunky interface, the too-easy puzzles. What were they thinking?			"

												This game is mostly about listening to dialogs and running from A to B, back to A and then to C. Has an awesome story!A sequel to one of the best stories you can find in gaming, but now you get three playable characters and very nice graphics for its time! April Ryan is back although her cheerful spirit is distored after what had happened in the previous game and therefore I recommend playing The Longest Journey first. Zoë, from the world of science, will be fighting a huge corporation while searching for her best friend. Kian, from the world of magic, finds himself torn between his faith and what his leaders tell him to do. All these three characters will get to interact with each other and controlling them, throughout the 14 hours that this title offers, is really great fun. You'll need to solve a few minigame puzzles (hacking), find ways to enter dangerous areas by putting enviroment to use and meet numerous people who always have something interesting to say. I wouldn't like to compare Dreamfall with TLJ since they are very different. They stayed similar in things that matter though and I appreciate that with 10/10. Again.			"

												Great game! A must buy for adventure fans who love a good story,First, you should know that this is a sequel to the game The Longuest Journey, also available on Steam. You should play that game first for story continuity, and it is a good adventure game as well.The story is what made me fall in love with this game. The well paced plot keeps you interested throughout, while well written dialogue and excellent voice acting made the characters believable, and even pretty darn likable. Zoe and Kian, two of the three characters you will play as, are particularly very charismatic.The other staple of an adventure game are the puzzles. The worst scenario for a player is to be stuck on a puzzle they cannot solve, which is not a problem at all in this game, as puzzles are relatively easy, and consequently do not slow down story progression.The scenery is simply breathtaking: varried, colorful, and beatiful. Don't just take my word for it, look at the screenshots above. Graphically, the game still looks good (current year 2013).Around 4 or 5 times in the game, you are asked to fight. The game suddenly changes to an action game, the controls of which are awkward, and the experience felt unpolished. But it is only a small flaw with the game that you can get by easily enough. Also of note, as the story focuses initially on the lives of two women and their relationships, it may be more appealing to a female audience.			"

												This is one of my favorite games, yet it isn't actually a good _game_.The puzzle mechanics, design and difficulty aren't nearly as at the level of it's predecessor, The Longest Journey. There are combat and stealth sequences that would have been better off being left out of the game entirely and moving around and the UI in general are kind of clunky.And yet, I've replayed this game about 3 times more than any other game I own. I have kickstarted it's sequel for a sizable chunk of money.The reasons for this are easy to list, but don't really seem as convincing when you just list them, but for me they made the difference between a mediocre game and one of my top 5 games ever.First off, the biggest for me, the story. The game's story develops on the fantasy/scifi of The Longest Journey, with a slightly bigger focus on the scifi aspect. It does in my opinion a great job of worldbuilding, giving you the feeling of being a significant, but not completely deciding part of an epic story and world(s).It's not the best story ever written, nor is it the most original. It is however a sort of story that doesn't seem to show up often in games, and it is well written. You can probably thank Ragnar Tornquist for that.Second, the voice acting, it's pretty much spot on for the main character, and most secondary ones. It's hard to emphasize how much this matters in making you empathize with the main character and her journey.Slightly less important, but still important in my opinion is the music, the tracks by the group Magnet hit just the right melancholy note. The rest of the music is serviceable, it works but doesn't stand out.The combination of those things make this game stand out to me for being one of the few games that has made me cry. And it still does, every time I play it. Maybe I'm a big sap, but (without spoiling) that moment, _that_ realization, it still hits home.One advice, if you do end up wanting to play this flawed, but beautiful game, do yourself a favor and play The Longest Journey first. It's an old style point and click, and the graphics really don't hold up, but it gives a lot of context to the world and the characters. This goes especially for the characters you meet that are in both games.			"

Just like the first one, the storytelling is amazing and the characterization and development is really top notch. It's a bit more interactive than the first one since you use WASD to move and sometimes have to sneak/hide. The combat system is lame, but that doesn't seem to matter in the face of everything else the game offers. Highly recommended.			"

What this really is, a telltale games game way before there was such thing as telltale game, and just oozes with class and depth, unlike telltale games.The graphics are aged for pc standards, but thankfully human voices haven't evolved, and its still top quality voice acting by todays standards.If you never played tlj i'm not sure if the effect would be as strong as it carries over the background... but if you have this is amazing. You're just watching this tlj story continue and you want to come back.. for what happens next in the story story (dont bother thinking about the gameplay, not the point at all, theres quality here and its not that). ....I don't remember dreamfall being as awesome as it is when i first played it.

												In preparation of the release of Dreamfall Chapters i re-started playing this game last week. I purchased this game as an xbox original on X360 before but never really finished it.I played the first game in the series The longest Journey a week before and wanted to continue the story as quickly as possible. The game is quite long and the mechanics are no longer point and click like the first game but actual direct controls. Inventory management can be a bit fussy as the interaction with it is not as inuitive as intended. Graphically the game holds up quite well albeit the facial animations can be awkward. But for its time the game was really good. It continues the story of the first game a bit but mostly introduces new characters and story arcs which are then melded into the first games storyline. It is playable if you havent played the first game in the series but it might be better to play the first one or at least read up on its story. Final verdict. A good game with a (sometimes) hard to grasp story. Gameplaywise and graphically the game holds up but at poiints does show its age.			"

												Dreamfall, the second TLJ game is, as far as sequels go, extremely well done.  Dreamfall takes the original Point-and-Click adventure theme and takes it to full 3D.  I was amazed at how true to the world this game is.  I had just finished TLJ and was so engrossed by it I immediately moved to Dreamfall, and there were numerous places that you explore in TLJ that are revisted to almost pixel-perfect replication of their 2D counterparts - or - recognizable, and yet changed by time.  The attention to detail is outstanding - I distinctly remember a point where a familiar character is writing in a book and narrating what he's writing and if you look closely you can see that the words he is writing are actually what the narrator is saying, not scribbles or obscured text.  I found that impressive for a game released in 2006.  To go with this 3D update, the player is given a much improved settings configuration, along with full controller support, which I found nice since Dreamfall really works well with one.  Also, while TLJ had beautiful backgrounds the character models were pretty dated; however, in Dreamfall, everything is quite beautiful.  The textures are good and the world is vibrant and alive.  One of my favorite things about TLJ was the voice acting.  While the VA is good in Dreamfall, I felt that TLJ had more outliers for the VAs.  In TLJ some people *really* nailed their part, but some really failed.  The median voice acting performance in Dreamfall is better than TLJ, but that also means these standout performances are unfortunately lacking.  Another major problem this game has is the combat.  It adds a sense of urgency to the game, unlike in TLJ you can actually lose and have to reload, and that's fine, but the combat is slow-paced, clunky, and just downright terrible.  I would have preferred removing it entirely.  There are also sneaking sections in the game and they could have been improved as well.  Coupled with these ""failable"" sections is an autosave feature, which is nice, as I usually find myself sucked into these games so much that I forget to save after awhile.  They're well placed and non-intrusive.Gameplay wise I like the puzzles in Dreamfall much more than in TLJ.  In TLJ the puzzles were extremely convoluted at times.  In Dreamfall the puzzles make sense; for example, you need to make a torch, so you get a broken axe handle, a rag, dip it in petrol and light it - it makes sense and is easy to figure out through intuition.  There is also less backtracking than TLJ had, which is nice, keeping the storyline progressing and the pacing of the game better.   The main reason I love The Longest Journey is the plot and storyline and Dreamfall is a worthy successor in this regard.  There are recurring faces and familiar places, but since the game takes place ten years after the events of the previous all have changed, some good, some bad, but they are all well done.  The game also plays more on the creepy side TLJ had, setting up a sense of mystery and horror.  The developers also took advantage of their new engine, making the game extremely cinematic and utilizing four different points of view, granting the player control of different characters to explore the world and storyline.Pros:Story/Narrative/Pacing/CharacterizationNice Variations in SettingLogical PuzzlesAttention to DetailCons:CombatNo MapFew Minor BugsEnding?While it isn't *necessary* to play TLJ before Dreamfall I would highly recommend it, especially since the first game is so good.  I really appreciated the developers staying true to the world they created in the previous game.  That said, the combat was awful, and it's impossible to overlook it.  The ending also doesn't resolve everything in the game.  Had I played this when it was released I would be furious; however, now that Chapters has been kickstarted I can wait a few more months to see how Dreamfall wraps up.  I'd really like to rank this game in the As; however, with these issues cited, I'm going to have to keep it on the very upper edge of the B range.  B++			"

												Prepare for a journey of self discovery through distant lands and fantasy wrapped science fiction flavoured worlds.Dreamfall: The Longest Journey is primarily an adventure game following the story of one Zoë Castillo and taking place in multiple different and diverse environments. Futuristic sunny and warm Casablanca, downtrodden rainy Venetian canal ridden streets of Newport, snowy medieval steam punk infused Marcuria and even hidden damp tree house based Swamp City. The characters that fill these worlds are also all interesting and unique. As the game relies on plot to drive the player forward, I will not mention anything about it but it does its job very well. The story is interesting and full of well designed characters and locations. The lore is presented in easy to swallow chunks and allows room for interpretation while still feeling solid and believable. This is a must as much of the game relies on walking and interacting with objects. There are some light environmental puzzles that slow down your progress through the story and break the monotony of walking or pushing through the story too quickly. Though it did feel like there could have been more of them as the gameplay is very shallow mostly consisting of walking and talking to characters. There are some fight sequences but it is evident the developers did not invest much time into them as they feel very wonky. Technically speaking, the game has no larger problems. Mouse and Keyboard controls are not the best but can be tweaked to your liking – I found the gamepad works best. Graphics are acceptable for a 10 year old game and the high colour vibrant art style means time has been kind to it. 1080p works fine with no frame drops on modern machines. Voice work is all very well done and the soundtrack is nothing less than wonderful.It took me 12 hours to finish it and I couldn’t get enough of it. As a game relying on story employing not all that spectacular gameplay, I was left wanting more. This game is the sequel to The Longest Journey (separate storyline of other character) and prequel of Dreamfall Chapters (continuation). I eagerly recommend this game to anyone looking for something story rich and similar to games like Life is Strange™, Syberia, MYST and anything from Telltale.			"

												Dreamfall: The Longest Journey was entertaining to play, but it didn't hold a candle to The Longest Journey. The whole game made me wish for less tacked-on combat and stealth and more of the point-and-click puzzle solving that made TLJ a great game. The few puzzles it did feature weren't much of a challenge and didn't require much logical thinking to solve.Still, the voice acting, environments, and entertaining characters made this game worth playing. I loved seeing all of the familiar faces as well as some interesting new characters. Despite being released in 2006, the environments delivered some solid scenery porn that holds up today. The story was also compelling enough to make me play to the end.With Dreamfall Chapters in development, this is a must play. If you can overlook its shortcomings and focus on the story, you'll definitely enjoy Dreamfall: The Longest Journey. "

												If you played The Longest Journey for this game (and you should), it kind of follows the narrative from the predecessor, giving clousure to some matters and opening new questions. The camera can get a bit jammed sometimes, but it's not a game-breaker. The voice acting, following its predecessor, is terrific!The storyline is great, and unlike the first one, I never had a problem getting stuck in a place, the puzzles are quite easy and the game is fluid. The mysterious Arcadia is shown now in more perspectives since the game has a moving camera, but also because people have more to tell depending on who you are. So yeah, I recommend this game and I'm looking forward to Dreamfall Chapters!			"

												I recently played through both The Longest Journey and Dreamfall again. TLJ is a masterpiece in storytelling and has some of the most well written characters in any game. Dreamfall is the sequel to TLJ and it follows a new protagonist and has a new plot but it all takes place in Stark and Arcadia again.Now, I need to make this perfectly clear: TLJ is a classic point-and-click adventure. Dreamfall is not. Dreamfall is a third-person action/adventure game. This sets the game apart quite a bit; they are not the same type of game.The lore is definetly the main part of both games and it's amazing. The two worlds, Stark and Arcadia, has a lot of wonderfull characters and creatures that you encounter. Dreamfall continues the story of April Ryan as well but the game is mainly about Zoë, the new protagonist. You get to meet some of the people and characters that helped April in the first game and quite a few new ones. For the sake of the lore, Dreamfall does bring a lot to the table but it's a whole new game that tries to introduce quite a lot of new features and action elements; for good and bad.Let me elaborate. First of all; it's in 3D and not 2D any more. You no longer point-and-click but you control Zoë with the WASD-keys. To find/view/interact things or people of interest you have to walk up to them and press a button. You also have a targeting function where you can view or interact with things from a distance. They have also added a fighting mecanic in Dreamfall in instances where you have to fight. This makes this game a whole new plattform and moves from classic adventure to fore action than adventure.Needless to say, this upset a lot of fans of the original game and to me it comes across as it's trying to hard to bring a modern design into the genre. It still works but it's quite annoying at times when you get stuck in camera angles and what not.But this game (weird controls or not) is still a great game thanks to the mentioned lore, amazing story and well written characters so I can only recommend it. I still recommend that play TLJ before this game; not only for the lore but because it's one of the greatest games ever made. Dreamfall is like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of TLJ but you need to look past the quirky controls and experience the ride.			"

												Go and talk to person A. Now talk to person B. Now back to person A. Now talk to person C. Now talk to person D to get object X. Back to person A. Back to person B. Now talk to person E... (continues ad nauseum)In my entire first visit to Arcadia, the fantastical world that contributes half the setting of Dreamfall,  I didn't make a single decision or solve a single puzzle. Instead, the game fed me a string of explicit or implicit instructions on what I should do next. When a puzzle finally bothered to turn up, the game practically leapt up and down in its efforts to show me the solution, reducing the act of solving it to yet another follow-the-instruction exercise. After tolerating this for over an hour, I shut the game down in disgust and looked it up on Metacritic. I felt that reading some of the critical drubbings handed out to it would soothe my frustration.The Metacritic score for Dreamfall is 75%. The ration of positive to negative reviews is 26:2.Maybe I'm becoming a cranky old man who is increasingly out of touch, but... really??Is following instructions good gameplay? Can I put together some IKEA shelves and then exclaim, “wow, that game was fun!”. Certainly I've had more head-scratching puzzles presented to me by flatpack furniture instructions than in the whole nine hours of Dreamfall.It's not as though the game is much better in its other sections. Throughout, the puzzles are almost offensively easy to solve. In one location, a mysterious set-up of statues and symbols taunted me with the half-promise that I would have to do some serious thinking to progress. And then I turned a corner and discovered... well... the solution. Just sitting there, waiting for me to go back and do the busy work of implementing it.Even these very easy puzzles are occasionally so badly implemented as to defy belief. One puzzle required me to recreate a tune I had previously heard, but the game had allowed me to remove the source of the tune from the game. Unable to remember what the tune had been, and without any means of hearing the tune again, I was completely unable to progress. On two other occasions I realised the puzzle solution instantly, but the game was so pedantic about how I went about it that I had to trial-and-error my way to taking the correct action. It reminded me of early text-parser games where you needed to type in multiple different phrases before the game finally understood what you wanted to do.And when the game isn't insulting you with non-puzzles, it asks you to slog through some typically dull and clunky fighting and stealth sections. I understand that when adventure games began falling out of mainstream favour, developers thought they needed to sex up their games with this stuff, but did it always have to be so badly implemented? The best fighting strategy turns out to be 'press forward and mash the quick-attack button until victory', and I found the best sneak strategy to be 'try not to die of boredom while watching your character inch like a lethargic snail towards their objective'.So... why the good reviews?Well, the passive elements of this game are generally very good. The plot is intriguing, and becomes genuinely gripping once it gets into gear. Budget limitations make the locations feel pretty sparse, but they're beautifully stylish and full of distinctive characters. Voice acting is good throughout, though I found the main character (Zoe)'s voice to be somewhat tepid and unconvincing during more emotional scenes. The dialogue is usually great, and skilfully conveys character in just a few lines. I can certainly see many people playing this game, falling in love with the characters, getting hooked on the plot, and coming away feeling they just played something wonderful.But they didn't. They watched a lot of wonderful things, they heard a lot of wonderful things, but they didn't play much of any worth. Especially near the end where the developers once again stop bothering with this whole 'game' thing and go back to 'Talk to A, talk to B, talk to C...' interspersed with dramatic cutscenes.And the sadder truth is that even the plotting and characters aren't good enough to warrant the skew towards positive reviews on Metacritic. I understand the game was scaled down from a more ambitious vision due to budget restrictions, but it has left some odd effects. One of the player characters undergoes a crucial and transformative change in perspective, but the reasons for this whoosh by without examination, which makes the change feel cheap and contrived. As the plot develops, you can see that the writers are aiming to explore a theme, but its all very muddy as to what they're trying to say, if anything. The end of the story is a huge 'To be continued...' with only one plot element resolved satisfactorily, though even that left me wishing for more detail.Irritatingly, there are hints of something better here. Early in the game, I was given a set of choices in a dialogue tree that I saw would take the scene in different directions. I made what I felt was a smart choice, and was pleased to see the result. Suddenly, I was playing: using my wits to make a decision and see what happened. Even now, I wonder what would have happened had I chosen the other option. These choices pop up later too, though they are unfortunately few, infrequent, and generally of little consequence. Having watched the developer introduction to Dreamfall: Chapters, I am hopeful that this avenue will be explored to its full extent in the sequel.Play Dreamfall if you're a sucker for reasonably well-told fantasy stories and you don't mind not having an active role to play in the experience. But if you think 'interactive entertainment' should encompass the whole spirit of the phrase: avoid, avoid, avoid. My personal score on this is 4/10. Your mileage may vary.			"

												Both The longest journey and this game, dreamfall are fantastic. They are among the best characters, story and dialogue ever made for this media. If you computer can run it, play them in the order. You won't regret it.If you feel too stuck on the puzzles, just get some help on the UHS site. It's great for giving hints without spoiling the fun.

												If you've never heard about Arcadia or Stark you have much to learn.Dreamfall is the long awaited sequel to the original ""The longest journey"".Both games are heavy on story elements and have a way of making you feel connected with the characters.Dreamfall is a bit more forgiving than the original when it comes to making mistakes - since at the bottom of it all the game is here to tell you a story. Or several parallel stories if you will. There's always more to the story than meets the eyes, and you will most likely be left as a huge questionmark at times.I love games that makes you keep guessing, the sort of ""maby if, but then he would, and if that have already happened then she knows and that would mean that..."" etc.All in all, the game serves you a superb story on a silver platter.

												Sequel to the Longest Journey, a game I strongly recommend.  If you played that, play this too for more of the world you've likely come to love.Pros:-Story, if you aren't here for story then you really shouldn't be playing this game at all.-None of the bizzare puzzles and even more outlandish solutions that plagued the first game of the series.-There are still some puzzle elements, but not really a focus of the game.-The already well established setting of the first game is built upon here in the sequel, and you really start to get a feel for this world as a whole.-More characters with more interesting motivations and personalities.-The humor is still there and still greatNeutral:-Not really a ton of gameplay, mostly walking and talking with a few fights, puzzles, and other segments sprinkled in on occasion, which isn't a negative for me, but opinions may vary.-This game is way shorter than The Longest Journey, and way shorter than the sequel Dreamfall:Chapters as well.-Combat is pretty garbage, I didn't care, but maybe you might, just know going into this one that they focued more on story than gameplay.-The graphics are good enough that it isn't distracting. Overall, if you love story focused games, play The Longest Journey, then play this and the sequel.			"

												Dreamfall: The Longest Journey (the sequel to The Longest Journey) is an adventure/puzzle/sort-of-actiony story-based game that tells the tale of two worlds colliding. The characters are interesting, the dialogue is well written and well acted, the graphics are good, and the UI has been completely overhauled - a huge improvement on the previous game in all ways.  It does expect the player to be familiar with terms and characters fromt he previous game, but I only played about halfway through the previous game and I wasn't too lost. Dreamfall is the good kind of sequel: one that transcends the original and builds off its ideas without remaining shackled to old UI, graphics, and voice-acting. The only problem I have with the game is that combat is poorly implemented, clunky, and either too easy or too difficult, depending on the fight. Luckily, the combat sections are short and few, so that's not a dealbreaker. If you've already played The Longest Journey, I heartily reccomend Dreamfall. If you don't want to deal with the previous game, you might want to read a quick summary first.			"

The storyline remains interesting and the settings change often enough to keep you thoroughly engaged. This series has failed to dissapoint yet! Can't wait for the third installment.			"

												I didn't particularly enjoy the original The Longest Journey, and all 3D adaptions of point 'n click adventures have been fairly terrible. So when I first tried Dreamfall I went in with negative preconceptions. I got a few minutes in and found the start too slow for my liking, plus I didn't particularly enjoy the 3D camera control and I was generally critical of some of the lack of polish. I shelved Dreamfall for a number of weeks.However, I'm very glad I picked Dreamfall up again. About an hour in, a gripping story begins to unravel. There are also some very likable characters and several genuinely funny parts later in the game. Dreamfall is also extremely beautiful.This game is more of an interactive story than an adventure. There are barely any puzzles, and the few it has are very easy. However, this isn't necessarily a negative point because it's still enjoyable.There's way too much unimaginative and redundant dialogue in Dreamfall, often to the point of frustration. Fortunately, you can skip over most of it without missing any story, and you can read back on previous conversations via in-game UI.There are currently many good, cheap adventure games around, and I think although Dreamfall is absolutely worth the price (compared to other forms of entertainment), it is still overpriced in todays games market, so best to put it in the wishlist and play other games until the sequel nears towards 2015.

												Knights of the Old Republic is my favorite game of all time, and I've wanted to play a game similar to it. Dreamfall: The Longest Journey turned out to be that game. You start in distant future Casablanca as a character I related to quite a bit. Lazy, no direction, a person who has lost faith in what they are meant for. Simple events turn into a long journey for Zoe, and the game takes you to various incredible environments. Besides traveling through these amazing worlds, I found mysef very attached to the storytelling and mystery behind what the hell was going on. The characters have great personalities and voices, and the environments are very interactive for the time this game came out (similar to KotOR, minus the inventory system).This game lacks a proper UI (which I didn't are about at all) or a good combat system (there really didn't need to be combat, but when it happened it was pretty poor execution), but the storytelling and game narrative makes up for it. All in all, if you like the sense of journey, exporation and characters that KotOR offered, givethis game a shot. I'm definitely buying Dreamfall: Chapters to play after this.			"

Dreamfall: The Longest Journey is a direct sequel to The Longest Journey, and assumes that you are familiar with the characters, lore and events of the first game -- I'd highly recommend playing it or reading a summary before considering starting here.Dreamfall is an adventure game of the dialogue-heavy and story-rich variety, with only a few inventory and logic puzzles -- more Heavy Rain than Monkey Island -- which may not be to everybody's tastes.  It isn't what I was expecting, and is quite different to the original, but the story was interesting enough to keep me playing.I also feel that I have a responsibility to warn would-be buyers that for some reason this game contains a number of one-on-one battles, using what is easily the worst battle system ever conceived.  Many of these battles can be avoided by picking the right dialogue options, so try not to♥♥♥♥♥♥people off.			"

												If you can handle a complex story and have already played The Longest Journey, I would recommend picking this up. It's using a 3D engine and you can use the WASD keys to move around and explore, click characters and objects to interact with them. Unlike The Longest Journey, the player switches between 3 characters; April, Kian and Zoe. Each has they're own beliefs and perspectives, this allows the story to be told from multiple points of view. Gameplay is diverse and includes combat, dialogue, exploration, puzzles and stealth, however there are often multiple ways to get through a section. For example, sneaking past someone might avoid having to fight them, or there may be more than one way to get out of a situation. Now the story might be difficult to understand especially if you haven't played The Longest Journey, even then the ending may leave you feeling very confused. This takes place after The Longest Journey and before Dreamfall Chapters, a lot of loose ends are tied up here but many unanswered questions remain in the lore. I would suggest playing all 3 games in order, that way you will be introduced to the series gradually and avoid confusion :)			"

												This is an odd recommendation. For fans of the first Longest Journey, this is an absolute no-brainer must play, purely for the continuation of the story alone. For everyone else, sadly... not so much. First of all, it's hardly a game (ok, so maybe 25% game, 75% interactive story) - but since most people buy games expecting... well,  gameplay... it's hard to recommend from that standpoint. But as I said, for fans of the original, it is an amazing continuation of the story. The developers fixed my main issues with the original and really tightened up the dialogue and storytelling. In that respect, it is nearly superb, and worth playing for alone. But the uninspired puzzles (i.e. fetch quests) and combat sections really bring down the 'game' part of the equation. Add one final major insult in the lack of an actual ending, and it's really hard to recommend for those who never played the original. But for those fans, it is simply not to be missed. PS - for best results, use a gamepad!			"

First of all, it's hardly a game (ok, so maybe 25% game, 75% interactive story) - but since most people buy games expecting... well,  gameplay... it's hard to recommend from that standpoint. But as I said, for fans of the original, it is an amazing continuation of the story. The developers fixed my main issues with the original and really tightened up the dialogue and storytelling. In that respect, it is nearly superb, and worth playing for alone. But the uninspired puzzles (i.e. fetch quests) and combat sections really bring down the 'game' part of the equation. Add one final major insult in the lack of an actual ending, and it's really hard to recommend for those who never played the original. But for those fans, it is simply not to be missed. PS - for best results, use a gamepad!			"

												If you can handle a complex story and have already played The Longest Journey, I would recommend picking this up. It's using a 3D engine and you can use the WASD keys to move around and explore, click characters and objects to interact with them. Unlike The Longest Journey, the player switches between 3 characters; April, Kian and Zoe. Each has they're own beliefs and perspectives, this allows the story to be told from multiple points of view. Gameplay is diverse and includes combat, dialogue, exploration, puzzles and stealth, however there are often multiple ways to get through a section. For example, sneaking past someone might avoid having to fight them, or there may be more than one way to get out of a situation. Now the story might be difficult to understand especially if you haven't played The Longest Journey, even then the ending may leave you feeling very confused. This takes place after The Longest Journey and before Dreamfall Chapters, a lot of loose ends are tied up here but many unanswered questions remain in the lore. I would suggest playing all 3 games in order, that way you will be introduced to the series gradually and avoid confusion :)			"

												Dreamfall is one of the best adventure games I have ever played.This is my second time playing, this time after playing (some) of The Longest Journey. [which is also amazing].Still. Dreamfall I played first and nostaglia is coming back to me again, the voice acting, story and gameplay is unique! - like that of the telltale game series, this is the foundation and formula that works so well in these story driven decision games.I have yet to play Dreamfall Chapters but am very excited to go on to that once I re-finish this game and get caught up with the story again.I definitely recommend this for any adventure game fans, or anyone who loves a good story! :)) enjoy!

												The Longest Journey was a great adventure game, and in spite of the mediocre reviews, I think this one was just as good.  One of my favorite adventure games, and I'm hoping they'll make more in the series. It's a deep storyline that pulls you in and keeps you interested, with an emotional ending that's rare in video games. If you don't mind 90's point-and-click adventure, play The Longest Journey first, then this one, but that's not a requirement. Both games have mature themes and language, so not for the kids.			"

												TLDR: Magnificent story, mildly annoying controls & combat, great voice acting and dialogue, moderately fun but sparse mini-games. If you can get past the controls/combat and enjoy a good story, play it.Dreamfall: the Longest Journey is not a direct sequel to the original Longest Journey (apparently that is planned for later release after Dreamfall Chapters) but is set in the same world(s) ten years after the events in Longest Journey and involves some of the same characters. The main protagonist, Zoe Castillo, is a new character, but you'll also be able to play as characters from the original game. It's also a departure from the original in that it's not a point-and-click adventure game - instead the developers tried to use a 3rd-person over the shoulder perspective and threw in some combat and stealth sequences to break up the story. However, even the developers admit that these added sequences are not very fun but thankfully there are relatively few of them in the game.The 3rd-person over the shoulder controls are not very well done and it will take you a little while of fiddling with the settings to get them to a playable point. There is very little tutorial (if it can be called that) or direction given to the player on how to play but the controls are fairly simple so this doesn't seem to impact gameplay in a negative way. The UI is incredibly minimalist to the point that you don't even see it unless you're in a fight (health bars) or you open up your inventory. There are far fewer items used in this game and you will instead be talking to people a lot more.The conversation system displays a series of one-word dialogue choices which when moused-over, are elaborated on by the controlled character at the time giving you a good sense of what the character will say if that choice is selected. The choices often indicate a direction that the conversation should follow (aggressive, friendly, tell the truth, etc.) rather than a specific sentence or phrase. My one problem with the conversation system is that the option to exit several conversations (Thank you) was also used as a non-exiting conversation branch, so I would recommend always mousing over the options before selecting to make sure that you don't miss a branch. I particularly enjoyed the conversations with Crow and being able to see and control the conversation between two opposing sides.The story itself is fantastic and will send you on several twists and turns through the game world, and getting to see the game from different perspectives. It's all set on an Earth split into two - the futuristic/cyberpunk ""normal"" world (Stark) being the science half, and a fantasy-themed world (Arcadia) the magic half. I won't go into the story so as not to spoil it, but you get to adventure in both worlds and examine the relationships between them. The dialogue was also very engaging - usually thought-provoking and even sometimes laugh-out-loud funny.At some points there are mini-games to hack or unlock things. They are fairly simple but fun and do not interrupt the story much if at all. The same cannot be said, sadly, for the combat and stealth sections, but again there thankfully aren't very many of them - or at least not many of them that will be hard/annoying. The stealth usually involves clicking on objects to hide and using your stealth walk (right CTRL). There were only one or two points in the game where I had trouble getting through the stealth, but the game seems to always autosave when you get to one so you thankfully don't have to replay too many cut scenes if you fail. In longer stealth sequences (the catacombs come to mind) I recommend saving and saving often whenever you're in a ""safe"" spot so you don't have to re-sneak all the way back. For the combat sequences you'll never really get stuck, as once you figure out how to beat the very simple AI you'll never lose a fight again. Hint: characters always block after you hit them, and you happen to have an attack that always passes through a block... you're welcome!Overall, I think the Metacritic score (75%) is almost spot-on, but for me personally I absolutely loved this game despite its flaws. If you enjoyed the first game and want more of the same style of story, or if you enjoy great story-telling in general, definitely play this game. If you haven't played the first game and enjoy point-and-click adventure games though, I'd really recommend playing the original Longest Journey first. It isn't required to play Dreamfall strictly speaking, but you will enjoy Dreamfall a lot more if you do and the references in Dreamfall about the original will open up the storylines from the Longest Journey that you would otherwise miss.

												While only about half as long as The Longest Journey (no pun intended) Dreamfall has a much different feel to it. Unlike The Longest Journey its a full 3D game with the player perspective shifting between three distinct characters and, while the visuals are nonetheless impressive, it feels much more clunky than The Longest Journey's 2.5D animations.The characters are likeable enough and the return of some fond favourites does still keep the series trademark sense of humour; I'm looking at you Crow! Even so, I wouldn't rate it as highly as The Longest Journey, but it still hits those important ""life as a journey"" ideas and questions.***Potential Spoiler Alert***Additionally, to those that might be put off by the rather abrupt abd confusing ending, Dreamfall was never meant to be a standalone game but part of a trilogy which, due to unforeseen circumstances, was cut a little short. Thankfully, Red Thread Games will (or have depending on when you read this review) be releasing Dreamfall Chapters which will not only finish the games stroyline. but also start new ones with new characters; and hopefully some old ones too(?).

												If you played and loved The Longest Journey, you will definitely love this one! It's a departure from the original, mainly because it's a 3rd-person adventure game with some combat thrown in instead of point-and-click. The combat is pretty clunky and awful, but it doesn't show up too often, so you shouldn't worry too much about it.Where the game really shines is the story, which I admit is one of the best I've ever experienced. The game's fairly stand-alone, but knowledge of the original story and characters enhances the experience and makes it that much better. It ends on a cliffhanger, but once the remaining episodes of Dreamfall Chapters get released that will finally be resolved.If you've played the original and loved it, then check this one out! If you've not played the original I suggest getting the TLJ + Dreamfall bundle, you won't be disappointed.9/10			"

												Dreamfall had some huge shoes to fill what with being the sequel to TLJ and all and to be honest it kind of failed but it's still overall a very good game. The biggest problem came with Funcom wanting Dreamfall to be more action-oriented and it really suffers because of this, there's some pretty bad forced action and stealth segments but they're thankfully rather scarce and don't ruin what really matters in TLJ, the writing. The writing is still damn good and arguably better in some ways to the first mainly being a lot more concise unlike its verbose predecessor. It doesn't quite capture the magic of the first game but Dreamfall is still an emotionally resonant and beautiful game despite its flaws and one of the worst cliffhanger endings I've ever seen. Thankfully the third game, Dreamfall: Chapters, will be out next year and I can't wait for it. I pledged $110 for it and I don't regret it for a second. Play this and TLJ, I bet you'll grow to love them too.			"

												This game's mechanics are admitedly dated and the movement in particular can be blocky at times. In addition, possibly due to budgeting reasons, a segment of the story ended in a rushed and perceivably incomplete way.That not withstanding, however, this was a lovely adventure game, an easy winner for any fans of the original game and any of the adventure P&C surge of the 90s, though this game in of itself veers from its P&C origins. A good story which becomes excellent primarily in its final act, writer/director Ragnar Tørnquist once again serves up thoughtful, charismatic and well-written characters whom- with the exception of main character Zoe- are generally voice-acted very well. This game will definately appeal to any looking for a new venture into story-driven, fantasy games, whilst I would recommend those who consider the mechanical aspect vital to give this a miss, as the limited camera scope and movement mechanics will likely have you tearing your hair out!

												This entire series has been amazing and definitely worth looking into. My first experience was on the Xbox 360 with my dad, however somewhere in the middle of the game my xbox had met its fatal end and I was never able to complete the game back when I was in Elementary school. When I first found that it was available for PC and it was on steam I was so excited I bought it right away, yet didn't play it. Instead I looked into it's predecessor ""The Longest Journey"".The game is ten times more satisfying if you have previous knowledge or experience playing the first game ""The Longest Journey"" in April Ryan's point of view. I couldn't be bothered actually playing the first game myself since I have a hard timegetting into games with really low graphics, so Instead I watched an entire playthrough of the first game no commentary before starting the second one. I am super glad I did, since they referenced several things from the first game and acknowledged characters that I could actually recognize, it was just so satisfying to be able to recognize them.The only thing I didn't like about the game was the lack of consequence or choice effect in the game, whether you chose to do one thing or not didn't effect anything in the story. The most difference it did was effect one aspect of gameplay to make something harder or difficult, like silently disarming a guard or attacking them full on, going the long way around, or taking a short cut. The only differences were dialogue, and even then, most of the dialogue was mandatory to read anyways leaving little to none replayability.At the same time, I liked that there was lack of choices I know I'm contradicting myself... It was telling you a story in the way they visioned it instead of you putting your own input to it. I loved it, to it's very end. I also got super excited hearing the news of the third installment Dreamfall Chapters, and knowing that the choices DO actually effect storyline and have tons of replayability. 10/10 Definitely worth playing, Highly recommend playing or watching a playthrough of the first game beforehand though. P.S The Soundtrack is beautiful.  "

												This game will remain among my absolute favourites, together with the original TLJ. This is not in contradiction with admitting that the gameplay is often lacking, and the puzzles have not been very puzzling. It's been a run-through.But this game has given me something that very few games seem to offer: first of all, immersion and identification with the characters, all very much ""alive"", recognizable, with strong personalities and different, clashing beliefs. But, most importantly, a rich, complex and simply wonderful plot and storytelling.There are several themes, and no easy resolution; but the game dares facing things like scientific and technological development, the world of art, magic, creativity, religion, faith and its loss, dreams and their values, questioning of beliefs, the relationship of all these elements in the world and in the human mind.Finally, the state of entertainment (therefore, games too) and the value of storytelling, and our risk of losing it.Loved it.

Unfortunately, the gameplay is lacking. Controls are only adequate and the camera is pretty bad. However, the game does not strictly require it to be more precise either. The fighting is an embarrassment and should have been left out, but thankfully there's not much of it. The puzzles are very easy and most should be able to complete this without getting stuck for more than a few minutes.I still recommend it though. Funcome have always been good at writing and this game really delivers a good story. Near the end it gets really interesting.			"

Which is wonderful and tragic. It leaves with as many mysteries as answers though (that lead into the next game Dreamfall: Chapters). A lot of its beauty is brought through the story, but there's just the way the game was crafted, little visual and audio things that impact the player more then you'd think. I'd recommend it to anyone.			"

												TL:DR An adventure game with a great setting and interesting story. Its terrible (but thankfully infrequent) combat sections and poor voice acting lets it down slightly.Full Version:The Dreamfall universe is a very interesting one. You've got Stark, which is basically our world but more futuristic, and Arcadia,a sort of fantasy world with magic, with both worlds seperate and still sort of linked. A small few people have the ability to travel between both. You start off playing as Zoe Castillo, who is the games main character and a resident of Stark. As the story progresses you get to play as April Ryan, the main character of this games predecessor The Longest Journey, and Kian, a sort of holy warrior. The story and the duel settings in particular are interesting and are what kept me invested in the game. The gameplay is mainly of the traditional adventure game sort with a lot of dialogue and cutscenes as well as a  (thankfully) little bit of combat which is poorly executed and doesnt fit with the rest of the game.However its the story that is the main selling point here. Its also worth mentioning that playing the Longest Journey or at least reading a synopsis of that games story is advisable as some of the lore and characters might be a bit confusing and the game sometimes assumes you have this knowledge.Good points:- The games settings of  futuristic Stark and fantasy Arcadia are great and the relationship and lore between them is interesting enough to keep you wanting more.- The story is quite good which is important for this type of game and having April and Kians sections is a welcome break from the dull Zoe.Bad points:- the voice acting is pretty terrible for some characters. Theres one minor female character with an exotic accent that sounds like they kidnapped the voice actress from the airport and forced her to dothe lines at gunpoint. The dialogue was also a bit glitchy at times as every now and again the dialogue would skip.-the combat it a steaming pile of crap. You have a light attack, heavy attack and a block button. But its like trying to control a an arthritis riddled person to fight agaisnt another person with arthritis who happens to be severely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Thankfully though these combat segements arent very frequent and are easy enough. They just add nothing to the game.			"

												What this game lacks in gameplay, it more than makes up for in the most fantastic story writing and design. Although this game is a sequel to the game ""The Longest Journey"", a very famous point-and-click adventure game, Dreamfall stands out as a remarkably wonderful and immersive storytelling experience with some limited puzzles spread through the game. You do not have to have played ""The Longest Journey"" to understand this game, and perhaps the game is better played if one does not know the story of ""The Longest Journey"" so that there is a greater aura of mystery to push you on. I played this game without having played ""The Longest Journey"" before, and I found the mystery to be great, the story fantastic, and all around one of the most worthwhile uses of my time.			"

												This game is quite a downgrade of the original game in terms of gameplay. But it doesn't mean the game is bad. The 3d aspect of the game doesn't really add much to gameplay but it does give an amazing perpective to the gorgeous and immersive atmosphere. All other aspect like graphics, sound, characters are superb. Puzzles are nice too. The most important thing: Story. It feels like there are cliffhanger all over the place and I can stop playing, wanting to know more.8/10 A let down if I have to compare it the first game but still amazing.			"

												I started out playing this game, before jumping to The Longest Journey, when having come back to this game my heart swelled as I then knew more about the world that I was being submersed into. This is a new set of characters going on a 'new' journey, however they ultimately are all connected with one another. If you enjoyed The Longest Journey, I would definitely recommend Dreamfall: The Longest Journey. Dreamfall: TLJ fulfills the promise of being story-rich and submersive as much as TLJ. I absolutely loved the experience and the memories this game has left me with. Seeing old faces from TLJ was well worth the wait, I did go on to play Dreamfall Chapters because I've become so emersed with the lives of the characters involved.I did not particularly enjoy the combat aspect of it as it took away from the point and click that was TLJ, but I did learn to adjust.

												Dreamfall: The Longest Journey provides a truly immersive and memorable gaming experience.  This is the the second entry in the ""Longest Journey"" saga and continues to provide an intriguing story line, interesting characters and beautiful visuals.  Dreamfall is an adventure game akin to the point-and-click games of old, but also provides an optional control scheme to accomodate for the use of gamepads.  The game is not perfect, however, as I found the combat to be quite forgetable and seemingly unecessary.  Also, the character animations are rather stiff and some of the puzzles were not very challenging.  Of course, this is a game that released several years ago on the original Xbox as well as PC, so that is something to keep in mind when it comes to the graphics.  I would recommend Dreamfall: The Longest Journey to fans of adventure games and RPGs, as well as those who are looking for an imaginative and intriguing story in a game.  The first game in the series, ""The Longest Journey,"" is also available here on Steam for those who wish to start with that one, which is an amazing old school adventure game.  Also, ""Dreamfall Chapters"" was recently announced for launch later this year and will be the next and final entry in the series.   Adventure fans and those of you who can appreciate a well told story, GIVE THIS SERIES A SHOT!  Happy gaming!			"

												This is a good adventure game. Not as long as the original but still just as unique and weird. The story is good and the dialogue is still mad, funny and random, especially when you meet Blind Bob.There are a few bugs in the game such as characters getting stuck while walking, who do eventually free themselves.There are walls and stuff to hide behind to escape certain enemies, some of these hiding places caused the character to get stuck and never got free again, then I had to reload the save, so it's a terrible bug but it happens right after an auto save anyway, and you can save whenever you want.There is fighting in this game for no apparent reason, maybe because it was released on xbox, the fighting is so cheap you will laugh at it, and thats all the enjoyment you get from it.A big problem for me is is that it was released on the Xbox, and when PC games are on consoles the PC version always gets♥♥♥♥♥♥upon in favour of the console version. So you will find dodgy controls and a♥♥♥♥♥♥camera, if you can get past this and you liked the original, or just like weird adventure games, you will enjoy this game.			"

												This is the sort of game that you either love it, hate it, or find yourself swinging suddenly from one to the other. Its a sequel to the longest journey which was originally a point and click adventure/puzzle game with a very strong plot. This is sort of similar, except that its more adventure based and is only the beginning of the game with more chapters to come. What you need to be aware of  however is that the creators added what is possibly one of the worst cameras ever and definately the worst combat feature ever. This, in my opinion as someone who loved its predecessor, ruined the game. There were times were I simply wanted to stop playing because the combat was messed up. It seemed very basic, as though they added it in as a feature which means that the controls are simple but clunky and the characters movements make it very hard to actually succeed. Combat occurs in the game often enough  for the creators to seriously put more effort in, but you get so drawn into the plot that it is easy to forget about until it appears again. The camera is awful at first but you can get used to it after a while although the awkwardness rears its ugly head once combat begins. The plot however is fantastic, exactly what you would have expected as a sequel to the longest journey. So don't misunderstand me, I would totally recommend this game purely because of the plot alone. The camera and combat are just things that you need to be aware of before you start playing. Also that the game is unfinished but you can still get a few good hours of play from it, although it ends quite suddenly and abruptly at a major point in the plot.Long story short, the game has many flaws but can stand alone on the strength of the plot.

												Dreamfall: The Longest Journey is an adventure game released for the Windows and Xbox platforms in 2006 and is the sequel to Funcom's The Longest Journey, which itself was released in 1999. The roughly 13 hours long story takes place ten years after the events of the first game and focuses on three characters, Zoë Castillo, April Ryan, and Kian Alvane.Graphically, this sequel is a step up above its predecessor showcasing a fully 3D world to explore. While the environment art is very nicely rendered, the 3D characters themselves look a little dated by today's standards. Music and sound are appropriately orchestral sounding and melodic and were a nice treat.Storywise, while the first game emphasized on the grandness, mystery and majestic scope of the two worlds Stark and Arcadia, Dreamfall takes a much more up close and personal look at the lives of the inhabitants. Characters that you know from the first game do make their return and is especially nice to see how they have evolved. It was especially interesting to see how the first game's protagonist April Ryan had matured, even though some may not like the new direction she has taken. Because this is a sequel, it is advisable to have played the original game first to better appreciate some of the story elements.The story is not without its faults however as I felt the pacing seemed to be slow at the earlier chapters. It does pick up pace right around Chapter 6 as the plot slowly unravels. Although It is an intriguing tale, some parts felt unfinished as there are some questions that remain unanswered even at the end of the game which itself ends at a cliffhanger. This is a tale in which the journey is definitely more rewarding then its destination. Hopefully the upcoming Dreamfall: Chapters due to be released in 2014 will provide more closure to the story.Downsides, the game felt really linear even for an adventure game. You are never given multiple puzzles to solve at a time and can only progress in a very linear fashion. Focus field (which is the game's way of interacting with hotspots/objects) also felt very awkwardly implemented. It makes the protaganist look like a robot scanning for items.Because this game was also made for the XBox, there are way too many loading screens even though certain areas looked like they could've been connected together. This really kills the immersion sometimes, and it would've been alot better if they just freeze the screen and have a little loading bar at the bottom instead of just completely blackout the screen and showing the game's title for the umpteenth time.The game also introduced some combat and stealth elements which I felt was very shoddily designed and very tacky. (Eg: Winning a combat means to just spam the attack button. Sometimes the opponent just stupidly stands there without even doing anything!) Had they been designed and implemented well, I wouldn't have minded, but as they are now, they really felt out of place and unnecessary.The game also did not have any ingame maps and there is alot of travelling back and forth between locations. There isn't any way to warp between them, and it is very painful to have to slowly jog all over the place. It really felt like a very cheap way to artificially lengthen the gameplay time. The ability to at least increase the character's movement speed would've been very welcome here.Overall Rating: 6.0 / 10In conclusion, this is a worthy sequel to the original game but is let down by its technical issues / questionable gameplay design which hinders the enjoyment somewhat. If you had enjoyed the first game, definitely pick this up and if you are willing to endure its flaws, you will experience a story that matches and sometimes even exceeds the quality of original.

												The game has three stages: frustration to start with, a very enjoyable story and a disappointing ending.  1) Frustration - the default control settings for PC are terrible. I had to invert the X and Y mouse settings to get anywhere.   2) Enjoyable Story - a deep and interesting story, full of promise, about the meeting of two worlds in dreams.  Beautiful graphics, easy enough to play and worth the effort.  3) Disappointment - the developers wanted to make a sequel so bad, they made the mistake of leaving the story completely unfinished. Nothing is resolved, there only sadness and loss. Although I was a fan of the Longest Journey, and mostly enjoyed playing Dreamfall, the ending ruins the experience and I almost wish they hadn't bothered making it. This game was misnamed - it should be called ""Dreamfall: Part 1""			"

												I'm a fan of The Longest Journey, but unfortunately I can't recommend this sequel. If you really want to play it, reason being you want to see how the story continues, be prepared for boring and clunky gameplay.The game can be broken up into a few categories: dialog/cutscenes (story), exploration, fetch quests, ""stealth"" gameplay, and combat. The story is solid, and the exploration is just ok. Everything else is flat out bad. The ""stealth"" gameplay doesn't fit and it's cumbersome. The combat makes Morrowind's combat look like the pinnacle of game design. The fetch quests are just repetitive and pad the amount of time it takes to complete the game.If all you want is to see the story continuation, I'd recommend another avenue like watching cutscenes on youtube and reading the story on a wiki page. If you do choose to play this one just know that it'll feel like work.			"

												I recommend this to anyone that likes a good story, because that certainly is this game strongest point. You don't have to play the first game in the series, but you will get more out of the references, returning characters, and world in general if you have played the first and gotten to know Arcadia before this game.The controls are... a bit annoying at first, both combat and sneaking are really bad. But luckily you get used to it after awhile, so it doesn't drag the experience down too much. The game has a variety of characters, most of them interesting and/or fun. As for our two leading ladies, Zoe and April. They are just so cute, and they both have both adorable and funny moments (which I appreciate) in the middle of this dramatic journey. They are also both flawed in their own ways, but their cuteness and capabilities outshine that, so it more adds to the complexity of them.As for the third playable character, Kian... Here is a character that seems to be defined entirely by his gender in this story. He is about as interesting as that sword he loves waving around, which is to say not at all. He is strong, tough, manly, honorable. And all his flaws come from him being too manly, too tough, too selfrighteous and confident. None of his parts really added anything good to the story or the experience for me.The music is mostly great. I say mostly because a few times it is really distracting There is a romantic/kissing scene, where the music makes the whole thing super cheesy, and in a section near the end the music and song pulled me out of the experience, until it stopped when I got to the next cutscene... Just so loud and distracting in a periode where I think silence would have been more powerful.The best part of this game is the story and the emotions of the characters. And while there are times when it isn't perfect, it mostly nails it. When it needs to feel serious and dark, it does. When it tries to be cute, it gets super cute and makes me just want to hug and cuddle the leads, even if those girls are more capable and bigger badasses than I will ever be. And when it tries to be funny it is. And when it wants the story to be tragic and sad, it pulls it off pretty well as well.So yeah, if you can suffer through the controls, the combat and stealth sections of the game in particular, there is a great story here for you. And the return of one of my favorite sidekicks, Crow! All shall fear the power of his beak, humor, and small bird-brain! "

Playstation 1 awkward.- Ridiculous writing:  I don't want to throw down the feminism card, but there are a LOT of hints towards it.  There's a quote in there saying something to the effect of, ""And this is why women should rule the world"".  Character dialog leaves NOTHING to the imagination.  Words.  So many ♥♥♥♥ing words.  You can't guess or infer what a character is thinking or feeling.  They tell you.  They don't stop telling you.  Even the male characters will rattle on about every ♥♥♥♥ing feeling in the sun they are feeling.  Holy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  I get that the character models are not fluidly animated, but jesus tapdancing christ--- the audience can get what two characters are feeling by the music and setting.- Bat♥♥♥♥♥♥insane story that switches (yes, switches) between Sci-Fi and Medieval Fantasy.- Main character doesn't shut up.- Puzzles are easy.  Navigating is the difficult part.+ Pretty cool story.  Its maybe unique?  Well.. not really.+ The settings are well defined.+ Music is nice.+ Setting is very well defined.  Once again, they really did a great job there.+ Right clicking will skip through a line of dialog. Do all girls talk that much?  I wouldn't know.  I've never had a girlfriend before.  Or talked to a girl pls help (´・ω・)			"

												I've been waiting for this game since I was 8 years old. And, no kidding, it took me 3 years to complete a single puzzle. I know...But all this time, I just couldn't hate it. The story is amazing, the concept and the ideas are amazing, the characters, although the graphics don't really help, are powerful and the game is atmospheric. Loved it.			"

While having a few flaws, fans will enjoy this follow upYEA! Overall the story is quite good Despite its age it still looks good Has full controller supportMEH! Story can be slow at times Some bugs that involve in game cutscene characters to get stuck in objects Voice acting is hit or missBLEH! Combat is just awful, should've not been included Puzzles are too easy and very far in between  More like an interactive movie than a gameHow it Runs:Runs great at modern high resolutions at high frame rates without issues. Has full controller support as well. Other than some bugs with characters getting stuck in doorways for cutscenes(reloading checkpoint will eventually fix it), it is in excellent shape. Overall grade AThe Gist:Dreamfall presents a decent sequel to The Longest Journey, that brings back your favorite old characters and what has happened to them. With a story that itself is quite good most of the time it does have some excruciatingly slow moments but it ends with a nice twist and a longing to see what awaits in the sequel. While not all is good, terrible tacked on combat is boring and stupid that would be better served via cutscenes, as well as a severe lack of anything that should be called a puzzle. The game basically plays as an interactive movie moving from scene to scene. Fans of the first game will see this as a must play, but a outside observer will probably be put off. "

												To be completely honest, I bought this game not expecting much.  But this game, it changed me.  It is b-e-a-u-t-i-f-u-l.  I cried at the ending.  This is my favorite game, and I cannot wait for Dreamfall: Chapters to be released this Novemember so I finally find out what happens with my precious Zoe.  P.S. Yes, the combat is stupid.  But the game was never about combat haha; I don't even know why in the world it was incorporated.  Thankfully, Dreamfall: Chapters has not combat.			"

												Dreamfall is a heavy storyline game.  This is good if you're like me and like games that have a great storyline.  There's also heavy dialogue throughout the game.  This may be a good thing depending on what you like.  If you're not into story-based games you may not want to play it.  If you skip dialogues you'll miss the story and may not know what to do next.  It's not all dialogue.  There's more exploring and adventure than anything.  This game has a mix of sci-fi futuristic and medieval environments.  This game has a feel of Tomb Raider on how the adventure gets exciting.  If you're a fan of story-based games you must play this.  I also have to gripes about this game too, not real bad but must be said.  The game is a little old so the graphics are dated but still good for the game.  If you're like me and play it with a Xbox controller you need to take the time to adjust the controller settings.  If you don't you'll be pulling your hair out. The mouse, oh I hate the mouse in this game. Even when playing with a controller the mouse arrow never goes away so you have to drag it to the corner.  But please take note: do not drag the mouse into the lower right corner of the screen.  Windows has that feature ""show desktop"" and for some reason the game doesn't ignore it.  If you drag your mouse to that corner the framerate will suffer greatly!  Keep the mouse out of the lower right corner!  I thought my game was broken but it was that little glitch that messes it up.  Finally, the fighting.  There's a few places where combat takes place.  Normally I'd welcome it but this game isn't easy to fight with.  The controls are stiff and unless you practice in the dojo level (at the beginning of the game) you'll fight bad.  The game is mostly moving around and getting from A to B and the fight scenes aren't big and very few.  It's just annoying.  Otherwise it's still worth playing.  It has a great story and I can't wait to play the sequel.ProsStoryMusicVoice actingDialoguesFuturistic/Medieval environmentsEnding was goodConsController - settings had to be set, don't trust default settingsMouse - just everything about the mouse (stay out of lower right corner!)Fighting - it's just badLanguage - there's foul language in this game.

												This is a reluctant, perhaps backhanded, recommendation, no scratch that. I don't recommend this game, UNLESS you really enjoyed The Longest Journey's plot/world. I'm not really going into the plot, visuals, voice acting, except to say I really wasn't taken with them so much. As a continuation of The Longest Journey, it is definitely satisfying to revisit the world and check in with the various characters from the original, but this is in spite of the rest of the game. First, there's combat, and it's bad. It's awkward as hell, it plays sort of like a bad minigame from Final Fantasy or something.  Basically it tries to be Rock Paper Scissors with very silly looking animations: fast attacks beat strong attacks, strong attacks beat blocks, blocks beat fast attacks, and circling beats. Enemies only ever approach one at a time, and the whole thing just comes off as a stupid, tedious affair. Not really difficult to deal with, but there was no reason to include it, or implement in the way they did. It takes away much more than it adds.Next there are stealth sections, and they're also pretty terrible. Your character has a 'stealth mode' for movement, which is frustratingly slow. It's not required on every stealth section, but the game doesn't do all that much to indicate to you when you need it and when you don't. Patrols and security are very simple, and these sections are once again pretty tedious. I don't really feel like they added anything much to the game, and the world would be better off if they were handled more like point and click puzzles where once a solution is found you don't have to continue sighing and playing around whatever issue. Then there are the item puzzles, which weren't all bad, but lots of obnoxious back tracking which just wastes time(really missing the ability to skip time from the first one). A couple also weren't very intuitive and of course there's the song cave puzzle which gives no hints whatsoever basically forcing you to bruteforce a 4 point permutation (or look it up because who can be asked). Basically every other puzzle in the game is: use your phone on X, use the one item other than your phone you have in your inventory, talk to that person again. I never really felt challenged, but I was a bit annoyed. Seriously, I've played first person shooters with harder puzzles.And, guess what? The plot ends on a cliffhanger. Very disappointing. Conversation options don't really seem to matter either, that's kinda okay I can understand not wanting to bother with branching story, but the choice doesn't matter if the outcome is the same.If they refined the above sections this game could've been like Beyond Good and Evil, well maybe it could've been. Everything about this game just felt like a half-hearted attempt, and I'd give it a half-hearted recommendation except that's really not a recommendation is it?			"

												I've been a huge fan of The Longest Journey, so when I saw this game come out, I was ecstatic.  Unfortunetly, this game didn't really live up to the hype for me.  Before I get lynched, I'll list pros and cons:Pros:+The storyline itself was pretty good.  I loved the lore and it was the only reason I actually finished the game. +Graphics and environment were pretty; it was fun walking around Casablanca and Archadia+Hacking mini games were okay.  Not difficult.Cons-It was hard to sneak around (probably because I was just bad at it, so it's not a huge deal), and they required a lot of sneaking.-Controls were a bit clunky-Very short game; finished it in 11 hours.-The combat system, it pretty much killed it for me.-Disappointing ending, destroyed what made the original game great. Overall, the only reason I would recomend this is to just continue the story to Dreamfall Chapters, but that's what Youtube is for, folks.5/10			"

												After finishing Dreamfall Chapters, I wanted to go back to the earlier games and play through them again.  I have Dreamfall: Longest Journey on Xbox, but it's no longer compatible so I got it for the PC, not realizing how horribly optimized it is for PC.  Don't get me wrong, I love the story, but the controls are so wonky with mouse and keyboard and there are annoying little bugs that force a restart (thankfully, usually close to an autosave point.).  I want to recommend this game for story, but the problem with actually getting to that story force me to suggest you try to find a copy for the Xbox, which it worked fine on, if you still have a system that can run that.Okay, those grivances out of the way, this is not a game for people who like action games.  It's a point-and-click adventure game at it's heart, but there are some stealth and combat portions which feel tacked on.  It adds some variety between the sometimes rather long-winded monologue portions, but yeah, it just doesn't quite fit right.			"

												Dreamfall: The Longest Journey is a fantastic 3rd person action brawler that rivals Devil May Cry or God of War in fast-paced action. There are brief bits of inconsequential story tacked on.No wait, the opposite of that.Dreamfall: The Longest Journey is a fantastic narrative-driven adventure game. I started the series because I saw the trailers for Dreamfall Chapters and wanted to get caught up on the story. I played it immediately after finishing The Longest Journey (which I reviewed here), so it was interesting to compare the two.Dreamfall definitely holds up better than TLJ from a technical standpoint. Being able to play at 1080p and 120Hz was a breath of fresh air, and the graphics are clean and recognizable. They've also thankfully foregone the most egregious uses of classic 90’s adventure game tropes (combining an object with every other object, pixel hunting, etc.). Unfortunately in its place they put some pretty mundane combat and stealth sections, but those sections are mercifully brief and infrequent. The story is where this series really shines, and Dreamfall definitely delivers. I don’t want to go into too many specifics, but it was very interesting and thought-provoking to say the least. As always I was very satisfied with the writing, though I felt the voice acting wasn’t as strong as The Longest Journey. It was also kinda creepy how everybody’s bodies are completely stationary while talking – only their mouths move, which is slightly unsettling.All in all I still greatly enjoyed it – though I would definitely recommend playing The Longest Journey first so you can get all the references and callbacks, plus you get to be amazed at seeing familiar places recreated in FULL THREE DEEEE. If you enjoy narrative-driven games I highly recommend it.			"

												I played Dreamfall back in 2006 when it first came out... and it blew me away.  The game played more like an interactive movie, with a stirring soundtrack, great voice acting, fantastic graphics/setting and a story that held my attention like no other before it.  Although it is a sequel to the ""Longest Journey"" you can still enjoy it if you have not played the original.  If you like science fiction adventure games you MUST play this... plan on losing track of time for about 15-20 hours.			"

												I love Longest Journey.It's one of my all time favorites.I was aware of Dreamfall from its release, but somehow just never got around to playing it until now.Christ, I wish I hadn't.There's loads to complain about, but I'll focus on the most important part; the story.It's non-existent. They take everything they've established in the first game and then dilude it beyond recognition. There's a pointless combat mechanic that's used a whopping 4 times (pro tip: spam heavy attack, unblockable) and the lack of puzzles makes it just a question of walking between places and dialogue skipping your way to the end.Pointlessly they make you switch between characters which happens wayyyyy too often near the end, to the point of there being shot-reverse-shot conversations where you choose the dialogue for both! You literally talk to yourself.Really, they had one job here. Make half of a Fantasy RPG and half of a Sci Fi RPG and mush them together. They did neither. The game then fully realizes its offense and decides to end on a 'cliffhanger'.Honestly, at the end I just didn't care anymore.If you've played Longest Journey, skip this.If you haven't, play that instead.

												Dreamfall: The Longest Journey isn't as long as The Longest Journey and gameplay is also a little different. It's not a point and click adventure like the first game is. It is an adventure game though, make no mistake. There are however less puzzles, not very hard ones either, and it plays out more like a movie. You are very seldom given a conversation option. The voice acting is alright, some of it is below average. The weakest link in the game is the combat system, it's clunky and unnecessary. I wish they would have left it out of the game. If you like adventure games I can highly recommend it because it has an interesting story. It takes you back to Arcadia at times and lets you revisit old locations and characters from the previous game. Definitely worth a play just for the story.			"

This game, was bad.The very worst of it: It does not do justice to the first game at all, ruining April's Character entirely (""I've changed!"" she says repeatedly to dismiss poor writing), lacking all humour the first had, and ending very poorly just to set it up for another sequel.There's a few more, less glaring issues but still quite bad.- This game includes combat. Very dull and badly executed combat. You have a block, light attack and heavy attack. Enemies just stand there while you pelt them, everything feels incredibly stiff, and there are several 'fights' that you cannot win at all. Only in one instance is fighting used to the benifit of the gameplay, in that it presents the player a choice between 'Be clever' or 'Punch her'.- There are multiple instances where your character can become stuck and a save must be loaded.- Hacking minigames.Lets try say something nice- It's nice to see certain locations and characters from the Longest Journey in 3D. A lot of good throwbacks.- Some neat ideas presented, and a lot of neat locations to explore. Nice world all in all.- Crow.			"

												The Longest Journey is one of my all-time favorite games, but Dreamfall was really disappointing. I played it when it was first released and decided to re-buy it on Steam thinking I should give it another chance, but...nope.It's visually stunning, and it's nice to see what became of April's friends in Stark. But I will never understand what possessed them to follow up a point-and-click adventure game with a game that requires precision and dexterity (and uses half-baked combat and movement controls that make precision nearly impossible). If I wanted to play a sneaking or fighting game, I'd play Thief or Half-Life.The interactive conversations from Longest Journey are also gone, replaced with console-friendly cutscenes where you have little input into the dialogue.It's pretty clear that they made this as a console game and put zero thought into how to port it to PC. The end result is an exercise in frustration with a storyline that just stops in the middle with no conclusion.Here's hoping Dreamfall: Chapters is an actual adventure game instead of a badly-ported console fighting game.

												This game series is simply amazing! I will say, it fell a bit short at the end and changing focus from April Ryan to someone we've never even heard about, Zoe. That being said, she is still a great and interesting character. The ending just makes me want to buy the newest game right now and damn the consequences for not having the money!Now the game itself is very different from it's prequal. this game is not point-and-click, but it has many of it's elements. You walk around using WSDA and select highlighted objects when you get close to them and use your mouse. You also have the item combination ability too, to solve the various puzzles in the game.What surprised me the most when I had it loaded up and waited to see scenes from the gameplay, is that there is a combat mechanic in the game. Not vital (as you can still use your brain or talk/sneak your way around situations instead), but a very interesting addition as it gives you more options as to what paths to go down.Well worth the purchase if you own the first game and if you don't, you better get the first game before this!

												This game excels at making you walk thousands of miles to collect something only to make you return to where you started. Generally the puzzles are infantile and extremely simplistic. I powered through the last few hours praying that I would reach the end soon. I was really dissapointed as I enjoyed The longest journey and generally love point and click adventure games. The graphics were passable and the main character hot as hell which is fortunate as for no apparent reason on several occasions she ended up strolling around in her pants. Loads of graphical glitches and getting stuck in doorways and narrow cooridoors as well as some scratchy sound effects and voice acting.  The most annoying thing however, was the ridiculous sneaking which might work if you could actually fully control the camera and see past your own head!

												I tried. I really did try.Dreamfall and its predessor, The Longest Journey, are often praised by adventure game fans, and I like adventure games, but I just cannot find anything to like about either of these. In Dreamfall's case, the adventure/puzzle component has been stripped down to a bare minimum and combat and stealth has been put in to make up for it. The trouble is, it doesn't do any of these things well, so by trying to appeal to ""everybody"", it becomes decidely mediocre at everything.This isn't purely down to the game's age, as even fans of the game recognised these shortcomings at its release, but still praised its story. Well, after 7 hours, I can't share those sentiments either. The ""twin worlds"" idea of ""technology"" and ""magic"" is a naive concept at best (what do you think stoves, spinning wheels and doors ARE if not technology?), fate and destiny and conspiracies and ancient civilizations are potentially great sources to mine for a story but I found nothing new or interesting about any of it, at least not by the half-way point. The voice acting is terrible by today's lofty standards, which I accept is an unfair criticism of a relatively low-budget game, but the end result is something that comes across as amateur.I've sat through worse games, and to call it terrible would be doing it a disservice, but the shoddy stealth/combat bits comined with a fiddly camera have broken this particular camel's back and I cannot summon the will to continue.On the plus side, I had no problems getting the game running properly this time, which was nice.

												The sequel to The Longest Journey, and it does not hold up.The story is not the problem, it is the execution of it. A lot of exposition dumps at the end and fells unfinished. It does have some interesting characters like Roper Klacks form the original game and the beggar, the rest are forgettable. It lacks the meat of the story that makes me care about the characters and the events.It is in 3D, for some reason, and by that I mean, combat and stealth sections which are unnecessary and not beneficial to the experience. It does have prettier graphics, but they are mostly wasted as the world is quite empty.You play as 3 characters: Zoey who is tasked by other characters to do ""stuff"" and is optimistic every step of the way.April (from the first game), she has her own problems now, and for her, they are more important now than the balance.Kian, skilled warrior with a heart of gold, that sees the errors of his cult. I guess! he is barely in the game.The puzzles are in very few numbers and not that hard, there are a few dialogue options that will provide alternate ways to continue.The story, it does not bring as much wanderlust as the first, both worlds have new governments and have adapted to the changes. Zoey is a ""normal-rich"" girl, who is minding her business when her ex-boyfriend gives her a task, that will raise a lot of questions that need answers, also a static anomaly tells you to ""save April"". So you fallow the trail you get to meet Aprils old gang, you go to the other world, find April, she has her own problems. April and Kian's story end in the other world, you go to a factory with a few puzzles and get to listen to a Exposition Dump about the static anomaly, which is indeed sad, but my interaction being zero, is even sadder, after which you go home and are booted to the final chapter where you simply go forward and listen to more exposition, The End. I mean, cliffhanger, more in the sequel.			"

												So I actually have mixed feelings about this game, but as a stand alone game aside from the rest of the series it has to be my least favorite one. To recap, you are continuing from the Longest Journey series of the heroine April Ryan and her adventures in Arcadia and ""Stark"". The game has you starting off as Zoe Castillo from Casablanca  who seeks to help her ex-boyfriend Reza with a story he was working on. Things happen, and you end up as Zoe going to Arcadia where many of the original characters are at. For those unaware, this series has a sequel after this one as Dreamfall: Chapters. The storyline is still good. You can actually watch this game like a movie and its really enthralling. I really loved the Longest Journey, but given the gap in development of course I expected a different type of gameplay. This game certainly has a bit more action, however, there are some frustrating elements. For example, there are many times in this game where you have to do some stealthy movements where the slightest wrong move will cause you to lose. It reminds me of Hitman, which I actually liked, but going into this game I wanted to relax and enjoy the story. I have two set modes when I'm playing games, high adrenaline for action games, and mellow enjoyment for point and click games like this. There's also one particular part in the game where you're in a cave and I had to watch a YouTube video to prevent myself from rage quitting. Based on the comments on YouTube a lot of people got frustrated with the game at this point. There are some minor bugs, but don't thankfully haven't prevented me from completing the game. The bugs are usually problems in getting to certain parts where the character seems to be stuck on an invisible wall. If you play around with the resolution sometimes that fixes the problem. That being said, I am now playing Dreamfall: Chapters. I haven't completed it yet, but it seems to really fix a lot of complaints people had with this game. It really makes up for the previous game, and I recommend continuing on with the series. If you're like me you might just like to complete all the games for the sake of completing series, and I understand that. Its not completely unbearable so if you must do play it!Tl;dr Nice story, irritating gameplay. Play Dreamfall: Chapters because it makes up for this one.			"

												Fantasy Adventure*Dated but fair graphicsOverall 2 out of 5Complexity 2Graphics 4Immersive 3Innovative 2Game Pace 2This feels like watching a random guy in Youtube, watching some other random people playing a game in observer mode.Above anything else I could say about this game, there’s this huge feeling that not only you don’t have any impact on the game (I don’t even mean making choices), as the characters you follow pretty much watch things happen for the whole 18 hours of gameplay.I loved the first The Longest Journey, but this sequel only shows something remotely interesting when it refers to the first. Everything in the story is shallow and blunt, in special the characters.You play three different characters in order of appearance:Zoe Castillo: Cute Spanish girl that you want to like, but simply can’t. All she does is walk around and complain about her lack of interest on things. You do get to play detective with here, but at the end it’s only so you learn about the story. You cannot even make the smallest decisions, like not kissing that blond guy that never appears again.April Ryan: I love April from the first game she is fun, curious, driven and bold. In this game, a plank with a sad face on it could very well substitute her. She nags the whole time and gets about nothing done. Of course other characters mention she has not been herself, but even if that’s supposed to be the reason she could at least be someone with some depth.Kian Alvane: The perfect action hero archetype. It’s not too difficult to excuse him for his apparently shallow personality, since it’s pretty much a given to action hero’s archetypes. There’s one thing though you do not forgive from them, not taking action. As “the girls”, he’s another execrator to everything.Blunt characters, no decision you make matter, a story clearly created to be only the hook for the sequence that only 9 years later they are managing to pull together, a tiny world, more loading screens than any other game I can remember… this is a disaster.I’m not sure that you could find many worst sequels, but if you forget the original game, this is playable. Not a good buy in any case.			"

												A disappointing follow up to The Longest Journey. I only recommend playing if you are completionist like me and are prepping for Dreamfall Chapters.Pros:- Continues the story of April Ryan with a new protagonist in the fascinating Stark and Arcadia worlds- Excellent writing and pacingCons:- Minimal real gameplay. Primarily fetch quests and the puzzle complexity is drastically reduced- Extremely underwhelming ending			"

												This game actually made me angry. If I had to describe it in one word I'd use ""dull"", which may not sound as terrible but, being a sequel to the magnificient piece of work that was TLJ, is a terrible insult (and, mind you, I don't have an idealized version of TLJ in my memory, I played it just before starting this one). And that's the thing; the game could pass as ""okay"" by itself, but it just doesn't make justice to the saga it belongs to.=== MILD SPOILERS AHEAD ===So, why did this game made me angry? Well:WORLDBUILDINGOr the lack of it. You see, playing TLJ I had the opportunity to learn about, I don't know, five religions, maybe ten magical races, each of them with their own story and myths, several fantastic regions, and that only in Arcadia. There was a solid common nexus to the whole story which was the Balance, its origin and its importance. On Stark, you would learn about the story of Newport, the space colonies or Bingo corporation. Some people might feel it was a bit too much or reading or talking (although most of it was optional), but maybe for the many fans of the game that is what made it great.In this game, there is basically no chance to learn about the backstory of anything or anyone. Some conversations will just drop some scattered information, and in a few rare cases (e.g. the Wati exhibition) maybe you can read some bits about the world, but that's it. No more long, elaborated stories and myths. Most of the times you just hear about people being ""special"" and some other cryptic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and you are supposed to accept that ""some things cannot be explained"" or something. Magic plays basically no role in this game, which is ridiculous when the premise is that there exists a ""magical world"" parallel to ours. I can't remember a single time a magical creature, or some magical spell, potion or similar had any impact in the plot. Everything is focused around the main character/s and everything else is just a blurry background.CHARACTERSAnd what characters are those. Most of the characters in this game are, as stated earlier, dull. The unexpressive voice acting of the main character didn't help, but anyway most of them are just ""good"" and ""bad"" without many significant personality traits. Kian is the only one that shows some sign of character evolution, but it's still mostly uninteresting. Secondary characters are not quirky, funny or memorable anymore; any of them pales in comparison to, say Burns Flipper or Captain Nebevay, to mention a couple from the top of my head. Reza, Damien, the friend with the computers shop, even Charlie and Emma, they just come and go for a short intervention not to be seen again. April is still kind of interesting, but there is no real progression of the character along the game. Also, again, there is basically no backstory for the characters, it's just dismissed with something like ""this guy has always been a loyal ally"", and that's all. Even the diary, which used to be a great way into the mind of the protagonist in TLJ, has now been reduced to ""X just happened, I should do Y"". On a more positive note, Crow is still pretty funny, to be fair.PLOTWhere is this game even going. So there's Wati corp, and there's the static, and there's the Azadi, and there's the White Kin, and then there's some more stuff. You would expect the story would end up converging to something solid around some specific theme, but it just really feel like they stop the story at an almost random point. Not only the plot is mostly unresolved, but even the resolved parts are unsatisfying. Most importantly, why the heck stopping the static would supposedly damage Wati (although it seems it didn't later)? What happened to Damian? What's the deal with Reza? Did they really spent the whole game building hype for an attack to the Azadi tower for nothing? In general, all the great plot moments that you would hope to take place don't. The Balance, the one plot core in TLJ that is the root for all the worldbuilding in the game, is suddenly something that doesn't seem to have any relevance to the plot (increasing the feeling of detachment between the events in Stark and Arcadia). I'd like to say that I can still hope for this to be just a messy prologue to Dreamfall: Chapters and everything will come into place there, but from what I have read/heard (I haven't played it yet), that doesn't seem to be the case.GAMEPLAYWhy did they have to mess this one up. I'm not saying that just because TLJ was a classic point-and-click this one had to be, but the thing is that there is almost no interesting gameplay in this game whatsoever. ""Puzzles"" are just idiotic (partly because the list of choices you have is not usually very long), combat and stealth sections are more clunky and annoying than exciting or challenging, and the ""hacking"" parts, well those were actually fun, but honestly it's just a small minigame (and really easy too). The rest is all walking long distances to talk with one or other guy, then come back the same distance, and then the story advances without you doing much. You don't have the sense of freedom that you used to have in TLJ, where you could go to many places and talk to many people trying to figure out how to go on. In general, you are just carried to the specific place where the story will takes place, do your thing and leave never to see the place again.TECHNICAL ISSUESHonestly, if the game was good in the previous aspects I wouldn't even mind this. And, don't get me wrong, there are some great things technically speaking in the game; some scenarios are really beautiful, the character designs are fine (although the expression of the protagonist seemed, again, rather dull) and voice acting is generally good (some better than other). However, as many have pointed out, the camera is really not cooperative, the inventory (even though for most of the game you just carry the same two objects) is not very comfortable to use, and I in particular had this glitch where every reflective surface (water, glass, metal...) would flicker constantly, making some specific scenarios really annoying to watch. As I said, I wouldn't say it's enough to say they ruin the game, but it certainly doesn't help its case.So, tl;dr: In my view, a game very inferior to TLJ. I understand that going into full 3D implies a whole new level of work, but honestly most of my complains are about story, characters and worldbuilding (which I'm not saying are easy topics, but they are not harder to do because of 3D). If you are a fan of the first one you may still play it and enjoy some parts, but do not expect it be as fun, exciting, challenging and in general good as that one was.			"

												This is the devolution of the fantastic point-and-click adventure game The Longest Journey.You play as two characters the bland and uninteresting Zoe, and the far more playable and engaging April. April being the character from the first game.This game takes a massive step back in terms of the voice acting and an even bigger step in the form of an addition of combat, which is clunky mal-placed and a thorough waste of time when it comes to the rest of the game. I cant say that I am a fan of it.The graphics are really nice and were stunning when it originally came out. The game is also very much a nostalgia trip for those who played the original game, visiting the same locations, interacting with the same people etc and builds on it but only fractionally.EDIT: This game does take a lot of time (for me) to get into. It feeds off of the nostalgia of the first game and does play it well but I stand by my original review. I loved it, but then I played The Longest Journey and now I can't say that I do.			"

												Very bad sequel :(I really want to like this game as I loved the first game.It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the awful combat and bad controls that make the combat even harder.The pace of the game is much slower than the first and has a lot of running back and forth with more loading screens and pointless item fetching.Pros:Story is part of the same universe with same characters.Some areas have nice graphics if a little old looking.Logic puzzles can be fun to play.Cons:Bad acting.Low quality cut scenes that don't help the atmosphere.Terrible combat.Pointless and annoying stealth sections.Slow death scenes that you can't skip.I'm only playing this becasue I bought it and I want to follow the story, it's either boring or frustrating in many parts of the game which let down the few good parts it has.Would have been better as a standard 2D point and click or if they removed the combat and stealth sections.Buy it if you must own all the games in the series, otherwise avoid it, there are many games better than this under the adventure game tag.

												Some may argue that DreamFall is a classic, like the game that came before it. If it wasn't for the fact that it was released in 2007 it could have been. It is only fair to compare games from the same year which were focussed on a strong narrative and see how Dreamfall compares. So lets take a few choice picks: Bioshock, Half-Life 2: Ep2 and Mass Effect.Stand Dreamfall side by side with these games and you'll see the problem. A strong narrative can be achieved in 3 distinct ways, The story itself can either be engaging with various twists, turns and intrigue. Or the presentation of the story itself can really be entertaining even if the story itself is simple. Or finally, a game has both a great storyline and presentation. HL2:Ep2 was a simple storyline which was well presented, Bioshock had an engaging storyline which had mediocre presentation and Mass Effect had both an amazing storyline and amazing presentation. Dreamfall however, has none of these.** MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD **The general plotline surrounds Zoe, an art student who is sinking into depression over her tedious life. Drop into the mix a sudden disappearence of her ex-lover and the story is away. Or at least, it manages a clumbsy take-off. The presentation of the story is done at a snails pace with it dragging out some very mundane 'secrets' which frankly you'd not be very keen to uncover. Around part-way through it drops an utterly pointless appearence by 'generic-broody-anti-hero' type known as Kian the Apostle and a cameo appearence of the previous games' April Ryan. The storyline around these two is both tedious and has absolutely no connection to the main plot except for the seemingly mysterious message driving Zoe forwards leading to the envitable encounter with April. The game spends an extended amount of time suggesting a great deal of links between the various parts of the tale but ultimately leaves you with unsatisfying loose ends. The ending itself is a slap in the face and feels like the last half of the game and story was completely pointless, it actually feels like the ending belongs in the middle of the storyline but the developers squandered that part by focussing on the resistance movement headed by Raven in Arcadia.I genuinelly had to force myself to keep playing through this game as the storyline became so bland and lifeless after the 5th chapter that I actually stopped playing for months. Occasionally I'd dip back in with the hopes that things would improve. Just as things got interesting I came to the realization that I'd actually reached the end of the game.While there seems to be Dreamfall chapters around now, you may be wondering - Would playing Dreamfall: Longest Journey actually give me greater appreciation of the storyline? The answer is no, because there is so little here that you are not missing a thing. Playing the original Longest Journey would be beneficial however.Oh and yeah, 7 hours on record. That is how long the game takes from start to finish. The fact I took months to complete it shows how tedious it was because in theory someone could finish everything in a weekend.			"

												Having played the first game when it came out and having played it a few times again and again, this title was a big let-down for me. First of all, having finished the title I really feel like I haven't actually played and I have gained no enjoyment whatsoever from this experience. Thinking back about it, guess what? It is because you actually don't play in this game. You ""play"" as 3 different characters each doing their part in the storyline which doesn't help connect with them at all. ""Playing"" consists of endless walking and talking to a few people with super huge and shallow dialogue sequences. Your inventory is small and at no time will you have more than 4-5 items (this happens only in a couple of sequences in the game only and 2 of them you have them on you always). Using items is restricted to some person telling you ""go there, pick up x and y and use them there to do z"".  There are a couple of boring and easy minigames, 2 or 3 puzzles (which can be challenging if you are brain-dead) and some ""action"" fighting. Fighting involves atrocious AI, messy controls and lots of boredom although boredom is a characteristic of the whole game. Literally 50% of the game is walking, 45% listening to dialogues and 5% (maybe even less) everything else.I purchased it after seeing the many good reviews. Seriously people, you like this thing? Even as a visual novel it's horrendous; the story doesn't make any sense at all and leaves lots of unanswered questions, dialogues are like you are talking to a 10-year old, characters are bland and boring and voice acting is very bad.I don't hate games. I like them, or not like them but still finish them. This title I hate wholeheartedly, first of all for wasting my time, secondly for ruining The Longest Journey forever for me after 17 years and thirdly for ripping me off. Even taking the emotional part out, this has to be one of the worst titles ever produced.I finished the title an hour ago and I've already forgotten about it. Granted I don't like visual novels in general, I have played visual novels that skip the boring and tedious pars and focus on the novel, which makes them infinitely better than this one. Out of the 10-11 hours you need to finish this thing, about half is walking. Calling this travesty a game is blasphemy and should be punishable by law, or even better by the wrath of God.			"

												Deeply flawed and disappointing sequel to a wonderful predecessor. Adventure elements were removed, utterly worthless combat system was added, the story makes no sense AND it ends halfway through with a promise of a sequel that never came. Good voice acting is the only good thing that remains from the previous game and, perhaps, some locations look alright - but these are not really worth hurting the memory of The Longest Journey.			"

												First: I liked the old adventures like Monkey Island or Zak McKracken. But this must be one of the most boring games I ever played. Be prepared for running the same way again and again and then some more times. About 80% of the time you have no indication of where you are supposed to go, no map, no quest indicator and no description of the way except ""at the south gate"" or ""to the ghetto"". No compass either btw to get to South Gate. The best bet ist always: at the exact opposite end of the town, alternating between the ends of town of course, so you can fully enjoy the about 8 loading screens - you encounter them about literally every 10 meters of way.The story at least tries to continue the story of the first game ""The Longest Journey"" and you encounter quite a lot of places and characters from that game, but unfortunately makes no sense at all contrary to the first game. There it made some sense to appear in a new world in your underwear as you traveled while sleeping. Here it seems to happen all the time - probably to distract from the lack of sense it all makes....So really: DON'T BUY IT!			"

												I was a big fan of the original game and I hate to compare it to the original but I have too. The original was far better, longer and well written. The reasons Dreamfall falls down is simple, controls and writing. They completely changed the control of the original and added in some weird fighting system which is very awkward. Apparently this game was ported to the xbox or more likely ported over from xbox to pc because the controls are awful. Some of the writing isn't great either While the story is interesting some of the characters come across very shallow. The backgrounds are still awesome. The models are improved on. But I can't forgive this game for the controls and writing. I would only recommend this to hardcore fans who really need their fix or to newcomers to point and clicks because it isn't much of a challenge. A far cry from the 10/10 first game.			"

												This game was a chore to play through. For fans of either point and click or action genres, this game is a boring slog that does not reward your patience.Controls are obviously set up with consoles in mind, leaving the PC controls extremely awkward.The combat system is pointless and seemed like an afterthought.Stealth is either boring or frustrating due to the awkward controls.Puzzles are significantly oversimplified and very unsatisfying.The game is told in the perspective of three different characters and while this is not always a bad thing, it was poorly executed in this game, ruining what immersion there could have been.The voice acting for the playable characters isn't bad, but other characters will often stop mid sentence because the game needs to change the page on the subtitles.If you haven't played the first game (The Longest Journey) you may find yourself scratching your head at some parts.The ending was not an ending. There are more unresolved plotlines by the end than at any other point during the game.There are a few bugs that cost you some time.The music was nice, the story was fairly interesting, and the graphics were a marginal improvement over the original (but it should be seeing as though it came out 6 years after.) They did a good job recreating a couple areas from the first game.			"

You play with 3 characters and they all find together (what a surprise) at the end (like an open end) but thats all i want to spoil.I really hope they still work on Dreamfall-Chapters. There are still something to tell in that story. ;)8/10			"

												Dreamfall is the second game in The Longest Journey-franchise. It is praised by many but I must disagree. I've played both the first game and this one and I must say that the first one is way better.In this one they have hyped up the graphics to the 2000's standard and made their own game engine it seems. All character has this blind stare into the distance while talking, with only their mouth and eyes moving, it's creepy as heck to look at.They've introduced fighting mechanics since the last game, and let me tell you, they are HORRIBLE and unbalanced. The enemy will 9/10 times whoop your♥♥♥♥♥because of this.Camera movement and movement overall (mouse and keyboard) are completely worthless and janky, Escape doesn't take you out of the menu or inventory, you HAVE to click the 'Resume Game' or inventory button to get back again. It's probably better with a gamepad, but a plain 360 controller isn't even picked up by the game..Puzzles in the game are too easy, not even worth calling puzzles because it's just ""go here, go there, pick this up, done"".Areas feels very empty, no people are around, most areas are just big empty places with very few things to interact with, and with the janky camera it's not even worth trying to look around and get a feeling of the place.The first game in the installment is much much better, voice actors have more feeling in their voices as well, helping with the immersion. I hope the third game (Dreamfall Chapters) will weight up for this piece of garbage called a ""puzzle"" game.Do yourself a favor and buy the first game instead. This game is just a dust collector with a few references and callbacks to the first one.			"

The only thing that comes even remotely close is the gameworld (at times..).EDIT: Tedious, meaningless puzzles.. (ie. you have to crouch in a specific place in order to ""activate"" a hide sequence to trigger an event that lets you proceed, even if the solution was already obvious).

												A direct sequel to The Longest Journey.I was really amazed playing The Longest Journey. Dreamfall, the sequel, fell slightly short of the bar set by the original, but having played the first title right before jumping into this one, there were a lot of little things I could appreciate quite a bit.Things I felt were improvements over the first title:- Better sense of direction- No more ridiculously complex ""we won't give you any hints, figure it out yourself"" puzzles.Areas where the first title felt superior to this sequel:- Imaginative world, setting, and character designs- Lack of facial animations in the original actually was an improvement, since Dreamfall's characters felt too stoic in their expressions.I recommend this game, but only after having played and enjoying the original The Longest Journey, as Dreamfall really is a pretty direct sequel in many ways.Here's hoping we get a 3rd entry in the series someday.

												Ragnar Tornquist's storytelling power doubles the immersion in the sequel to The Longest Journey. This tale draws more people into the surreal, mind-bending world(s) portrayed in the original, adds a touch of horror to the narrative, and continues almost flawlessly to build on the story already constructed. The game is very playable, the victories very rewarding.On the downside, there are some few holes in the plot between the two; nothing I found painfully glaring, but one or two things seemed to be missing. As well, not all the gameplay pieces make it through the storytelling process alive; once or twice you might feel like you're doing less exploring and more pacing down a one-lane alley to your ultimate doomstiny. A combat system was also worked into the game that might have been intended to be a prominent feature, but comes out shallow and just a touch broken.Ultimately, an amazing story told in an amazing game with excellent for its time visuals that still manage to mostly draw the player in. Gameplay and puzzles that work well together; a beautiful set of environments to explore.			"

												TLDR: I recommend and not recommend at the same time, see below.After playing TLJ, it is clear that Dreamfall is a different game that ""follows"" the storyline of the former. I am quoting ""follow"" because the events take place 10 years after. However, the game feels very different both in gameplay and story, so I think it should be viewed as a standalone game.Gameplay wise, it is fully 3D with heavy reliance on conversations. Not many puzzles that challenge your mind at all. Inventory is reduced to a minimum and normally you keep forward just by walking your way to your objectives (some running forth and back too). The game features stealth and combat, which is made in a poor fashion. Stealth mechanics are kind of ok, but forces you to press a key (def. key control) all the time, instead of just toggle stealth with a key. Probably one of the reasons playing this game with a keyboard can be punishing. Combat is just terrible, you just smash the button and attack. Luckily there isn't many combat. I can understand why they decided to put it in game, but the implementation really is terrible.In terms of story, it is really complex, cryptic and creepy at times (character design, especially the faces contribute to that level of ""creepyness""). Travelling through the two worlds, I found Stark to be more fun and interesting than Arcadia (this also happened to me for TLJ). After finishing the game you end up with hundreds of questions. The game story isn't closed and this can be frustrating.Therefore, I can only recommend playing this game if you plan on playing Dreamfall: Chapters and you are interested in the story of these worlds (and wait for a sale ofc). If you liked TLJ only for the amazing point and click adventure game it was, you will be disappointed with Dreamfall.			"

												This is a great spiritual sucessor or prequel, to the longest journey. It had me scratching my head for the first hour before I realize this is the ""second"" game. As a narrative, this game is great. The GUI and the actual navigation of the world is a bit clunky... But it is forgavable for the story and the promise of more to come. Dreamfalls chapters follows this game, AND IT SHOULD. The ending of this game is a massive cliff hanger. And it demanded a sequal. No spoilers, but it hit me in the feels. This is such a great story, I really couldn't reccomend the series more!			"

												The game (rightfully) gets a lot of flak for shallow gameplay mechanics, but this is interactive fiction at its best. It is ENTIRELY story-driven (a la Telltale's TWD) so if you're a fan of good storytelling in games, this is definitely for you. It has a very unique narrative which I don't think I've ever seen done in a game before, and I'd say the game accomplishes what it sets out to do with it. For instance, at a certain point in the game, when playing as one of the protagonists, you come face to face with another character you control, and are at complete odds with. The dialogue exchange between them after which the game transitions to the point-of-view of the character whose ideals you were just questioning was definitely the highlight of the game for me. And there's also the scene in the hospital room, which was utterly heart-wrenching. A very unique experience, and definitely one of the best written games I've had the pleasure to play (err, ""play"" wouldn't be the right word)			"

												It was hard for me to determine whether I want to recommend this or not and I think if I wasn't curious about Dreamfall Chapters (which I haven't played yet) and I still had some goodwill left over from The Longest Journey, I probably wouldn't have.If you play this game right after the first one, brace yourself for disappointment.The voice acting of almost all characters (except those who were in the first game's cast) is amateurish - which would be more tolerable if the main character, Zoe, wasn't among the bad crowd. Combine that with the character being less convincing and A LOT less likable than The Longest Journey's April and an overall much weaker premise for the game, and you have a lead character that's just dull.Speaking of which, April Ryan is back... and VERY MINOR SPOILER is a complete ♥♥♥♥♥. Her voice acting and reasoning is still more solid than Zoe's but she's too weak the carry the story on her own and, as I said, Zoe is more of a hindrance to that than anything. The story itself is okay but far from mind-blowing. It's quite obvious that the people responsible for it wanted to take it in a ""different direction"" (as some self-proclaimed 'visionaries' tend to do) and failed miserably to recreate that sense of purpose the first game gave you, even when faced with more overwhelming odds.The combat system... Well, let's make it quick: It's painfully bad and its only saving grace is that there's only few instances where you actually have to fight. A few more of them and all the goodwill in the world couldn't have convinced me to recommend this game. Yes, it's that terrible - among the worst I've ever seen in a game I actually wanted to play.As for the camera and controls, they're clunky at best but you can get used to them enough to not be hindered by them. When it comes to the adventure gameplay, well, it's not in the same league as its predecessor or any other adventure game, really, but if you're playing this game, you're probably here for the continuation of the story from The Longest Journey, and for that, it's okay...ish. What is not, however, is the unbearable sneaking system. You are annoyingly slow, the areas are large, you have no idea when they'll see/notice you or not... Again, it's only tolerable because there isn't too much of it.The graphics have improved from the first game... and yet they haven't. The first game had pretty (if dated), well designed maps and backgrounds. This game has 3D environments that are large and empty. Yes, the graphical quality has increased, especially the character models, but they've lost that spark, that soul somewhere along the way.The music somewhat makes up for that. Actually, it may very well be the one thing I have very little to complain about. It's fantastic, a few vocal tracks aside that push the ""romantic"" or ""sad"" over the edge... It's like the one in charge of these scenes had William Shattner compose them.Overall, the game gives the impression of being half-cooked: A couple of ideas thrown together without giving them a critical once-over, half-hearted execution, unconvincing design and voice-acting, a story just one step shy of being boring (and a few more steps away from being actually interesting)... In a word: A filler - something to push out the door until somebody could come up with something better. Which is weird, since they apparently had six years between this game and the first one. You'd think that'd enough to make a better game.The cameos and returns of characters from the first game are convincing but, overall, the writers were a little too quickly to discard ideas, characters and motives from The Longest Journey and they didn't have the skill to turn a good story-driven adventure into a fresh action adventure of similar quality.Now that I read my review again, the only reason I'm still giving this game a recommendation is because I want to know if Dreamfall Chapters can make up for it.If you're coming from the first game and want to know what happens, pick this up on a sale. That is the ONLY circumstance under which you should buy this game. Otherwise, go and find something better.			"

PROS:+ A great story and a long journey.+ Story continues from The Longest Journey. It's great to see the places and people you know in 3D.+ Hooks, twists... You'll always want to know what will happen next.+ I just love everything about it; the characters, the universe...CONS:- Controls/camera movement are not so good, but you'll get used to it quickly. We all know most of the old 3D adventure games has this problem.- Your character might get stuck in here and there; so game is buggy sometimes.- Combat mechanism is unnecessary, clunky and boring. - AI is not smart. You can just stand right next to enemy and he wont even notice...- At some places the reverb on the voice-overs won't fit the environment.- The game is not challenging, there are few easy puzzles.? The game is in 3D and have stealth/combat mechanics involved. Personally i love stealth games so it was an exciting experience for me. But if you are old-school adventure fan, you'll probably don't like it and you'll feel its unnecessary. Stealth scenes may get boring if you fail and have to start from the beginning, but you can save the game often to save some time. I admit that Dreamfall lacks the spirit of pure adventure genre but it's still fun!? The ending was... well.. cliffhanger. It felt incomplete. But the story continues since we have a sequel now.VERDICT: I already played this game when i was a teenager. A gaming magazine gave it for free in DVD format, isnt that amazing? But at some point the game was giving an error so i could not finish it and till this day didnt know how the game ended. So I decided to visit my favorite game back and it was worth it. I managed to finish it by playing 10 hours straight without any brake, worth every second of it :) It was a long journey which i'll never forget...			"

												The bad: The game movement was a bit odd - it took me a some googling and some trial and error to get to a comfortable place with it. The fighting mechanism was a bit useless. Also the ending was... well lets just say unsatisfying.The good: I found the puzzles a bit easier than in The Longest Journey (maybe that was just exposure though). I really liked the story - on par with The Longest Journey. The main character is great, and it is a fun game to play. Overall, I would highly recommend it, especially if you like games with lots of cool female characters and ones that are highly story driven.			"

												A surprisingly delightful game. Feels like a modernized point-and-click adventure game. It's very easy to play with a controller, and the puzzles are mostly straight forward. Very memorable characters, great story, mostly great environments. The game is PACKED with personality and charm. The art style is superb and allows the outdated graphics to still shine. Great pacing throughout the game with great humor. Plays/feels at times like Beyond Good and Evil, Fable, Resident Evil, Zeno Clash. The combat is awful, but is uncommon. Unwieldy but manageable camera. The game switches between three characters at times which feels off, but at least the character stories intersect meaningfully. Characters are voiced, and there's TONS of dialogue. At times you can choose how your character reacts; choose to get more story or straight to the point. Took me ~13 hours to beat, a blast up until the story starts wrapping up. The whole ending is awful and unfulfilling. Overall, superb. INSTANT FAV.			"

												A direct sequel to The Longest Journey.I was really amazed playing The Longest Journey. Dreamfall, the sequel, fell slightly short of the bar set by the original, but having played the first title right before jumping into this one, there were a lot of little things I could appreciate quite a bit.Things I felt were improvements over the first title:- Better sense of direction- No more ridiculously complex ""we won't give you any hints, figure it out yourself"" puzzles.Areas where the first title felt superior to this sequel:- Imaginative world, setting, and character designs- Lack of facial animations in the original actually was an improvement, since Dreamfall's characters felt too stoic in their expressions.I recommend this game, but only after having played and enjoying the original The Longest Journey, as Dreamfall really is a pretty direct sequel in many ways.Here's hoping we get a 3rd entry in the series someday.

												I was initially hesitant on buying this game; I had heard of this game when it was launched, seeing many ads in PC Gamer back in the day, but I wasn't really interested in playing it. I'm so glad I did. This game is truly one of the greatest adventure games I've ever played. It's not without faults, but you will find an experience that will keep you up for hours on end regardless.The story is phenomenal! It's initially slow and is executed slightly cheezily (given the age of the game), but it quickly hooks you in once the atmosphere of the game has settled. After the first to second hour of this game, I found myself wondering why I've never played it before! It's intriguing, mysterious, and almost detective-esque. The story really picks up in the middle of the game-- to save you all from some major spoilers, I'm just going to say it's magical.In addition, the music is fantastic: the composer puts subtle musical cues into the world's environment and professionaly crafts those into the score, creating several memorable and beautiful themes! I'd have to say that this is the greatest video game soundtrack that nobody has heard.The voice acting is hit and miss; however, when it hits, it HITS. There are some fantastic voice actors in this game. The main character sounds great, but some of the minor characters that you run into are downright HILARIOUS! There are moments and lines in the script that are just joys to watch and listen to, some examples being the hilarious elevator scene, the spice trader, and a few others. A couple of the voice actors kinda suck. Sure, the combat sucks and the animations could be better, but c'mon: this game was released in 2006! The Steam screenshots are touched up with effects and shaders to make the game look better than it actually is. Some of the puzzles are just rediculously hard and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You'll definitely look those up online to save time.If you can get past the minor setbacks (and trust me, you will), you will find yourself a well crafted, memorable adventure that will consume your thoughts! I mean, if I wrote this LONG review on STEAM, that has to mean that the game is fantastic, RIGHT?!			"

PROS:+ A great story and a long journey.+ Story continues from The Longest Journey. It's great to see the places and people you know in 3D.+ Hooks, twists... You'll always want to know what will happen next.+ I just love everything about it; the characters, the universe...CONS:- Controls/camera movement are not so good, but you'll get used to it quickly. We all know most of the old 3D adventure games has this problem.- Your character might get stuck in here and there; so game is buggy sometimes.- Combat mechanism is unnecessary, clunky and boring. - AI is not smart. You can just stand right next to enemy and he wont even notice...- At some places the reverb on the voice-overs won't fit the environment.- The game is not challenging, there are few easy puzzles.? The game is in 3D and have stealth/combat mechanics involved. Personally i love stealth games so it was an exciting experience for me. But if you are old-school adventure fan, you'll probably don't like it and you'll feel its unnecessary. Stealth scenes may get boring if you fail and have to start from the beginning, but you can save the game often to save some time. I admit that Dreamfall lacks the spirit of pure adventure genre but it's still fun!? The ending was... well.. cliffhanger. It felt incomplete. But the story continues since we have a sequel now.VERDICT: I already played this game when i was a teenager. A gaming magazine gave it for free in DVD format, isnt that amazing? But at some point the game was giving an error so i could not finish it and till this day didnt know how the game ended. So I decided to visit my favorite game back and it was worth it. I managed to finish it by playing 10 hours straight without any brake, worth every second of it :) It was a long journey which i'll never forget...			"

												I like this game's very complex storyline with many different elements and characters, the puzzle solving, and the unique and multidimensional characters. However the PC controls are very frustrating and make it difficult to move characters without getting stuck against a wall or with the camera incredibly close so you can no longer see what you're doing.

												It was hard for me to determine whether I want to recommend this or not and I think if I wasn't curious about Dreamfall Chapters (which I haven't played yet) and I still had some goodwill left over from The Longest Journey, I probably wouldn't have.If you play this game right after the first one, brace yourself for disappointment.The voice acting of almost all characters (except those who were in the first game's cast) is amateurish - which would be more tolerable if the main character, Zoe, wasn't among the bad crowd. Combine that with the character being less convincing and A LOT less likable than The Longest Journey's April and an overall much weaker premise for the game, and you have a lead character that's just dull.Speaking of which, April Ryan is back... and VERY MINOR SPOILER is a complete ♥♥♥♥♥. Her voice acting and reasoning is still more solid than Zoe's but she's too weak the carry the story on her own and, as I said, Zoe is more of a hindrance to that than anything. The story itself is okay but far from mind-blowing. It's quite obvious that the people responsible for it wanted to take it in a ""different direction"" (as some self-proclaimed 'visionaries' tend to do) and failed miserably to recreate that sense of purpose the first game gave you, even when faced with more overwhelming odds.The combat system... Well, let's make it quick: It's painfully bad and its only saving grace is that there's only few instances where you actually have to fight. A few more of them and all the goodwill in the world couldn't have convinced me to recommend this game. Yes, it's that terrible - among the worst I've ever seen in a game I actually wanted to play.As for the camera and controls, they're clunky at best but you can get used to them enough to not be hindered by them. When it comes to the adventure gameplay, well, it's not in the same league as its predecessor or any other adventure game, really, but if you're playing this game, you're probably here for the continuation of the story from The Longest Journey, and for that, it's okay...ish. What is not, however, is the unbearable sneaking system. You are annoyingly slow, the areas are large, you have no idea when they'll see/notice you or not... Again, it's only tolerable because there isn't too much of it.The graphics have improved from the first game... and yet they haven't. The first game had pretty (if dated), well designed maps and backgrounds. This game has 3D environments that are large and empty. Yes, the graphical quality has increased, especially the character models, but they've lost that spark, that soul somewhere along the way.The music somewhat makes up for that. Actually, it may very well be the one thing I have very little to complain about. It's fantastic, a few vocal tracks aside that push the ""romantic"" or ""sad"" over the edge... It's like the one in charge of these scenes had William Shattner compose them.Overall, the game gives the impression of being half-cooked: A couple of ideas thrown together without giving them a critical once-over, half-hearted execution, unconvincing design and voice-acting, a story just one step shy of being boring (and a few more steps away from being actually interesting)... In a word: A filler - something to push out the door until somebody could come up with something better. Which is weird, since they apparently had six years between this game and the first one. You'd think that'd enough to make a better game.The cameos and returns of characters from the first game are convincing but, overall, the writers were a little too quickly to discard ideas, characters and motives from The Longest Journey and they didn't have the skill to turn a good story-driven adventure into a fresh action adventure of similar quality.Now that I read my review again, the only reason I'm still giving this game a recommendation is because I want to know if Dreamfall Chapters can make up for it.If you're coming from the first game and want to know what happens, pick this up on a sale. That is the ONLY circumstance under which you should buy this game. Otherwise, go and find something better.			"

												An awesome follow-up to an awesome game!!!  This continues the amazing story told in ""The Longest Journey"".  The story itself will keep you riveted and on the edge of your seat, wanting more.  Outside of the story, the gameplay has its quirks.  The fighting and stealth portions are wonky... but there are so few of them it's forgivable.  A caution given that The Longest Journey games have a bit of strong language at times (though usually not in gratuity).Overall - If you love a good story, your biggest disappointment with this game will be that the sequel has yet to be created.

												An argument of whether games may be considered art arises quite often - and i can say, that The Longest Journey and Dreamfall definetely make for a convincing argument. If you are new to the series, then play The Longest Journey first, and Dreamfall second (the first part, and then the sequel) - you will not be dissapointed. Do not be discouraged by the price tag on this ""old"" game - if there was ever a game worth its price, it would be this one. Click buy, ""install now"", close the curtains, and prepare your soul for the Longest Journey of your life.			"

Dreamfall: The Longest Journey controls and camera just suck! Got used to it eventually using a game pad. But what the heck? What an incredibly aweful ending?! Everyone you care about is either dead or comatose! And WATIcorp ends up releasing the Dreamer?! The whole journey, all for nothing. That's just disappointing. I'll be starting Dreamfall: Chapters tomorrow. There better be a better ending. And why the hell did it take them 8 years to continue this? Makes me wonder even more about the ending of Dreamfall 1.That said, I have to say that this game is amazing, still. The whole fighting was unnecessary and just doesn't fit in. Other than that, really well done and a must-have for all adventure fans.			"

												GREAT game.  Has a few moments that feel like a ""hidden item puzzler"" but it's an adventure game with a solid plot, a solid script, and some decent voice acting.  Word to the wise though:  play ""The Longest Journey"" first.  Otherwise there are parts of this one that will leave you scratching your head and thinking ""WTF was that all about!?""  Also, word is there will be a sequel released soon that will add closure to the series.  This one, like the previous entry, has an ending that really leaves you hanging.  Like your favorite TV show suddenly says ""To be continued..."" and then the series gets canceled!!Also, get a good walkthrough online.  There are a few puzzles that NO SANE HUMAN BEING will be able to figure out without some help.  Such as, take a rope and combine it with some tongs, then add a rubber duck inner tube, ZOOM IN AND CLICK A TINY BAND-AID ON THE BACK SIDE OF IT to remove the band-aid and deflate the duck, then use the whole contraption as a fishing rod to grab a key off of some railroad tracks.  With NO HINTS in the game that even tell you you need that key... but you do.So yeah, some of the puzzles are CRAZY RIDICULOUS but otherwise the game is amazing.  Love the story.  Engaging until the end... then leaves you wanting more.  I'm definitely (eventually) getting the third one.			"

												The story in Dreamfall is unlike anything I've ever played before. It's so much going on and so much to explore. You get really involved in the story and the characters, there's few games that both makes me laugh and cry. The game has some great and fun puzzles. There are even some tasks that where so difficult  that I had to use a walkthrough (there's especially one specific location I have in mind). The game unfortunately have a lots of bugs, which is typicall for the time period this game was made. Some of my biggest problems was ""static"" sound and that the game had some ""invisible walls"". Some few times I also experienced problems relating to the cut scenes, with that I mean when your character walks through a door and get stuck. And since it's a ""cutscene"" you don't have any controll over the situation. The solution are to alt+tab to get her ""lose"". Despites the bugs and loading screenes I had a blast playing this game, the story is the best I've ever experienced in a game. If you haven't played it yet, what are you waiting for?ENJOY YOURSELF!!! :-)			"

The plot betrayes you in many was such as deepness and repetition of already know variables.When you finish it you feels sort'a betrayed. Too many stories unresolved (properly), too many deaths, sound track keeps on getting annoying at trying fill up emotion momnets. Fun Games, you delved into a new realm of AG, but it didn't live up to stand the test of time, as the first ♥♥♥♥♥♥I did it) one did (or will it?).Still, a worthy game.Overall it was fun and enjoyable so it would be a 7/10.Compared to the first one: 3/10			"

												This is really fun story book adventure game. Yes its fairly linear at times, and nothing like the point and click predecessor but that doesnt matter to me. You visit some of the old haunts from the previous game amid a mixture of exploring, puzzle solving and story driving cutscenes. Focusing mainly on the protagnist you work your way through Arcadia and Stark. You also get to swap and play several other characters that drive the story which works well.Not the point of click adventure I was expecting but a fun relaxing story driven game or the same.			"

												Dreamfall is the sequel to ""The Longest Journey"" and I had just finished that game before playing this one (bought it as a game pack). TLJ and Dreamfall both have breathtaking storylines. I felt that this game was a lot more enriching for having just played TLJ.There are many differences though. For instance, TLJ was more heavily focused on problem solving and interaction with NPCs. This game was very different gameplay wise, including a heavy focus on stealth puzzles, this boring minigame where you match up symbols (it was fine the first time, but after the 5th time of doing it, it was old hat), and a combat system which was not very well executed.I also had huge problems with the camera and movement when I first started. I recommend this game be played on a gamepad if at all possible as it did not react well to my mouse and for some reason the camera movements were inverted.But I am a player who plays games for their story, and this one had a fantastic storyline, although you are left with many questions at the end. I couldn't imagine having played this game 8 years ago when it came out and then having to wait until now with Dreamfall Chapters to finally get answers to those questions.If you play for story, I recommend this game, (but play TLJ first; its graphics are definitely dated, but it's story is timeless).

												The nice thing about this game is you don't have to play the first game in the series to play this -and- understand what is going on. The puzzles are a bit simpler (and less confusing) than the first game with far more interactivity and a good story line. It seems a bit closer to an RPG than the first game did. The graphics aren't amazing, but it's easy to look past it while playing the game. This is a great series, so I would suggest playing the first one as well, but definitely play this if you enjoy this type of game.			"

												Entirely opposite to the game that preceded it, Dreamfall begins strong and grows weaker as time passes. Unfortunately, this game comes from the era when every adventure game felt the need to include mandatory action sequences, almsot exclusively poorly implemented, with this as no exception.Zoe is a lovely character though and the game is enoyable enough. It's a certain addition to the collection of any adventure game fan, but I doubt you'll pull it off the shelves too often.			"

												I was initially hesitant on buying this game; I had heard of this game when it was launched, seeing many ads in PC Gamer back in the day, but I wasn't really interested in playing it. I'm so glad I did. This game is truly one of the greatest adventure games I've ever played. It's not without faults, but you will find an experience that will keep you up for hours on end regardless.The story is phenomenal! It's initially slow and is executed slightly cheezily (given the age of the game), but it quickly hooks you in once the atmosphere of the game has settled. After the first to second hour of this game, I found myself wondering why I've never played it before! It's intriguing, mysterious, and almost detective-esque. The story really picks up in the middle of the game-- to save you all from some major spoilers, I'm just going to say it's magical.In addition, the music is fantastic: the composer puts subtle musical cues into the world's environment and professionaly crafts those into the score, creating several memorable and beautiful themes! I'd have to say that this is the greatest video game soundtrack that nobody has heard.The voice acting is hit and miss; however, when it hits, it HITS. There are some fantastic voice actors in this game. The main character sounds great, but some of the minor characters that you run into are downright HILARIOUS! There are moments and lines in the script that are just joys to watch and listen to, some examples being the hilarious elevator scene, the spice trader, and a few others. A couple of the voice actors kinda suck. Sure, the combat sucks and the animations could be better, but c'mon: this game was released in 2006! The Steam screenshots are touched up with effects and shaders to make the game look better than it actually is. Some of the puzzles are just rediculously hard and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You'll definitely look those up online to save time.If you can get past the minor setbacks (and trust me, you will), you will find yourself a well crafted, memorable adventure that will consume your thoughts! I mean, if I wrote this LONG review on STEAM, that has to mean that the game is fantastic, RIGHT?!			"

												The game (rightfully) gets a lot of flak for shallow gameplay mechanics, but this is interactive fiction at its best. It is ENTIRELY story-driven (a la Telltale's TWD) so if you're a fan of good storytelling in games, this is definitely for you. It has a very unique narrative which I don't think I've ever seen done in a game before, and I'd say the game accomplishes what it sets out to do with it. For instance, at a certain point in the game, when playing as one of the protagonists, you come face to face with another character you control, and are at complete odds with. The dialogue exchange between them after which the game transitions to the point-of-view of the character whose ideals you were just questioning was definitely the highlight of the game for me. And there's also the scene in the hospital room, which was utterly heart-wrenching. A very unique experience, and definitely one of the best written games I've had the pleasure to play (err, ""play"" wouldn't be the right word)			"

												If Dreamfall was just a dream then I don't want to wake up..EVER. This chapter is set 10 years after the original (The Longest Journey), many things have changed that will engage the player's curiousity from the start. Ofcourse memorable characters and locations make a comeback and look better than ever with the leap in graphics. I caught myself warmly reminiscing the sights of Venice- the border house where April Ryan lived and the Fringe Cafe ahhh the memories! April and Crow do make an awesome return though much of the game focuses on a lovely new character named Zoe. When I started this game, I wanted to play as a familiar face but I grew quite fond of Zoe very early on. Partly because the developers have obvious talent for building characters but personally because of how quickly I identified with her and her decisions that many people make in their youth and stuggle through: dropping out of school, letting go of relationships, and trying to find a purpose in life. And just like in TLJ, destiny and curiousity turn her dull life into an otherworldly adventure that makes for an always unforgettable story. I absolutely cannot wait for the third installment and highly propose this series to anyone who seeks an emotional and enchanting game like none other!			"

The fighting and stealth portions are wonky... but there are so few of them it's forgivable.  A caution given that The Longest Journey games have a bit of strong language at times (though usually not in gratuity).Overall - If you love a good story, your biggest disappointment with this game will be that the sequel has yet to be created.

												Story: The story continues 10 years after The Longest Journey. Like the original, the voice acting was strong and most of the old cast showed up in this game. However, that's where the similarities stop. The story becomes convoluted and confusing and introduces more questions than it answers. Even the ending was a cliffhanger that left a lot to be explained. Gameplay, in comparison to the first game, involved a lot of walking... a lot of it... and had attempts to weave stealth and combat into the gameplay. Unfortunately, despite the addition of these additional elements, neither combat nor stealth felt polished to a point where it made meaningful impact.Environments: The limited 3D graphical engine used also didn't do the game much justice. Although it meant the world could be explored in an RPG manner, it also meant that the world was void of on-screen assets resulting in a very plain world. Music: I thought the choice of a romantic (theme) song was terribly wrong. Unlike other games where similar music invoked strong emotions, Dreamfall's two romantic interests didn't communicate their romantic tension very well in game. I think it may also be due to the game engine's lack of facial movement when talking.6/10. I was actually pretty disappointed overall.			"

												a great sequel to the first part.the developer was again able to put a lot of character emotions and atmosphere into this game.i also liked the fact visiting some locations from the first part.it was interesting and sometimes funny to explore the previously explored areas after 10 years of time.you are switching between 3 characters - sometimes it was like a ""f*** why switching now"" when you were completley into the currently playing character but in summary it was great to play these chars.also nice to see how the npc chars react to you dependent from your char (e.g. kian in the ghetto vs zoe in the ghetto).it's a 3D adventure and they implemented walking, running, sneaking and fighting.i'd have preferred to walk by default and run with shift but maybe that's only my opinion.i often enforced walking to experience a more realistic game (who permanently runs when exploring in rl? ;)imo the fighting part is implemented badly and i tried to avoid it as often as possible. fortunately most of the fights can be avoided by sneaking and there are not many fight situations at all.imo there are less puzzels or riddles and they are much easier than in the first part.nevertheless it was an exciting story, great characters and atmosphere.it was very - kind of - 'diffcult' to pause the game for such things like sleeping and working ;)			"

It is so much more playable and although the controls can seem a little clunky and reversed (especially the combat!). If you can get past that you are in for a treat, I fell in love with Zoe and Kian. Zoe like April is yet another well written strong female protagonist which a lot of developers seem to struggle with, and Kian although I believe his story is too short in this is a fantastic additional character.

												Dreamfall has a pretty good, if at times awkwardly presented plotline. It is the successor to popular 90s point 'n' click adventure The Longest Journey, and despite being in third person, unfortunately embodies many of the more archaic design choices that came with the genre of its predecessor - mixed with poorly implemented stealth and combat segments.Moving the camera is jarring, and expect to need to change your controls when you first fire up the game, as mouse movement is inverted by default. Voice acting is a mixed bag, with the protagonist through much of the game, Zoe, being the weakest of the bunch; sounding frequently disinterested, though less so as the game progresses.Play it for the plotline if sci-fi fantasy is your thing, but be aware that the mechanics still have a distinctive feel of being stuck in a time some decades past.

												TLDR: I recommend and not recommend at the same time, see below.After playing TLJ, it is clear that Dreamfall is a different game that ""follows"" the storyline of the former. I am quoting ""follow"" because the events take place 10 years after. However, the game feels very different both in gameplay and story, so I think it should be viewed as a standalone game.Gameplay wise, it is fully 3D with heavy reliance on conversations. Not many puzzles that challenge your mind at all. Inventory is reduced to a minimum and normally you keep forward just by walking your way to your objectives (some running forth and back too). The game features stealth and combat, which is made in a poor fashion. Stealth mechanics are kind of ok, but forces you to press a key (def. key control) all the time, instead of just toggle stealth with a key. Probably one of the reasons playing this game with a keyboard can be punishing. Combat is just terrible, you just smash the button and attack. Luckily there isn't many combat. I can understand why they decided to put it in game, but the implementation really is terrible.In terms of story, it is really complex, cryptic and creepy at times (character design, especially the faces contribute to that level of ""creepyness""). Travelling through the two worlds, I found Stark to be more fun and interesting than Arcadia (this also happened to me for TLJ). After finishing the game you end up with hundreds of questions. The game story isn't closed and this can be frustrating.Therefore, I can only recommend playing this game if you plan on playing Dreamfall: Chapters and you are interested in the story of these worlds (and wait for a sale ofc). If you liked TLJ only for the amazing point and click adventure game it was, you will be disappointed with Dreamfall.			"

												Great Story, I completed this in order to have a Diverse gaming experience with my playthrough in Dreamfall Chapters.Even though its an older title it was still worth the playthrough just to increase my gaming experience for a more diverse story option in Dreamfall Chapters.I would still recommend Starting with The Longest Journey First, but you get the general info that you need from this story play through.

												This is a good adventure game that I played through many years ago.  Anyone that is bored with all the new games should definitely play this.  The game plays like an interactive movie, and ♥♥♥♥ 1up for giving it a score of 40.			"

												Great adventure game. Great story. The story takes you on a far multi-geographic and even multi-dimensional worlds. I really enjoyed the story so much that I got wrapped up in it. It's one of those games I will always remember.			"

												Story: The story continues 10 years after The Longest Journey. Like the original, the voice acting was strong and most of the old cast showed up in this game. However, that's where the similarities stop. The story becomes convoluted and confusing and introduces more questions than it answers. Even the ending was a cliffhanger that left a lot to be explained. Gameplay, in comparison to the first game, involved a lot of walking... a lot of it... and had attempts to weave stealth and combat into the gameplay. Unfortunately, despite the addition of these additional elements, neither combat nor stealth felt polished to a point where it made meaningful impact.Environments: The limited 3D graphical engine used also didn't do the game much justice. Although it meant the world could be explored in an RPG manner, it also meant that the world was void of on-screen assets resulting in a very plain world. Music: I thought the choice of a romantic (theme) song was terribly wrong. Unlike other games where similar music invoked strong emotions, Dreamfall's two romantic interests didn't communicate their romantic tension very well in game. I think it may also be due to the game engine's lack of facial movement when talking.6/10. I was actually pretty disappointed overall.			"

												Dreamfall has a pretty good, if at times awkwardly presented plotline. It is the successor to popular 90s point 'n' click adventure The Longest Journey, and despite being in third person, unfortunately embodies many of the more archaic design choices that came with the genre of its predecessor - mixed with poorly implemented stealth and combat segments.Moving the camera is jarring, and expect to need to change your controls when you first fire up the game, as mouse movement is inverted by default. Voice acting is a mixed bag, with the protagonist through much of the game, Zoe, being the weakest of the bunch; sounding frequently disinterested, though less so as the game progresses.Play it for the plotline if sci-fi fantasy is your thing, but be aware that the mechanics still have a distinctive feel of being stuck in a time some decades past.

												This is the second installment in the story of ""The longest Journey"" saga. Graphics are much better due to this being released 6 years after the first. Yet this is not a game you play for its graphics or amazing gameplay elements. You will play this ONLY for the amazing story. Nothing else matters in this series. If you are a fan of story-rich games, this entire series is one you must have under your belt.It is suggested to play The Longest Journey prior to playing this one.			"

												I have not played the previous game, The Longest Journey, so I can't really compare them to one another, how it may have evolved into a better, or even worse game.. However, I can very much still talk about it. I found this game while searching across the internet a few years back, it looked fantastic.. And kinda ""exotic"" to me, as I were one of those FPS only gamers at the time. After a few days thinking about it I decided to download it, unfortunately I had to turn to piracy, due to lack of money. My first impressions of it were quite solid, it was a new and interesting game, with a good story to it. At least what I could grasp at that time.. Seeing as my English was not very good. After about a third of the game done, it decided to die on me.. It would not start anymore and I quickly gave up on it.Now, a few years later, during the annual Winter's sale, I picked it up, alongside Dreamfall Chapters, the new sprout in the series. And so I began playing it for a second time. Now with a more.. *Mature understanding.. The game does indeed feel a bit old, or at least older.. Probably due to how the controls work out. They are a bit clumsy in some scenarios. But it is something that can easily be overlooked. As for the gameplay itself.. It was very good. I felt that I got a deep enough bond to some of the characters, especially the MC, to actually care about them. Which is a plus in my book. The story was interesting and captivating, with much varitaion and exitment, though I believe I would have gotten a sligthly different.. Feel.. To it, if I had played its predecessor, The Longest Journey. To say the least I am very happy that I came back to this game, it was truly time well-spent..!			"

												Great game. But, please, please, before playing this, please do play The Longest Journey first. That way it will be a much, much better experience. It's the same world, same story.Because this is quite an old game, there might be some performance glitches. The use of v-sync helps a lot.Pros:+ Story+ Soundtrack+ Overall writing+ Puzzles that make sense and are intuitive (some of the TLJ puzzles did not really make sense)Cons:- Anticlimactic deaths/disappearances of few characters- Some strange performance glitches on modern systems			"

(You can also see the ""growth"" from the fist in the series to this one (In trms from the Art/scenery)			"

												Hello from the other side...Brilliant. I love how there are multiple ways of moving forward through the game. I'm enjoying the storyline and genuinely like the character.The inventory system isn't very intuitive, and combat feels slow and clumsy, but you get used to it...here's where multiple possibilities of working through a part helps...can't use your item in your inventory fast enough? Well, you can always just knock them out or kick it down.			"

												A beautiful game that pulls you in and shows you a masterpiece story. Has some elements of fighting, some elements of puzzles, some elements of 'super secret spy.' Each part is shown to be necessary for the type of story they are trying to convey.It's silly combat mechanics will frustrate anyone who wants a fighting experience. It's straightforward puzzles will annoy those looking for a puzzle experience. It's obvious stealth solutions would make you laugh whole heartedly at their idea of a secure building.Then why play?This game's style is the soul of the telltale game style. It isn't meant to be a challenge, it's meant to drag you in and pummel your feelings.I hope you enjoy!			"

												7.9 out of 10This game was less intense than what I remembered, but maybe I just mixed some parts up with another game since I played it almost ten years ago or something. Needless to say, dialogues were less monologuish and pointless than the first, and the graphics and environment designs were great considering the time the game was released. Playing the game was quite a visual treat.I'm not sure how the hell I was able to play this game in the past without having first played TLJ1, but man I remember being so confused by April Ryan and everything back then. Now with a replay in context, a lot of things make sense. I feel really bad for Zoe's dad, though.There are several really annoying bugs and glitches in Windows 7 version, however. I have 8 GB of RAM and my graphics card is nVidia 950 GTX. The most annoying issue of all is the voice stutterings that almost slow to a crawl, happens in several places. Second most annoying was getting stuck outside doors for certain maps, which required switching between windows to fix. At any rate, the story was pretty decent and original (no chosen one BS but still of course has ""the special one"" thing). The fighting mechanics really do suck. I would have liked a bit more puzzle solving - I think there was actually much less of that in this game. Or they far more straightforward than the first game to the point where they felt none-existent. All in all, this is still a pretty solid adventure game imho, and I'm looking forward to finally start with Chapters.			"

												PROS: Good story compared to most games, interesting use of aboriginal folklore, pretty and unique environmentsCONS: Frustrating camera controls, awkward fighting mechanics, somewhat awkward animationsOVERALL SCORE: 7.5/10Dreamfall: The Longest Journey is, as you might guess, the sequel to The Longest Journey. In it, we follow a new protagonist, Zoe Castillo, as she attempts to track down her ex-boyfriend Reza. We also catch up with April Ryan, who has become jaded after the events of The Longest Journey, and Kian Alvane, a member of the Azadi who is brought to Marcuria in an attempt to destroy April and everything she stands for.Story-wise, the game was quite impressive. We get multiple perspectives throughout the game, which was a nice was to gain knowledge that might have been harder to obtain if we'd been stuck with Zoe. There is a strong mythos a dreaming, as Zoe is a dreamer - she can use her dreams to move between worlds. The idea of the dreaming and dreamtime was pretty clearly inspired by Aboriginal mythology on dreaming and the creation of the universe. The mythology itself is fascinating in its own right, and very underused in writing so Dreamfall gets some major points for utilizing it. The story itself had lots of twists and turns, many of which I did not see coming (especially the ending of the game).The gameplay mechanics left much to be desired, though. There are a small handful of combat scenes that involve spamming the left mouse button and they mostly only serve to be annoying. They don't regularly appear so I have to wonder why the appeared in the game at all. The camera was also pretty awkward at time, especially during the numerous stealth scenes. However, it wasn't so bad that the game couldn't be finished.Overall, I would say Dreamfall is worth playing, especially if you are already invested in the series from playing The Longest Journey. The story and the mythos are enough to make the game worth it.			"

												Dreamfall: The Longest Journey is the story-rich game that falls between The Longest Journey and Dreamfall: Chapters.  It relies most heavily on character development and storyline exposition through interactions with well-developed NPCs and only occasional puzzles.  The emotive voice acting and variety of accents adds to the gameplay making it easier to bring the somewhat dated graphics back to life.  I would recommend playing The Longest Journey before starting the sequel or if the graphics are too off-putting, watching a playthrough online.  There are occasional references to the first game which are much more satisfying when you have the background knowledge, of not just the overall plot, but of the specific events and characters.  Dreamfall: The Longest Journey is a story driven game rather than a true puzzle oriented, adventure game.  As a result, it falls flat when it comes to the other, very few, gameplay aspects that were tacked on.  For instance, your choices result in different dialogue but don't affect the overall storyline, the short combat sequences are poorly implemented, and the puzzles are few and far between.  Nevertheless, the storyline and character development are so well done, that the few instances where it falls flat are easily overlooked in order to find out what happens next and enthusiastically watch the story unfold.  The first and third installments are terrific and fall much more neatly into the puzzle focused, adventure genre than Dreamfall: The Longest Journey.  However, don't sell this game short and enjoy it for what it is, which is an interactive, story-driven, and engaging link between two worlds.  "

												After playing The Longest Journey, which I enjoyed so much, I had to play this game.Some gameplay elements were confusing at first (camera movement, combat system) but I got used to it, and after a while I found myself immersed again in the amazing story.The witty dialogues, the funny characters, all the good things from the first game were back!The puzzles were like the first game: mostly doable, but some I had to look up.So yes I totally recommend this game, but play the first one first.

												Dreamfall is a very emotionally profound game. It has an incredibly unique setting, and everything about it is designed to make you feel attached to the characters. The sets, sound, music, enviroment, and story make you fell irrevocably in tune with the protagonists and their choices, and it makes for one of the most compelling stories I've ever played. Highly, highly recommended for people that love in depth plot and point and click adventures.			"

												The story in Dreamfall is unlike anything I've ever played before. It's so much going on and so much to explore. You get really involved in the story and the characters, there's few games that both makes me laugh and cry. The game has some great and fun puzzles. There are even some tasks that where so difficult  that I had to use a walkthrough (there's especially one specific location I have in mind). The game unfortunately have a lots of bugs, which is typicall for the time period this game was made. Some of my biggest problems was ""static"" sound and that the game had some ""invisible walls"". Some few times I also experienced problems relating to the cut scenes, with that I mean when your character walks through a door and get stuck. And since it's a ""cutscene"" you don't have any controll over the situation. The solution are to alt+tab to get her ""lose"". Despites the bugs and loading screenes I had a blast playing this game, the story is the best I've ever experienced in a game. If you haven't played it yet, what are you waiting for?ENJOY YOURSELF!!! :-)			"

												GREAT game.  Has a few moments that feel like a ""hidden item puzzler"" but it's an adventure game with a solid plot, a solid script, and some decent voice acting.  Word to the wise though:  play ""The Longest Journey"" first.  Otherwise there are parts of this one that will leave you scratching your head and thinking ""WTF was that all about!?""  Also, word is there will be a sequel released soon that will add closure to the series.  This one, like the previous entry, has an ending that really leaves you hanging.  Like your favorite TV show suddenly says ""To be continued..."" and then the series gets canceled!!Also, get a good walkthrough online.  There are a few puzzles that NO SANE HUMAN BEING will be able to figure out without some help.  Such as, take a rope and combine it with some tongs, then add a rubber duck inner tube, ZOOM IN AND CLICK A TINY BAND-AID ON THE BACK SIDE OF IT to remove the band-aid and deflate the duck, then use the whole contraption as a fishing rod to grab a key off of some railroad tracks.  With NO HINTS in the game that even tell you you need that key... but you do.So yeah, some of the puzzles are CRAZY RIDICULOUS but otherwise the game is amazing.  Love the story.  Engaging until the end... then leaves you wanting more.  I'm definitely (eventually) getting the third one.			"
