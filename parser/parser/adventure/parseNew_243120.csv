												Betrayer is pretty unique in terms of gaming experience. In fact, I'm not entirely sure it can even be categorised as a 'game' per se... I shall try to explain. You begin shipwrecked on a beach in 1604; all you know is that you sailed from England to join a colony in the Americas. You are met with an eerie, black-and-white landscape, devoid of colour and, apparently, life. You make your way up the beach, and from there you must begin to explore your environment in order to work out where you are, and what has happened here. Things are clearly wrong in this unsettling place. Your only ally is a mysterious woman in red who doesn't know her own name. Your enemies vary from Spanish Conquistadors with demonic red eyes to bow-wielding natives who utter unearthly howls as they stalk you through forests and grasslands; you barely see them coming before they are upon you, attacking and darting away before you can return fire. When you find and ring the fort's bell, the world around you shifts; just when you thought the daylight was scary enough, the night-world is ever more terrifying with skeletons and ghosts to be found all around you, shrieking in the darkness. So, scene set, let's start with the basics. The monochromatic graphics are brave and striking; the rendering is gorgeous and you soon get used to looking at this greyscale world, as items of interest are vividly marked in red. But don't be fooled, this doesn't make anything easy to see coming, as realistic wind effects keep the trees and grasses shifting, fooling the eye into seeing movement where there is none, or covering the stealthy approach of a foe. The wind is both your enemy and your ally; you freeze when it blows, for fear that you've seen or heard something moving, or you can dash through the gusts, knowing the sound and movement of the wind will disguise the noise of your approach. As if this didn't make things tense enough, sound is extremely important. There is no background music and no vocal acting; all you will hear is the wind, and the sounds around you - some enemies can be detected by the clanking of their armour, distincive howls, or gutteral roars. Early on you gain the ability to listen, using your HUD to follow sounds to be led to clues, locations and lost souls in need of rescue. Ring a bell to enter into the night-world and the sounds are amplified; the dull clanging of the bell, the screaming of wraiths, and having to use your listening ability to pinpoint the next clue... Seriously, play this game at night, alone, with the lights off and no other background noise, and you will discover a whole new level of immersion in this terrifying world. It will probably give you nightmares. And PTSD. Especially if there's a sudden noise in the house while you're immersed... honestly, last night, my cat sneezed while I was creeping up on a heavily-garrisoned fort area, and I had three kinds of heart attack all at once. One of the hardest concepts to grasp in this game is that for pretty much all of the time you will not have a single clue what you are supposed to be doing - or even if you are supposed to be doing anything. Think about it - most games you play will have clear cut objectives, quests and story lines to follow. Betrayer doesn't give you any of that, and to be honest, why should it? It's realism at its finest - in real life, a stranger doesn't approach you in the street and tell you that the answer to all you seek is in the next town, here's a map, speak to so-and-so and report back to me so I can tell you what to do next... Betrayer expects you to behave as you might if you really did wash up on a beach in 1604. Figure it out for yourself! Take a walk - look around - collect clues - piece it together - find scraps of paper - talk to the friendly folk - kill the ones that try to kill you - trial and error; you'll get there in the end. Hopefully......Which is why this game gets mixed reviews, it seems. Betrayer will frustrate you as often as it rewards you, because when you're missing a clue and you don't know where to look, then it's hours of map-trawling to try to work out what you've overlooked. There is no handholding here; once you get used to that and start to work things out for yourself you can really start to enjoy it, but this game probably loses a lot of players early on who don't like that style of play. However, the rewards for perseverance are exceptional; intense, involving play; clever use of stealth and strategy; incredible characters and a deeply shocking storyline that keeps you guessing until the end. So when I said at the beginning that it can't be characterised as a ""game"", it is because of the incredible amount of realism involved, despite the supernatural themes. It is a media form in its own right; a cross between a game, a movie and a real-life action adventure where you have to work everything out for yourself. Betrayer will not even ask you the questions, let alone tell you the answers - you will literally have to suss everything out for yourself. The beautiful thing is that you will be vey pleased with yourself when you do!One of my favourite elements of this game was in not knowing where the true evil was; in the deeds of the settlers you learn about, or in the shadowy realm of ghosts and monsters. The irredeemable acts that people do to each other in their own selfish interests and the ways in which those deeds come back to haunt them are intriguing, horrifying and tragic all in one go. Betrayer is, essentially, a simple game that can be incredibly difficult at the same time. For example, the combat is apparently straightforward in a point-and-shoot manner, but the nature of the weapons and the environment makes tactics important. Stealth is essential in many cases and reload times for muskets, pistols and crossbows have to be taken into account. You can only carry a realistic amount of ammunition so being able to recover spent arrows from fallen enemies is a nice touch and saves your precious resources. You quickly learn the best weapons to use against each enemy, and there is a grim satisfaction to be had in being able to ""stealth kill"" an enemy silently from a distance using your trusty longbow (my personal favourite weapon in the game) or by sneaking up and throwing a tomahawk at them.  In fact, it is hard to pick fault with Betrayer. Any frustration at not knowing what to do is negated by the fact that it is simply part of the point of the game; you just have to keep searching until you find something that takes you forwards. If you don't like the greyscale graphics, you can adjust the settings of the game so that it is in full colour; personally, I enjoyed the atmospherics much more without any additional colours. If you don't like the eerie silence of the game, you can ruin it with your own background music or something. My only real nitpick is that it would have been nice to have some voice acting - if the Lady in Red and other ""characters"" could talk directly rather than using text boxes, then it would have made the game feel even more realistic. The text boxes were, for me, a jarring interruption to an otherwise flawless experience; even the HUD has been carefully considered to be as unobtrusive as possible, and can be turned off for ultra-realistic feel. Otherwise, I thoroughly recommend this game. This is definitely one for those with patience and tenancity who are looking for a real challenge. It is not something to be played through quickly or for light relief. If you invest some real time in working through Betrayer and give it - and yourself - a chance, then you will not be disappointed.			"

												BELOW IS MY OPINION AND REVIEW OF THE EARLY ACCESS VERSION WILL UPDATE WHEN THE FULL RELEASE IS OUTThis game is a really good example of why the early acess program on steam is a good idea.When you start to play the game you are given no guidance and just wake up on a beach (thank's to a shipwreck) and set of forward not knowing what you will face around the next corner,then all of a sudden ""WHOOSH"" an arrow fly's past your head and then the intrigue and mystery start's to kick in.Keep on going and you come to the fort (now to say any more will spoil not only A-your enjoyment but B-all the mystery that await's you)Keep playing and the game show's its mystery and just keeps on giving,i wont say any more as its allway's better in any game to discover it for yourself.Blackpowder Games Betrayer Announce Trailer - YouTube

			The creative forces behind Shogo: Mobile Armor Division, the No One Lives Forever series, and the original F.E.A.R. have formed an independent studio.		

This is one of the best game's on the early access program and deserve's people's time and money but if you would rather wait until the full release who can blame you and let's hope that BLACK POWDER (who listen to all comment's that have been passed on the game and have made improvement's and hopefully will continue to do so in the future until release) can get it finished and release more update's soon as i wait for this game to come out in its entirity with eager anticipation.FULL RELEASE REVIEW BELOW (MAY CONTAIN SLIGHT SPOLIER'S)Ok so i was waiting the release of the full version of this game and had got my self into quite a fever pitch for its arrival.Am i dissapointed no not in the slightest.The full release contains all the element's that intrigued me in the early access and then expand's on this to the point that it has become so much more than what it allready was.You start of on the beach after the shipwreck (no spoiler's so dont worry) and then proceed from there into a story full of both intrigue and mystery,you wander of up the trail and soon you reach the next area and then the game world expand's and you will be on the way to the first safe haven (WHO AM I KIDDING THERE ARE NO SAFE PLACE'S) Fort Henry and then the game start's to show you its otherwordly side.Betrayer - Cleansing the South Gate - YouTube

Let's just say that the game take's place in both the real and the not so real,but in both you will come across some pretty scary opponent's who need to be felled (in a lot of case's) for you to open up new area's and therefore expand the game world,which therefore open's more challenge's and yet more different (and hard to beat) foe's.The graphic's in game do the job they set out to do perfectly and you often wonder why the world has lost its colour and why certain item's still have their's (mostly item's will have a redish colour to them,but you can mess about and change the setting's so that your world is more colourfull-i wouldent bother though as the game is more striking in black and white and thats how it was meant to be played).The sound in game is (only one word for it) amazing and does its job to perfection,foes will grunt and howl and sometime's you will wonder if its a beast after you or an otherwordly spirit,the much talked about game play element of listening to the wind to adavnce both the story and aid you in quest's has been worked on and now works perfectly (sound was coming from both my speakers and got louder the nearer i got to my objective,also you find that if you heading the wrong way you can tell by the sound coming from your speaker's also).Quest's in game are both entertaining and will advance the story and allway's help uncover that little bit more about what is going on in the world and also why what has happened has ""HAPPENED"" (and trust me the ending will be one you wont forget in a hurry and will leave you with that ""COME ON WHAT'S NEXT"" feeling and an urge to play the inevitable sequel).SPOILER ALERT*****DONT WATCH IF YOU HAVENT FINISHED THE GAME OR WANT TO FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF*****SPOILER ALERTBetrayer - game ending scenes [spoilers] - YouTube

												Betrayer is a fun game.What you want more to this review?Reviews are meant to be longer? Fine.You end up shipwrecked on a beach in Virginia in 1604, as you get up and proceed to work your way to the colonies and small settlements you realized everyone is ♥♥♥♥ing gone except for a girl with a red hood, and Spaniards. And form there you must unravel what happened to the colony and everyone in it, that's the story right there. The game is classified as horror, and this appears as you unravel the story, the history, and even in the enemies. I'm telling you right now that when you think you've seen it all, the game pulls another punch that catches you offguard. You'll also find that the game is split between two worlds.Gameplay.Gameplay is fantastic, it's a mix between Dark Souls and STALKER. Everything virtually takes away 50% of your health, you drink water to restore your health and can carry two charges of water with you to use, and it gets tougher as the game goes along. If you die you drop all your loot in that area, it disappears if you die before picking it up. You can change it to easy mode though but why would you do that? Moving around the map is also pretty damn nice, as you can run for as long as you want, no sprint bar or anything, and fast travel is an option, making traversing a breeze. Combatwise you don't get anything, you only get a knife for melee and that's it, you can stealth kill with it and you can upgrade the damage it does. Weaponry includes musket's (pistol and rifle), bows (short and long), and a crossbow, there are unique versions of it which overhaul how you fight, and the bows are silent for stealth killing, you also get a tomahawk, which you throw, also silent, it oneshots nearly everything.As you go through the game you will find pages which explain more of the history, and areas that are buried, these hold clues for your investigation jobs, and items. Speaking of which, your investigations play a vital role in the game, seeing as how no one cane be talked to in the light world, they happen dynamically, as you find items or otherwise. They really help toward the end game as well as open up the history more. Moving on from that, we move to various tidbits, you can buy and sell, and you don't need to be at a merchant station to sell, you can sell from your inventory, pretty convenient. You also can retrieve arrows, ammo, and tomahawks off of killed enemies, as well as various loot items. And speaking of loot items, there are chests everywhere, and some hold upgrades to items, these include and extra tomahawk, and charms.And charms are the next part, charms are those items you apply for various additions to what you have. These include the ability to be harder to see, faster reload, and more health. The charms and weapons all come in various qualities, from crude to exceptional, there's also unique weaponry, which upgrades on a different scale. You can carry three charms, and three weapons, and all weapons are tied to hotkeys and of course, the scroll wheel. Oh, and I forgot to mention, you do get set amounts of ammo, such as 10 arrows, but your ammo count is also upgradable, ♥♥♥♥in' A!There are also bells in every section of the map, that lead to the Otherworld/Bell World/Purgatory. This is also a major area in where the horror manifests, as well as a whole different map to explore for loot, enemies, and the story of course! It's shrouded in fog and everything else you saw in the video on the store page. It's fun! You can also hit X for help, no waymarkers are used, despite having a compass, and hitting X will give you some creepy audio which leads you to clues and objectives, it can't be used constantly though, mashing X won't give you a stream of the audio; it ""recharges"" after use which takes a few seconds.There is a toggle button which does give you a subtle waymarker on the compass to help you.Stealth.Stealth is one of the biggest aspects of this game, occassionally in the overworld the grass rustles, this lets you run through it for the duration without alerting anyone, and running will bring attention, as will firing any gun. You can crouch, which hides you, and get close to enemies to shank them, or hit them with a tomahawk. An important note to take is that wind does not affect arrows or bullets, so feel free not to worry if you are aiming and the wind suddenly blows.Enemies.Oh boy this is fun!I'm only gonna reveal two, because I can and the enemies are really something to see.Spaniards: One thing you'll notice fast is that the Spaniards dotted around the map are not quite humanly, these are your standard enemy, and they stop at nothing to kill you, they come in numbers, and force. They will be armed with bows, muskets of both kinds, and they tend to run up and stab/punch you in your face. Remember! You can't take too many hits, so even four of them will require some kind of planning. Worry not though, as the game does not penalize you for choosing one combat type over the other, but running in guns blazing is still a risky move.Skeletons: The common everyday grunt of fantasy games returns and wants you dead! The skeletons are not push overs, every bit as strong as the Spaniards, but at least five different kinds of lethal. Unlike the Spaniards they are mostly melee oriented, but a good number of them will attack at range, and seeing as how they don't have guns or bows, they fire energy blasts at you at a rapid rate, did I mention they also have good aiming? Also unlike the Spaniards, they pop up at random around the Otherworld, some may pop up no more than a few feet from you. Spooked solid? You ♥♥♥♥in' bet.Non-enemies.Wraiths, Shadows, The Red Hooded Maiden.Wraiths and Shadows are there to tell a story, don't expect too much from them. They are the people to talk to do everything investigation related, don't expect them to be fully fleshed out, however their own histories are pretty interesting. Shadows however are there to tell a story like the Wraithes and give you sidequests and rewards. Both Wraithes and Shadows really really add to the horror factor, and the Wraithes especially make it seem like it's some kind of purgatory where they are. The Red Hooded Maiden is the person you'll be in constant contact with, she's the only person to talk to in the light world, not much more to say but to experience it for yourself, sorry for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting my way out!Tid-bits.The game is in an entirely black an white color scheme, punctuated with shades of red. This adds to the horror, and the red shows you something is not right with the world. You can change the color contrast, but why would you do that also? I do recommend playing through it the first time on black and white, it was the dev's artistic vision and it really makes the game. There's also no music, relying on ambient and various sounds, some superb audio if I ever heard any.The game also throws punches in terms of difficulty, as you do progress your weapons do let you deal with the enemies more smoothly, but as you get better so do they, as new enemies appear and as they get more agressive in numbers and to ane extent, power. Did I mention arrows have a chance of deflecting off armor?There is one problem, and that is a bug that makes you crash to the desktop. This is the only bug and it happens by accessing the menu and just rapidly moving through things. It's not the worst, but it does break the immersion when it happens; tread carefully around that. The game also saves often, so no worries if it does crash.Overall, Betrayer is an unsettling game, that gets better as you progress, it doesn't get over complicated or lost in telling the story, the combat remains challenging and grows as you go along. The total game time is at least 8-10 hours, not bad for an indie game.I give this game 4 out of 5 Axes!			"

												Betrayer is a first-person game, where you awake on a small beach after your ship wrecked. You are thrown into the game, without any explanation or a real goal first, so you'll start exploring.Controls are basically like any other first-person game. you can jump, crouch, use your weapons and interact with objects.So, until here, everything is quite the usual.What makes it so interesting and unique in my opinion, is the visuals. Yes, having a game being black and white and only highlight enemies and objects with the color red was a great move. It adds a lot(!) to the atmosphere (you can however play with the contrast, and color saturation yourself to make it  colorful again, though i wouldn't recommend it).After you have made your first steps, you encounter quite mysterious happenings.Enemies appear and will try to shoot you on sight, but they don't seem particularly human. After finding and entering your first settlement, you'll find burned corpses and try to find out what happened to these poor souls and then, there is also that mysterious maiden in red, which appears out of nowhere and then there is also, what i would call, the ""ghost realm"" (after ringing a bell in a settlement, everything darkens and you'll end up fighting skeletons and talking to souls, which got murdered).Together with the visuals, the great sound and the spooky atmosphere it makes a quite good game.The world itself is divided into larger hubs, where you can roam and explore freely, though, there isn't that much to find (graves, some clues and diary-entries which will give you a bit of backstory and few settlements or smaller places of interest).You will find (or buy) different weapons throughout the game, like bows, crossbows, pistols and muskets to fight of the enemies (which you should do stealthy in most cases, as you can't take much damage).The middle part feels a bit stretched and sometimes, it can be a bit frustrating, not knowing exactly what to do and where to go, but if you like exploring and a rather stealthy first-person mystery game which doesn't take you by the hand, then i would definitely recommend this one!

												I loved Betrayer from start to finish. It was a breath of fresh air from the usual mundane FPS games out there.The atmosphere, gameplay, and narrative, were all spot on. You can tell this was made by a passionate group of developers who wanted to make a game different from the rest.Mystery and suspense are the key areas of focus when it comes to the story. You're continuously driven to explore and uncover more about the events that unfolded in one of the first New World colonies. It's a very interesting time period/setting, and the feeling of isolation and terror are captured very well.Gameplay evolves as you progress through the game. Stealth takes a bit of practice to master and becomes more necessary as the enemies become more difficult to fight. Each area has ""crime scenes"" that let you piece together what happened to figure out what to do next. It's deeply satisfying to find all the clues and work out where to go next. The game doesn't try to do too much too quickly, but rather presents itself gradually and expects you to keep up. Very nice stuff.I couldn't recommend Betrayer more. It's everything I personally look for in a game, but still managed to surprise me. I can't wait for the next game from Blackpowder Games!			"

First thing after starting the game was setting up the saturation level to make the colors appear. Then, suddenly the game looks much better! The atmosphere in Betrayer is quite mysterious and induce you to explore the ""New World"". Environment looks good. Trees, leaves and grass moves with the wind naturally. One thing that I miss are the animals, you hear them but, do not see. The story is about helping the lost souls to find their peace. To navigate through the world you can use special ability to hear. Actually there are two dimensions, the light world and the dark one which you are switching by ringing the bell. Shooting is more about timing and accuracy. 17th century guns reload very slow so missing a shot is a mistake you will regret so badly that it will make you cry... just kidding. Betrayer is quite unique so it's worth a try! "

												I didn't know what to expect when I began Betrayer, but it was pretty good. While it's definitely focused on first person combat using bows and 17th century firearms, there's a large focus on exploration and figuring out what happened. It's straight forward and linear, as horror stories tend to be, but good, nontheless. One of the major draws is the desaturated graphics, which are adjustable from fully desaturated aside from red, and full saturation. You can adjust these as you please, which is pretty cool, although I will admit it's easier to pick out items and enemies when it's played in its default state (and it actually brings a horror aspect to bright daylight areas).You go from map to map piecing together what happened, along with collecting weapons, charms, ammo and cash. There's a sneak mechanic to the game which works well, and isn't finicky. There's a melee attack, but aside from charms there's no variation there. Bows and tomahawks are reusable but not as strong as firearms initially, so a lot of the first half of the game you'll be balancing what weapons to use, etc. The maps are of a medium size aside from the tutorial map, and there's even fast travel and ""return to last location"" so you can hop back to town to pick up some stuff and go right back to where you were, which is nice and leads to more engaging gameplay over endless walking.The game is about 8 or so hours long if you do everything, probably 10-12 if you go for all the achievements. The story is interesting though it'll require a lot of reading. It's definitely a more subtle kind of horror, which I think works a little better in the long run for a game like this. I'd say at $20, this is a decent buy, but I got it for $4 which is a huge steal for this.			"

												You begin Betrayer washed up on the shore of the New World, a country rendered in stark monochrome. A linear path leads you inland, acting as a tutorial along the way, but it's once you reach the abandoned Fort Henry that you really begin to grasp what awaits you.Or rather, you don't. Betrayer is the sort of game that delights in keeping you on the edge, never entirely sure what's happened to rid the land of human life or what you're supposed to do about it. It's a game with no missions, no quest markers, no breadcrumb trails. Blackpowder Games, largely made up of former Monolith developers, has dipped into some obvious influences for this stark and striking horror adventure. The Elder Scrolls is one, with an open map through which you navigate by icons on the compass. You'll also sense strong echoes of Far Cry 3. Corrupted, animalistic Conquistadors patrol the wilderness, and since your only defences are crude bows, old-fashioned muskets and a throwing tomahawk, you'll spend a lot of time skulking through long grass, masking your movements in time with gusts of wind and thinning their numbers as stealthily as possible.Should you fall in battle - and you will, since these Conquistadors hit hard and are relentless once they have your scent - you'll respawn back at the fort, leaving all the valuables you found at the site of your death. If you die again before reclaiming them, whatever you found or earned is gone forever.But Betrayer is also an adventure game, of sorts, and one that is driven by mystery and puzzles. Not the crude block-sliding, lever-pulling puzzles that games so often fall back on, but deeper, more abstract problems. In terms of tone and mood it reminds me, more than anything, of the hallucinatory and terrifying climax of 2009 metaphysical viking movie, Valhalla Rising. It's a game that presents exploration as cloying terror and colonisation as a creeping cancer. It's scary, not in the cheap sense, but at a more primal level. You're compelled to explore this land - area by area - but it never feels comfortable or empowering.While Betrayer succeeds in atmosphere, it fares less well in pure gameplay terms. The lack of direction is thrilling, but becomes problematic when the game only marks specific locations on the map.Combat is, sadly, where the game is weakest. The enemies are fairly crude creations, wandering back and forth in fixed, meaningless patterns, and their AI doesn't stretch much further than simply charging at you once roused.Once you've got their attention, they'll follow you across the whole map, displaying only the most rudimentary of tactics - at a distance, they'll use ranged attacks, and up close they'll batter you senseless. Betrayer is rougher around the edges than its stylish exterior may suggest, but it's never less than fascinating.The whole game is a question, intriguingly posed and offering no easy answers.			"

												I really wish I could recommend this because some aspects of this game are excellent, however there are also negative aspects which really drag down the experience as a whole and make it just mediocre.The atmosphere and setting are pretty interesting, this being a horror adventure game set in a 17th century colonized America. You will solve mysteries about murdered colonies by finding clues and talking to lost souls in some other dimension, while fighting conquistadors and otherworldly creatures with 17th century weaponry as you do so.Visually it's also a very pleasing game and it gives you the option to customize how bright and saturated the colours are. So you could play in a completely gray scale world, or make it overly saturated so it looks unrealistic but beautiful, or just go for something realistic in between those. But how beautiful the scenery in this world might be, its stunning aesthetics are literally all it has. There is only some minor exploration involved in this world, which makes the gameplay feel really bland. It felt like the world of Skyrim, but after having taken out all of the dungeons, sidequests and other interesting things and just replaced them with a few empty colony bases and some things for you to find, which you pretty much are obligated to do to progress in the game. You basically end up doing fetch quests and constantly running around to talk to this lost soul or go find this clue, which becomes a massive drag and will make most people lose interest in the game around halfway in.I understand the plot reasons for the bases to be empty, and you would imagine everyone being dead to make you feel lonely, but it didn't because there were still plenty of enemies to break that solitary feeling. And if you would actually do different things in all of these bases it would be a lot easier to tolerate, but unfortunately it's just doing the same thing time and time again.This is all such a shame because everything about it looked so unique and promising, but it really ended up lacking variety in the gameplay and quests to an extreme extent.

												Betrayer is quite extraordinary. Its atmosphere is amazing, with it's beautifully crafted black and white world. But it's an empty world, one that needed way, way more content than this, because the gameplay becomes quite repetitive after a few hours, even if the story is mysterious and intriguing.You end up washed ashore and you have no idea how you got there or where you even are. Moving forward will act as a small tutorial and once you enter the next area the real game begins. Soon you'll find a deserted village, a village where you find a Maiden In Red (which the story is all about) and a bell. A bell that belongs to the village. Restore the bell and you can ring it, and it will instantly transfer you to an even darker world (please note that that's not quite true; the area remains the same, but the enemies and NPCs become different) where ghosts can be found. These ghosts tell a story and it's up to you to find more clues and solve the many mysteries this world has. You can switch between the light and dark world on the fly with the ring of the village bell and both of these worlds contain clues, found as letters or other objects. With the press of a button you will hear voices and sounds that will guide you in the right direction. Follow the sounds to find your next clue(s). An original concept that works very well, especially because it's an open world. I really liked it.Of course, there are also enemies to be found and these are actually quite tough at times. But defeat them and they'll drop loot. Loot that you might desperately need later on, because the enemies become harder to defeat. Other ways to gather loot is by buying it from a digital salesman in the village or by find treasure chests scattered across the lands. However, if you get slain by an enemy you'll drop all of your loot and you have one try to get it all back. Die before getting it and you'll lose everything, with no chance of ever recovering it (Dark Souls anyone ?).Enemies can be killed with stealth. Just use your bow to silently take care of them. Or you can kill them with help of the wind. It will mask your sound. Another original concept that works very well. Unfortunately, the AI disappoints from time to time so it's not always the way to kill off enemies. Enemies might never hear you even if you're only a few metres away from them, and other times they come running to you from miles away. It's all over the place and I was disappointed to see a polished game like this have such crappy AI.There are several areas in the game and exploration is key for solving the stories. But like I said, it becomes repetitive after a few hours because all you do is look for clues, ghosts and treasure chests and kill enemies. There's not much else to do in this game. Now, I do have to say that it kept my interest all the way through (which lasts about 10 hours), mainly because there's no handholding. The lore and stories are yours to interpret. And this is exactly what also made Dark Souls so fun to play. You get small hints of what's happening or happened and it's up to you to think of what might have actually happened. Good stuff !Betrayer is an excellent game and I'd love to see a sequel. But please, fix the AI and make the world itself a bit more interesting to explore. Recommended ![Rating: 78/100]			"

												I found Betrayer to be both unsettling and fun to play. Everything you encounter is shrouded in mystery, be it your marooned situation, the person that shoots an arrow in your path to pass along a message, or the ""darkness"" you enter upon ringing the settlements' bells. At first I found it to be a rather unforgiving game. There's not a whole lot of handholding that happens with this: Here is your bow. Be careful with your ammo. Try not to die to ravening conquistadors on your way in. Pick up some clues and try to piece together what the hell happened if you make it that far.Visually, I really enjoyed the black and white color scheme with the splashes of red to indicate things of importance (like piles of dirt, pools of blood, and things that want to kill you). But if black and white isn't your thing, and you don't enjoy that creepy Blair Witch vibe, you can adjust the color to the saturation you're comfortable with. There is no voice acting, which I find only contributes to the atmosphere of the game, lending itself to a rather solitary and unnerving experience. There is no musical score to speak of, but rather the things you would normally hear in my neck of the woods (the birds, the breeze, and your own footsteps). A lot of this game works on audio cues. You can hear the enemies if you care to listen for them. Stealth is the name of the game (not literally... but achievements! And... health!). So I highly reccommend it.Overall I enjoyed learning the story of these colonists. Some things, like the explosives you pick up, I have never found a use for, other than getting myself mercilessly slaughtered by every conquistador in the surrounding area. The ending, if not completely satisfying, is nevertheless what I would expect from this sort of eerie game. Definitely worth a look.			"

												From the moment I saw the beach you start on, I knew this game was going to be good.  Three hours in, I've been proven wrong--this game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.  The desaturated environment is both gorgeous and eerie.  It feels alive, too.  Birds and insects chirp and buzz, vegetation waves in the breeze, and the unliving grumble, creak, and scream.This game is great for anyone that loves horror and exploring creepy environments.  The combat is pretty fun, nothing unique, but I enjoy getting to use muzzle-loader guns and bows.  The story is satisfyingly disturbing, as well.  Sometimes I'm not sure what is scarier:  imagined horrors such as ghosts, or how bestial humanity often is.I look forward to what the developers have in store for us next.  Betrayer is an instant favorite of mine.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: Blackpowder Games Publishers: Blackpowder Games Initial release: March 2014Genre: FPS, Adventure, Action#Worth/NotWorth: #WorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationThe short version – Paranormal investigator extraordinaire meets Far Cry.You appear on a shore, behind you a ship. Likely the vessel that brought you here. A land devoid of color stay for an unpretentious amount of red. This game is not just visually strking, its stunning. You are given the option to play in shades of grey or blast the color saturation up to see lush forests and gated strongholds.The actual gameplay mechanics more or less revolve around two things. Exploration and killing things. Through your exploration you are likely to discover chests with goodies, pages with exposition that give insight into the goings on, gravestones among other things. Bascially, it's a completionists absolute dream or worst nightmare. The main draw though is to gain insight into the investigations about the ghosts.. I didn't mention the ghosts?! There are two worlds/dimensions to explore, though the same clues and collectables can be found in either. The dark world, the world in perpetual night where hostile undead things will spring forth from underground to ward you off the investigation. Where items must be ""cleasned of corruption"" before preceeding. And the light or daytime world. Hostile baddies still are here but their purpose seems less warding and more left over neural pathways of repeated and ingrained behavior from their time in life. Very real since of LIMBO here. Character progression is not necessarily ""gated"" but there is a very real MetroidVania -esk feel to upgrading your characters weapons from damage, speed of reloading, noise levels, amount of ammo held, amount of water (health packs) and charms that aid in movement speed, reload speed, and enemy detection. The sound design is absolutely phenominal. Listening to the wind to find your direction. The wind insisting its innocent. Audio cues to detect the natives who are virtually undetectable otherwise. I should mention the wind I speak about is more a button to listen to the wind as the actual wind is used as a stealth mechanic to hinder your noise and detection level. The beasties make crazy scary noises, very distinct ones. To the point of knowing what enemy is behind the bush. The screams are unnerving, you don't really get used to to ambiance, comfortable perhaps, its always slightly disqueiting. Even at the end when I was fully confident in my ability to survive I was still nervous to face enemies to some degree. My only caveat remains that enemies don't react to your shots until their health is completely depleted and become victims to the physics. I just wish you could interupt their attack to some degree. Overall, one of the more memorable and unique games I've played in awhile.Follow my curation for more "

Betrayer – Atmosphere, Horror, Exploration, Stealth, Investigation, Open-World, Historical, FPSa spoiler-free reviewRating: Highly RecommendedI have never been so scared of loons in my entire life. Crouched down in the tall grass, I listened for the cry of the water bird to come again for what seemed like whole minutes. I heard it suddenly, only a few yards behind me. I turned around slowly, but couldn’t see it against the pitch black shadow of the trees above. Holding my breath, my heart slamming against my ribcage, I took a step forward. Too late I realized I should have waited for the cover of the wind to muffle my footsteps. Four angered loon calls startled me from all directions as arrows flew towards me…The above passage is an account of what could have happened in Betrayer. The initial starting scene of waking up on a beach next to a shipwreck seems a little bland at first, but the game soon after departs from stereotype.- Visuals -Betrayer starts in greyscale, making the woods and trees around you dark and mysterious. The color red is still visible, though. Enemies dressed in red are immediately visible even from a hundred yards away. Red markers over health, shops, and ammo drops help discern them from the grey background. Some enemies do not have red, making them near impossible to see against shadow and therefore much deadlier.- Sound -First and foremost this game forces you to listen. Some enemies cannot be seen easily and can only be detected through  their special call. The most unique feature of this game by far is the fact that the human enemies use animal calls: bears, loons, etc. This serves to makes the player feel isolated – the only sounds one ever hears are the noises of the wild. Audial clues to the next objective in each area force players to use their ears over their eyes. Headphones are a must.- Story - (no spoilers)The player wakes up on a beach in 1604, Colonial America. As you travel, you discover deserted settlements, find weapons, and defend yourself from hostiles. You meet one person from the abandoned colony, a mysterious maiden in red who cannot remember her name. As you set out to discover her identity, you notice a bell has been removed from its post. You replace it and ring it out of curiosity. Strangely, you are transported into a shadow world with its own set of enemies and the spirits of deceased colonists. By collecting clues from the area around you and interviewing the spirits, you are able to piece together what happened to the settlements and discover who the maiden really is.- My Thoughts -I was immediately hooked when I started this game. I love atmospheric games that throw you into the world with set objectives but no set order to complete them in.If you are an impatient sort, this might not be the best game for you. Especially at first when you have low quality weapons and low health, stealth and patience are essential to survival. There is nothing more satisfying, though, than stalking one enemy for ten minutes or so and successfully getting a stealth kill on them (not a typical case).There are a few difficulty settings that you can change. I personally enjoyed the easiest difficulty level, but if you like punishment go ahead and try hard. There’s also a map system that shows you where just about everything is. If you enjoy a challenge, try turning the map waypoints off and using the audial clues to find stuff.- Cons -- Enemies’ pathfinding led to some interesting fights with lots of sudden 90° turns- Some enemies are actually impossible to see against a shaded background. Try flanking them to get a better vantage point.- Very little explanation of bullet/arrow drop leads to a high learning curve for trying to snipe far-off enemies- UI graphics aren’t too impressive- Last area is loaded with bugs – the devs really should release a patch or something- Each area feels quite repetitive in terms of tasks – devs should have provided a little more variety of quests- Wrap-up -For all you TL;DR readers out there, I think this game was probably one of my all-time indie favorites. There are a lot of genre tags for this game because it takes influences from all of them. Bugs and annoyances are there but don’t really impact game satisfaction. I’d highly recommend this game to anyone who can wait five minutes for anything; you’ll be glad you did!Not RecommendedRecommended With CautionRecommended- Highly RecommendedRecommended as Essential "

												Have you ever seen the Disney movie, Pocahontas?  Be prepared to be led on a magical journey through the wilderness surrounding early English settlement in Virginia.  You will learn to appreciate the things you take for granted and about the life altering passions of human nature.""Quit jerkin' me around, reviewer,"" I hear you saying.  ""This is a horror game about exploring a black and white world filled with scary monsters.  There is no way Betrayer is at all like Pocahontas!""Betrayer  is  like Pocahontas; not because they share a setting but because they are both stories of outsiders coming to understand and appreciate the world around them by introduction to a foreign culture.  You, the player, are the outsider.  You are learning to appreciate the world of sound design.  The culture that will teach it to you is the setting Betrayer presents.Okay, I'm jerkin' ya around a bit.  I'm sure as a clever reader who enjoys my long-form reviews, you already appreciate what good sound design can mean for horror and stealth games.  But Betrayer has built its sound design into its every aspect to create the perfect study.The stealth elements of Betrayer are entirely sound focused and are essential to your ability to remain hidden and to detect enemies.  Those enemies have a very small vision range.  However, if you run or use a firearm, they'll spot you in the dead of night, through a blizzard, in a concrete bunker, on another planet.  You'll need to move slowly or run in short bursts while gusts of wind cover the sound of your movement.  You won't hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon.  But you may learn which animal calls are made by an enemy that's just a silhouette hiding in pure, black shadow. Only by identifying the calls they make will you pinpoint their position and save yourself from a deadly ambush.It's like Marco Polo for keeps.Likewise, sound contributes more to the game's tension and atmosphere than the visuals ever could.  Oh yes, the conquistador enemies you encounter early are unsettling for their hunched posture and the segmented movements of their armor.  But it's the bear roaring that makes them frightening.  The use of animal sounds for humanoid enemies lends them that elusive otherness that makes them horrifying.  It also characterizes the savagery of their nature brought to life by the cursed land.While stealth and combat are important parts of Betrayer, I would say the core gameplay is about exploration and investigation.  And like the others, sound is key.  Objects of interest give off directional sounds to help you locate them and you can press a button to hear a directional sound leading you to your next main objective.  Your goal is to find physical evidence of the events that transpired and a bell to ring to visit a dark world haunted by ghosts.  You'll need to use your evidence and their testimonies to put together the story of the colony.  You won't paint with all the colors of the wind, no.  You will paint yourself a picture of racism, murder,♥♥♥♥♥♥ betrayal, and all the other destructive passions of a people unleashed by a wild land they weren't prepared for.There is a map and visual cues so that the hearing impaired might enjoy the game.  However, Betrayer has all kinds of new and exciting ways to diddle your ear-hole, so you should lean back, put on headphones, and enjoy the ride.Combat is fitting for the game's time period and tone.  You'll have access to a variety of bows, pistols, and muskets.  The latter hit - you and your enemies - for deadly amounts of damage, but make noise sure to give you away.  And you might as well go for a coffee while they reload.  Bows are silent, but the early bows you find only do deadly damage if you can fire them with precision while hidden.  And as everyone knows, an arrow bouncing harmlessly off your armor is the universal greeting for people who would like to be unceremoniously shot.The game flow is similar to Bioshock:  you start poorly equipped and combat is hazardous and resource depleting.  By the end of the game, though, you'll have found powerful weapons that reload stupidly fast and have tons of health restoring items and ammo.  Fortunately, combat never stops being deadly where groups of enemies are concerned and the last segments of the game put your resources to use in large, difficult fights.Like that adventure under the sea, Betrayer's narrative is similar.  Take it from me.   (What is it with me and Disney films today?) You play as an outsider washed ashore and left to discover the fate of a fallen society after the fact.  Unlike Bioshock (you didn't think I was talking about The Little Mermaid?), Betrayer takes place in the very real setting of Virginia in the early seventeenth century.  Can you imagine being dropped into a proper wilderness with nothing to help you survive? Try to imagine it without all the cabin building karate ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t of recent survival games.  What I'm getting at here is that Blackpowder Games chose a naturally scary setting.  Life as an early American colonist couldn't have been anything other than♥♥♥♥♥♥terrifying.They nailed that fear of being isolated in a very alive land you don't know anything about and threw in some monsters for good measure.  You'll find this Virginia's abandoned forts swarming with wraiths, Indians made of ash, and growly shambling conquistadors. The only living thing not trying to kill you seems to be a lady with a pragmatic attitude who nevertheless wears her best sexy Little Red Riding Hood Halloween costume.  Like the ghosts, her past is a mystery to be solved and tied into the omnipresent curse.Wait, what?  I haven't talked visuals, yet?  Sing with all the voices of the mountain, indeed.  The sound design here is that good.  But Betrayer also looks good.  Everything is in a stylish black and white with touches of bright red that direct your focus.  The wind effects through the dense foliage of your surroundings look great and the enemy animations strike a nice balance between natural and surreal.  The game also gives you the option to play the game in full color in the light world.  And the game looks just as good that way.  The only notable weakness is that the contrast is turned up to eye-gouging degrees.  I think the purpose was to try and give the light world a sense of hyper-real vibrancy, which it kind of does. But its biggest success was giving me a headache and making some things really hard to see.  That might be by design, but it's too much in my opinion.  I turned the contrast down halfway through and felt no shame whatsoever.  Fortunately, the option is there.There are some other minor criticisms to be made.  The in game map is at-odds with using sound to navigate.  If you only use the map, you'll get confused about  events that only trigger in a sequence that the sound navigation would unveil.  The sound navigation will disappoint your Nazi robot-like need to follow the most efficient course through all the treasures and objects of interest.  And you will have that need because the pattern for each area - explore light world, ring bell, find ghosts - becomes routine.  So neither method is ideal.And if you want a pure stealth game, this isn't it.  Stealth is a tool that you can and should use, but even early enemies are designed so that they  will  ambush you.  There are several big fights that are unavoidable.  In the dark world enemies pop out of the ground right in front of you.  And, worst of all for stealth-lovers, there's no way to run away and hide.  Once enemies have found you, they will follow you to the ends of the map (barring the perfect storm of big cover objects, wind gusts, and timing).  It's not terrible that Betrayer isn't a stealth game, but I'd sure love to see a proper stealth game use some of the ideas here.Worth ten bucks?  Well, I know good sound design and horror has a life, has a spirit, has a name.  It's Betrayer.			"

												When I purchased Betrayer, I got it on sale and only paid a little over $2.00 for it. I honestly wish I could go back and pay full price for it, as the creators of this game gave me over 20 hours of gameplay. But what is Betrayer exactly?It's a first person shooter/exploration/horror game, set in the 1600s. The premise is simple, in that you end up as a nameless pilgrim who washes up on shore after a shipwreck. Disregarding an ominous message, you end up battling the undead with bows, crossbows, pistols, muskets, tomahawks and small explosives. Your only other human contact is a mysterious woman dressed in red, so you need to find out what is going on and hopefully escape with your life. The gameplay is very solid and plays better with a Steam controller, although the keyboard and mouse setup works fine as well. No problems here. Graphically the game is great looking, whether you keep the default black and white noir setup or saturate it with color. One thing to note is that there is no music outside of the title screen, as the rest of the game relies heavily on sound, whether it is the wind blowing to help you with stealth kills or the moans and groans of the undead as they charge at you.One thing that can be a little frustrating is that the game, while open ended in each of its seven main areas, doesn't provide a direct linear explanation of the story or your overall objective. The story must be pieced together from clues and notes that you find along your journey, along with conversations you have with undead spirits, that you can somehow speak with despite no explanation as to why. So you know, the main objective of the game is to remove the corruption from the areas that have it so you can move onto the next map, although not every map has corruption within it.Currently there are map markers which point to the clues, notes, corrupted totems, and treasure, but these can be disabled if you wish. However leaving them on does not detract from the gameplay. These items should definately be sought out as not only will it improve your understanding of the story, but through the treasures you find (along with loot from defeated enemies) you can upgrade your arsenal of weapons along with ammo upgrades. Some people say this turns the game into basically a 'walking simulator' but it's no different then any other sandbox styled title where you need to travel to your objective.There is a lot to be had here and for the price it's an absolute steal. I give this game a musket blasting, crossbow shooting, undead killing recommendation.			"

												I'm very pleased with this game.  I bought it on sale for $4 and was a little skeptical about it specifically because it looked like the kind of game I would probably enjoy a lot (I was afraid I would be pumping it up just to be let down).  I'm very glad I was wrong and I can easily say that this game is worth full price.A few bits of personal preference to start off with; I personally prefer to have the color saturation turned up in the game.  There's two modes that you play in, one is in the light and the other is in the dark.  The dark provides plenty of the gray color palette to satisfy any inclination for having it feel gloomy.  The game itself does a good job of setting that mood even without having the colors being washed out.  I also made the darks less dark and the lights less light, just so I could feel comfortable being able to see everything there was to see.  The second personal preference is to NOT turn up the difficulty in the game.  The default difficulty is satisfying enough for me.  For players who might get frustrated enough to put the game down, I would suggest setting the difficulty to 'less deadly' right from the start.  The weapons are 17th century weapons and as such are slow and feel a bit cumbersome (although not at all as inaccurate as I was expecting).  You're going up against supernatural beings who are every bit as deadly as you are and if you die, they all respawn (in new spots -except inside strongholds) and you'll just have to find them and kill them again.  Avoiding them is very difficult and once they spot you, they'll chase you all the way back to camp if you're not able to take them down.The visual style of the game is excellent.  The sense of walking around in the woods is truly convincing and immersive. When the wind picks up to make all the vegetation move, it's nothing less than breathtaking.  I go hiking on a regular basis and this game comes as close as any game has ever come to replicating that experience.Navigating through the game and the story can seem a little confusing at first but it's actually very simple.  You basically use two things to tell you what to do.  Early in the game, you'll get a map and you'll get special senses.  Basically, all you have to do is turn on all of your map markers and go to the site of each one.  In addition to that, just keep using your special hearing skill (x-key by default) and follow the sounds to lead you where to go.  That's it.The game is pretty scary to me in a fun ghost story kind of way and it would make a great game to buy and play around Halloween, although there's certainly no need to wait for the next Halloween to come around.  If you have a system that lets you set all the eye candy to maximum, it's worthwhile to do so but the game is well designed, with a sense of peril and accomplishment that really satisfies.  I haven't finished the story yet so I'll update the review once I make my way through the whole game.Edit: Ok [I think] I've finished the game although it seems a little strange that it doesn't have any credits available, but I guess that's because it was a small team.  Anyway, here are some pros and cons.Pros:-Great overall story which is worth sticking around to see where it leads.-Great presentation.  Sort a combination of light versions of Skyrim, Far Cry 3, and Blair Witch Project.  -Just about the right length considering how repetitive it starts to feel at the end.Cons:-Lots of structures but not a single one is open to you to take a look inside.  It's all bunch of external shells and doors that won't open -basically just scenery.  Considering it's a period piece, it would have been nice to get a closer glimpse into what the daily lives of these people might have been like.  Maybe the sequel (?) will include this.-No voice acting.  I know this is unfair considering that it's an independent game with a low budget and also that it's available in multiple languages.  Nevertheless, maybe this game will be so successful that they'll be able to have a few more bells and whistles next time around.  Having said that, I'd very much prefer to have it be all text than to have any bad acting so there's that.-Repetitive quests.  Why is it that on every map I have to find someone's head, tell ghosts to find their way by listening to the bell, and find apparently meaningless gifts for the chick in red?  These things feel like and basically are meaningless distractions from the story that don't take up much time but nevertheless do so unnecessarily.Overall, I'd say it gets an 8/10 score.  The game was a lot of fun and very artfully presented.  A well thought out sequel could really shine and I'd really like to see this title thrive as a new property.			"

												*WARNING* Possible gameplay spoilers, read ahead at own risk.Betrayer is not a bad game, but not as good as it could have been.A visible effort into making a stand-out first person shooter-stealth horror game. Personally, I liked this game quite a bit. I'm fond of the design and setting and the gameplay wasn't bad, but there is plenty of room for improvement.The first thing a player will notice is the color scheme, black and white with red filters to create a unique visual setting which perfectly complements the lonely and abandoned theme of the game. It creates an unsettling environment and is capable of leaving a memorable impact on a player. But I found that while it does look neat, the style lacks substance and eventually becomes a chore to look at for prolonged periods. Thankfully you have the option to adjust color and saturation on the main menu, so therefore only half of the game gets tiresome to look at.Betrayer's gameplay can be considered as a FPS with stealth and horror implements. The player has an open world dotted with enemies to be looking out for, and three weapon slots to fill with your choice of weapons. While the gameplay wasn't atrociously bad, there are some loose screws that break a chunk of the experience off. The game takes place in the 1700's in the new world (AKA modern day America if you don't know history) and takes advantage of the technology of the time period: Bows and powder loaded single shot firearms comprise your selectable armory. One of the problems I have with Betrayer is the weapons itself, being a first person shooter weapons are a very important part of the gameplay, and the weapons available are of short variety and are slow and meticulous to use. To fill your three weapon slots is a selection of 5 weapons, 3 kinds of bows and 2 firearms. The bows are unreliable in combat because a heavy chunk of enemy distribution are covered in a kind of armor that has a chance to harmlessly deflect your arrows, and the guns, realistically but kind of frustratingly, take a long time to reload. This makes the combat either frustrating or uninteresting depending on the player's approach. Stealth mechanics are also implemented, enemies start off unaware of you but can detect you if they see or hear you coming. To counteract this, you can stay crouched and in shaded, obsure areas and move when the wind blows to block out the sounds of your footsteps. Stealth is even encouraged in the prologue level as it explains that enemies become enraged when in combat making them stronger, and that attacks while undetected deal more damage. A problem with this is that the stealth mechanics aren't as polished as they should be in order to suggest such an approach for the whole game. Enemies will always know exactly where you are if you mess up, and you cannot escape and try again, making a stealthy capture of a fort or outpost a ""do it right the first time or not at all"" deal. Also, I find that using arrows is more difficult with the black and white color scheme since its harder to determine where your arrows are flying, so it takes longer to determine the arc and most often giving yourself away.For the horror aspect of Betrayer's design: I think it's subjective. I didn't find anything scary but that doesn't mean others will too. I liked some of the enemy designs, the maddened beasts wearing spanish inquisitor armor and the burned men (who are IMPOSSIBLE to see with black and white settings) are some of the most unique and creative designs I've ever seen. But at the same time the enemies are also so uncreative and boring. Other types of enemies include giant spiders and skeletons, might as well go all the way and throw in Frankenstein's monster and dracula to get the real Disney's Haunted Mansion effect. I was really disappointed at this turn, since the other types of enemies are creative and fit perfectly with the game's setting only to erase them out entirely halfway through the game and rely on cliche monsters you'd find in a kids halloween drawing. On a side note here, one of the most memorable and fun parts of the game is where you come across a large fort that you'd expect to be infested with enemies, only to find it empty. You feel slight relief at the unexpected respite when you hear battle horns in the distance and then find yourself under seige from the spanish inquisitors. This part was so unexpected and fun, I really wished that more of Betrayer had moments like this. Nobody suspects the Spanish Inquisition!Now to the final point: Betrayer is a semi-open world game with a sort of mystery setting for the story, setting out a bunch of clues in the map and letting the player explore to find them, no handholding. This leaves the entire experience of Betrayer to the player's whim, do you scour the map finding each and every bit or do you rush through to the end? While this is a good idea, the game's design is flawed and incapable of supporting it. Resulting in a lot of backtracking, boredom and searching. Being ""alone and abandoned with no handholding"" requires that the game fully captivates its player, getting them excited and invested in the experience making them want to discover everything and providing positive reinforcement with a sense of accomplishment. Betrayer has none of these, you find a clue, make a note of it and maybe a ghost will say something about it.  This results in the exploration of Betrayer being uneventful and disappointing. Not to mention that in order to uncover a large majority of items hidden you need a shovel, which can be found roughly half way through the game, resulting in a LOT of backtracking. While Betrayer missed the mark, the ideas are there. It could have been so much better, creating a unique open world mystery game in the 1700's with supernatural twists and heart pounding stealth combat. Instead Betrayer is flat, repetitive and lacking in a lot of substance. Despite my enjoyment with the basic idea of the game and all of it's potential, I can't help but feel disappointed with the direction the game took instead. The appeal is there but doesn't build up to anything worthwhile.			"

												Betrayer is a bag of mixed emotions. Appealingly presented in beautful monochrome and undeniably atmospheric, it's a falling star that will mesmerize you for a moment before its light disippates into night sky. What do i mean by this ? Well, give me a moment to explain.Year is 1604 and you just woke up on the beach of the New World among the debris of a marooned ship carrying nothing but your knife. World around you is presented in stylish monochrome with pleasant sounds of splashing waves and schreeching seagulls. It could almost be idyllic if it weren't for the fact that you barely escaped watery grave. With only the vaguest idea of where you are and what to do next, you scrounge up what you can from boxes that are strewn around the shore and head up inland. It doesn' take too long until you stumble on a first sign of life in a form of a warning arrow, shot by a person clad in red. A friendly advice on a piece of paper will introduce you with a opportunistic merchant who provides you with your first weapon and hope of future, mutually beneficial relationship. Wepon in hand, but caution in mind, you'll proceed to face whatever dangers stalk the tall grass of this newly colonized country. Incidentaly, stalking is the best approach to combat. Your crude longbow won't do you much good in a straight on fight and breasplate worn by your enemies will deflect most arrows. Stealthy approach is very much encouraged - hiding in tall grass and utilizing shadows and gusts of wind to mask your footsteps before you can close in for one deadly strike. However, if you cross their direct line of sight they will spot you and charge to your location which creates a lot of intense encounters, at least in the beginning until you size them up and get better equipment. Like in Dark Souls, you lose all your loot when you die; (an option which can be turned off in gameplay menu), so you want to choose your fights carefully. There is a modest variety of weapons, appropriate for that era. Powerful, but slow-loading muskets and flintlock pistols for your short range, fire-and-forget needs with weaker short/longbows and crossbows doing a nice job at long range sniping. There are also quick-throw explosives and tomahawks when enemies get too close. Exploration will reveal small bits and pieces of information - page scraps provide lore and insight into past events, puzzling clues an evidence into violent misdeeds, graves engraved with names and causes of death - these are constant reminders that something  has gone terribly wrong. Immersion is an overused buzzword, but it's really appropriate here. All this culminates when you reach your first settlement; a small fort mysteriously deserted, showing signs of struggle. Here you'll be introduced to another gameplay mechanic, where you need to collect a bell, hang it from a beam and ring it, whereupon you'll be transported to a darker version of normal world. Dark world is populated by skeletons and floating shades; your vision is limited, and you have to orientate yourself by ""listening"" and/or following small appearing pointers on the screen. These will lead you to lost souls, remaining echoes of colonists who will explain the significance of certain clues and slowly unravel their mysterious fate and events that led to their untimely, violent deaths. In these first few hours it looks like Betrayer will settle into a nice rythm, providing a good balance between atmospheric, nearly horror experience, exploration and combat, but it never quite comes to that. New areas you discover feel and look pretty much the same - they're mostly empty and while collectibles offer a decent incentive to explore, it will inevitably become tedious. Enemies that seemed dangerous and sinister before will show all limitations of their AI when you realize there's nothing more to their tactics than relentlessly charging to your location. Most of the combat challenge will come from limited 17- century weapons, and finding more powerful ones is crucial to your survival. These are mostly found on dead enemies or in chests, but really powerful unique, weapons are buried beneath piles of rock that can only be accessed once you find a spade much later in the game. Unfortunately they use exactly the same models as regular ones so it lacks that feeling of finding something really special. Backtracking isn't a problem since there's a fast travel system, but your character is shown as area circle on the map, instead of the usual arrow, which creates  confusion when you're trying to find your way, so I'd recommend turning on compass. Ghostly investigations you have to do will reveal very interesting albeit mostly tragic stories, but ultimately amount to nothing more than running from one location to the next, picking up mementos and presenting them to appropriate shade. It's gets very formulaic and repetitive very soon - get to the new area, retake the settlment from enemies, find the bell, go to the dark world, play the courier for ghosts, rinse and repeat.  It approaches greatness but never reaches it and that's what's most frustrating of all. Tenative recommendation. If you approach it from purely gameplay standpoint, you will ultimately be disappointed, but if you take in all the atmosphere and look past its objective flaws, you'll find an enthralling experience. Not really a scary one, but one with uncomfortable sense of unfamiliarty and uknown.			"

Many glitches and bugs ( I got stuck in the stones several times, I have wandered to the end of the world and then fell into the oblivion) Findings are sometimes barely visible The game gets monotonous. There are just 3 maybe 4 different types of enemies, every location is almost the same) The game is not stable (at least for me). It had crashed 3 times during 6 hour gameplay.

												ATTENTION: AMD USERSDO NOT BUY!!!!Read the steam forum thread: https://steamcommunity.com/app/243120/discussions/1/558752451333082368/It has been 2 years, and this has never been resolved. Both the devs and AMD have abandoned all efforts to solve this bug. I believe the solution lies more with AMD, since this issue is very specific to their GPUs and their GPUs ONLY.This game is all about atmosphere. Before I got my AMD R7 360, this game was immersive, despite being black and white (with some red, sometimes) only. I played it with a pair of 7.1 surround gaming headset and the audio was fantastic. But these two bugs (and there are more), really ruins it.So, if you want to play this game and you happen to be an AMD user, don't. I for one will switch to Nvidia first before I play this again..

												Alright. Yes this game is in Alpha and it is not yet finished but it is indeed awesome. The screenshots do not do it enough justice, the high contrast black and white look gives this game a wonderful ""feel"" and since it is more first person adventure than run and gun shooter this creepy vibe only helps. Good atmosphere and good mix of exploration and enviromental storytelling let you proceed at your own pace. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a different FPS game that isn't just shoot, shoot, shoot with no real story of time to think. Play it. You will not regret this at all, plus its in alpha so you actually can give the devs some feedback and help them shape this wonderful game.			"

												You're shipwrecked by the Spaniards in colonial times. You have no one and nothing but what you're wearing.  You venture into the wild defenseless and wary.  The sounds of the wind follow you as you make your way along a trail.  You hear crows and other critters, but see no one and hear no one until you stumble upon a Spaniard wearing full armor. You try to reason with him but then you hear a horrible unearthly sound and the Spaniard rushes you.  It is no longer human...This game is fps mixed with horror.  You find clues along the way in the form of letters, items, and tombs that tell you about the world and what has happened.  There is the day time cycle which is filled with undead Spaniards and a dark cycle whereupon all the undead come to light. I enjoyed this game quite a bit.  It was fun figuring out the various mysterious and stories.  Also there are plenty of jump scares and I found myself doing quite a bit of stealth. You get to use bow and arrow, crossbows, pistols, muskets, even grenades.  The game was made to be played in black and white but I used the following color settings to make it easier on my eyes.  2.2, 1.3, and 1.0.  I give this game a 7/10. Check it out! "

												Betrayer caught me by surprise. I heard good praises about it without querying for details. After completing the game, those praises are definitely warranted. The initial setting of being washed ashore with no knowledge of who or where you are shrouds the player in a mist of mystery. The black & white graphics provide a unique atmosphere. I actually didn't realize you could play the game in color until I was almost finished with the game, but after trying both settings the black & white graphics really adds a sense of creepiness that you don't get with color.Stumbling upon the first fort location, armored figures can be seen pacing back and forth, standing guard. At first it's really unclear how to approach the situation. Are they friendly? While trying to be sneaky, I was quickly spotted by one who alerted the whole platoon and 12 enemies quickly descended upon me. Goose bumps filled my skin from head to toe as I just turned and ran, my heart pounding as I occasionally looked back only to catch a glimpse of the blood red eyes of my pursuers.It soon became clear that I could not escape and one-by-one I drew my makeshift bow, adrenaline swelling, and aimed squarely for their heads. One down...then another. Soon, after what felt like an eternity of running and shooting, they all fell before my feet, their red outlines lingering. My heart was able to catch a much needed rest.And this was only daybreak. More sinister lurkings are waiting in the night...Betrayer is really a spectacular game, for the first 3 or 4 areas. Then it starts to feel repetitious because all the adrenaline expended killing your first squad starts to become routine after about the 4th instance. So while there is plenty of gameplay, its appeal is lost somewhat quickly. And while there is a grander story coupled with all the action, it gets lost in all the noise (until the end of course).Overall, it is a fantastic game, although it could have been a lot better had there been more to explore.

												Betrayer is a First Person Action game set in colonial Virginia. The gameplay feels very similar to Elder Scrolls, with the ability to fast travel from one location to another via the game map. Unlike other First Person games out there, Betrayer uses a monochrome art style, which is a little disorienting at first. It looks cool, and definitely stands out from other games of the same genre, but I think this particular game could have looked amazing with colored graphics, just my opinion. The tutorial area consists of a beach where you are trying to find out what is going on. You learn how to sprint, melee etc. In this game you also collect clues, loot treasure chests, bust open crates for loot, and of course fight conquistadors. One ofthe first weapons you can get is the bow, so using stealth you learn to take out enemies from a distance. When you die you can try to retrieve your belongings but if you don't get to them in time, you will lose them. I am curious to see where the story takes me as it seems interesting, a deserted colony, Conquistadores and Natives who seem to have gone insane and a mysterous stranger who has amnesia and can't see the enemies you see. Worth a playthrough, for the story, as well as to check out a game that actually uses monochrome in 2015.			"

												One of those games that seem rather boring before you actually play them, and when you play them they become one of those unique experiences you don't forget for a long time. While not a great game, Betrayer is a decent somewhat open-world game where you wander through land and find out what happened to those who were before you. In addition, you get to fight some enemies that are not easily taken down unless by a surprise attack, so you are mostly sneaking around and taking them from afar. The difficulty is challenging at times, the atmosphere and audiovisuals are unsettling, and the graphics are very unique and beautiful. Albeit short, it was a very enjoyable experience, and I recommend it very much.			"

												(Final Update)Alright, I finished the game the other day, and my overall impression just kept getting better as the game progressed. I think it was of the more interesting and fun games I've played in a while. It's also one of the few early access titles I've bought where you can see a clear line of game improvement progression as far as the development goes. From the early alpha to now, the improvements were consistent and did take into consideration the playing experiences of the early adopters..The ending had a definite WTF moment, and somebody else I was reading said they nearly crapped their pants, lol. That moment was abrupt and shocking enough for that to be apt, lol. Anyway, I thought it was a stellar game well worthy of anybody's attention. (Previous Updates with some SPOILERS)Been playing more of the Betrayer today. I finally got the hang of combat enough to be able to make some real progress. I also noted that the developers listened to the complaints about the enemies unceasing search for you (and by search, I mean making a beeline for you no matter how well hidden you are or how far you have run) once they aggro. Now, if you can get out of their line of sight and stay far enough away, the enemies will start heading back to wherever they were patrolling the first time. That makes the pistols and muskets viable choices, since before, given the amount of noise they make, enemies from anywhere within earshot would head right to you no matter how far away you had moved once firing. Now, they don't, which is awesome.Anyway, now I'm at a very challenging (for me anyway) point where I've found and unlocked everything in the normal world on the first map, but have to cleanse some totems in the spirit world in order to move on to the next map, and the spirits guarding them are super tough, fire energy balls at you, and generally are as fast as you are.(next)Alright, progress update:Definitely moving at a faster pace now. I'm on the Fort Hope map and SPOILERSfinally found the shovel. Turns out those rock piles hold some of the best equipment, which is unsurprising considering how long it takes to get the shovel.Running away is also a viable tactic, especially once you figure out the maps a bit. There is almost always a spot where you will have the advantage over multiple enemies. Leading them there is key to taking a lot of the defended areas like forts and such....at least from my own play experience.SPOILER END (next)I use a gamepad, which I like, but the game clearly is made for k/m, and I think your odds of success increase if you play k/m. Definitely your weapon accuracy increases.I also re-keyed the gamepad, which helped my experience a lot. Setting up heal, jump, and such to keys that made more sense for me elevated my experience.Anyway, I may actually finish this game over the next couple days. I really don't see how people are getting through their first playthrough in 8-10 hours. I'm legitimately approaching 16 hours of post full release gameplay, and I can see putting another 8-10 in, and that's without trying to find every chest, note, etc..(Original Review)I purchased Early Access to this game via Steam. It has since seen its full release (a lot of you bought this while it was on sale yesterday, so I guess you all are aware of its full release, lol).Anyway, I have put about 4 hours (maybe a bit less) into the game so far and my impressions are as follow:It is a disturbingly beautiful game. The sharp contrast between the black and whites in the black and white world are compelling. The way they did this was pretty amazing IMO. The world truly looks living and breathing, and yet at the same time, there is a forlorn sense of desolation that comes with it. Really an amazing setting. The use of red to highlight things of importance such as items, enemies, and even allies just adds to the stark contrast between beauty and horror. You can also enter a spirit world version of the same world (basically, your perception of the world around you is changed) wherein enemies are highlighted in blue instead, and everything seems quite surreal. The developers use of sound really brings all this to the forefront. Every sound and sight has a reason and noting seems out of place.The interface has notably improved from the early versions of the game. The item/quest menu is pretty simplistic and easy to navigate. The map has also improved from its early state. Key areas show on the map as you find them and become fast travel spots. You can also see pretty much exactly where you are on the map. Other than that though, you really have to rely on the in game compass to navigate. In fact, this game doesn't really hold your hand at all. I think in many ways, they got their inspiration from Morrowind, especially in the way quests are presented. For example, you may meet the a guy who is looking for signs of his wife. Last he remembers, they would sit together on a hill overlooking the fort. That is all the info you are going to get. Now, it's on you to try and figure out where that location is. However, there aren't a lot of hills overlooking the fort, so it isn't a needle in the haystack type scenario, and when you get closer to the spot, it is highlighted in that eerie red and certain sound become more evident in the surrounding area.The use of stealth is very important in this game. In fact, I knock a little off my overall view of this game due to an issue tied with this, because....once you attack something, it aggros and knows exactly where you are regardless of how fast you run, how long you run, or how well you hide. In addition, if it (or you) use a weapon that makes a lot of noise, and other creatures within earshot also aggro. That is a real flaw in the game in my estimation. So, stealth becomes ever more important to try and either get the best position to take down an enemy quickly, or to just completely bypass them altogether, undetected. The use of movement during wind gusts to mask your sound is particularly brilliant in its application and wind gusts happen often, so being stealthy is completely do-able.The combat itself is fairly forthright. You have missile and melee options. Your missile options include one launched/fired weapon (bow and arrow, musket, so on) and a thrown weapon as well. Your bows/guns can be scrolled through on the gamepad and you can have up to three assigned to slots for this. The enemies can take some punishment,so again, the element of surprise is crucial as is upgrading to better weapons whenever you have the option. Healing is accomplished by drinking water and you carry a waterskin with you.The story itself is pretty intriguing so far, and is both surreal and haunting. It and the environment suit each other quite well.The gamepad interface, which was a complete wreck in early stages has also become a pleasant alternative to k/m. Some real thought went into how to key the various actions to a gamepad, and I personally prefer it to k/m for this game at this point.So....those are my impressions so far. I think it is easily worth people trying out due to its unique qualities and amazing backdrop. Just know that the combat can be quite unforgiving for the reasons I outlined above. Hopefully (at least in my opinion), the developers nerf the enemies aggro a bit so you can at least flee a battle if need be without the certainty of being hunted to the ends of the earth unerringly.I will update this later after I have either finished the game and/or found things worth mentioning here.

												Betrayer is an action-adventure game set in 17th century America. Once ashore you reach your very first settlement but find it completely abandoned apart from some human-sized ash figures. The only friend you have is a girl wearing a red cloak. She is looking for her sister and asks for your aid.While wandering in the forest you encounter conquistadors who attack you immediately. Stealth is very important - especially at the beginning of the game - as you can quietly dispose of your enemies without having to fire your weapon. Initially, you have a bow but soon you'll be able to obtain a crossbow and also a pistol and a musket. These - as the game takes place centuries ago - require quite some time to be reloaded.I like the atmosphere of the game. I am not sure why the creators went with the monochrome (black and white) art style but it certainly suits the game's atmosphere. In fact, only some key elements show up in red colour such as the things you can interact with and the enemies. Wind blows heavily from time to time which completely conceals the sound of your footsteps. Both the art style and the sound effects deserve a high five!While the map shows small settlements and roads you can go elsewhere in the forest to find many secrets as it does not reveal everything. There are hidden chests, graves, clues and even unique weapons scattered throughout the land. Later in the game you obtain a shovel with which you can dig at certain places.Oh, the clues! Every map has a central settlement where you can install a bell. Once rung the game changes your surroundings completely. Everything becomes dark and creepy and instead of conquistadors you fight skeletons and evil spirits. You find good spirits who will always tell you a story. A story of a murder, betrayal, vengeance or something sinister that resulted in the death of the townsfolk. You can then find other ghosts and clues (items) to reveal the background of these killings. While not necessarily a long game and repetitive at times, Betrayer offers a refreshing experience in the FPS genre with its unique art style and excellent sound effects. The game never tells you where to go but you are able to ""listen"". By pressing X you hear a sound effect that is stronger if you are close to your objective and also if you face the right direction. This is a creative way to make you navigate and the creepy sound effect greatly accompanies the haunting atmosphere of the Otherworld.Highly recommended and do keep the monochrome colouring style as intended!

												to be honest, i bought this game on sale and saw it as nothing more than a time waster. after only two hours of playing i am hooked, and it has become much more than that. both the light and dark worlds are tense and oppressive, the weapons and how they handle is probably my favorite thing, it really makes you think about how to handle yourself when in combat. pistols and muskets are slow to reload, slow enough that it becomes a hinderance when faced with more than two opponents. this is where the beauty lies with this game, you cant just run around and expect to survive, there is a thought process required. while im nowhere near finished with this game i can still give it a solid thumbs up, and i urge anyone who is debating the purchase to just go for it, whether on sale or full price, its worth it			"

												This is a game that doesn't do much hand holding, often giving you little to no direction at all and just letting you loose in large open environments. But that's kind of what makes it so enjoyable. Shooting ghosts and zombie Spaniards with a musket and longbow is awesome fun. It seems to be very well optimized too.Full video review:

												Definitely a Thumbs Up for Betrayer!  I've played through it twice - once when it was released & again 2016 for the 100% Achievements, and both times I thoroughly enjoyed it.I don't say this lightly - THIS GAME IS UNIQUE. I don't think I've played anything that I can compare it to, and that is a GREAT thing. It's fresh.  The story is interesting & sooo twisted - (spoiler - it seems the natives were the only 'good guys') LOL. ALSO, the game was creepy as H3LL when going over a map after ringing the bell. I'm not a run 'n gun player, so I just eased around slowly & stealth killed most of the bad stuff.  Fav moment was coming across a hunting party of 10 natives in the woods & dropping them 1 by 1 without the others ever getting a clue - Nice!  (Also, to take out all the Thieves, I'd  recommend stealthing it up - they're too quick otherwise).  You'll have an interesting assortment of primitive weapons to choose from and different ability combos with the charms you find, too.  I went for Health, Stealth, & Speed, and felt bullet-proof <grin>.So, Betrayer is a memorable game and time well spent. It was absolutely worth the originall selling price, and now it's a steal at $5 or lower sales.  Try it - I think you'll like it.  Cheers			"

												One of the most affecting games I have played in recent memory and one that often lingers and haunts me after a play session. There are slight echoes of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. (mood and pacing) alongside a subject matter that was reminiscent of the film The VVitch (yes, I know the game predated that film's release) with combat inspired by Skyrim and Far Cry. I started the game about 8 months ago and then was pulled away from it after only playing the first few hours due to a busy life schedule. Since then I have started and played other games but Betrayer stood out in my mind and left a lasting mark. I kept thinking about my brief initial experience and finally decided to revisit the game in recent weeks. I am glad I did and played it through to the end. Despite some moderate repetition and a playtime that lasted a little longer than the core concept could sustain comfortably I had a very positive experience with the title. I loved the colonial setting which is noticeably underexplored in gaming and the flintlock firearms and bows made for very tense and deliberate combat--just like in Far Cry 2 the experience is best when you crank the enemy difficulty up!Overall the strongest element is the unsettling and foreboding mood laced with just enough unexpected disruptions and peripeteia to keep the tension high and the player questioning. This game is worth playing for the setting and the mood and will leave a lasting impression in an age of well-crafted but forgettable alternatives.  "

												A really unique game; I've never played any game like it. Pros:The enviornment is BEAUTIFUL. Seriously, I love the wind effects.Weapons feel really satisfying.Story is interesting only if you pay attention to it.Good fast travel system.The darkworld is really neat.Great value (Full price is $5 now, and it's $2.49 on sale).The whole map in unlocked from the start (except for the very last area).Neutral:Not voiced.It's hard to follow the story later in the game. The journal helps you organize what's going on, but I stopped caring towards the 3 hour mark.Short. About 6 hours to do every side objective, loot every chest, and explore every corner of the map. I think this is a good thing though. If it were any longer, it would get boring and repetitive.Cons:While the wind effects are nice, the map lacks a lot of things you'd see in the woods. I do a lot of hiking, so it bothered me that there were no little streams, animals (besides crows), and density of flora/trees. I've actually gone hiking in Virginia (where the game takes place) and it looks much different. A lot of the map feels copy/pasted and is a little sparse.Some of the enemies are just plain annoying.Overall:I'd say this is a solid indie game; you can tell the devs put their heart and soul into it. The value is good and there's enough to do to keep you entertained for 5+ hours, although, honestly, I probably won't replay it for a few years. I'm feeling a 7/10 for this game. Just be sure to buy it on sale (buy ALL your games on sale).			"

												There are already some great reviews here, so I'll keep mine brief and attempt to not repeat what has already been said.I've only played about an hour and a half of this game and I'm already overwhelmingly impressed. I had this game on my wishlist for some time because I was unsure of how it would play. I managed to snag it on an 80% off sale, and I must say, had I known this game was so nice, I would have gladly paid full price for it.So far, the only drawback of this game seems to be the lack of voice acting, but that's honestly nothing I've ever been upset about. I've even played my fair share of text based rpgs. I'm also not a graphics junkie so the assets don't bother me at all. Additionally, this game doesn't lead you by the hand, which really isn't a drawback in my opinion. If you read and observe your surroundings, you'll slowly peice together what it is you're meant to do... or at least, build a perception of what you believe you are supposed to do... who knows why you're truely here? I sure don't yet (and I'm excited to find out).My review of this game?The enemies are noticibly clever, and that always makes me happy. They pause to attack when you're reloading, aim where you will be as you straife instead of where you were, and search for you where they last saw you if they lose sight of you.I enjoy piecing together plot through dialogue, and this game has that, by allowing you to find and converse with wraiths and shadows that either barely or don't at all remember who they once were. Being able to travel back and forth between the 'night' and the 'day' adds an extra dimension to the semi-open world.I've always enjoyed horror, adventure, puzzle, games, much like Silent Hill, but I've never played one in a more wilderness style setting. It's quite refreshing to experience.If these traits sound like something that will entertain you, and you don't mind the lack of spoken dialogue, prefab assets, and lots of reading and retracing your steps, this game is well worth $5, in my humble opinion. These are the sorts of games that should definitely be supported.			"

												It's fairly easy to knock about Betrayer if you approach the game like F.E.A.R or another 'ctrl+C, ctrl+V' shooter, but that is totally on you - not the developers. Rather, this should be played like a point and click game in many respects, with an appreciation for the art style Blackpowder has adopted.Let's start with that. The aesthetic of the game is obviously fairly distinct and this can be a great detractor for some people. Though there is a colour saturation option (that's right, you can play in colour), it is really not recommended as you lose a great deal of the art style that ultimately shapes the atmosphere of the game. However, I found that bumping up colour to 0.1 was beneficial in many cases as it allows for small amounts of extra detail to be resolved, adding a bit more depth otherwise lacking from homogenous blacks that at times were hard to wrap your head around. Overall it's quite gorgeous, and Blackpowder have clearly optimised the look to suit black and white with a little wiggle room for very minimal colouring.Weapons are by in large period faithful. Crossbows, short bows, long bows, muskets, tomahawks (no, not the exploding kind), flintlocks and rudimentry grenades make up your arsenal. I read elsewhere someone complaining about a lack of automatic weapons - which reflects more upon their own retardation than a fault of the devs. Each weapon feels distinct, and you'll be conciously cycling between certain ones based on the context of the battle at hand, with things like muskets woeful for close combat with multiple enemies but an absolute cannon for longer ranges. Though the mechanics are overall quite simplistic, the hierachy of weapons and their upgrades mean that you'll rarely be dependent on just a single one until quite late in the game.Other things to note are the actual quests and storyline. All follow a theme (if you can't guess it, log off and finish off your homework of reciting the alphabet) that can at times be a bit ""geee I really didn't see that coming,"" but remain distinct enough so that if you're genuinely interested in playing the game, you'll recall who-is-who and what-is-what. It may not be the strongest storyline, but it is entertaining enough to see the game through to completion with a twist or two.Finally, the game follows an open world structure most similar to that seen in S.T.A.L.K.E.R games - with open regions to explore that may be left by only a single route in either direction. Though you can teleport anywhere on the discovered map, I find that it actually is inhibitory to your progress as you miss things like chests, buried charms, quest items and unique weapons that you probably overlooked in the early games. These can actually play a pretty big part in how you finish the game, so keep that in mind. There are plenty of other things I could mention - like the charms, enemies, stealth mechanics, great soundwork or the otherwordly realm; but those are probably best left a bit hush-hush so you can enjoy them yourself. This is a great game that has been well produced but may at times suffer from acute cases of cliche or confusion. If you approach it not like a shooter, but like a point-and-click adventure, you'll enjoy yourself.			"

												Betrayer is a game marked by absence. There is no soundtrack to speak of and its color palette is limited to shades of white, black, and red. That emptiness is chilling, but does also serve to enhance what is there. The normally ambient sounds of the breeze and rustling in the distance are given even greater purpose as they are the means of hiding your movements from enemies while tracking theirs. The player is left constantly shifting between being the hunter and the hunted, a feeling that is heightened by a selection of weapons centered around bows and 16th century firearms. And despite incidental noises being the only sounds the game provides, the tension of always listening for the next encounter means actionless stretches are not tedious. However, the desolate landscape and the fight for survival are secondary to the mystery of the game. The plot unfolds largely through documents left behind by the colonists and the game does a surprisingly good job of switching between those grounded stories and an overarching narrative while elegantly tying them together. Betrayer doesn't force any motivations, or any personal details for that matter, on the player character which makes it odd, then, that the only other living person in the area isn't given them either. The enigmatic Maiden in Red remains so guarded - or just naturally passionless - that it's difficult to connect with her, which leaves it equally difficult to invest emotionally in the situation at hand. While this disposition does make sense for her character, it seems like an important opportunity was missed. It's moments like these that cause Betrayer's sense of restraint to feel a bit less than intentional. Maybe the game was designed to emphasize only the most essential elements or maybe it was left unfinished. Whichever case it is, the important parts are here: an immersive world with an intriguing story to tell.			"

												Before the infestation of Steam with ""indie games"" and ""walking simulators"" since the last two years. There were a really good real indie games. Like this one.  It's a first-person exploration survival horror game. Maybe the new Resident Evil VII will be like this game.  Edit: No, this game is way better than Resident Evil VII.  The tag ""Atmospheric"" means something when it comes to this game. It has very nice visual style. The game by default is in ""noir"" visual style: black and white with red for the enemies. But you can change the color settings, as you want it. Perfect combination between ""art game"" and  real ""survival horror game"".  The story is surprisingly good and very original. It's scary but not gory like in the Resident Evil. More mystical ghost type of horror story. You, the main character, are a shipwreck survival, who wakes up on the coast of colonial Virginia. What happen, where are all of the colonists and who is the cute girl in the red dress? There are several huge areas to explore and solve this mystery.  Some may say that the game suffers because there aren't voice acting. When it comes to talk with the NPCs there are only text menus. It's indie game after all. But for me, this perfectly fits with all the spooky ghosts which populates the game. A ghost don't speak with a voice, it talks directly into your head. Only a text can bring that feeling.  The gameplay is solid. I don't know how other to say it. It reminds me about the first survival horror games like ""Alone in the dark"" and ""Resident Evil"". The game don't ""lead you"" or ""hold your hand"" and show you what to do. You are doing all the exploration as you like and by yourself. The fights are heavy and difficult even against one enemy. There is a stealth mechanic for silent kills and avoiding multiple enemies. The stealth mechanic includes a gameplay mechanic option to mask of your steps with the sound of the wind. To fight properly you must to use all of the items and weapons you can find. You can't really ""die"" in this game. If your Hp hit 0% you are ""kissing"" the ground, pass out and the lovely girl in red dress, drags you back to the nearest settlement. But you are losing all of the items and weapons. To get them back you must go back on your ""dying place"" and if you die again before getting them you will lose them like in the hardcore RPG ""Dark Souls"". Also, there is very nice ""sound"" gameplay mechanic. You are using your hearing to navigate- finding points of interest or hidden objects. There are very nice and helpful option settings to make the game more ""friendly""(easy) for certain players. Like removing the Dark Souls ""items backpack drop"" when you die. Or putting a visual ""sound"" indicator on your compas for people with hearing disabilities. For this money is a steal. I mean, there are so many ""triple A""  $60 games with less content. Edit: On several times in this review I compare this game with the classical exploration  survival horror games mostly the Resident Evil and its ""VII"" first-person part. Honestly to say, Betrayer is several times way better than REVII. It perfectly nails all the ""parts"" inside the game. The fights and the stealth, all optional. It's your decision, how to engage the enemies. The exploration part ""is/was""(read about this below) perfect. The map size, they are not too huge to lost in them. Or too small to make the game feel linear, like in the REVII. The perfect size for exploring. Again, it's your decision to engage the heavily infested with enemies settlers post with the current weapons or to search for better weapons and money.  Perfect combination of art-game, survival horror classics and hardcore elements.BUT.... But there is one tiny unpleasant going to awful... problem. The last update: [1.9]. This update adds all of the objects and points of interest (a.k.a the quest places) on your game map. And I mean directly on your map... by default.... There are not hidden. There is no setting option to disable them. The only way to hide them, temporary, is from the game map itself. But they will be still there to tempt you and spoil your play. By this, the entire exploration part of this game goes to hell. Everything is based on exploration. And the non linear narrative of this game became broken. I don't know why the developers did this. Maybe they received too many complaints from ""gamers"" about ""difficulty exploration"". The game is now, just a stupid generic walking simulator for hypsters and other casuals with no knowledge about video games. No challenge at all. (Oh...Boy! The infestation of pseudo-gamers, who thinks that games are so fashionable these days and to be modern you must to play them. Will destroy this industry. Or at least its indie part.)I highly recommend this game. It was extremely good on the previous updates. But until the developers fix this ""map problem"", I recommend to not start playing it. This is a really awful game spoiler.			"

In fondo trovate la versione italiana della recensioneYou find yourself on a beach, surrounded by the remainings of what looks like to be your ship.At the horizon you can see some vessels ready to sail.No hints on who or what you are; no one points you in a particular direction; all you can do is to start walking along the road.Somebody left some messages on the way; text that warn you: ""This place is dangerous, keep going at your own risk"".Betrayed is an OpenWorld where you have no help of any sort, no tutorial.What to do and where to go is up to you to find.You will have to explore the world of the living and the world of the spirits to find clues and informations to help you rebuild the events.Visually the game is really engaging; this odd black and white graphics where only the colour red is shown create a really suggestive scenery; as suggestive are the sound effects.The fights are more or less hard, that's up to your skill as a gamer.I've to admit that missing a destination or any kind of hint on the long way bores me; a risk that you have to keep in mind is losing a good amount of time wandering around (and dying by the hand of the enemies) without having a clue on what to do.So if you don't like this kind of challenge it's not the game for you.All considered I recommend it (maybe at a low price, why not?) for his originality and uniqueness.***Siete su una spiagga, attorniati dai resti di quella che presumibilmente era la vostra nave.All'orizzonte si posso scorgere altri vascelli intenti a salpare.Nessuna indicazione di chi o cosa siete; nessuno che vi indirizzi verso un particolare luogo; tutto quello che vi rimane è cominciare a camminare, seguendo il sentiero.Qualcuno ha lasciato dei messaggi lungo la via; testi che vi mettono in guadia: ""Questo posto è pericoloso, continuate a vostro rischio e pericolo"".Betrayer è un gioco OpenWorld in cui non vi viene fornito nessun tipo di aiuto, nessun tutorial.Cosa fare e dove andare spetta a voi capirlo.Dovrete esplorare il mondo dei vivi e quello degli spiriti per trovare indizi e informazioni che vi aiutino a ricostruire gli avvenimenti.Visivamente è molto coinvolgente; questa grafica particolare in bianco e nero in cui spicca solo il colore rosso rende l'ambientazione suggestiva; altrettanto suggestivi sono gli effetti sonori.I combattimenti sono più o meno impegnativi (dipende dalla vostra abilità di giocatore).Devo ammettere però che il non avere una meta o un qualsivoglia suggerimento a lungo andare mi annoia; un rischio che dovete prendere in considerazione è quello di passare una buona quantità di tempo a vagare (e morire per mano dei nemici) senza avere la più pallida idea di cosa fare.Quindi se non amate questo genere di sfida forse non è il gioco adatto a voi.Tutto sommato lo consiglio (magari trovato a basso prezzo, perchè no?!) per la sua originalità e particolarità.

												Very cool game. Different than anything I've ever played before. It's basically a first-person exploration game with a bit of horror thrown in. You're shipwrecked on an island and have to explore to find clues as to why the island inhabitants disappeared. The game takes place in colonial times so you use bows, flintlocks, and matchlock weapons. Weapons have realistic, multistage reloading procedures that can be interuppted and then resumed from the last step completed.Headphones are an absolute must for this game. You find the various clues and treasure by pressing a button to ""listen"" which will provide directional ""humming"" sounds to lead you to it. There is a mechanic so that headphones aren't necessary in that a white box will appear on the left and right of your overhead compass that fade in and out to point you towards your objective. However, this takes a lot away from the atmosphere and spookiness of the game.Once in-game, there are to settings I strongly encourage you use. Firstly, turn up color satuartion to give color to the world. The black/white with red highlights scheme looks cool for a few minutes but the game ultimately looks much better in color. Besides, the ""otherworld"" is already in black/white. Secondly, check the box titled [Otherworld Gain]. I like the deep black of the default otherworld but it was just too difficult for me to navigate.			"

												9/10. Great Indie game. I started by playing in black and white, but after the second fort opted for colour, which was a good decision as the visuals in this game are stunning. Brilliant textures and lighting make this game very atmospheric. The lack of much sound in the game, means that what you do hear is important, and adds an original theme to the game. You can make this game as easy or as hard as you like, given the options to hide placements on the map, or add the ""death drop loot"" option. Some bits in the middle of the game are boring, but overall it is an interesting story, and the game as a whole is quite unlike most other games. The ending is strange and leaves you asking questions afterward. Possibly the best indie game I have played, big thumbs up, even if there are noticeablly boring bits.			"

												This is not your usual bad steam artsy ""experience"", this is a proper game with actual gameplay.If you like exploration games with an ambiguous narrative, jump right ahead. If you arm yourself with a good pair of headphones and turn off the lights, you will have an incredible, immersive experience.If you're still not sure if the game is for you or not; check out Sexbad's excellent review about it:

												A desperately artsy survival horror that ends up being neither survival nor horror, but rather a depressing graveyard of unrefined ideas. Around 90% of the time you'll spend slogging through the forest from one map marker to another fetching assorted junk to read some bland 17th century felony reports as a reward and then backtracking for more markers until the plot decides to just drop it at some point and roll out the credits. The other 10% is dedicated to awkwardly paced abrupt combat encounters, most of which are all about slowly kiting around in the open or side-stepping behind a tree and hoping for the best, while trying to use a severely limited assortment of unwieldy “realistic” killing tools against small groups and waves of repetitive enemies with Diabloesque AI, dodgy unpredictable hitboxes and rng-based deflections. There is a rather rudimentary stealth system to serve as an alternative, but in practice it is only applicable to make your gameplay time 3-4 times longer than it has to be, while in most really challenging encounters where a stealthy approach would be desirable the combat is script-forced on you anyway.Overall while being an obviously budget-crippled and mechanistic but passable and at some points rather enjoyable and suspenseful experience Betrayer is very hard to recommend gameplay-wise. Especially so since its plot is pretty hard to get invested in while both the protagonist and the Maiden in Red have all the personality of a windows system cursor and a 90’s chat bot.			"

												Great twist on a FPS. Unlike most derivative FPSs, the setting is not burst-fire-full-metal-jacket but rather a period where you'll be armed with bows, crossbows, powder pistols, and powder muskets. And they will take time to load, including pouring powder and ramrodding. Again unlike most FPSs, there's a story you engaged in; not just riding along a cut-scene-driven story, but one where you need to collect clues and things and fill in your knowledge of what's been going on in the various areas.The use of sound to help you locate PoI in the game is highly novel and clever, and the sounds are eerie & suitable for the setting. Pays to be listening carefully as you explore. Surround sound headphones were highly valuable. There are visual indicators to augment the sound if you need a little assist. The gameplay & environmental sounds are excellent as well.For collectors, there lots of stuff to find--much of it quite helpful, especially if you're not the greatest twitch player--and it will pay to revisit old areas of the map.The length is appropriate, but do note that you're looking at perhaps 12-18 hours; I'm not OCD on the achievements, but I sneak around somewhat (not to assassinate, just not to get injured in battles) so I took 17 hours. This length is very suitable for the investigations and degree of variety in the game.There is just one save, which you can trigger yourself or let the game auto-save at key times and on a schedule. Normally I hate the single-save option, especially in games with ~RPG/story choices; I feel I get less value with no insta-replayability (no, I never want to slog through a game in order to make a different choice 11 hours in). However, in Betrayer it works out just fine and I didn't get that annoyed great-this-checkpoint-again feeling at any time.All-in-all a quality game that was quite a bit of fun, had a unique settings, had novel use of sound elements, was interesting to complete, was suitably challenging, was engaging, and which didn't overstay its welcome. Refreshing change from the big console-catering publishers! "

												Slowly you`re sneaking through grass. You´re enemy is near and shows you his back. You can see the conquistador armour gleaming in the sun and covered by the wind you`re only 2 steps away, but then you hear a loud grunt and fastly you recognize you miss another conquistador. Using your crossbow you hope you will get the one in front before they attack as two. You get the one, but it takes time to reload the crossbow. Too much time, the other conquistador reach you, after getting hit, the crossbow is ready again, you fire, you hit, he goes down.  Eased you look up, while the wind surrounds you. The Year is 1604 . Welcome to Betrayer.You were send to the new world to found out what happened to a british Colony. Early you  will be attacked.  Attacked by Conquistadors, who seem to be obsessed. Soon you recognize thatthe Spanish were not the only Danger in this Region. Finding the Fort of the Colony empty without any soul, except 2 Ash Corpses you have to ask yourself one Question: What happened to the Colonists?Betrayer is a very interesting First Person Shooter Game. Your Weapons are Bows, Pistols, musketry and knives. No Rocket Launcher, no BFG, no Lasersword and no Kitty Bombs. This game got a special Graphicstyle that creats a unique atmosphere. And i mean in a haunting way. Do you remember a walk in a forrest? Remember the the Birds Singing, the Sun between the trees, the wind playing with leafs. How they rustle? Yes? Congratulations, now you are in BETRAYER. I think my Forrest Walks will never be the same. *sigh*Also you are able to play this game in Black/White Style, which is special, or in colours.Anyway, on your search for the Colonists you have to fight. You can do it the direct way ""HEY GUYS I`M HEEEEEERE!"" or the Snake way. Sneaking. So if you`re sneaking you can do it with the help of the wind. No joke! This is a special point of this game. The wind covers your steps and the enemy can`t hear you coming, if you come from behind, hey who would sneak in front, eh? No, you don`t have Jedi Power forget it. This is 1604, not ""far far away in a distant galaxy"". Well you can decide on your own, how you survive and believe me ... the Conquistadors are not the badest Guys in this game.Sure, there is very much to read, the Story of the colonists are written words, not moviepictures, but if you ever read an exciting book, you will know what i mean. So, follow the hints on a map, solve the mysterys and stay alive in a unique looking game. Always have your weapons loaded. It can take too much time to load if you are attacked. And don`t forget your real life. Take a walk in the forrest. Listen to the Birds and the rustling leafs in the sunlight. Enjoy.			"

												It's not a horrible game, but ultimately it's just boring and frustrating, so I can't recommend it.I've had my eye on the game for some time, as it has a very interesting look and a unique setting.  I wasn't willing to risk much money on it, though, since it didn't look like there was much to the gameplay.  I'm glad I waited until I could pick it up cheap from Indiegala.  The graphics and overall feel of the game are certainly good, but playing the game itself just isn't very fun.  In fact, for an FPS, it's one of the more boring games I've played in a while.  You're given very little instruction or direction, just that you're supposed to ""do"" stuff and ""find"" stuff that's scattered around the map in an effort to ""solve"" investigations.  I don't really know what the point was to collecting this stuff and solving these investigations, as everything seemed pretty random and didn't do much to advance a plot, at least as far as I could tell.  Mostly what I ended up doing was wandering around aimlessly, looking for something with a bit of color or following audio clues until I stumbled across something to interact with, at which point I would press F to collect or read something.  Occasionally there would be some enemies to fight, and those encounters ranged from either being easy one-shot kills, to practically impossible battles with sizable groups that come from all directions.  Mostly there was just a lot of walking around, though, wondering if the game was actually going to go anywhere.  It's not that I mind this kind of gameplay - I spent dozens of hours wandering around the wastelands of Fallout 3, for example.  But in games like Fallout, there's a sense of accomplishment and progress when you discover things that I simply never felt with Betrayer, making everything seem more a chore than an adventure.There was a kind of stealth system, but it was pretty laughable.  Bascially you could either crouch, which rendered you practically invisible but meant it took an excruciatingly long time to get anywhere, or you could walk, which gave the enemies supernatural awareness of you at all times, or you could stand around until the wind kicked up, then use the noise to scurry forward for a couple seconds until the wind died down again.  Maybe it sounded good in theory, but it was pretty pointless in practice.It's not nearly the worst game I've ever played, I can't even say it's particularly bad, but overall the game was just too boring to put up with the frustrations, the ambiguities, and seeming lack of any progression.  I have plenty of other games in my library that are just more deserving of my time.			"

												I enjoyed this game more than I expected I would.Story is decent. I liked the different kind of art style and color scheme. Ultimately this game is a survival fps, with some stealth if wanted. I enjoyed the combat, and the types of weapons; and the gameplay having to manage ammo, sometimes having to swap weapons mid combat due to reload times.At first it might be a bit slow paced, even frustrating since you can die easily, but once you progress just a bit past the beginning it gets more manageable. (You can still die easily.) I liked the constant tension.Sometimes I would find myself playing very stealthily, and/or attacking from far range, sometimes even kiting. Any of that may not have been necessary, but was fun to me. I don't know though, a couple times at enemy camps or strongholds it may have been necessary.It's worth the $5 price tag, even more on sale.			"

												Betrayer is a wonderful game to pick up if you're interested in adventure/horror games with a fair amount of collectibles and a dash of mystery. It doesn't take too long to beat the story, but the low price reflects back on that-- it takes about 6 hours to go through (if you're not speedrunning), so $5 seems pretty generous to me.Pros:- Unique story- Horror elements are more atmospheric rather than petty jumpscares- Gorgeous graphics- Cheap for about a minimum of 6 hours of gameplay- Achievement integration so you have more objectives to accomplish after beating the story and obtaining all collectiblesCons:- Can get repetitive at times- Stealth gameplay sometimes acts wonky- Combat can seem like a chore after a couple of hoursOverall: 8/10, definitely recommended whether you get it full price or on sale.

												'Not the stealth game you deserved, but the one you needed'There is a lot to say about Betrayer. I will be extremely brief and say it's one of the more memorable game experiences I've had, and even playing during daytime, knowing exactly what to expect, this game literally sent chills up my spine and had me in goosebumps during the dark scenes. And in the day part of the game, it turned out to be one of the simplest and most true to life stealth experiences ever. I recommend playing with no compass, and using the tiny dot crosshair (it's pretty hard to aim without one). I also preferred turning off the ammo / hp hud most of the time and just went to the menu when I needed it. I wish there was a hotkey to toggle it. Highly recommend you play for a while with the default black/white color until you absorb the feel of the game, then go to color and see how beautifully the world has been rendered. I haven't played all the latest stuff, bu thtis is probably the best looking natural environment I've seen in a game to date. Highly recommended.			"

												Am I the only one who gets chills or goosebumps with the sound effects in this game?To anyone wondering if you can change the contrast of color in the game to make it colorful : YES : you can change it in the settings you don't have to play it in black and white.Betrayer is a very unique indie game.  It's fps in a sense where you have a  variety of weapons in your arsenal including bows, short bows, muskets, pistols, grenades, and even a tomahawk slashy thing. It has several large maps filled with clues, secrets, enemies, and weapons. My favorite weapon in this game are definitely the bows because it's so fun to use.It's not really a scary game I think it's just the sound effects that give me goosebumps when wearing headphones.Overall it's a great indie game.

												Betrayer is a visually brilliant game that creates an atmosphere from the start. The developers show real promise, but don't expect this to be an A title game with the kind of production you may be used to. Betrayer is a success story of the early access program and although is now out of early access, it still feels like an early access game in many senses. I hope to see the game get some updates and a UI face lift - It doesn't hinder the gameplay, the story or the experience but I feel it need polishing in places. It can be overly difficult at times, even once you have acquired some of the better weapons. Still, there is an option to turn down enemy damage as you pretty much die 2 hits and if you’re not constantly creeping around it’s hard to stay alive. I whole fully recommend this title and look forward to seeing what the devs do with the game here after. "

												Betrayer is a unique FPS game that focuses on mystery and intrigue.The review will be represented with a simplistic ""Pros/Cons/Neutral"" format.Pros:* Beautiful visuals. (Monochrome can be turned off and fiddled around with)* Sound design is just magnificent. The immersion that it introduces is astounding.* Great mysteries.* The spiritrealm type of thing is a breath of fresh air. * Collecting the collectibles help you do mysteries and collecting stuff can be therapeutic thanks to the scenery and the simplicity.* Extremely low price, seeing as it's even been on the Groupees 50 cent bundle. Very easy to trade for as well.* Very good controls.Neutral:* Your hand will not be held. (Take it how you will)* Combat is fairly simplistic.* The stealth system is very easy once you get used to it.Cons:* Difficult to see whether you've been detected by the enemies, only a sound queue to notify you.* Enemies don't respawn after clearing a cluster, meaning you have to play the game again at least once to get all of the achievements.Overall:7.5/10			"

												Betrayer starts off as an atmospheric, pseudo-horror game where you're navigating through colonial America fighting ghosts and collecting clues. Sounds great, right? Well it isn't because it grows boring very quickly.You fight the same enemies over and over. Your arsenal is limited to a bow, a crossbow, a pistol, a musket, a throwing hatchet, some bombs, and your melee knife. They are period-appropriate weapons, true, but there's just not a lot of variety and the hatchet and bombs are hard to use properly. I played using the bow almost exclusively, because it felt like the other weapons were just slight variations on range, fire rate, and reload speed. You can apparently try to sneak up on enemies from behind, but let me tell you: This is NOT a stealth game. It's all outdoors. You're out in the open. The only reason to bother with stealth here is if you want the game to last four times as long (aka, 300% more time spent doing nothing).You encounter a woman in red, who has forgotten her name. For some reason, you can give the woman trinkets that you find. She immediately questions your motives for giving her a gift. She will then either begrudgingly accept the gift or refuse it and send a passive-aggressive insult at you. Look, I don't know why I'm giving you anything! It was a dialogue option that the game presented! Maybe if you had a personality, I would know what you like!You're supposed to be collecting clues in order to learn the identity of lost spirits or something. Seems like everyone here has amnesia. This game has a light world / dark world thing going (Hey that's never been done before!) except in this game the only difference between them is that in the light world you fight the revenants of dead soldiers and in the dark world you fight spooky, scary skeletons. So you collect these clues by looking at your map and going to each of the pointers. You then talk to the lost spirits and select each of the dialogue options that is presented to you. Mystery solved! I'm Sherlock-effing-Holmes!I did not actually finish Betrayer as of writing this review. I did the same boring stuff through four or five areas and decided that even if it did a complete 180 and turned into a competent game at the end, it was too little too late. Don't buy this game.

												A friend gifted me this game. What looked to me like yet another pretentious indie game turned out to be an enchanting, eerily captivating experience. For anyone scared of the monochrome look, there's a slider and you can play in color right off the bat.Combat is a little clunky but manages to still feel intense. The environments, enemies and sound effects make for a blend that is as captivating as it is creepy, even if it's all a little underproduced. The 'listen' mechanic which guides you to the nearest important location in the game will probably give me nightmares for the next month but I think it was worth it.			"

												Mediocre FPS, bad easily fooled AI, slooow moving arrows.Setting is great, would have been nice with voiced narration and NPC but this works well enough. “Detective” part of the game is…….run from one place to another. But the stories out there is as dark as promised. Have not finished the game when I am writing this but the main storyline have so far eluded me as I enter the third area. Would be nice with a skill tree as you solve mysteries everything for character progression is linked through gear.As long as you are NOT searching for a BOOM headshot game but for something different out there i would recommend this.

												This new studio, Blackpowder games, who in which there are ancient members of the F.E.A.R team from Monolith, releases their first game. I bought it on early access in the beginning, and didn't play it since, but im now in the full version and i got to say i'm really impressed, the level of polish is incredible. This game is really unique too, the atmosphere is one of a kind, plus the graphics are outstanding, the textures and when that wind starts blowing on the green stuff (trees, grass, bushes) i get shivers. Audio is very silent and atmospheric too, you hear the wind, the grass, animals, birds, the water. And for sure coming from the team is a very cool dark atmosphere in the ""other world"", which i would call it, where you find tons of cool creatures. Story is very mysterious too, and interesting. There is also kind of a rpg feel to the game, when you search in chests and exploded boxes of wood with your knife to find loot. Weapons are very nice too, with my special favorite being the bow.Overall very happy with this purchase and recommend to everyone who likes original fps's with a spooky kind of atmosphere.			"

The map marks disappear after your first visit and it's easy to lose track of places you need to come back to.			"

												The good:- Nice atmosphere- Nice graphics (sometimes with some frame drops, even with a GTX 980. It uses Unreal Engine and runs on DX9. Doom (as example) runs more smoothy with all Maximum, 1080p and DX11 getting constant 60 fps). Lack of optmimitzation I would say. But nice visuals afterall.- Search for ammo (destroying boxes or killing enemies), gold, treasures etc- Use the shoop for upgrade your gear or for buy new weapons / ammo / items- Stealth is a good choice. I really like more to kill (he he he) but in this game the enemies makes a lot of damage even on normal. 3 touches and you are dead.- Aiming is excelent (with mouse and keyboard)- Challenging- Good AI- Good dialogs- Good story (ok, the ending is a little meh)The bad:- Can be repetitive (search here and there and only running with your feets)Would be a good idea (in the future patches) to put a horse or something7/10			"

												I had my eyes on this game since its very release, back in March. Watching its updates, reading further reviews about its content and gameplay, I saw quite a fair amount of both appraisals and negative criticism. I was sceptical for a while, but the months reinvigorated my interest as I witnessed some clever updates addressing a few issues that were hindering its potential. Then I recently bought it and, about only one week and a half afterwards, I've finished it.Betrayer is a fantastic indie enterprise, like few I've seen. It combines visual astonishment (directly affecting the atmosphere of ethereal mysteries) with no-nonsense combat, enhanced by the evolution of enemy hordes and also of the player's arsenal and fighting techniques. Running about with musket and bow has never been so much about timing each one's shot and adapting them for the precise circumstances. Missing *your* shot might very easily mean taking the enemy's back at you, since their aiming is relentless, and your health bar, friable.The theme is reasonably innovative, and the game's approach is downright unique. The year is 1606, and you land on Virginian soil, only to find a very primitive colonial process that has crumbled under inner conflicts and treason. On the other side, Native Americans are hunted, violated and burnt, as the names of their ancestors slowly fade away throughout the narrative process. The several notes found in the game tell (in fairly neat writing) of leaders from both sides being conspired against, sons and daughters being slain or assimilated. The player is then left with a visual that matches the storyline: ghosts float about the dense woods without remembrance of their actual lives, and beg for closure for their sins and/or misfortunes. The player may or may not remind them of who they were and what they did, bringing them either peace or torment. Amidst all this otherworldly saga, the true game's nemeses are embodied by steel-armoured bears (the colonisers) or burnt owls (the natives), which can be interpreted by their roaring or hooting beyond their human silhouettes.Play this game bearing in mind that it is a heavy experience. Being able to adjust colour saturation and contrast is also a nice feature for atmosphere adaption. If I were to point out a mistake, it may have been the walking and searching necessary to locate clues, letters, chests, and weapons. These are vast forested lands that are excellent for territorial combat, but a bit tedious for repetitive treasure hunt. Apart from that issue, a game that is well worth the cash and is beautiful to explore.			"

												6.5/10Overview: FPS Action/AdventureThe Good:+Artistically and technically the game looks very good. The game also gives you the option of adjusting dark/light/color saturation levels to find the desired graphical effect to your liking. +Interesting setting taking place mid century. The entire game takes place mainly in forested areas +Interesting story that slowly unravels as you progress +Easy achievementsThe Average:The combat leaves a lot to be desired. You have a handful of weapons: bows, crossbows, pistols and none of them felt truly satisfying to use.The game doesn't do much in terms of changing up the gameplay or scenery. The game is split between a number of areas and all of them look, feel and play the same. Enter an area collect all treasures, clues, clear corruption, rinse and repeat. A lack of enemy varietyThe Bad:-The game gives you the option of using stealth rather than charging head first into battle. The problem however is that stealth is awful. Sometimes enemies will spot you a mile away and other times they won't. It lacks consistency, although there are items that make stealth slightly easier however most of these items are obtained late in the game.  This doesn't really matter though because most of the time enemies will just surprise attack you  as you make your way through the forest. -The only AI the enemies have is to charge you. Thus, combat revolves around enemies spotting you and then charging you relentlessly.    ConclusionDespite the low score I do feel there is enough in this game to justify a purchase, albeit at a low price. The developers seem to truly care about the game providing constant updates and responding regularly on the forums. You are playing this game more for the setting and story and less for the gameplay.			"

												A visually stunning, original indie game with great flaws. As it is really, really cheap I recommend it though.The graphics are really nice. You walk through beautiful countryside - especially forests - in a scenario almost never used in games, so this is a plus.However the game doesn't decide what it wants to be. It is a surprising mixture of elements that don't fit.An open-world ghost story FPS with chests to loot, with few different types of weapons of which you find all the time versions to deal more damage, at least when you find a shovel to dig them up? And why are there so many chests to open? Should this be spooky, or a kind of Borderlands for the poor? It is not spooky enough to be a horror game, it fails in presenting its story better, and the looting and lack of NPC activity (the only people moving are you and the evil guys, the rest is stationary) ruin its atmosphere. Also the many fights against ghost-like enemies are only interesting as long as you stay in the ""normal"" world. Otherwise you fight skeletons and ghosts with really boring design and with an IQ worse than the enemies in Serious Sam. Also, the weapons are not well-balanced and although the old guns are fun, you find yourself in the end shooting everything with a bow because it just shoots faster - and that's what you need when the enemies are just rushing towards you without any brains.If this was an expensive game I'd give it a negative rating because although it has some very, very positive aspects (graphics, game world, unique scenario, nice old weapons, NPC stories, bug-free, good performance), the negative aspects are huge. The game is not consistent at all and fails to tell its story at least a little dynamically, and while making you walk around like in a walking simulator and you might enjoy the visuals and countryside in theory, most combat is annoying. Replay value is zero, too. This game could have been far, far better with some more NPC movement and more focus on story presentation. Instead after a while I felt like the devs had put a lot of passion into the maps but ran out of ideas when they needed to fill them with content. It also annoyed me that I had to dig up stuff all the time, but didn't have a shovel from the beginning, so I needed to backtrack all maps again. Well this way the game of course takes a little more time, but still it is not satisfying at all. A little more linear gameplay would have been better.For this cheap price however you should give it a try, the scenario and the graphics are definitely worth the few bucks. Regarding the fact that this game was made by a very small team it is impressive in its positive aspects and I will stay tuned for their next games, which will be hopefully more consistent.			"

												After the first 20 minutes of running around you've pretty much seen all betrayer has to offer. As beautiful as betrayer is. Every map area is identical to the last, and the few enemy types quickly become EXTREMELY repetitive.Instead of just an empty forest every map. Where are the large spooky abandoned houses or mansions? Where are the rivers? Where are the lighthouses? Where are the rope-bridges, where the large quarries?And for the enemies they could have added so much more, like wolves, bear, possesed birds, witches.Every map is the same as the last, enter, find four ""Corrupted"" totem poles, kill the 3-4 enemies next to them. And that unlocks the next area which you just start the process over again.The story/objectives with helping the ghost people is insultingly repetitive. It seems like they tacked on the objectives just for the sake of giving you something to do. And the occasional ""The thief has escaped"" minigame is a pathetic last ditch effort to throw something else in. You have to find a ghost person, ask them what they need. Find them a certain item in the dirt, and repeat a hundred times. I have never seen a more borring/shallow objective setup in my life. I have seen MMORPG quests more immersive than betrayers quests.During alpha the game was headed in the right direction. The bows had arrow drop, and you really had to lead your targets to hit them like a real bow. If you died you had ONE chance to reclaim your dropped loot before it was lost forever. That gave the game a real sense of fear and adrenale.Now you1. No longer need to account for arrow drop with your bow (the arrow lands wherever the crosshair is placed)2. You respawn and don't need a single penny or any items3. You get healthpacks that you can use whenever your hp is low4. The enemies just run straight at you like brainless idiots.Betrayer could have been so much more. If you get this game on sale for like 1-3 dollars and just want to have it as a relaxing immersion experience. Than go for it. But if you are looking for a playable video game. Get as far away from this game as possible.			"

												Betrayed is an intriguing title that is not without some flaws.On the face of it,  it's a game of ""crouch, sneak, kill.."" Rinse and repeat. It is beset with the frustration of Demon Souls without the rewarding learning curve. Death means a loss of loot and a respawning of enemy you have painstakingly cleared; also, at the time of this review the game also tends to crash now and then when toggling inventory menu which again means  restarting the long chore of clearing respawned enemy,( although I understand the Devs have this issue tagged for a fix )So that all said, what is it that keeps me coming back again and again for more? Is it the superb graphics and artwork? Is it the setting of a Shipwreck survivor in the 17th Century, or is it the intriguing and mysterious  sub plots clues and locations that build towards a larger picture of Supernatural proportions? It is all this that creates a sense of playing within a Ben Wheatley cult British film.So flawed and frustrating, yes, but this is far outweighed by its moody and enigmatic magnificence.Now I need to take my leave, for I must return to the trees and rocks and that damned wind. Who knows what may befall me around the next bend, or what grissly secrets I may uncover. Whateveter it is won't be nice, but I am compelled to go...			"

It plays like a spooky mystery game/fps.Pros spoopy nightmares interesting mysteries fun hunting enemies fun playing detectivecombat is pretty funCons repetative AF, there are some minor story parts that serve no purpose Wannabe RPG elements that are totally unnessaryThe game forces you to upgrade weapons and buy♥♥♥♥♥♥from a merchant but it just interupts the gameplay and ruins immersion could have been spookierThey set up this really quite unsettling creepy atmosphere then didn't really capitalize on it, I kept wating for something to make me♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants but I never did :(  minor plot holes and lack of explanation for certain enemies or why they exist AI is really dumb, so to make it interesting you gotta fight them like you are Mel Gibson in the Patroit or its not a challenge.

												I hadn't felt such oppresive atmosphere since STALKER series. You feel completely lost with little help and nearly everything out to kill you. There isn't a moment that you're not thinking ""Should I go back?"" when you're low on ammo and health. But the persepective of some new treasure is just too much for you, now is it? You don't like the quiet serne 17th century American East Coast? Ring the bell and get transported into a nightmarish world.The ex-Monolith Devs knew they were doing there. The game has been polished greatly ever since early access and most of the bugs have been fixed and a lot of shortcomings have been padded out. It's a great game and I fully recommend playing it if you love survival horror.			"

												Betrayer is a curious game. It's a horror game, with a semi-open world to explore. It's a shooter, but it encourages stealth. It even shuffles some RPG elements in there for good measure. The end result is an experience that's quite unlike anything I've ever played. The game starts off with you washing up on a beach in 16th-century Virginia. As you make your way inland, you discover the nearest colony has been overtaken by a mysterious force: one that turned the local populace into ashes and changed a Spanish invasion force into feral beasts. You meet the enigmatic Maiden in Red, whose past is tied to this place in ways she cannot yet remember. As you venture through the forests you uncover more abandoned settlements, each with their own history and ghosts left behind to tell it. You'll face a multitude of strange creatures, brought forth by the plague ravishing the Frontier. The combat can get a bit clunky, but the novelty of shooting monsters with muskets and crossbows makes up for that. Exploration can get a bit dull, since the world mostly looks the same. I had to resort to using an online map for each of the game's segments in order to get the full experience.Each map of the game world is strewn with collectables. These range from journal pages left by the people to graves and clues you find in the wilderness. Speaking with wraiths can give you valuable insight into the tragedies that occured here, even before the world went to hell. There's some interesting stories to be found, and they all receive a form of closure. The way you handle them can also have an impact on the ending of the game, but don't expect the effect to be too great. The ending itself is also strange, and leaves a lot open to interpretation (and the inevitable sequel), but the game's climax is satisfying enough to overlook that.Betrayer is definitely not easy. The enemies pack quite a punch, even on the lowest difficulty setting. There's not a lot of guides on there online, either, so you'll have to find your own way through the intricate maze of Colonial history the developers have crafted. Figuring it out is immensely satisfying, though, and I'd definitely recommend everyone to play this game.			"

												The unsettling feel and look of the world, alongside some of the most terrifying sound effects, develop an alarmingly grim world full of mystery and brutality. The action takes place during American Colonialism with a great deal of gothic aspects thrown into the world, which makes the experience that much scarier. Overall, the open-world gameplay with its mysteries and hidden secrets was incredibly immersive, due to its challenging nature and horrid details.			"

												I purchased this game during Early Access and really enjoyed it at the time. Soo much has been added to the game I won't list it all here. Betrayer is made by some of the original F.E.A.R. devs and that alone got my attention. It has a moody atmosphere, spooky enemies, classic weaponry, color pallette/contrast sliders and a low amount of handholding.I reccomend playing in the black and white but it looks like the color options have gotten some adjustments, making them better as well. The dev's have made a lot of adjustments from the feedback they were given in Early Access, while remaining true to the vision they had for Betrayer. The way the trees and grass sway with the gusts of wind add a nice touch to the eerieness of the game, though you can use wind that to sneak up to enemies undetected. Also there is a listen ability that you can set to have a visual que, it will help you find the right direction. So far this is an awesome fps to have in the collection. Betrayer is not a cutscene/QTE game, story is given to you as you talk and find clues around the locations.I wish there were more music but that is personal preference and it would probably take away from the experience/atmosphere the developer was aiming for.

												I would recommend you not to read too much about the game. Play the demo first, it's a good representation. If that doesn't give you a thrill and a chill down your spine, then you'll miss half the game, because it's really quite a thriller. The Betrayer name and Adventure genre caught my eye and a had quick glance at a short description and without further ado I was plunged into the game. All I really needed to know to play the game was the mention of the Unreal engine and a quick peek at the controls ASWD and the rest was quite intuitive. The game is quite a mystery too and there were times when I wished I had a better idea about my role in the game, but it was somehow like playing Zork Nemesis or Myst with Guns. Sometimes there were dialogue options that left me wondering if it's also a role-playing game and with a bit of romance, but.. It didn't quite play out the way I thought. There were a few times that I was getting a bit angry with the game, because of controls and a bit of clunkiness in design, like if you got your finger on fast-forward and open the map window for a quick peek and exit you stop moving even though you still got your finger on fast forward. There are lots of keys for different windows and there were times when I had too much adrenaline going that the keys felt a bit too crowded and since each of them would cancel movement, things were getting a bit to hectic at times. There is a tremendous amount of moving around in the game and even though there are some nice fast-travel options there is still a bit too much walking, but there are also some really cool, chilly and atmospheric hair-raising sound effects and a lot of sudden encounters. It would have been nice to have an Always Sprint option. The game use some really old guns, muskets, flintlock pistols, bows and crossbows all with pretty slow loading. Unfortunately you can't dodge bullets or arrows by quick-stepping or jumping, but you can sprint and take cover and it works quite well. Even though there is a lot of sound, there is no voice acting in the game and I didn't really miss it either. The writing is pretty decent. I only had to look online for a solution once, because there was a bell I couldn't find in the Deep Woods. You can play the game in black and white (and red) or increase the Colour saturation from pale to full. I did a bit of both. It took me 15 hours to finish the game and I was sprinting a lot, but I was also really exploring a lot. I had a good time.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a First person Simulation horror game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere is a difficulty settings available.The font text is pretty small at the options menu.There is a color slidebar available. You can either play in colors or in white/black.There is a mouse sensitivity slidebar available.You are able to change the controls on the keyboard.You are able to play with your controller.The game has alot of resolution sizes available.You can play in fullscreen or windowed mode.There is a global/master volume slidebar available.There is a sound volume slidebar available.There is a music volume slidebar available. Even playing on the highest graphical settings. It still doesn't look sharp.About the game.You are stranded on an unknown island and you no clue what to expect. The era is in the medieval timeline. You will find some chests which you could loot to get some money. A stranger will shoot an arrow with a message into a tiki totem and tells you to escape before it is too late. Obviously you won't do this and keep exploring around. Objects or other interactings will give a nice indicator or a sign that you can do actions with them. Like a piece of paper has an obvious different color and is shining from a distance. When getting chased by an enemy or an enemy has spotted you, A heart beat sound will keep ticking and it will stop whenever you ""safe"".There are auto-saves available.There is a shop stall to buy new things.You are able to change the color settings at all times.You are able to change the difficulty settings in-game.Health/ammo indicator font is pretty small.Graphics are okay.Scenery is okay but could be bland/stale at times.Terrain effect is nicely done.Game feels short and it has a story.Doesn't have alot of enemies.Collectables/Interactings have a good visible indicator. They also make a sound when you are close to them.There is a map available and you can fast travel to some locations after you have discovered them.The map is also showing all locations of each collectable and which kind of collectable.Other things.The game is nice, but on the same time The game feels boring as well. There are not alot of enemies around the world and i have the feeling this game is more story/explore based than fighting. There is also a stealth thing which will give you more damage on the firt shot but i think this is totally underused/unnecessary.-------------------I Give this game a 6/10			"

												For whom the bell tollsBlackpowder Games deserve praise for attempting something a little different with BETRAYER, and although it remains, at heart, an action RPG, they have succeeded in taking the genre in an unusual and interesting direction. This is a game that’s big on atmosphere, even if it is a tad light on content. Visually the game is quite unique, and the small indie studio have managed to create a world that’s far more eery and mysterious than can be found in most AAA horror titles. And this creepy atmosphere is further enhanced by excellent audio design. The combat is fun and reasonably challenging, and it does stealth pretty well too. It would, perhaps, gain something from a wider variety of environments and maybe from some voice acting, but on the whole this is an excellent little game. And it’s also great value for money. Some have criticised BETRAYER for being repetitive but personally I found my 26 hours within the game thoroughly enjoyable, and it never felt like a grind. And I managed to get all the achievements – huzzah! Sequel please.4/5			"

												PROS:Very eerie atmosphere.Areas are completely open.Interesting mystery to solve.Scary twist.Weapon variety and mechanics are good.Alternate equipment options are very well thought out, useful and add to the game play.You can rambo, steath it, mix it up. Anything goes and encounters are exciting and fun! Price is so low for what you get.CONS:Enemy variety could be better.Nothing is voice acted, allot of reading.Replay value is limited.BOTTOM LINE: Totally recommend. Would love to see what the devs would do with a big budget. This is a great game from start to finish. It sucks you in at the very beginning and doesn't let go. I would have payed more then $5 for this game after having played it.SIDE NOTE:I long-bowed with 2x pistols, first play though very fun!			"

												Picked it up in a sale a while back and just recently discovered this gem in my library.I like the art style and how the game slowly introduces its mechanics. It's not voiced over, but that's quite okay. Combat it also quite nice.What I didn't like too much was the repetitive tasking towards the end, and the need to revisit locations. The pacing also didn't work too well for me. At a certain point, I found an item that allowed me to very quickly gather other valuable items, which I could have used earlier in the game. Plus, more repetition for those who, like me, like to collect all stuff once it's accessible.Anyway, all in all it's a great game, I enjoyed playing it very much!			"

												Interesting concept!Sin City-esque visual style combined with a horror-mystery theme, You got yourself a great game on the paper.The reality, however, is quite different.Once you get past the novelty of it, this game doesn't really have much to offer.The first time you ring the bell, it's scary as hell, but if you're used to jumpscares or more complete horror games, you will be sorely disappointed. I'm a ♥♥♥♥♥, so I thought this game was scary af the whole play-through, but my opinion on that matter means little.A compelling story could have made up for it, but despite its moments, the main story is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Especially the endingBut the stories of all the ""shades"" you encounter are, however, quite well done.

												Like so many people, I wish Steam offered a ""neutral"" button for this game as I'm sort of 50/50 with it thus far.   As so many other people have already mentioned, base gameplay is roaming around trying to find clues and/or pick things up.  That's fine, not like other games require any less of its players.  My cons:I guess my biggest gripe with the game (and bear in mind my play time - maybe this gets better) is that I found the combat difficult (I may be in the minority there).  While some enemies can be done in with a single shot to the head, I found this to not really be an easy thing to do.  Where I am having serious  problems is in the ""void/dark wold"" (or whatever it's called) where the skeletons are roaming around.  You are using period appropriate weapons, so your guns require a significant reload time between shots (since you are using black powder weapons).  Even if I sprinted, I could not outrun the skeletons and the melee attack was near worthless since once they get that close to you, you're more or less dead.  This leads to my next gripe - you die way too easily in my opinion.  Where there is one skeleon, there are usually three or four and they swarm you.  Since you can't outrun them (unless I'm doing something wrong), I can't get away and keep getting killed.  You can go back to your last spot to recover any lost gear, but the game regenerates any baddies you killed before and places them in different parts of the map.  Usually I would be fine with something like that, but it just makes this difficult. When you are killed, you respawn back at the fort (at least at the part I am currently at which is pretty much the beginning) meaning you have to back track to wherever you were last.  The areas aren't that big, but since the bad guys are also respawned and placed in different locations after you die, it means you are stuck having to deal with the same bad guys over again.  Only this time you don't have the benefit of any ammunition or other items you may have had prior to your death (including money).  So even though you can buy weapons and supplies at the fort, you aren't going to have any money after respawning to actually buy anything with.  If you are out of ammo, you're kind of hosed since all you will have is your melee knife which is useless in my opinion.    With regards to weapons - you can purchase upgraded weapons, but they seem to be priced way too high in my opinion.  As much loot as I've picked up, I still don't have enough money to buy upgraded weapons and from what I've read on other reviews, they probably aren't much of a benefit anyway.  There is supposedly a stealth aspect to this game, but I have yet to be able to sneak up on anyone with success (even when the wind is blowing).  You're better off trying to take enemies out from a distance if you can.Pros:Game runs smooth and I think it does offer a bit of a different premise when compared to the average FPS game. I'm usually a fan of this type of game in that it does blend some horror and investigation type elements into the game.  They are limited, but at least they are there.  I got it on sale for a few bucks and that would be my suggestion to everyone else - get it while it's on sale and that should help offset the negatives.  I did not (and will not) get a refund on the game and I'll still keep tinkering with it, but nothing in the game really screams at me to come back and play it like others that I've played.			"

												When you first enter Betrayer, you're struck by the awesome monochromatic art design, the atmosphere of foreboding, and  you get filled with a great sense of adventure. It doesn't last long however, each area being much the same as the last, with the same enemies, same mechanics, same scenery. Things that were once fun to run around and collect become a chore. Enemy types are very few, and do not scale well with the ever-increasing power of your arsenal. Monsters that were scary once soon become little more than roadbumps (unless playing on the highest difficulty). There is some decent flavor text scattered about in the side-quests, except the final story quest requires you to backtrack over every single area and solve every single mystery before you can beat the game, which once again turns something that could have been an interesting side-quest into a tedious chore.I recommend only buying on a steep sale, or not at all.

												Beautiful. that's my description of this game in one word, allow me to explain why i think so:this game is an atmospheric horror stealth detective game, it is very rich in it's story, and is using very simplistic graphic options in order to set you 'in the mood' to be frightenned by a mere bush or shadow, it uses the black and white feature perfectly. altogether it is not a very difficult game for people who are skilled at stealth games, and yet it still manages to challege even skilled players (my personal oppinion).a complete playthrough can be achieved withing 8 hours with most the steam achievements apart from the ""Antagonist"" which will take some more grindding, but yet again, the game is fair to the player and is capable of building up pressure and interest as you wonder deeper into the dark forsaken woods.

												For me, this is a difficult game to rate as it is a combination of genres the main being  adventure horror and FPS unfortunately, as another person stated in a previous review I found it almost impossible to relate to the characters in the adventure element of the story but, really enjoyed the FPS part.Perhaps that was the problem, the FPS element was, for me, more fun than the adventure and therefore I didn't really play it or want to play it like an adventure, I usually enjoy adventures but, found that here I was only playing the adventure out of necessity to progress the FPS.IMHO the story was complex to the point where I felt the it was holding me back from progressing and became just incidental rather than in integral part of the game.The cross referencing between people places clues and events involves flipping between menus to understand the multiple links which to me seemed to impede the progress of the game. Whilst the story behind the events was actually quite interesting and complex it quickly became a chore that got in the way of killing enemies, finding clues and treasure, upgrading weapons and removing the evil on each map. There is not a lot of reading involved but, it does frustratingly slow down the game if you are playing it as an FPS.To get the full benefit from the game it needs to be played first and foremost as an adventure and not an FPS.  The graphics are good, if your eyes are comfortable with the black and white default it heightens the atmosphere also, the night brought on by ringing the bells is particularly atmospheric, I preferred 50% colour during the day which for me, made the day night transition more dramatic.Sound also plays an important part in the game as locating an item, enemy or event can be done just by following a sound to its source, headphones are probably an advantage.Although there is a compass it is not possible mark any locations on the in game maps this can be a problem as some items can only be accessed with a shovel and relocating them once you have found a shovel can be very time consuming. The ability to be able to print out maps for the player to mark locations currently inaccessible of items for later return would have been useful.The game has little if any replay value except for playing on more difficult settings however, I shall play it again when I get time as an adventure and concentrate on following the story, although I completed it only a few hours ago apart from the main character I recall very little of the interrelationships of the other dozen or so characters in the story.I bought this in a sale and believe that I got value for what I paid however, I also believe there was a lot of potential missed because the two main game play genres failed to complement each other effectively, despite that, it was still an enjoyable game.I shall definitely consider any future offerings from Black Powder Games.

In the end it can become a little repetitive but you'll be invested in the story well enough to carry through it.The ending itself was not that great, would say that that is the main downside of this game for me.I would still recommend it to anyone tho, I really enjoyed the game!A tip: Don't waste time looking for the spade it's well past the second half of the game that you'll find it :p			"

You're right, no damn mini guns or fast reload here!Playing in black&white is stunning. The characters looks detailed and creepy aswell. It's not a horror game by any far in my opinion, but it definitely got a creepy vibe to it all through and the story is great. Must warn though that there's alot of story reading here. ;)Played it through in 6h. I did not waste too much time finding the last graves, notes etc after I completed the story though.			"

												Just to know this was a project done by the creators of Condemned: Criminal Origins, the original F.E.A.R., No One Lives Forever and Blood, back in the saddle of creative freedom, should be enough to warrant your curiosity. I purchased this back in August in hope that a seed would blossom into something unique, creative and depthful.Seven months later, that is exactly what I've gotten.My disposition towards Stream Greenlight and Early Access has always been one of caution and skepticism, but Betrayer has proven to be a fine example of what happens when the system works as it was made to. The world the game pits you into is one filled with mystery that fills you with a sense of empty loneliness reminiscent of the Fallout games. Its rare to see a game with an outdoor focus capture the essense of nature so well while managing to keep things so eerie to the player. This game will thrill you and it will chill you. Its both scary and a scary good time. I'm excited this turned out so well, and I'll be keeping my eye out for Blackpowder's next project.			"

												This game started off well, there was an edge of mystery to it and a slight creepy atmosphere of being alone in the wilderness of new england, where everyone has vanished from the colony. After finding myself a bow and getting in to combat i was swiflty killed clearly unperpared. I found myself some better weaponry, armed with a musket and some bullets i quickly became someone to be feared. The stealth element was useless in my opinion.  I did enjoy this game for awhile but after a few hours collecting things...then another couple of hours collecting things... it became a bit mundane. There is a slight story to the game but nothing worth giving it any credit, if you enjoy an endless hunt for collecting items then this is probaly the game for you. "

												Betrayer is... Interesting. It's what I'd say a Atmoshperic Horror, not a gore-fest or nightmare inducing horror. It's creeping around trying to find the enemy before the enemy finds you. It's not very long, story-wise, but can be play-time as it has a (now optional) ""find your corpse before dying a second time or lose your gear"" mechanic. The game expects you to be able to figure things out, but not a steep learning curve either.Pros: Good Combat systemInteresting Plot/StoryMonochrome color adds the Atmospheric Horror.Game doesn't hold your hand more than explaining a single important game mechanic Cons:Repetitive Objectives to advance the storyBow & Arrows can take a little getting use to usingGame doesn't hold your hand more than explaining a single important game mechanic $5 isn't a bad price for it. On sale, it would definately worth it.			"

												Betrayer is a great game comparable to the open world of Miasmata with the Stealth gameplay of original Splinter Cell games. Mind you both games are better than Betrayer in that regard. Miasmata with a better storyline Splinter cell with more threshed combat. Here's a pros and cons list of the game in general.Pros:Stealth gameplay is interesting and rather challenging which actually motivates you to try, as opposed to many survival games where combat is simply a cakewalkCombat is challenging and becomes increasingly more challenging throughout, and makes you think very quickly on your feetStoryline is interesting though requires attention to detail to followAtmosphere is very impressive and artstyle is original and enjoyableCons:Storyline seems somewhat disconnected at places which can make it less compelling overallCombat can get repetitive late in the game. From early to mid game the combat does not seem repetitive.			"

												Year is 1600. Emty hostile island. Spirits. Weapons. Ghosts. Empty forest, and a strange switch into darkness (same forest except creepy as hell) whenever you chose. Betrayer has more or less this atmosphere.The game reminded me of STALKER in a way. You are put on a hostile environment with lots of nature, beautiful natural sounds mixed with some dark ambient and horror audio. No quest markers and pointers, you have to figure out what to do yourself. For max atomsphere and immersion I advise to turn off the crosshair. It's pretty easy to learn how to shoot without the aiming help. Betrayer has a mix of exploration and first person shooting (which works fine). It has a classical horror story, which you will read in the game (no spoken stuff). Game is normal in difficulty if you just follow the story. If you set out to find all secrets and hidden stash, it's difficult. Map navigation is realistic, although it would be awesome if the game allowed to set notes on it. To illustrate the difficulty of finding treasures: it is still hard even if you have a copy of a map in a Steam guide that shows where the specific hidden objects are.It's definetly a different game, and the switch between light and dark world is very interesting (don't misunderstand, both environments are pretty hostile). One thing to note: Betrayer can get repetative after some time, I wish there were more unique environments and places put here, since 60-70% of the time you will be exploring. Still, I gladly suggest it to anyone looking for dark thriller kind of game, with appropriate atmosphere.			"

												This game has excellent atmosphere and a fantastic combat system that manages to feel very impactful. Muskets and pistols are superbly implemented and their reload mechanics make changing weapons a necessity at times, and the other items you can carry around give you plenty of options. When you fire off those gunpowder weapons you really feel it and you have to make strategic decisions about when it might be safe to reload which adds some depth to combat.The great atmosphere is brought about by good sound design and a beautifully haunting aesthetic. The mostly grayscale world, with smatterings of red really works to amp up the semblance of mystery, it gets the mind wondering “why is it like this? What could possibly be the cause? When will I finally lift this accursed grey?” This impetus pushes you on ever deeper into the forest, discovering clues and interacting with all sorts of nasties in order to try and uncover the ultimate answer.Unfortunately, that's where the positives end. The game felt a little bit too long to me in truth, I feel the game could have used one or two fewer areas as it does get repetitive, and it felt like near the end even the developer was getting tired of writing stories as the things to find became more about gold and items and less about story, although that was welcome by that point as I just wanted to conclude the story by then.It did redeem itself a little, but I still feel the story and the ending were underwhelming. I was intrigued at times, but overall I think it could have been a lot better. While the combat was full of impact, the story most certainly fell flat.That said, I do still recommend this game, it is very cheap and if you're after something a little bit different the combat and the aesthetic alone are elements worth seeing, and the story passable enough to keep going until the end.

												I could not help but think of Silent Hill while in Betrayer's world. At the outset, when I began investigating the wild fields off the coast of Virginia, discovering clues to crimes that came years before, I started to wonder what precisely went on here. The serenity of the sound of insects buzzing in the distance and the wind blowing, rustling the grass and leaves, all lent themselves to an unsettling quiet in this black and white world. When I discovered ash covered men in the first fort, there was no possibility of Volcanic activity, so there must be some reason that had turned men to stone, and soldiers into undead heathens. When I struck the bell in that fort, and with an all-mighty crash and a ring that seemed to last forever, the world darkened with a thick grey fog. It became a murkiness of unknown, and I strained my ear ever so slightly to hear the whispers of spirits in the distance, drawing me closer to reveal their dark pasts. Upon meeting them, I learned their lives were cut short by circumstance and poor judgement, with their families torn apart by superstitions. Those superstitions then may have seemed unfounded, but now the undead and disturbed spirits had begun to roam the tormented and blood stained land. A young girl, dressed in red - could not remember her name or her tale, but by flitting between the light and dark worlds, I was able to help her remember her unfortunate past.What Betrayer does best is in atmosphere, mood and dramatic tension. Gameplay does feel repetitive after the first area, but I found playing an area at a night gave me enough time to ponder, then come back wanting to uncover everything I could. Despite there being a very generous quick-travel system, in which after quick travelling to a fort, you can then choose to quick travel back to your last location - I found myself wanting to roam the lands on foot. The sound queues when you press the ""Listen button"" are chillingly atmospheric. They really sound like they're shrouded in the clouds of fog.The most unfortunate part of Betrayer is that it definitely is lopsided in design. My biggest gripe has to be the landmarks on the maps are already there, so it becomes more of a collect everything, rather than ""discover everything"" sort of challenge. Pacing could have been better with the stories themselves tend to be a little basic, and the setup to discovering them is the same: talk to person A, then to B, then to A again, rinse and repeat. I found it frustrating that I found all the clues already - and therefore the process of solving the mystery was literally jumping between two spectres. By the end of the game, I had amassed a large wealth of coin with nothing to spend it on, as near the end I got a key item that allowed me to go back and collect all the buried treasure, which have little to no significance for I also get the best weapons that way - then there was no reason to spend any coin except for cheap ammunition.I still recommend this game on the fact it offered me a few nights of wonderful atmosphere and despite gripes about the story and pacing - I still found the tales to be exciting enough to warrant me wanting to know more.

												A unique little Indie gem.  You're dropped on the shores of a Colonial New World, with absolutely no instructions about what you're suppossed to do.  Gradually, you uncover clues about the missing colonists here, and eventually figure out what events took place in this haunted landscape.  If you like mysteries, you should enjoy this release.As you visit each new location, there's a bit of a  ""rinse-and-repeat"" aspect that becomes a little repetitive by the end, but it's not really a problem considering the length of the game.  It's relatively short at around 12 hours...more if you're a completionist.  Graphics and game-play are great (particularly for an Indie release), and the story-telling is, imho, exceptional. Over-all, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, and given that you can pick up Betrayer for ~$5 during one of the many STEAM Sales Events, I highly recommend it as a great little week-end diversion.

												Bashed by most critics for its lack of explanation and  repetitive gameplay, Betrayer is a game that completely drew me in until the goosebumpy ending (at least I felt that way). It is a semi-open world action-adventure with lots of first-person shooting (or throwing), exploration and (text-)talking to ghosts, with a unique graphic style (you can change the high contrast black and white if you like), punishing difficulty (that you can set easier in the options) and, which is my personal favorite, an audio clue system that makes sense when you come to the end of the game (headphones or a quality sound system should be used while playing). The bleak atmosphere derives mostly from the visuals and the superb sound effects (no musical soundtrack). I recommend playing it in B&W if you can take it, important stuff is highlighted in red.Personally, I never experienced any technical issues or bugs. It took me about 11 hours to see the ending, but I have not found every little thing there is to find.You should play Betrayer if you like to explore and figure things out on your own, care for a mysterious story, are prepared to do some ingame reading and don't expect a typical FPS just because it's made by some ex-Monolith guys. Its a fine, but sadly misunderstood game by a small studio. I thoroughly enjoyed it and urge you to give it a chance.			"

												Short, sweet, beautiful. I loved this game. Between the beautiful setting of a wooded east-coast ghost colony (not sure if this is supposed to be Roanoke, feels like it tho) and the wonderful use of sound as a map, not to say the least about the bold use of color and lack thereof, I was lost in this game. Make no mistake, it is kinda short. After I figured out the use of the petrified ear, and what it entailed, I had no problems finding all the clues, notes, chests,  ect.. I figure about 10 hours all told, depending on skill and whatnot. Ending was kinda on rails, and it felt like the various choices didn't mean anything, but that is forgiveable because that crap happens with AAA titles also (Mass Effect). All told, pick it up if you like some spooky native american rage ghost♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Betrayer is a bit weird, I think it's a finished product and there's no rough edges left, but it still feels like it's incomplete.The game works in all respects and has no problems, I've got 100% completion (apart from 2-3 grindy achievements) and I didn't encounter a single bug. The UI is minimalist and the gameplay is interesting but eventually starts to become repetitive towards the end. It pulls off a decent combination of RPG and FPS, but I feel certain aspects could have been made better and others weren't really relevant (upgrading your weapons for example feels tacked on and doesn't actually contribute to gameplay, you just get more powerful weapons that do exactly the same thing as the game progresses)The story is interesting and makes you think, the setting is unique and one I've seen in virtually no other video games and the mood and tone is excellent, I had cold shivers for a lot of the game and it brought me back to the creepy feelings I experienced in F.E.A.R.The sound is beautiful in the game and the graphics are amazing for an indie title, but I highly recommend tweaking the contrast and color settings to bring a little bit of color back into the world, because the monotone black and white detracts from the lovely visuals. The only caveat is there is no voice acting whatsoever, and the game is heavy with dialogue. I myself didn't mind this but it is a shame to see a complete lack of voice acting.The dialogue and storyline are solidly written and some of the conversations were heartbreaking while others were downright hilarious, so the writers have done an excellent job, I won't spoil the ending or the plot but I do feel the main plot was a little underdeveloped and not explained as well as it could have been, however the overall storyline and setting are leagues better than most story based games I've played, so if you want a story with as much depth as a decent novel or film, give this a shot.Betrayer isn't amazing, but it shows lots of potential and is probably one of the better indie games to be released recently.7/10, this game is underrated, but it isn't perfect. I'll be watching these developers in the future.			"

												I'm amazed this game hasn't gotten more press than it has- I found it on a Steam sale for $1.99 completely at random.  It's quite short (replay value = 0) and has serious flaws, but for the price it's absolutely worth itPro: The world is both unique and starkly beautiful.   The monochrome graphics add a wonderful atmosphere, and the way the trees and shrubs move in the breeze is beautiful.  Sound is very well done and essential. (play this game with headphones)  The day/night mechanism works well.  The weapons are fun- having to deal woth the long reload times of flintlocks while being swarmed by enemies is a nice touch.  Stealth, when it works, is really useful- there's a huge difficulty bump in about a third of the way in and the only way I found to survive the ambush was to run and quitely snipe the enemy one by one.Cons: This is tough- it's clearly a work of love by a few people without a huge budget.  That said, they couldn't get everything they wanted, and it needs polish.   It's labeled as survival horror, but it's really not scary at all.  In fact, the nighttime enemies are laughable- the skeletons especially look like they're drunk.   The story is decent, but it's obvious the authors had more they just couldn't add. The real problem is the core exploration mechanic- it just doesn't work well.  You have a map, which by default lists the positions of almost every object on the map before you explore an inch.  It makes the visual and sound cues worthless- just walk to the marker.  Strangely, the markers disappear when you find the item and there's no way to put your own markers down, which is a major issue when you have to revisit them.The devs do have an option to turn off the map markers, but that adds more problems.  The story is told by meeting wraiths at nighttime, but without markers for them it's nearly impossible to learn everything.  The wraiths can be seen at a distance, but the shadows can't, and worse the shadows only appear once certain conditions are met.  They appear near significant events (murders) but the markers for those vanish when you visit them (and you can't place your own)  Without turning on markers for them, you have to search a couple of acres of territory over and over for the one guy you need to talk to.  I tried to play it without map markers only using sound cues (and listen) but it's just too damn frustratingAll that said, ignore the cons and buy the game.  It's a unique take on the genre and hopefully the devs will manage to write the sequel it obviously needs.			"

												This is one of the most highly atmospheric, and unique FPS games I've ever played. The use of color, and the lack there of, is excellent. The minimalist sound is incredible; having the wind be the dominant effect is uncommon and a real delight. Unraveling the mystery and gameplay was frustrating at first, but well worth the experience. The action and difficulty were great, and the level of spooky was just high enough that my girlfriend couldn't handle playing it after the first few minutes, but the design and effects were good enough to have her just hover over my shoulder and watch.

												You can find the video for this review in the video section for this game or on my YouTube channel.This is a great game.  It's a first-person stealth adventure with a healthy dose of whodunit storyline set in the New England wilderness of the 1600s.  This will be on my Best of 2014 List without question.These notes reflect day 2 on Steam, so they may get patched over time.[PROS]- The black-and-white esthetic is beautiful, but replaceable if you're not into that.- The storyline is amazing and the characters you meet are written to make you like or hate them -- a lot.- The stealth combat is great -- creep into shadows and expect to get owned if you go running at two bad guys like an idiot.- Shadows count toward stealth- Wind counts toward stealth- When you're nearby important items, there are audio cues to draw your attention- Four hits and you're dead- You are rewarded for exploration- You can't lose aggro -- enemies will follow you until either you are dead or they are dead- Very simple inventory system; tons of lore and each clue you find is recorded just in case you want to review it later.- While sprinting, you never get winded- In my opinion, good game length- If the combat is too difficult or time consuming, there's a button for that- Full rekeybinding with warnings when you unbind a key- Audio cues are important, but if that's an issue, there's an option to turn them into visual cues[CONS]- Limited graphics options (no 1080; MAX = 1280x720)- There is no warning when you are exploring and walk into an ""exit zone"" to the next area.  So while exploring, you might accidentally leave the area and then have to come back -- which is a pain.- FOV slider goes to 110, but it looks very weird visually and really hinders you given how important it is to zoom in to hit targets at range with your bow and arrow.- Light refraction off of water is junky- Enemies always walk in a triangle, so you can anticipate where they'll be.- Enemies occasionally walk on top of a tree- Enemies make a huge ruccous when they spawn- There's no letter or other device to tell you why you're here at the start of the game.  You can piece together the story as you go along, but the first fifteen minutes of the game could be a lot more informative- Game is very linear all things considered- Each area takes about an hour to fully explore and technically you have to explore them twice (I won't spoil why)			"

												A neat black&white forest navigation game with FPS, RPG, stealth and supernatural elements.The story pieces itself together as you progress through the game, and turns out to be really good. If you have this in your library, definitely give it a try sometime.The gameplay starts feeling repetitive after a while. You transition between independent areas, which contain npcs, quest spots, enemies, chests and other stuff (all can be shown on the map). Find all the pickups and resolve all the tasks, and it's off to the next area. There's a dual-world mechanic, and heavy focus on audio cues.The difficulty is fairly low, since you carry a healing item (up to 4 charges) which can be refilled for free, you can fast-travel beween checkpoints in the area, and death just respawns all enemies. Also, those throwable tomahawks which instakill anything, they're great.			"

												Very fun. I enjoyed it. I liked the graphical design style of black and white with red highlighting places of interest. Although the fact that they allow people who want a full color version to turn that on is nice. Story was interesting as you pieced together the subplots for the various NPCs. Combat was fun without being overly difficult or easy. There were definitely some moments where I was running backwards frantically reloading my crossbow as something was chasing me down. Using the trees to dodge arrows and other projectiles was well handled too. Keeping the items content and equipment simple was nice. Once I realized I didn't need to SEE a trowel or a hatchet to HAVE said item, I was good to go there. I think the only slight issue I could say is that the listening skill was not explained and therefore it took a couple minutes to realize how that worked. Sound was handled nicely as well. I liked that certain audio clues would indicate what enemies were around. The indian sound effect was especially good. Every time I heard it, I would whip around scanning for them. Usually they still got off the first shot. All in all I'd have to say a well thought out and executed game.			"

												I've only played 2 hours of this game but it has already suprised me in a very positive way. It's a first person exploration game with a combat system that I really enjoy, even though you need to be really accurate to be able to hit the enemies. (Not a negative!) You can choose to stealthkill the enemies or go muskets blazing straight into the action! The devs have succesfully created a really erie feeling and the story is really mysterious and interesting. I picked this up for 1,49€ and I'm almost annoyed at the fact that I didn't buy it full price to support the studio, because they're totally worth it. I highly recommend that you pick this game up! Even if you doubt the aesthetics will be pleasing because of the b/w, fear not! There's an option to maximize the saturation of the colours which really makes this game look lovely since you spend alot of time running through the woods. (Thank you, Blackpowder. <3)			"

												While initially enamoured by the world of Betrayer, with it’s stunning art style and intriguing plot, my interest quickly waned when the shallowness of the gameplay became apparent.  This didn’t stop me enjoying it, mind.The game is set on an unnamed island in the year 1604, which has been taken over by “corrupted Conquistadors”, as well as various other nasties.  You quickly meet a girl, whose name is unknown to both of you, who claims she has been trapped on the island for quite some time.  She warns you about the dangers within, but obviously, if I were to turn back towards the sea, that wouldn’t be very interesting.  So, ♥♥♥♥ you red-hooded lady, I’m staying.The game reminds me of what little I’ve heard about Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, insofar as that everyone on the island has ♥♥♥♥ed off somewhere, leaving only ghostly remains who serve little more than to tell you what went on.  The game injects very little personality into these beings, resulting in me quickly switching off to what was being said (or, read, because there is no voice acting) and just skipping dialogue.However, the game’s combat features quite an interesting mechanic.  There is a pseudo stealth system in place, meaning you are able to silently take out enemies from a distance when a gust of wind blows.  Being set in grassy fields and forests, this makes perfect sense given that for the most part you will be killing enemies with a bow, although you can also get your hands on a crossbow, musket and pistol.  The last two are, needless to say, quite loud, and will not mask your approach.  The wind sound effect is also very nice, might I add.The enemies themselves aren’t too bright.  They will run at you until they are within their preset range to be able to attack you, meaning that you can easily kite them until you’ve twatted enough arrows into them to have them fall down.  The game also features a “dark world” mechanic, wherein you ring a bell and♥♥♥♥♥♥goes all dark.  In this dark world, among other changes, the standard enemies are replaced by spooky, scary skeletons, which send shivers down your spine.  Mechanically, they are not much different to the Conquistadors, and less visually striking.Speaking of visuals, the game has a stunning art style.  In fact, it has multiple art styles.  By default, the game is high contrast duotone, apart from reds (yes, like Sin City).  Is there a name for that art style?  Maybe.  Anyway, if you don’t like that style, then you are very similar to me.  However, you are in fact able to change it in the settings, with separate sliders for contrast, saturation and brightness.  The only other game I can think of that lets you do that is Serious Sam 3 and Skyrim with mods.  More games need this feature, it’s a great customisation option.  I highly recommend you enable full colour in this game, it looks fantastic with it.The game mainly consists of collecting bits of paper with words on them, finding tombstones with words on them and treasure chests with all sorts in them.  Also some story happens which ends abruptly (I think?) when you’ve done enough stuff that the red hooded girl remembers her name.  Then that’s sort of it.  You wander off and carry on collecting.  No real climax, no credits, no cutscene.  Nada.  This didn’t bother me much, but did leave me a tad perplexed.  Perhaps there’s an Arkahm-esque special super ending for collecting all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the game.  I might find that out, one day.So, yeah, the game is about a man on an island with a girl, and you find stuff and there’s exposition in there somewhere.  It’s all a bit aimless, but the nice looking environments and collectathon nature of things was actually enough to keep me interested.			"

												Oh well, what can I say? This game was one of the many I have on my backlog, and I would not have thought it would stand out from the rest. I was wrong. Playing at max settings and with good surround headphones I got completely immersed in its world. Stealth mechanics are not explained properly in game, so I had to check online to know exactly how it worked. After that, the experience became from good, to magnificent. If you like to take your time in games to watch at the scenery, feel complete immersion, read and learn about mysterious lore and plots, and investigate areas, then this game is for you. You can also play stealthy or just face on the enemies. The accessories you can use make your build be either stealthy, or action wise so it catters to both audiences. For me, when I became bored of sneaking, I just faced the enemies head on. I played the game on medium difficulty, and I can say I found it a bit hard if you dont know what you are doing. Since I like to challenge myself in games, I loved the difficulties. If you see this game not getting too good reviews online, that is because the game lacked many features and options when it was first released. This game has been through many patches, and the experience I got was of a complete game with almost everything I wanted it to have. The devs really listened to the fans, and polish the game super neat.			"

												This is a good one. The environments are amazing. The game is supposedly meant to be played in black and white, with some color, mostly red, shining through to mark things of importance. Thankfully there are some sliders to mess with the colors and you can get the game looking amazing. I know some people like the black and white effect, but it didn't do it for me. I can't say enough good things about the atmosphere of this game. It manages to be bright, colorful and vibrant while being creepy at the same time. All the story is told though clues, documents and other collectibles that you record in your notebook. Every piece of text you uncover is recorder and honestly makes for a great story that involves the disapearance of all the people in the area, leaving behind zombified Spanish soldiers among other things. The combatinvolves longbows, crossbows and single shot pistols and muskets. There are charms you can find that increase things like reload speed. run speed and health. Health is important because it is rather easy to die in this game because the enemies are pretty strong. All you get out of this game is what you put in it. You can discover as much of or as little of the story as you want. The only bad things are that there isn't more of this game and the story ends rather abruptly and without much fanfare. I can understand why this is done, but at the end of the day I wanted a little more closure. 9/10			"

												Stunning visual style, atmospheric, engaging, and leads you to want to find out more about specific small events that tie into a larger picture - puzzle piece by puzzle piece; as you find clues to murders and mysteries about these spirits you encounter whom have no knowledge until triggered with a reminder or an artifact that is close to them (Amongst other things) - They beg you to find out about what happened to a spouse or child (eventually much more engaging and creepy things) - As you are finding out the answers to these questions; you begin to wonder what exactly happened as what initially seems like a murder with the spirit being a victim - may soon appear that he murdered his family; then another clue may throw that out the door all together.- Graphically the art style is stunning, although I play with the ""Regular World Looking"" visauls for when I am not in the ?Spirit Realm? / Other plane of existance - then use the default darkened realm for when I ring the bell; that sends me to the nightmares of a Virginia in Hell :D -The ""Little Red Riding Hood"" gal is quite interesting; I tried hitting on her by giving her an object that had deep sentimental value to a spirit and that didn't fly - The things I am seeing she is not; and as I progress I can tell she will end up connecting the dots to all of this; I just hope she doesn't end up being my foe - as My character is alone in Virginia, Shes alone in Virginia.. You know. Gotta start that new world and all. -cough-If you are expecting gameplay like F.E.A.R or No One Lives Forever look elsewhere; this is a 7 (or 8?) man studio from the masterminds behind those games - with that said I'd say that the combat is closest to ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"" - It's simplistic; Archery has some slight distance / movement ballistics needed to gauge while firing; Muskets and Handguns are my love; but my TRUE love (aside from my darling red hooded princess) is the TOMAHAWK. - After BLASTING some Hellish mofo with my Musket (long re-load time obviously) I can take out the skeleton charging at me shooting some deadly magic my way with a clean tomahawk to the FACE.Wind0wneD. 80.7/100 as of right now.Will be posting a full review after finishing the title (I can tell I am rather close) - I put up the first 60 or so minutes of gameplay (with some parts skipped for plot or atmospheric reasons) on a youtube playlist which will include the review as well; for now here are videos 1-8; if you are curious about how it really looks and plays check it out! Hopefully the videos end up aiding in someone to buy the title who was on the fence!)

From terrifying enemies to a story that is unique and combat that can either have you fleeing for your life or fighting a horde of enemies. It's well beyond worth the 14.99$ price tag, get it you will not be dissapointed.			"

												A very unique blend of action, adventure, horror, and a dash of RPG. Betrayer has an atmosphere that is unlike any other. Imagine the open world and supernatural horrors of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. set in the 1600s, with a intense color style that only uses black, white, and red. There is a slider to adjust the way the game looks, including the ability to add color, but honestly the game works perfectly fine as is.Ignore the metacritic reviews of the journalists, as they have absolutely no clue what they are talking about. This game is excellent. Don't let this game fly under your radar, it is absolutely worth checking out.			"

YouTube™ Video: Betrayer: Early Impressions 

			Views: 393		

			Betrayer: Early Impressions Betrayer is an action adventure FPS indie, created in the U3 engine. It features an interesting visual style and high fidelity graphics.		

Above is my video impressions of the gameBetrayer features an unique and striking visual style. More than likely it's the look of the game that brought you here in the first place. It being created in the U3 engine, it looks very nice, and top shelf quality. From the foliage bending to the winds blow, to the chirps of birds, and the huanting sounds from afar, the game acomplish it's atmostphere in glorius fasion.How ever, if you are used to way points, and the game guiding you to your next destination, you may get lost in Betrayer. The game is some what open world and expect the player to find his or her own way. It has no obvious quest, no indicators of your objective, or what may first come off as any objective what so ever. You will have to explore and peice togeather the story as well as what you are suppose to even be doing, all by yourself. This can be taken as either a strength or a weakness, depending on the type of player you are.It being in early access it will have a few rough edges. No voice overs, balance issues, as well as some what short game play needs to be mentioned and noted, but overall, an impressive demonstration as an early access.I think this game has a lot of promise.Pros:- High quality and professional visual and audio- Atmostpheric- Unique style- Open world game play- Great stealth mechanics- No objective markersCons:- Balance issues- Combat is pretty standard except with 16th centry weapons- Some what limited in content- No objective markers :P "

												Well Just completed the game 100%. You can enjoy this game in it's native black/white setting or you can turn the color on during daylight though setting. Either way it's pretty amazing.The graphic with color is above average for an indie game. The sound is generally creepy at night and sound is very helpful during daylight to help you track things.Everything is pretty easy to find because there is a Circle of interest that you can find on the map. During night use ""X"" to hear ghost sound and look though your compass to find where everything is.You don't quite get the name Betrayer until the very ending and you have to actually think back though the story and note to understand where Betray is.You have 1 NPC girl to interact with entire game and she is fun to toy with using different gift and dialoge options. The rest NPC ghost are very tragic and twisted sometime. IF it's not for the release all the ghost in Peace achievement. I really don't want give them peace and let them continue the torment. Try it your self. It's not a long game but fun to play and investigate. Ring that BELL. Summon the demons. 7/10			"

												I will admit: I went into this game with low expectations. I was in on the early access, and while I liked the idea it just wasn't shaping up to wha I wanted to me. Color me shocked, but I have to say my expectations were simply surpassed. I still have my misgivings, but this is overall a good game. THIS is how a game should be developed. Start with a rough edge, sharpen, an evolution of characters and ideas, until finally you have a finished product. And on that note alone I would recommend this.First: The good.Atmosphere. The game drips with a thick atmosphere set in a pre-colonization american wild. There is no wildlife or humans save for you and one other. You are the only sane man in a cursed world, and this game does an excellent job at establishing that hard-to-nail lonely feeling.This game is also quite frightening in the fun way that everything is scarier that it should be. Mortal enemies consist of soldiers and natives. The Spanish soldiers are literally some kind of inhuman beast-men, and the indians are more like zombies than humans. Then you have spiritual foes; consisting primarily of spell-casting skeletons and wraiths. Its just that everything you encounter is so strange and unnatural in ways you don't execpt. Armed with only simple weapons and your stealth skills, this game does a good job at making you feel helpless and alone in a diffuclt situation; proving that, once again, taking away the weapons doesn't make a game scary on its own so much as the feeling of helplessness and weakness does. A wide variety of intimidating monsters and plentiful surprises makes the game consistantly intense and frightening; no spoilers included.Except one: NIne foot tall Infantryman in the first area.Weapons work well on that note. You have a small arsenal of five or six weapons that can be upgraded in quality to improve performance. Each weapon has strengths and drawbacks. Bows are weaker, but being able to recover ammo is practical. While a pistol or musket packs a punch they are also noisy and very limited. You also have a dagger sidearm for fending off swarming enemies, and a tomahawk that serves as a sort of grenade attack that can get rid of anyone except some of the nastier foes with one good throw.It is also worth noting this game is very hard at times. You can take about two to three shots before dying if you don't use a health flask, enemies often attack in groups, and many foes possess a rage ability that makes them more resistant to damage when they go into attack. This is primarily a stealth fps where sneak attacks and avoidance are preferred, and open conflicts are dangerous and cost you a lot of valuable ammo. A well placed arrow to the back can kill a soldier in one shot, but if he spots you? Not even a high-quality musket shot to the chest will kill him then. You have to be quick and accurate in this game, and it is very rewarding.In summary, the gameplay is intense and legitimately scary a lot of times. Its a good challenge, and working with old-world weaponry is good fun and rewarding to get the hang of. The gameplay is definitely there.The bad:I'm going to skip over some of the nitpicks like the night being too easy at times or enemy path-finding being a little clumsy, and loading being a bit too long for my tastes and get on with the one big problem I have with this game.Story and objectives.The setup is good to be fair. You are some kind of traveler going to America when your ship is gunned down by a Spanish warship and you are stranded in a strangely cursed colony where everyone is mysteriously dead, and ghosts roam freely. You have one companion in all this mess, a woman in red robe, but she doesn't even know her own name. Its up to you to figure out what is going on.And here is where it falls apart. You never figure out what is going on.You spend most of the game finding white ghosts, people who committed horrible acts of betrayal (hah) and sin, and are now cursed to undeath, and helping them remember their sins in order to give them peace. But each character is its own little side story that ultimatley shapes up to have nothing to do with the whole curse problem. After completing the fourth investigation and helping the ghosts remember their sins, I still don't know what is going on. You also find pages that seem to log thoughts of the colony, but they are all worthless it seems; with many of them talking about mundane things like the quality of an indian arrow vs an englishman's arrow.There's also a mechanic where you find certain treasures that you can give to the girl in red that I 'think' is some sort of investigation mechanic where you see how she reacts to certain things in order to find out more about her and help guess who she is later, but even on that I don't know.The game is just cryptic. I feel like the main 'plot' doesn't go anywhere, and I'm just doing a bunch of fetch quests to collect clues to help people remember things that I don't care about. There is just no point to it, and if there is than its waited too long to make it, as I am sure I am already halfway through the game.That's another thing though: clue collecting. Its interesting to use a sort of sixth sense to find little treasures and points of interest to collect clues to help the ghosts remember things, but its all linear and prescripted. All your responses are single-lines that force the stories along in an unpleasant way. It lacks intelligence.To summaraize that: The story just isn't good. Its got a nice setup, but it holds the player by the hand, drags them along at a snail's pace, and presents itself in a broken incoherent mess of sidestories that just make absolutely no sense in the grand scheme of things. And finally, for a game that oozes with 'mysterious', there is just no mystery, since everything you say is pre-determined. You should be able to collect clues, put the stories together yourself, and figure out whether the evidence saves or condemns the soul in question, but instead its all a straight line and often painfully predictable.Overall:I remember the developers saying they wanted to make a simple well-polished game rather than one bloated with ugly features, and I can agree with that bit of wisdom to an extent. But I have to say, Betrayer's biggest flaw, and a big flaw at that, is the lack of complexity. Weapon variety feels a little limited, the stories of the ghosts are easy to figure out and don't really involve the player, and overall its just a big fetch-quest that serves as an excuse for the player to go out into the darkened wilds to explore and face monsters.But that doesn't stop the gameplay one bit, which I would say is top notch when it all comes together in tense stealth action and brutal conflicts. Its a well-made, if overly simple, game that is fun to play and a decent challenge. For an atmospheric game, the lack of a good engaging story is a massive flaw in my eyes, but the one-of-a-kind setting and pre-american FPS gameplay is just enough to redeem its shortcomings.I recommend this game, if barely. I wish it could have been better, but its fun enough as is and definitely worth the twenty dollars.			"

												The environmental effects and scenery while repetitive are very impressive and nice to look at.  But for me, that is all this game really has going for it. The enemies are frustratingly overpowered and most of the gameplay is spent trying hopelessly to avoid them while navigating the wide open fields. I can see the appeal for very patient gamers and maybe it gets more fun eventually. It was not what I hoped for and holds little to no scare value.			"

												+ Good graphics.+ Unique premise.- Broken stealth.- Lack of enemy variety.- Very repetitive quests/loot hunts.Nothing makes bad stealth game like a telepathic AI. You know the ones I'm talking about. Those AIs with Insta-Spot™ goggles that magically know where you are once alerted. They can't be evaded. They can't be bargained with. They can't be reasoned with, and they absolutely will not stop, until you are dead.(I ended up just moving around normally like I was playing Quake. You're going to get spotted and end up in combat anyway, so why bother hiding?)Broken stealth, coupled with the loot hunting and facing the same enemies - if you've played this game for an hour, you've played the whole thing. The plot alone, while very interesting, was not enough to keep me motivated to finish the game. Even at sale prices I would find this difficult to recommend.Verdict: 4/10 - Below Average			"

												Simply awesome! This game was made by 6 (and 1/2?) people, and yes it has rough edges but the devs continue to patch it and even with the bugs, it is quite an experience.Combat is tough, almost Dark Souls tough in-fact. Want to go stealth? Go with a bow, but beware that you won't have high damage and the shots may bounce off armor. Want power? Go for guns, but kiss stealth goodbye and hello long reload times. (Like to see you load a early colonial pistol/musket in two seconds)Graphical presentation is great. Yes you can give the game color, but you should at least give the default a go, really works well.Gameplay is fun as you explore the area, helping investigate wraiths deaths and try to find out that the hell is going on.Only few complaints is there isn't much variation, go to a town, get objectives, fight and don't die, complete investigation, repeat. But for a game this cheap this isn't a huge deal since the game is a blast to begin with.In short, this game is worth your time with its blend of exploration and combat, with a really well done presentation.

												A very boring, uninteresting game that left me highly disappointed as well as angered by its terrible mechanics and design.Betrayer was a game that I good expectations for back when it was in early access and I bought into the beta for 13.49 usd (the game was originally 14.99 on steam when I bought it.)The game, at the time, seemed promising. It was taking on an interesting art directive. This following description of the beginning of the game is still accurate in the final product. You enter into a blighted land that's void of color with the exception of the color red. While you proceed inland, a woman fires an arrow at a post with a note attached. Telling you to leave this land for it is cursed and lest you desire to be trapped here too, you should make haste away from the land. Building up atmosphere, you look around you and the winds howl, the trees and leaves rustle violently creating a very ominous feeling of living in a corrupt land driven mad. You continue down the winding path only to be stopped by another arrow hitting a post near you. It tells you to take the bow near you and arrows. The creatures who dwell in the lands are spirits of people who once lived there, now insane, they skulk the lands, only to be thrown into a murderous frenzy should they see any living soul who wanders this place.You will need to kill them. She tells you to aim for their heads and use the wind to mask the noise of your arrow, and your kill. Now. For starters. This is one of the first problems i've encountered in this game. The mechanic of using the wind to mask your... ANYTHING. Doesn't work, ever. It doesn't mask footsteps, even if you're crouched and hardly moving. It doesn't mask arrows, grenades, crossbow arrows, musketshots, thrown handaxes, pistol shots. It's a faulty mechanic that doesn't exist at all. The wind is just wind, it has absolutely no gameplay value except contributing to atmopshere.And then we get into the next part. A lot of the weapons in this game accordingly have a low reflect chance. Meaning if you shoot an enemy or throw a projectile at them, it has a ""small"" chance of reflecting. At least that's what it says on paper. But in reality, the reflection rates in this game are stupidly high. It's pretty common for enemies to reflect your attacks. Your arrows, your bullets, and sometimes even handaxes.And that's where we get into the next part of the bad enemy design/weapon design as well as player mechanics. In this game, you'll take a lot of damage from enemies from one blow. Though alternatively, assuming you're aiming for the head, all enemies die very quickly, usually in 1 or 2 blows to the head, and about 4 or 5 if you're fighting a captain demon (except grenades one-shot everything including boss-like monsters). So anyways. You'll quickly assume in this game you're supposed to play it very stealthily. Avoiding conflict, sneaking around foes. Attack only when you absolutely have to-except that's not how it works at all. For some reason, all of the enemies in this game seem to have pin-point knowledge of where you are. I've had many times where enemies are charging at me from far down the field and I have no clue how they saw me, heard me. And this is inconsistent too, sometimes you'll just have enemies who know exactly where you are from a little over half a football fields distance, and then enemies who'll not know you're extremely close to them, at nearly pick-pocketing distance.I think the worse part is that all the enemies in this game will simply just charge you. They'll run up to you and get in your face and quickly kill you. Which is stupid, you have sometimes freaking squadrons of men just charging at you. And for how slow the reload times are for guns, and the deflect chance on arrows. You'll be standing there like an idiot constantly firing arrow's they'll just deflect or reloading a gun while they hack your bloody limbs off.though it doesn't stop there, it gets better. It's an entirely liable strategy to lead a mob of enemies to a barrel of water and then iterally stand next to a barrel full of water (because barrels of water replenish all of your health and give you 3-4 potions that replenish your health by 40 points out of 100 total health) and just strafe around and reload your guns/fire them and shoot arrows and then pick them up and fire them again at the enemies until they all die while you keep drinking from a barrel of water. This is literally the only strategy I could find that was functional to actually take over a few stronghold positions in the game. The difficulty is otherwise impossible for the mechanics of the weapons you're using.So i'm going to halt there and go back to the atmosphere.So in this game after you leave the tutorial area. You enter the world and proceed up a path to a abandoned village full of people turned to ashen figures. You won't find much in the village save for a bell. You'll place a bell on its bellpost and you'll ring it. Once you do this, a loud sound resounds from the bell and you enter the dark world, the place where demons wander. And the game sets the tone for what they want of the dark world. A shadowy place where unspoken horrors echo deep within the blackened foggy haze, you will hear screams in the fog, but you and a courageous foot will have to proceed forward into the haze. But i'm getting ahead of myself.You'll pick up a dismembered eye, ear, and tongue in the village. To allow you to see, hear, and talk to spirits in the dark world. This is assumingly, where your investigation begins. To figure out what happened to the people here who lived here before these lands became cursed.But i'm going to ruin everything for you right now, because there's absoultely ♥♥♥♥ing nothing. I streamed this game for several hours on twitch.tv and I can tell you that there seems to be absolutely no story here. Nothing is explained, everything you meet and talk to is just people who died painfully normal deaths in the real world in the time period it takes place. And for that I mean being killed in a battle with natives, a person was killed so the killer wouldn't be found out as a traitor, natural death from disease, suicide from depression over a loss, there's even a person who commited suicide by accident because they didn't know how guns work and accidentally shot themselves in the head.Nothing contributes to whatever story there is in this game, it's just fetch quests, and you have these incredibly boring conversations. That basically sound like this.""I don't know who I am.""""Were you killed by this gun?""""Yes.""""You are Alvar Thompson.""""Oh yeah, I am.""""What happened?""""Oh, my son died and I got really depressed so I killed myself.""""Okay.""""Yup.""And that's it. Sometimes there's ""more"" to the story, and it's just more fetch quests and finding out why they're dead. The best part is that after you find out everything there is to learn about someone. You report to the girl who was firing arrows at the post back at the village (She's only there in this land cause she's looking for her twin sister.) and then you just give the like, murder weapon or a memento of the person who died, as a gift to her. And you get 4 options and none of which contribute to the story. And you learn nothing about her.I've hit my character limit, so i've deleted a lot of text to type this and the below. I will post a video review of this game in the future wrapping up my points about this game.Anyways, this game is riff raff and you should stay away from it. Even at 4.99 usd, this game is a waste of money. The atmosphere and gameplay as well as story are all bullocks and a waste of time.Sorry for my incomplete review, but I hope to some degree that the text provided will help you in your decision in buying this product. Thank you for reading my review.			"

												UPDATE: I upgraded my machine and installed Win7 x64 and was able to complete the game.This is an interesting game- what I've been able to play of it, anyway. If you have a 32-bit OS, this game crashes like crazy. Wait until you are on a 64-bit OS.The plot is simple- you wash up on shore in the New World (early colonization of America- like Jamestown). The land is drained of most color. A young woman in a red hood soon appears, telling you she doesn't remember much other than her twin sister is missing. You will have to explore during the day and the night to figure out what happened, and each has its own set of dangers.The atmosphere schtick with everything black, white, and red works for me. It's hard to explain why I like it; best I can do is to say that it is easier to take in the setting when you know things in red are important and the rest (for the most part) is scenery. The graphics are solid- nothing amazing, but nothing bad beyond some of the typesetting, which is a bit sloppy and hurts immersion a bit. If you really hate the lack of color, you can opt to change it to a more ""normal"" color setting, but you'll lose some of the game's charm in the process.Sound is well done. There is a type of enemy in the third area that, if you listen carefully, communicates via animal calls. One kind means they are near, another one is heard when I step into the open, and a third is the signal to attack. I have learned to fear bird calls, because they mean I might get jumped by multiple fast enemies shooting arrows aplenty at me. You can sneak up on foes more easily if the wind is blowing through the branches, too (though I have not been able to pull it off). There are a few enemies that are basically a skull and skeletal hands with dark vapors for a body- I mention this because killing them is punctuated by a rather funny ""PING!"" sound. On one hand, it doesn't fit the creepiness of night exploration, but on the other, when you nail that elusive Thief, it's very satisfying to ""ring its bell"", so to speak.Gameplay is a sort of cross between an exploration/find and click adventure game and a first-person shooter. Combat is short and deadly; at first you can only take a couple of hits at one time (you do have a means of healing, but it is limited to undoing one hit per use, give or take). The bow, musket, and pistol feel like you'd expect such primitive firearms to feel (though if you're used to Skyrim's bow like I am, there will be a small adjustment period). Enemies often travel in packs, so proper attack plans and dodging are a must. Gung-ho rushing in will get you killed. The enemy will press the attack if you seem vulnerable, but you have a tomahawk to throw if they get too close. The melee attack seems best used for stealth attacks or as a last-ditch desperation move. Since my initial review, a new enemy, giant spiders, were added- while they are a nice addition from a pure gameplay standpoint (hard to hit and fairly fast), they are a bit incongruous to the setting.During the game, you have to search for clues as to what happened, which will lead in turn to finding restless spirits to interrogate and/or lay to rest. You will find items early in the game that will make it easier to spot clues via visual or audial cues. Lots of people who suffered horrible deaths, and a fair number that probably deserved worse.This game won't be for everyone. If you want another traditional FPS, Betrayal won't do it for you. However, if a blend of light clue-hunting and investigation, short but brutal bouts of FPS combat, and a setting/theme that keeps the player on edge much of the time sounds like it's worthwhile, give it a shot (and don't forget to dodge while you reload that musket).

												It's hard to decide, am I recommeding this game or not? Both at the same time. First of all, Betrayer brought me A LOT of dissapointment, i've waited for this game so hard. Then buyed it, after final release, (not the buggy Early Access Version), launched it...and....""that's it? oh, okay""... Anyway, when the game tries to be scary, at least tries to create spooky atmosphere, the result is not that good. Betrayer means a lot of walking in circles, pressing the ""LISTEN ability"" button, defeating enemies in boring fights, and walking with a bit of...walking and...running. On EMPTY, BORING MAPS. But this title has some nice features you should check out. Of course the grey scale. And the fact that players can turn this off and play with colors. One also of the good things is a FREAKIN' GOOD audio. You better play with headphones, everybody recommends it! Wind blowing, waving flags, shooting arrows...and the weird noises you hear, when you use the ""LISTEN"" ability - it's just a compass to your objectives, (not everything is pointed by this, not the chests with treasures, etc) but following voices is a very nice idea. And another good thing, the strongest for me, is the plot. The main plot and the secondary investigation you will proceed through are very interesting and sometimes very terrible. Game worth checking out, but wait for a sale. Price is too high for someting that average.+ Very strong main plot+ Stunning audio+ Gray scale and ability to turn colors back- Boring maps. EMPTY MAPS- Boring fights- A little boring game generally- Price is to high, game is too average- Little bugs , sometimes- Walking in circles			"

												Both visuals and audio combine to make a strong atmosphere in the game which is terrific, it is the strongest part of this game. I personally turned on colour in the game, though the black and white provides the game with a more artistic style, I found my eyes struggled with it.Game combines elements of stealth, action, mystery and the paranormal. The story was interesting, immersive and the gameplay rather fun.			"

												Betrayer is an excellent game and reminds me a lot of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games (if they were made by an indie company). It has the same slow, tense atmosphere and requires you to think about each enemy encounter, instead of rushing in weapons blazing. Enemies do a lot of damage and your healing item is minimal for most of the game, so you have to attack from a distance or sneak in an backstab a couple enemies first. The variety of weapons is really useful for multiple playstyles: muskets. pistols, and explosives do more damage, and help you survive when you accidentally attract the attention of a mob, and your knife, bows, and tomahawk are *mostly* silent and help you get stealth kills. The black, white, and red aesthetic was actually really engaging and improved immersion for me, but don't worry, there is a really simple option to play it in full color if that's not your thing. What's even more interesting about the atmosphere in this game is that it incorporates a Silent Hill-esque mechanic of dark and light ""worlds"" that have different enemies and quests.The storyline is fairly good, but I wouldn't say it is amazing. The theme of ""betrayal"" (I see what you did there Blackpowder Games) is consistent throughout the game and there are many smaller stories interwoven into the primary narrative, however, after the first two maps, whenever I spoke to a character that had a quest for me, I could already predict what evil ""twist"" would occur in his/her paricular story. Furthermore, I feel that the player-character really doesn't have much motivation at all and ffter playing it all the way through, I don't even know why he's there! All that being said, the story is genuingely creepy and ""messed up.""I only have a few criticisms for this game. The first is how repetitive it gets right before the end: the enemies don't really change much, so while combat is still fun, it's the same kind of fun, over and over. Even if the frequency of enemies increased, or if the types of enemies were mixed together in close proximity this would present new challenges. Ideally, I would have like to see three more enemy types: 2 for the ""dark world"" and 1 for the ""light world,"" but I realize that this is an indie title, and there's onyl so much you can do. Also, there is a certain item that let's you dig up these rock piles you find throughout the game, and these piles have some of the best weapons in the game. Unfortunately, by the time you get these awesome weapons, you are near the end, so your need for them is really minimal. It would be nice to get this item halfway through the game. Finally, finding treasure chests and items is really tedious. You simply march out into the forest, wandering aimlessly, until you hear treasure (treasure chests emit a whistling sound). The problem is, you can literally wander around for an hour on one map to find all of the items! Something as simple as a mark on the map when you find a treasure would have made it go quicker, so I don't backtrack to places I've already searched.  All that being said, this game is still chock full of crazy, tense, scary, challenging, shooting, stabbing, sniping, sneaking fun! Get it now!			"

												Betrayer is a simple, yet highly original game with a chilling story and atmosphere. It takes a while to get into the groove of Betrayer as it doesn't hold your hand, and the lack of audio dialogue and music (for me) impacted the immersion and reduced the personality and human nature of some of the characters. It lacks a layer which I feel could've pushed Betrayer further than it's atmospheric horror label and into a story of family and loss.The forest scenery and camps are eerie and make you feel like you are playing in a significantly larger world(the areas of the world you progress through are relatively small and repetitive) and the two world gameplay is a good gameplay element - crossing over into a spirit dimension of each map to talk to lost souls and wraiths is legitimately spine-tingling; the sound design is pretty spot on at continuing to keep you on edge. Betrayer is pretty damn good and is guaranteed to get your spine tingling, oh and you can throw hatchets and cherry bombs at flying skulls.			"

												If you enjoy a good short horror story with a twist or two, then this is the game for you!  ""Investigations"" are essentially that.  A means of unvieling a series of (pretty damn good) short stories to the player mixed in with some combat and exploration.  The art design and sound are well done, and generate an appropriately spooky and haunting atmosphere.  Being able to tune the amount of stylization was a good choice by the developer.  I'll admit I was initially interested in the game because of the stark black, white, and red color scheme, but as I played I turned it to the more realistic color scheme.  This only affects the daylight sections of the game.  The night time is trichrome no matter the settings, balancing out the day sections.The combat is surprisingly ok, but a little more feedback on your health would have been nice, as I died often without really realizing how injured I was.  I would have appreciated if the stories were tied to the enviroment a little more.  Enviromental story telling is what videogames can really excell at, and while I can tell the developer made an effort to do that, I can only wish they had more time and a bigger budget to really flush out the world and details.

People like me won't mind - no voice acting is better than terrible voice acting when it comes to story, but some will disagree.-The game gets repetitive.

Posted: June 30, 2014
												The most accurate description I can think of for BETRAYER is “FAR CRY 3 meets SILENT HILL by way of ELDER SCROLLS.” It applies some of the mechanics and structure of open world action games to a survival horror game, or at least a really dark and atmospheric adventure game.The game has you explore the ruins of 17th century English Virginia colonies, piecing together the sordid tales of the people who lived there while fighting off monsters. The combat might be a love-it-or-hate-it affair, but BETRAYER’s main appeals are definitely the detective aspect and its atmosphere.The most immediately striking things about BETRAYER are obviously its monotone color palette (which is actually optional) and that its unusual (for video games) setting. Both work together, along with the paper map by which you navigate, to create a great sense of being in another time and place. It’s not just the lack of color that creates the style either, but the high contrast Blackpowder games employs (along with the reds that stick out to facilitate gameplay), particularly the very deep blacks which accentuate shadows. Blackpowder lets you adjust the contrast and bring color back into BETRAYER. Setting everything to “1.0” makes the game look much more “normal” and realistic, but also less interesting if you ask me. At some points you have to travel into an “otherworld” where the monochrome scheme inverts and thick, SILENT HILL-like fog is prevalent. Oppressive would be a strong word to describe it, but it manages to feel sufficiently moody.The meat of the game is exploring the world to track down clues and eventually interrogate ghosts to put the story together. The ghosts all make for diverse and interesting mini stories that eventually connect to the main mystery of the game, though Blackpowder didn’t have the budget for any voice acting.Even though the main mystery is fairly directly told once you gather the necessary clues, BETRAYER manages to vaguely allude to other mysteries behind the scenes. These culminate in a highly ambiguous ending that’s already ignited various interpretations from players.The combat is probably BETRAYER’s most polarizing aspect. Of course it can’t be a normal first person shooter when you’re dealing with 17th century weaponry. What Blackpowder ended up with is something I find rather challenging and skill-based but others might just find to be a crapshoot.As you fight monstrous Spaniards, skeletons, and other creatures, you mainly use a bow which feels nice and takes a bit of practice for figuring out when to loose arrows. Stealth definitely helps for starting or avoiding encounters but isn’t always an option. The knife, crossbows, muskets, and pistols are suited to different kinds of enemies and situations which all have patterns to learn. Dodging enemy projectiles is particularly tricky but learnable. If you want you can turn on a feature where you drop your equipment when you die and have one chance to retrieve it a la DARK SOULS, but the game as of this writing has it turned off by default.BETRAYER probably takes between five and 12 hours to finish due to much of its content being optional, but also desirable because of its affect on the ending. For fans of survival horror and adventure games who miss investigating dark, mysterious places, this isn’t only a nice first person game to chew on, but also a unique application of open world game design. From there it’s just a matter of whether or not the combat holds you back.			"

												This game really surprised me. I wasn't expecting much from it apart from visually beautiful graphics. But it offered so much more! The story behind all of the characters, their interactions, unearthing murders, killing hostile brutes and savages and talking to otherwordly spirits was a fantastic adventure.The combat mechanic was very nice. I was a big fan of the way the bows controled. Very streamlined and just a pleasure to use. The stealth factor was little iffy and never seemed consistant in terms of how quickly enemies would notice you and at what distance.Still, with all the small unrefined bugs, I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone with a sense of adventure and getting lost in story and folklore.

												Impressive atmosphere. Does a fine job in making the player learn the mechanics without explaining them, and to let the player decide what the game is about. The game stops giving new things to do early on and the game gets repetitive. There was one crash, and a few times I got stuck in geometry and had to reload. Writing and art are enjoyable enough. The weapon and item upgrades seemed out of place as they didn't matter except for the very end game items that offered significant bonuses.			"

												This game is overtly padded to the point of being annoying. I can imagine it's very tempting to take some basic things that look fairly professional - lush environments, decent interaction with enemies, semi-interesting investigations - and padding it all out into a ""full lentgh"" game. Unfortunately, by the time you're going through basically the same motions in the 8th level in a row, things just drag on wayyyyy too much to be worth your time.A more in-depth review on my journal[xander77.livejournal.com] "

												One of the most distinct aspects of Betrayer which initially draws in many people is the black and white color scheme with red accents similar to the Hysteria mode in Alice Madness Returns. This is a unique look for sure but after a while, becomes a bit much for the eyes. Luckily, after putting about five hours into the game, I noticed the color balance slider which is available from the main options menu. After adjusting the colors to my liking, the game came to life. No longer was the look gimmicky and odd. It became a beautifully landscaped game which suddenly gave the feeling that a lot of hard work and time was put into its creation.With the Sound being the high point of Betrayer I was happy to see that the other game elements were not far behind. Playing this game was an enjoyable experience, one which I will confidently recommend to gamers interested in this genre of game.Visit www.SteamFirst.com and search Betrayer for my full review.			"

												Highly recommended. The sound design is pretty amazing and truly affects the gameplay. You can hear enemies exact position, and must listen for secrets and your objectives (play with headphones!). Other than that the world is beautiful wether you choose to play in black and white or in colour (I still haven't decided which I prefer...)Also while the game is by no means a horror, there is a constant feeling of wrongness with the world that is just the right amount of unsettling. And the dark world's atmosphere takes the creepy into overdrive.Overall this is a highly recommended game. The exploration is fun, the atmosphere is perfect and the sound based gameplay is refreshing and does a lot for the immersion. Some might complain the weapons are clunky as hell and they'd be right, but that's sort of the point, you are using 17th century muskets and pistols. That's not to say using them is not extremely satisfying though.			"

												A game you can truly lose yourself in. I won't lie, neither the story or the gameplay are spectacular, but the atmosphere and general aesthetic of the game are what keeps you playing. I haven't felt so immersed in a long time, a lot of other games just lose my attention quickly, but Betrayer kept it long enough to finish it all in two sittings.Story? It did have me curious, but there was a lot of filler keeping you from what you want to really know, but it isn't thrown in your face so I can't complain, most of it is optional. The ending did feel kinda cheap, but had shock factor at the same time.Gameplay? About 80% of the game is following your ears to move from one objective to the other, essentially one huge fetch quest, but the journey is riddled with enemies and the combat is actually really damn satisfying. You'll be using bows, firearms and my personal favourite: tomahawks, to dispatch opponents that get increasingly difficult. It felt like playing Far Cry 3 with the bow and having to be stealthy.Design? The graphical style is amazing, I'm in love with it. The unique style may take some getting used to, but it really adds to the atmosphere of the game. Don't like it? Then you can disable it and go full colour in the settings. The sound is stunning too, really had me on edge a couple of times and genuinely sent shivers down my spine.Performance? Some of the best optimization I've seen in a game. I never went below 60fps which is a rare thing for a laptop gamer to say. I used to crash frequently, but they patched the problem causing that and my second play session went fine without a single crash or bug.I'd say this is worth the experience, as long as you're prepared to lose yourself.

												Betrayer was one of early access games that had a good feedback from the gamers and i agree wtih them the gmae had uniqe art style black and white don't go crazy and start saying this game sucks cuz there's no colors the game there's a colors in this game if you want but i don't think it's a great idea the game is batter with black and white you'll relize that when you play the game . in the game there's two worlds the first world is real world , the other world makes you able to talk to the ghosts and trust me the other world is so scary .the ghosts in this game don't remamber what happend so they ask you to help them  so  you have to collect clues and check graves to help them remamber what happend.the strories in this game with the main stroy is really disturbing. the game is sandbox you can discover a lots of things clues , graves , chests and other things and there's sides quest .gameplay is not something but it's good you can stealth by hiding from the enemies and walking slowly and you can buy different kinds of wapoens from some fire arms to crossbow .  the game gives you no ♥♥♥♥ing clue where to go , so it's hard to play the game without checking some guides on steam .the sounds in this game is really good the sounds of the winds and the sounds is the only way to guide to important stuff like some lost ghost , chest and clues  so i recommend using a headset . btw there's no voice acting or soundtracks in this game . Pros:+enjoyable gameplay+uniqe world and art style+interesting story +good side quests +great sound design+huge world Cons: -you will get lost a lot -you can't mark somthing on the map			"

												This game has the perfect combination of eeriness, mystery and visually impressive landscapes. The history and mysteries you uncover really draw you into the game and you just can’t help but to invest your time on the game to simply find out what happened. The DarkWorld is visually stunning and the creatures and characters you encounter are interesting in their respective ways. All in all the game is fantastic and would recommend it to anyone. Well done BlackPowder. In truth, I have never heard of BlackPowder before, but I am impressed with their work on this one. Looking forward to more from these developers. "

												A great and unique gameAbout the...Gameplay: Every map has ""two versions"", daytime and in the night. Mainly you go around the map to find clues, after finding them, conversation options ""get unlocked"" and you can talk to spirits to solve their problems which torture them and keeps them from departing. Sound is very important since there is no ""questmarker""; the game offers you a ""Listen""-button, when pressed, you will hear a sound leading you to the direction of points of interests.Enemies: Since this is kinda a stealthy game, enemies are very strong and should be killed without being detected. But in late game you (if you were busy searching), you might find powerful weapons which usually 1-hit them.Story/Atmosphere: Unique black & white, only the Red Maiden and Enemies are drawn in a bright red dye making them easy recognizable. The ""characters"" aren't voiced, you need to read all the texts, but this isn't really a big problem since the developers made the conversations quite interesting and short.Overall a good game, finished the game in ~9hr "

												Although not completed yet, this early access game provides a unique nuance unlike any other FPS on the market. An eerie Twilight Zone-esque scenario set against the backdrop of Colonial Virginia, this game will keep you guessing the entire time. With its instant immersion, the game keeps you asking WTF with its combination of the X-Files and a 17th century version of ""Who dunnit?. A unique aspect of the game is its option to play in black and white (with some red thrown in so that you may recognize key items, enemies, etc). With a plot that allows one to piece together murders utilizing Holmes-ian deduction themes along with bone chilling demonic thrills, you'll be wondering why they haven't made a FPS that allows you to shoot a muzzleloader until now!

												This is an exceptional game full of suspense and the unknown. While it will never terrify you, assuming you've played games like F.E.A.R, Amnesia, and Outlast, it will put you right into the shoes of someone who has shipwrecked on a stupid spooky island.The game should definitely be played in its intended monochrome palette, with the dark/light contrast at a medium high setting. The game is meant to be played with your ears, and with a good mix of sniping and not getting hit skills. The early game will test your courage, and the late game will test your ability to take on many foes simultaneously, while the entire game will test your ability to remember where everything is. If you're feeling adventurous, sketch out the maps for the game and be sure to mark down some of the special objects in case you die or cannot recall where they were. Of course, using the built in listen functionality will work but some items don't show up on the audio map.For sure one of the best games I've played this year so far, give it a go!!!!			"

Betrayer is one of the best games I have played in 2015.  I highly recommend it.  It's a masterpiece.  The story, the graphics, the sound and atmosphere.  It’s amazing.  This is art. Things to KnowI played on easy, so as to not loose my loot.  The game is not a cakewalk.Don’t mess with the color options, play in B&W.  It's worth it and will immerse you in the atmosphere and sound.  144Hz is available through some file editing.  Steam has a guide on this. LinkThe game does have a demo.ProsThis is a really cool setting: you are in the Americas during the spanish colonial period.  Think natives, muskets, forts, etc.  I was very interested in the developing relationship between my character and the girl in the red hood.  The game’s concept, that you are releasing troubled souls, is very interesting.A great story.  I was actually interested in these people’s lives.  That’s a hard thing to do in video games where the player is encouraged to go straight away to the next task.The graphics are amazing!  I was fortunate to run the game on high/ultra with 60-100 fps on an i5 and GTX 980; it looked incredible.  Don’t mess around with the color, leave it black and white, trust me.The sound is equally amazing.  Hearing the crickets chirp, the wind blow, the native’s chants in the distance . . . .  The subtle and perfectly placed music.  Whoever did the sound on this game deserves an award.  I would genuinely like to meet them.This game is scary, definitely puts me on edge.  Requires an extra dose of anxiety medicine.The fighting is unique too.  A first person shooter game, but your weapons are muzzleloading black powder pistols and muskets, or the optional bow and arrow.  Very fun and differentThe enemies are varied, different, and thrilling.Excellent save system; pretty much save when you want.Good stealth system.  Stealth makes the game easier if you have patience but it is not required.Pacing is just right, the game starts out fun and just gets better.Pretty stable game.ConsThe game will run at 144hz, if you edit some files on your PC.  Why wasn’t that just built into the options?All of the firearms have an odd pointing to them, it looks like they are aiming at the sky.  Some of the sound effects, like when a bullet hits an enemy's armor, sound like they are from a 1960's western.  I think this is a stylized choice.The ending felt somewhat anti-climatic. I would like to see a little more weapon variety.  A crude pistol looks identical to an excellent pistol. "

												This is a slow game that explores the folly of colonists that bring their petty and stupid actions with them to a new world.  (It makes me want to watch the movie ""Aguirre Wrath of God"" again.)  It is a small game and has more punch than most big ones.  I loved wandering the fields while exploring the maps, talking to Allison, and the slow transition of the fear of travelling the woods to eventually mastering that fear and becoming the hunter rather than the hunted.  There were things left unsaid and unfinished and I am totally fine with that.  There has to be some mystery left.  This game came out of nowhere and is like a piece of art.  Thanks!			"

												Betrayer does many things well. Great combat, graphics and a good concept. The combat flows well, the weapon types are different from each other and they all feel like how they should. The graphics (I played black and white because I'm a hipster) were actually my favourite part about the game. It's very neat, the models look fine and the whole black and white with the red to bring some contrast is just good to look at. The concept of being in the 17th century and♥♥♥♥♥♥is whatever, it could've been something great at least.But the thing is that Betrayer failed to keep me engaged with it's story for long. There are multiple reasons for this. First, the story... I couldn't tell you in detail what it is. You see ghosts and help them or something, then theres this red dressed girl who you interact with. Your interactions basically have nothing to do with anything, she just says some cliché♥♥♥♥♥♥about everything, and there's no consequences of what you say to her. Random ghost stories, that could be the name of the game, too bad it's boring after the 2nd one. It could've been actually interesting but the delivery is so poor that I couldn't bother. I just went on fighting monsters, at least that's fun... for a while. Unfortunately there is nothing new after the 2nd area. It becomes stale very quickly. I just ran to the treasures, killed any enemies I saw and that's it. Not very exciting. And that's basically the whole problem with the game. It's fun for 1 hour and then it just repeats itself. When you get to the ""climax"" you just don't care anymore. The ending  just he like the whole story, is an undeveloped joke. It's the pseudo ghost mystery♥♥♥♥♥♥ I mean, it makes sense the girl doesnt want to let her sister go, but it could've been delivered somehow emotionally? But no, it's as bland as anything in this game. You can't even care about the girl because she acts like a robot the whole game. So yeah, good combat and graphic design, but basically no variety and story delivery/flow. It's 5 euros if not on sale.. but it's not a good game nonetheless.			"

												Betrayer is first person action adventure game set in The New World, 1604. The player is set to a part of Colonial America where the horrific truths remain undiscovered. The game world is open area in each section which allow player to collect clues and search for better gear to survive from relentless world.The gameplay is about collecting clues and conducting investigations to learn the past of lost souls. Thus, it will reveal the truth behind the colony. Thanks to Blackpowder Games, who had worked on games F.E.A.R. for creating of two different worlds that allow player to switch and play major role to solve the puzzles. The silent New World is full of hostile conquistadores and Native American warriors while The Otherworld presents you an uncomfortable and depressed world as it stripped with black-white and red to indicate the important stuffs. It looks stylish and serves well on game theme, but you can adjust color saturation if it’s not your taste.The combat is simple FPS game, even on normal difficult. The enemies are deadly and straightforward in AI pattern. You need to take them out quickly which force player to use bow most of the time or rely on inconsistent stealth mechanic.There’s no voice narrative, all you need is to read from scarp papers to gain information and seeking for right NPC. The map marker and smart fast travel are useful enough to avoid player lost in track.Overall, Betrayer offers a short but impressive experience with unsetting and strong atmosphere. Although the combat is quite unbalance and puzzles are too simple, the feeling of horror/mysteries game love is back as the credit start to roll.			"

												What a great game. I started to play the game in gray/red color mode but later on I increased the saturation and enjoyed the colorful world. It felt more enjoyable this way even tho it lost most of its horror atmosphere.I like that I had the option to choose myself how I wanted to play the game.It took me 16 hours to complete the game with investigating and collecting everything. But there are still achievements left.I really loved the mixture of FPS, Adventure and Investigation. It's really well executed.This it's another of these gems I bought with a bundle. It deserves more than a few bucks from a bundle. Therefore, yes it's worth your money!Edit: I need to mention that the story leaves much room for interpretations. You quit the game but you'll find yourself thinking about the story days after your playthrough. It's very rare that I feel this way about a game.			"

												Betrayer is an interesting take on survival horror genre. The developers trust the players enough not to lead them by the hand. The gamer is given quite a huge map to explore, filled to the brim with hidden fragments of a spooky story (or, rather, stories) to piece together. This leads to an amount of freedom not usually found in similar titles. Artsy graphics, ambient sounds and some good writing create a truly eerie atmosphere and add much to the experience.On the other hand, one of Betrayer's core mechanics — the stealth — is deeply flawed, and the overall gameplay starts to get repetitive towards the end.Nevertheless, a decent effort by a talented team.

												Such a creepy, surreal little game. A brilliant example of what a strong indie development team can accomplish on a small budget. I'm already hoping that they make a sequel.The original black, white and red color scheme is the only way to enjoy this game. Unless you have bad eyesight I can't understand why anyone would want anything different. It cleverly captures the mood of the atmosphere. I also love how tolling the bell immediately puts the world into darkness where all kinds of sinister creatures and secrets lurk.			"

												Betrayer acts like the name states, builds up your trust then stabs you in the back at the end and proceeds to mock you while doing so. While I thought this would be a fun game it was far from it for me and felt more like a chore. The main character is a blank slate who gets practically no development throughout the entire game whatsoever. The black and white and red color scheme is nice for about five minutes then it gets annoying, luckily you can change the color settings in  one of the menus. The game for me ran at a solid 15 frames per second the entire playthrough, im not sure if its the game or my machine so i will give it the benefit of the doubt. The main characters task is to go around as mundane exorcist Sherlock Homes who help wraiths come to terms with the horrible murder♥♥♥♥♥♥suicide they or a loved one committed. excluding the wraiths the only other interactable npc is little red riding hood who appartently has amnesia and a twin sister. The interactions with her are very bare bones and seem absolutely pointless as the game seems more focused on her than you. There is no music or dialogue/speech sounds in the entire game making things feel unfinished, it does add to the creepy factor though. I will admit the game did catch me off gaurd with a few creepy/scary moments. One thing i did enjoy was the introduction of new enemies for the first three stages which helped spice things up, but then things became stale again. There is major repitition in each level involving finding ghosts and objects then using said objects to trigger the memories of the ghosts so that they can forgive themsevles for murdering their friends/loved ones. You do this for every area over and over again, rinse and repeat. By the time you get to the last stage it was my wits end over the difficulty and frustration in the last fight. To top it all off the ending leaves you feeling betrayed and almost robbed of your time playing through this game. I wasnt able to see how great of a game this is but if you are still dead set on buying it I would recommend buying it during a steam sale or humble bundle as I do not think it is worth the full price.

												I completed this game 2 times. The first time on an older build version without those neat markers on the map and the second time with them. Those markers are very helpful since any spots of interest will be displayed on the map so you won't miss out anything. The game consist of outdoor levels decorated with a lot of grass, trees and bushes and some buildings that are often used as checkpoints, there is not a single building you can go in which is quite a shame :( The game would be more fun if they added more different assets to it but is it ok as an indie game.The main goal in this game is to explore, defeat enemies, find clues and interact with NPCs.There are no voice actors in this game so you have to read a lot :PI'm quite pleased with the variation of enemies and weapons that I can use, it is entertaining until the end. What makes this game so successful are those unique features that I haven't saw it in other games yet and of course the storyline :) Well, buy it if you like it :P			"

												I loved Betrayer from the first second i saw it and that was an early stage of greenlight where you could find only a few titles. Now you find hundreds and this game still feels unique and for sure it is. Betrayer plays in a monochrome world with some coloured parts like in the movie Sin city. And it's fullfilled with things to find like notes for your investigations, different enemys and areas to explore, during your tactical FPS gameplay. A unique game feeling where you have to switch between two worlds, the light and the dark to accomplish your mission(s) and the difficulty reminds me a bit on dark souls. Betrayer is a real Game it will challenge and mesmerize you."" I'm still waiting in the darkness, i hope she will talk to me soon. ""			"

The graphics are wonderful, you can customize the game to be whatever experience you want, dark and creepy, bright and less creepy, or somewhere in the middle. The combat is amazing as well, you can attack enemies loudly and head on, or opt to creep up on the enemies using the wind to mask your footsteps and take as many out silently as you can before starting a fight (I recommend being sneaky). There are loads of secrets to find all over the maps as well that give you more insight into the story, or just some nice loot. I strongly recommend this game for everyone, even if you dont usually like these types of games.			"

												Betrayer amounts to a slow burn ghost story. Any expectation of a high suspense thriller, big set pieces, or even many jump scares should be set aside. Instead, the game focuses on a very deliberate theme of exploration and investigation. In terms of presentation Betrayer uses a black and white palette with slashes of red and shimmering effects to call attention to objects of interest. An alternate reality may be accessed early on that changes the scenery to an even more bizarre inky version of itself. While there may be complaints about the high contrast or crushed blacks, it is likely a good idea to give the default setting a chance before tinkering with colors or levels. The intended graphical style is an impressive companion for the tale being told.Similarly, the audio design deserves special credit. The player often hears an enemy or object before they see it. In addition a certain item allows for areas of interest to be ""heard"" from a distance and zoned in on. This helps to substantially reduce the potential of the game becoming simple meandering.It quickly becomes apparent that combat itself is not particularly the point of Betrayer. It is often fast and brutal. Stealth tends to lend the greatest rewards and is quite satisfying. Death is only lightly punished (there is an option to make it more severe) making mistakes mostly a nonissue. The enemies, while limited, offer certain unique behaviors though all seem to resort to running straight at the player eventually.As for the meat of the game - the investigations - they serve mostly as a vehicle to relate the story to the player. The writing paints a rather bleak picture that was compelling to see through to the end. That said, on a mechanical level, investigations left something to be desired. It mostly boils down to finding an object, then taking the item to a npc who tells you about it or an event involving it. There is no ability to make inferences or mistakes. The player is simply lead to an object (via sound) then lead to whom they should speak to about said item (again, via sound).Another small annoyance is the map. While perfectly serviceable, a game with so much ground to cover would have greatly benefited from an ability to mark points of interest (chests and the like) to return to later. Another weak point is enemy designs. As a whole the creatures in the game simply come off as a bit flat and uninspired.Overall, Betrayer is a worthwhile experience. If given patience, as well as a proper understanding of just how to play the game, it offers an interesting tale to slowly unravel. It is not without its flaws, but none of them are severe enough to drag the entire experience down.			"

												This game is wonderfully immersive and keeps you on edge. The story is original and keeps me engaged throughout the game. Each section of the map adds something new to do, though some of the tasks can be seen as repetitive. While the combat seems clunky at first, it develops into a frantic brawl for your life. The aesthetic choice of a colorless world (other than a rich red that pops out) adds to the eerieness of the world.

												Betrayer is a game I have been waiting for awhile. It has been a very long time that a first person game has filled me with such dread and I am fully decked out with bows and arrows, crossbows, flintlocks, and tomahawks! It is amazing what a small team was able to accomplish especially with regards to the audio. The hisses of restless spirits, creaking of the walking dead, the groans of marauding Conquistadors, and the whistling of ""naturals"" create a soundscape where every encounter is filled with great risk and peril. Exploration can be very rewarding resulting in the discovery of loot of all types.The art style is excellent. While the graphics aren't gorgeous, what's there is impressive be it English log cabins, native straw huts, varied geometry in the terrain, and well animated adversaries. I felt like I was taking a hike in the twilight zone, even using rocks and foilage to hide from my foes to ambush them with throwing axes and a hail of arrows. Heck I'd channel Natty Bumpo and fire off one of my many muskets to draw attention to myself. The AI is decent even if simplistic. Enemies will try to turn you into a human porcupine, hack you to bits, rend flesh with claws, lodge razer sharp bones into your flesh, or blast you with unholy bolts. Trust me, they're not trying to hug you!What I didn't like was how annoying it was to go about discovering chests. Sure there's a chiming sound when you get close to an object of interest and they glow or blink red form afar, but in all seriousness I often overlooked things. An enterprising player collaborated with other explorers to take a screen shot of the map of each region with a legend of points of interest like loot. I love treasure! Even though I love the audio, the game is best played with headphones or a good surround set up. Even then I suggest on turning on visualization of audio cues. Running around spamming the ""listen"" button wasn't too much fun.Combat is simplistic and felt suprisingly authentic. Except for the ultra accurate smoothbore flintlocks. Yeah their range was relatively far, but the dude you're playing as fires accurately and loads like a man possesed (or on drugs). Not that I'm complaining too much, in RL (real-life) it takes roughly thirty seconds to get your muzzle loaded musket ready for firing and that's if nobody's shooting at you, there's no yelling, or people trying to stab you with bayonets (which weren't invented yet). A lack of spear toting and halberd wielding enemies was a bit suprising, but a dagger is still plenty deadly. Things get easier with the discovery of new weapons my favorite being the crossbow. If you get decent at leading enemies and catch them before they enter melee the game isn't quite a breeze, but it's rewarding to keep cool under pressure.All in all I'd give the game an 8/10. A bigger budget and more staff would have made this diamond in the rough into a gem.			"

												Betrayer is a rough diamond, its beauty and value unmarred by its unpolished edges.You play as a sailor, stranded somehwere in New England in 1607. As you set forth to reach the nearest colony you realise that something is amiss: deserted colonies, deranged conquistadors and scattered corpses are a gruesome welcome for our protagonist. He soon finds himself a companion of sorts, a woman all clad in red, that will not fight his foes, but will be what little solace he may find in such bereft land, offering a chance for interaction and some sort of guide that helps you remember, to some extent, the humanity of your character.That is not to say that she will be the only opportunity for interaction you shall find, for there is the ""Other World"", a parallel, twisted alternate reality of our world is there for you to access; when you are in there you can find lost souls, astray and forlorn. It is your job to help them remember their identity, and make them relive their last, darkest of hours, to piece their past and get to understand what destiny befell the colonists.And that is where Betrayer truly shines: in order to piece together the various clues and information you must make various forays into the other world, as well as in ours. It is so seamlessly integrated that you go back and forth without ever feeling like it is being imposed in any way, rather, it feels as a logical path. The non-linear and open world nature of the game does help in this regard. Moreover, you find totems scattered all over the place, some of them corrupted; approaching these in the Other World triggers a fight with some guardians, and upon completion will leave the area less populated with foes, making your exploration easier.As for combat, the Other World has its own share of creatures, creepier than their real world counterparts, and deadlier. In there you may fight spectres, skeletons, and some other creatures. That is not to say that the real world is easy by any means. You have to employ stealth, cunning and skill to survive in the environment, hiding in the bushes, waiting to strike at unwary conquistadors and indians, using the sound of wind to cover your footsteps.Weapons are SERVICEABLE; they are the game's weakest portion by far. They  feel half-finished, lacking the ""oomph"" of a proper weapon. No crossbow thud, no arrow whoosh, no musket/pistol detonation feels powerful enough. They do decent damage, though, they just lack the right feel.Graphics are alright. The game uses the unreal engine, and it does show in the grass and some textures. Yet the character's hands seem taken out of some 2007 game. They are alright, just not what you would expect of a 2014 game. It is worth mentioning that the game is in black and white by default, and it plays beautifully that way, far more immersive. That being said, you can tune the game and give it as much colour as Oblivion's palette, but it will lose its grim charm.To sum up, a compelling story, an excellent and captivating gameplay and a charming (and eerie!) atmosphere are sure to make Betrayer a game you shall not soon forget.All in all, I would highly reccomend this: 8.5.

												This game is GREAT!The background, plot and gameplay are just amazing. I just love the black & white (& red) palette, but you can adjust it to get a colorful world if you want to. Sounds are awesome too, the wind, screams, weep... and you really need to listen very carefully if you want to keep alive and advancing, finding clues and unlocking the plot. About the gameplay, it has has a lot of stealth. You can't just run because enemies will crush you.This is not a game for everyone... Is very dark, complex and confusing. You need to understand and follow clues to keep advancing. Sometimes you will walk in circles serching for items, notes... clues, but this game has ""something"" that makes running in circles a very comfortable and entertaining job.			"

												I completed this game 2 times. The first time on an older build version without those neat markers on the map and the second time with them. Those markers are very helpful since any spots of interest will be displayed on the map so you won't miss out anything. The game consist of outdoor levels decorated with a lot of grass, trees and bushes and some buildings that are often used as checkpoints, there is not a single building you can go in which is quite a shame :( The game would be more fun if they added more different assets to it but is it ok as an indie game.The main goal in this game is to explore, defeat enemies, find clues and interact with NPCs.There are no voice actors in this game so you have to read a lot :PI'm quite pleased with the variation of enemies and weapons that I can use, it is entertaining until the end. What makes this game so successful are those unique features that I haven't saw it in other games yet and of course the storyline :) Well, buy it if you like it :P			"

												I loved Betrayer from the first second i saw it and that was an early stage of greenlight where you could find only a few titles. Now you find hundreds and this game still feels unique and for sure it is. Betrayer plays in a monochrome world with some coloured parts like in the movie Sin city. And it's fullfilled with things to find like notes for your investigations, different enemys and areas to explore, during your tactical FPS gameplay. A unique game feeling where you have to switch between two worlds, the light and the dark to accomplish your mission(s) and the difficulty reminds me a bit on dark souls. Betrayer is a real Game it will challenge and mesmerize you."" I'm still waiting in the darkness, i hope she will talk to me soon. ""			"

												The game was really, and I mean really fun. (Just play the demo!)Something about the whole thing just sorta fits the great, dark athmosphere.A unique thing about this game is the option to change the color intensity (personal recommendation: 0.2 saturation), which changes the whole feel of the game. The combat felt challenging, yet not unfair with the enemies having just enough variation to not feel bland and the same. Well, that's all nice, but I never got to the end since after eight hours of gameplay, my save simply vanished.This might be just me though (or simply my fault somehow), so if you're not afraid of that happening I can fully recommend this game!

Posted: June 23, 2014
												Most games released nowadays are a dissapointment to me. This game has been the first, in a long while, that I've enjoyed thoroughly. While this game isnt a 10/10, its damn near close.The first thing I want to talk about is the choice of lighting. When you start the game, the default lighting scheam was b&w with really dark shadows. Even with my computer's brightness turned up fairly high, many of the paths were too dark to see for me. I perfer seeing the detail in the shadows and like the game with colors, so I lowered the darkness and turned those on. The nature of the game changed a bit with just that. This is neither a good nor bad point; I mention this because some reviewers had ""struggles"" with the default settings but they are easy to change.For starters, this game is very intunitive, but doesn't spell everything out for you. There are hints and messages to tell you of completed sets of notes and chests per map, but it doesnt take you by the hand and play for you; something a few indie games do that puts me off. The ""listen"" feature is really cool to me and definitley a must ""over there."" The things you pick up and learn are concisely recorded in a journal that is easily managable and well marked.When I first started playing, the game quickly got creepy. Strange sounds, insane enemies, odd shifts in lighting and crazy mysteries, came at me in unison. The game isn't scary, and it doesn't try to come off as such. However, many of its spooky/creepy aspects add to the action of the game to make it more enjoyable to play. There are a few things I don't like about this game. Most notably, this game has an eerie loneliness about it. The red maiden that you barely interact with doesn't help too much either. It still feels like a pointless you-vs-world kind of situation that I don't enjoy and, while I don't know how to solve this issue without ruining the atmosphere the game trys to create, it is an issue I have while playing it. Another problem I have is the bow. I've probably missed more arrows than I've hit. I was expecting this game to have drop or sway or at least SOME kind of innacturacy in the bow, so I'd always try to lead my shot or account for the distance, purely out of habit. Instead the arrow would go right where the cursor was aiming every time, unlesss I was a huge disstance away. I read that the devs used to have drop and took it away, which I think is a mistake and takes away from the integrity of the game. The audio for this game is phenomenal. It feels like it just fits. The only small problem I have with it is that the ramping isnt really gradual on the listen sounds. I would listen and hear just a small abnormality and then run over 10 feet and it would be echoing around my room. This is a very minor detail and doesn't really bother me too much. Another small thing I'd like to mention is the poinlessness of the tomahawks and explosives. It might just be me, but I haven't found a point to acutally use either on enemies so far, and I don't see myself using them in the future. In any situation I've had so far, using my guns/bow just seems like a better idea.Overall, this game leaves a unique impression, and is definitely very fun and intense. I'll update this review if I come up with more stuff as I play through the rest. So far, this is definiely something I'd recommend diving into.			"

												Betrayer amounts to a slow burn ghost story. Any expectation of a high suspense thriller, big set pieces, or even many jump scares should be set aside. Instead, the game focuses on a very deliberate theme of exploration and investigation. In terms of presentation Betrayer uses a black and white palette with slashes of red and shimmering effects to call attention to objects of interest. An alternate reality may be accessed early on that changes the scenery to an even more bizarre inky version of itself. While there may be complaints about the high contrast or crushed blacks, it is likely a good idea to give the default setting a chance before tinkering with colors or levels. The intended graphical style is an impressive companion for the tale being told.Similarly, the audio design deserves special credit. The player often hears an enemy or object before they see it. In addition a certain item allows for areas of interest to be ""heard"" from a distance and zoned in on. This helps to substantially reduce the potential of the game becoming simple meandering.It quickly becomes apparent that combat itself is not particularly the point of Betrayer. It is often fast and brutal. Stealth tends to lend the greatest rewards and is quite satisfying. Death is only lightly punished (there is an option to make it more severe) making mistakes mostly a nonissue. The enemies, while limited, offer certain unique behaviors though all seem to resort to running straight at the player eventually.As for the meat of the game - the investigations - they serve mostly as a vehicle to relate the story to the player. The writing paints a rather bleak picture that was compelling to see through to the end. That said, on a mechanical level, investigations left something to be desired. It mostly boils down to finding an object, then taking the item to a npc who tells you about it or an event involving it. There is no ability to make inferences or mistakes. The player is simply lead to an object (via sound) then lead to whom they should speak to about said item (again, via sound).Another small annoyance is the map. While perfectly serviceable, a game with so much ground to cover would have greatly benefited from an ability to mark points of interest (chests and the like) to return to later. Another weak point is enemy designs. As a whole the creatures in the game simply come off as a bit flat and uninspired.Overall, Betrayer is a worthwhile experience. If given patience, as well as a proper understanding of just how to play the game, it offers an interesting tale to slowly unravel. It is not without its flaws, but none of them are severe enough to drag the entire experience down.			"

												I'm not gonna lie, I started playing this game just to get it completed and all the achievements finished. That being said, I never really heard much about Betrayer and think it far exceeded my expectations. You can play this in black and white, or turn the color saturation to max and let the visuals really shine. I thought some parts got to be very repetitive, but solving some of the mysterys really kept me pushing through it. Each zone you get to seemed to present a new enemy. I really enjoyed the combat and thought it gave you plenty of options. Like others have stated, the ending was a bit strange and definitely leaves you asking some questions. So if you're on the fence about it, pick it up when it's on sale. This game should not be overlooked and I wish I had heard more about it before I started playing.			"

												3 Options we have here people. Start game, settings and quit game. So classic, so awesome, no useless extras, just the minimalistic perfection. Graphics of the game is so unique, starting as a black and white adventure although you have the option to add colors, it is not recommended. Later on we will have the opportunity to travel to a the dead world which is incredible, the lights and shadows creating an atmospheric feeling that sadly being ruined by the clumsy enemy animations, which brings back memories from the games of 2000's. In fact they are terrible. Perhaps the biggest problem is  the lack of music, not to mention the lame enemy, and the non-existing conversation voices. Thats not why i like it. Rather because of the engaging story, witnessing the life and deciding the fate of the dead people at the land of endless horrors makes the whole event so personal.The game is good overall, achievements are working, and the Dev crew is so nice and helpful, despite of that, it is not yet recommended to buy before sale.

												Betrayer is a fun FPS adventure game that definitely stands apart from other games. There isn't really many RPG elements so I wouldn't go in expecting such, but it is still a compelling little story type game. It is set in a world with two variations, light and dark, during colonial times. The backstory and messages scattered across the map are in no way dull and do not detract from the main story like in some games and the main storyline seems interesting enough.The only issues I currently have with the game are the enemies with their extreme ranged accuracy, enemies having really wide detection ranges, no voice acting whatsoever (which is okay still), and not much in terms of customization of anything (which is also okay because it seems like more of a story game anyways).It does a lot of things well though, such as the animations, the sounds, the graphics, and just the individual character of the game. I would say it is worth picking up because it really does have an interesting style that will keep you occupied for awhile. 7.8/10			"

												First of all, the graphics and the atmosphere of this game are fantastic. The major problems come in when you realise the world is quite empty, and there is no real use to being stealthy, since enemy encounters are so far and few, and they are basically random ambushes which you cannot really avoid. The story is also not so compelling and the combat system is not very sophisticated, although still quite enjoyable. Overall this was a great experience. This game has some flaws, but for its price I still recommend it.			"

												Let me start by admitting something. I bought betrayer alongside other games during a sale, and then uninstalled it after less than an hour, finding it confusing and dying to a group of enemies frequently. It was only because I needed more playtime to get trading cards that I reinstalled and played it a bit more. I am very glad that I did.Betrayer is a very well done suspense game, a murder mystery or sets of murder mysteries if you like. It is more disconcerting and more eerie than it is terrifying. There is a great sense of foreboding in the game helped by a very interesting and pretty black and white, with red hints, pallet. Each area of the game has a certain story to it, whether it be the burning of a woman falsely accused of being a witch or a father’s desire to do anything to preserve his family’s honour. You investigate, reading notes, finding clues and discovering what’s happened to the inhabitants. Sometimes you fight Spanish conquistadors, sometimes humanoid ash creatures and sometimes skeletal opposition.Like a lot of games you start off with very mediocre weapons, can only carry a very small amount of ammunition, water (health) and bombs and so it can start off tricky. But using the stealth system and then eventually gaining better equipment means it becomes more manageable later on. The weapons are interesting (crossbows, bows, muskets and pistols) and thematic, muskets hit hard but have an agonising reload time, for instance.Yet the decent combat, takes a backseat to the story, the mystery of the New World settlements and what happened to them. This isn’t a game that holds your hand, with an unclear sense of what you should be doing prevalent throughout the game; it’s what put me off originally and some of the negative reviews reference the lack of direction. I think that this works for this game and with a new patch if you want to you can see where most (not all) of the places and items of note are on the map.For the price, especially on sale, this is an absolute steal. An atmospheric story telling game of mystery, discovery and a not in your face sense of horror. The ending divides opinion a bit, I won’t spoilt it but it is short/abrupt. Betrayer isn’t really a traditional shooter and its lack of an obvious sense of direction isn’t for everyone. For those that like mystery, suspense, a story that you discover rather than are told, I can’t recommend Betrayer enough. "

Intriguing at first, a little borring in the middle, with quite interesting ending which seems to depend a little bit on players choice.

The aesthetic is fantastic, playing in black and white with red accents is something different and it's sets a good tone.  The horror element is pretty well done too, especially with the story(ies).

I wouldn't say it's the scariest game I've ever played, but the fact that you and one other NPC are the only living, sane people in this colony gives it an eerie, suspenseful atmosphere. It has many murder mystery quests as well. The combat and stealth mechanics are a lot of fun, forcing you to think ahead. Finally, the graphics are impressive given its indie status.			"

												3 Options we have here people. Start game, settings and quit game. So classic, so awesome, no useless extras, just the minimalistic perfection. Graphics of the game is so unique, starting as a black and white adventure although you have the option to add colors, it is not recommended. Later on we will have the opportunity to travel to a the dead world which is incredible, the lights and shadows creating an atmospheric feeling that sadly being ruined by the clumsy enemy animations, which brings back memories from the games of 2000's. In fact they are terrible. Perhaps the biggest problem is  the lack of music, not to mention the lame enemy, and the non-existing conversation voices. Thats not why i like it. Rather because of the engaging story, witnessing the life and deciding the fate of the dead people at the land of endless horrors makes the whole event so personal.The game is good overall, achievements are working, and the Dev crew is so nice and helpful, despite of that, it is not yet recommended to buy before sale.

												I'm not gonna lie, I started playing this game just to get it completed and all the achievements finished. That being said, I never really heard much about Betrayer and think it far exceeded my expectations. You can play this in black and white, or turn the color saturation to max and let the visuals really shine. I thought some parts got to be very repetitive, but solving some of the mysterys really kept me pushing through it. Each zone you get to seemed to present a new enemy. I really enjoyed the combat and thought it gave you plenty of options. Like others have stated, the ending was a bit strange and definitely leaves you asking some questions. So if you're on the fence about it, pick it up when it's on sale. This game should not be overlooked and I wish I had heard more about it before I started playing.			"

												Betrayer is a fun FPS adventure game that definitely stands apart from other games. There isn't really many RPG elements so I wouldn't go in expecting such, but it is still a compelling little story type game. It is set in a world with two variations, light and dark, during colonial times. The backstory and messages scattered across the map are in no way dull and do not detract from the main story like in some games and the main storyline seems interesting enough.The only issues I currently have with the game are the enemies with their extreme ranged accuracy, enemies having really wide detection ranges, no voice acting whatsoever (which is okay still), and not much in terms of customization of anything (which is also okay because it seems like more of a story game anyways).It does a lot of things well though, such as the animations, the sounds, the graphics, and just the individual character of the game. I would say it is worth picking up because it really does have an interesting style that will keep you occupied for awhile. 7.8/10			"

												Let me start by admitting something. I bought betrayer alongside other games during a sale, and then uninstalled it after less than an hour, finding it confusing and dying to a group of enemies frequently. It was only because I needed more playtime to get trading cards that I reinstalled and played it a bit more. I am very glad that I did.Betrayer is a very well done suspense game, a murder mystery or sets of murder mysteries if you like. It is more disconcerting and more eerie than it is terrifying. There is a great sense of foreboding in the game helped by a very interesting and pretty black and white, with red hints, pallet. Each area of the game has a certain story to it, whether it be the burning of a woman falsely accused of being a witch or a father’s desire to do anything to preserve his family’s honour. You investigate, reading notes, finding clues and discovering what’s happened to the inhabitants. Sometimes you fight Spanish conquistadors, sometimes humanoid ash creatures and sometimes skeletal opposition.Like a lot of games you start off with very mediocre weapons, can only carry a very small amount of ammunition, water (health) and bombs and so it can start off tricky. But using the stealth system and then eventually gaining better equipment means it becomes more manageable later on. The weapons are interesting (crossbows, bows, muskets and pistols) and thematic, muskets hit hard but have an agonising reload time, for instance.Yet the decent combat, takes a backseat to the story, the mystery of the New World settlements and what happened to them. This isn’t a game that holds your hand, with an unclear sense of what you should be doing prevalent throughout the game; it’s what put me off originally and some of the negative reviews reference the lack of direction. I think that this works for this game and with a new patch if you want to you can see where most (not all) of the places and items of note are on the map.For the price, especially on sale, this is an absolute steal. An atmospheric story telling game of mystery, discovery and a not in your face sense of horror. The ending divides opinion a bit, I won’t spoilt it but it is short/abrupt. Betrayer isn’t really a traditional shooter and its lack of an obvious sense of direction isn’t for everyone. For those that like mystery, suspense, a story that you discover rather than are told, I can’t recommend Betrayer enough. "

												First of all, the graphics and the atmosphere of this game are fantastic. The major problems come in when you realise the world is quite empty, and there is no real use to being stealthy, since enemy encounters are so far and few, and they are basically random ambushes which you cannot really avoid. The story is also not so compelling and the combat system is not very sophisticated, although still quite enjoyable. Overall this was a great experience. This game has some flaws, but for its price I still recommend it.			"

												Betrayer is a relatively generic stealth horror fps.  That's not to say it isn't good, because it is.  It has a certain charm to it despite everything being somewhat run-of-the-mill.  The aesthetic is fantastic, playing in black and white with red accents is something different and it's sets a good tone.  The horror element is pretty well done too, especially with the story(ies).  If you're a fan of ninja-ing around with a bow and arrow with a bit of unnerving intensity, do it.			"

												Betrayer is one of the most unique FPSs I have played in the last couple of years. It is an unsettling adventure with lots of tragic stories to uncover and I thoroughly enjoyed playing through it.By just looking at the gameplay videos, you can tell that the game is very heavy on atmosphere. The world has an eerie feeling to it and from the very beginning you know that something went very wrong here. The first time you are transported to the shadow realm, I guarantee some nerve-racking moments. Betrayer's setting is great because while you might not find many enemies, the tension is always kept very high. It is horror done right, not with cheap jumpscares but an atmosphere that is undoubtely chilling.It also doesn't help that your weapons are true to the game's 17th century setting. If you thought that evading screaming skeletons and floating skulls wasn't enough, then imagine frantically reloading your muskets and pistols that use gunpowder.The game does not hold your hand along the way and this is a very positive aspect in the age of dumbed-down game design. There is no objective marker, just a ""listen"" button that vagely gives you an audio cue about where to go next. This greatly helps immersion and you truly feel like a helpless chap among mysteries and monsters.Overall, I can easily recommend Betrayer to people who enjoy a refreshing, immersive experience in a unique setting. I really hope that the developers will continue this story with an expansion at least and this is a very rare thing for me to say! "

The Goodvery strong atmosphere; the visuals, the sound and the writing complement each other in creating an atmosphere that is not only eerie and scary, but also very sad and occasionally disturbingjumping off of the previous point, the writing in this game was a big surprise for me; while there isn't much of a main story going on at all, the way the conversations with the lost souls slowly reveal the most horrible things about the persons' lives was very intriguing and often quite chillingexceptionally well done in-game log; information on anything and everything you come across in the game, be it NPCs, scrap notes or dug up items, is saved permanently in your log, with a description and an indicator that tells you whether or not you've already discovered everything there is to discover about it; very useful, especially later on when you re-visit old locationsthe ""Listen"" mechanic, which helps you find your way around the forest to all the points of interest related to any ongoing investigation, is pretty unique and had me engaged with the game in a way that a sole reliance on the map wouldn't have The Mehwhile I did enjoy the design of the ""daytime"" enemies, the wraiths and the spectres, I felt like having comically cliched skeletons and giant spiders attack you at night was both, a bit lazy and, sadly, detrimental to the serious tone and otherwise dreary atmosphere of the game I didn't enjoy the combat too much; taking out enemies from a distance is okay, but once they gang up on you (which happens frequently, and especially the nightly spawns cannot be sneaked up upon), it all turns into an often frustrating mess; a big part of the problem is that the AI often resorts to simply running straight towards you, attempting to hurt you with melee attacks, while you try your best to keep them at a distance with an arsenal of (deliberately) slow, ranged weapons; you do have a melee attack of your own, but it's depressingly inefficient, as are the explosives you find, which will often do splash damage to yourself or simply miss the quickly approaching and dodging enemy entirely; there's a ""last resort"" type of weapon in the form of a very deadly tomahawk, but those are in extremely short supply (by the end of the game, I was able to carry only a maximum of three)I wish the actual investigations were a bit more involving than just picking up clues that are strewn all across the forest; maybe the dialog system could have been made a bit more complex with multiple dialog trees and investigative questioning The UglyI feel like Betrayer's biggest problem is that it quickly gives off the impression that the developers were padding things out; the 7 main maps could have easily been compressed to 5 or even just 4, with multiple investigations per map and fewer ""filler"" chests and buried treasures; I sometimes felt like I was doing busywork, which truly hurt the sense of immersion that's so crucial to the enjoyment of this game  OverallBetrayer was a pleasant surprise for me. I don't know what I was expecting, really, but it certainly wasn't something so engrossing and well-written as this. It's a bit of a shame that the game overstays its welcome by a few hours, since the most fun I had was early on when I was figuring out the mechanics of this strange world and unraveling its mysteries. Later on, I often found myself just checking all the spots on the map in order to move on. However, I will say that the final map and its related investigation managed to bring back much of the game's initial charme and atmosphere. I just wish they had cut out some of the filler in the middle. Either way, though, as far as spooky indie games go, this is a big ""Recommend"", with the hopes for a tighter Betrayer II that focuses much more on the investigations.Also, I noticed that many commenters have criticized the game's ending for being a letdown. I don't really agree. The ending (both in terms of plot resolution and gameplay) is pretty much in line with the rest of the game, in my opinion. .:very mild, nonspecific spoiler:. It doesn't answer any big questions, but the game never leads you on to believe that it ever will. "

												Betrayer had it all: a thick atmosphere of anxiety, a mysterious scenario which is pierced the mysteries very gradually, a graphic orientation more than successful, a coherent universe and work on sound excellent. Unfortunately, Blackpowder teams have failed to create enough diversity to captivate the player over time. It really bored after two hours of play, due to gameplay mechanics too repetitive and enemies to the absurd behavior. This is all the more regrettable that the strings of anxiety are finely manipulated. We could only wish that this talent is put to the duration and not fused to the first moments of the game.

												I can't believe I had this game for months and not tried it yet until today. I got sucked into the game for hours. The atmosphere is bone-chilling, the color deprivation is equivalent to removing of one's senses to enhance the reception of the other availalable ones, mainly the audio. However, there is a color saturation option if you want it, but I recommend keeping it off or very very low for the experience intended. The game's atmosphere is relied heavily upon the sound that I had become scared and jumpy on several occasions. There is an item in the game you need to help you find your path via sound. The path-finding sound is like a bunch of whispers that are heard from afar and are louder as you near it. It is audible when the item is used, but i shudder before I even press the button.The games graphics are beautiful, thought some may say dated. I love the way the trees and grass move and the ambient lighting bounces off the environment. Sprite/Enemy models look a bit shoddy, but does not stray from the fear factor it gives me with animalistic sounds of beastly vehemency. I have fled a few times while whimpering. I definitely recommend. 10/10 on the sound. 8/10 on the graphics.  "

												It's not an average FPS from your library. Muskets and pistols from 17th century acts like they should and your hero is not the commandos with magical autohealing.It's not an average modern stealth action. If you can hear the enemy or see him from hundred meters away - so does he; they're not deaf and blind as it trended in stealth games nowadays. Enemies are smart but reckless, they'll track you down almost always, even if you'll run from them to the other end of the map.I was sceptical when got heard about this ""open-world horror action"". But the atmosphere of the game is really great - mysterious and grim, even in the bright daylight. I highly recommend to play this game in original black-white-red palette - your eyes will bleed, but it's worth it. Sound is also a big part of ambience and it's awesome: wind, birds, trees and grass, weapons, ****ed-up Spaniards, skeletons and wraiths. It'll sounds crazy, but lack of voice acting is not a flaw in this case - it makes the game even more surrealistic. Totally worth the full price (but I grabbed it with -80% at Summer Sale). The game that you'll remember even after few years.			"

												Pretty cool game with a really nice creepy atmosphere - the graphics style and execution is amazing. The game never gets too scary though since combat isnt very hard. Having to sneak more would have helped the atmosphere.  Also i think it would have been really nice to get voice acting in a few places - there is quite a bit of reading if you want to know whats going on. The system to find interesting stuff by ""listening"" is really well done - a lot of information is conveyed via sound. One other point is that the system gets a tad repetetive after the first few levels. The game is split into a number of pretty big areas but there is always only one next area to go to. There is also fast-travelling which helps a lot.All in all i'd say the game could use a few tweaks but its pretty amazing - and the price is fair for about 8 hours of gameplay			"

												This game feels a lot like one big fetch-quest. I like the atmosphere (spooky!) but having a map that pretty much tells you where everything is and being forced to travel to locations twice (once in the normal mode and the second time in the alternate reality that the game allows you to switch to) seems like it is meant to drag the game on. The story seems interesting but the rather dull MMOFPS-like combat isn't doing it for me.The weapons are rather interesting and require good aim. Fortunately and unfortunately, the AI is dumb as bricks as it seems to get stuck behind objects a lot and gives up the chase when you run away.I immediately went into the colour correction menu after starting up the game as the black and white didn't do it for me at all. Kudos to the developer for allowing you to configure the game to your needs.I only played this for 20 minutes and already I realised that it was going to be one long haul of going here, doing that and bringing it back to base then going out again because something else needs a hauling. I couldn't recommend it as I generally do not enjoy these games, especially not when the combat is rather bland and the graphics rather outdated.On top of that, the game expects you to apply some sort of stealth. Unfortunately, this Raptor doesn't do stealth. It also seems to needlessly drag the game on even longer as you are forced to move at a snail's pace.I am thinking this game would have been better off being a Doom 3 clone than making you walk around all over the place. A missed opportunity. "

+ Interesting concept+ Beautiful graphics + Can be played in idyllic black-and-white - or normal color rich setting+ Gives a few good shivers+ The arsenal of 17th centuary + Fair price- Story is predictable and dry- Very simple action, which gets repeative too quick- Horror grows wearyBetrayer develeopment team ""Blackpowder Games"" is formed from veteran devs of Monolith Studios which is behind legendary games No One Leaves Forever and F.E.A.R. The game settles itself 1600s Virginian coast at the time of colonization, which is not too often seen in fps titles. The main character is nameless, presumably english captain and only survivor of sunken ship. The game doesn't spend too much time with more enlighten intro, but lets player jump into boots of this lonely seaman straight away.At the very beggining it comes clear that something has gone terribly wrong with both the english and the spanish settlements on the neighbourhood. Only friendly person with whom protogonist begins to cope is mysterious lady dressed in red. Betrayer merits highly on visual level - graphical desing is astonashing. I really loved how wind waved the trees and I could see every sprig shivering in gallantic spruces. The immersion is fulfilled because there is no background music and you can literally hear the wind blowing. I also loved how the color scheme could be set from full color -setting to default which shows only red colors and leaves everything else black and white.Gameplay in Betrayer works like in any typical fps. While the weapon arsenal is unusual and exotic I found fighting too simple. The enemy AI is not worst possible, but majority of melee enemies just rush at you from long distance which makes it easy to take them down with bow or gun depending on hostiles' strenght. While the gunpowder doesn't grow in trees I had no difficulties to survive.The game's biggest advandage lies in its horror feature and I admit having rather unconfortable moments when wandering in wilderness in night time/mode. The enemies lurking in there are more gruesome and surely got me scared a couple of times. However like in other action horror hybrids it is easy to get used to these dangers. Any boogieman or -woman can be killed and thus usually every new type of enemy may get one scared only a couple of times before killing them becomes a routine.If I could give this rating somewhere between good and bad I did. Betrayer has some features like already mentioned colour settings which I would gladly see in other games too. On the other hand either fighting nor freightning features last long enough which makes gameplay to flatten much too quick and even the story sorted out to be medicore after promising start.Eventually it is a price tag which lift's my thumb up - even higher if it's on sale.

But once you play it again, the next thing you know, you're addicted.Betrayer is a very original, immersive and intense game. All the intensity, quests, and details always want you to play more. 9/10 game.Strongly reccomended.			"

												At first glance, Betrayer looks pretty awesome. The first hour or so, it was pretty entertaining. The graphics are stark, morose and creepy (very befitting the story). The story and setting start out very compelling. The soundtrack is subtle. The gameplay relies on stealth-based combat.Unfortunately, most of this begins to wear thin the more you play. The graphics eventually become a strain on the eyes, as you try to squint and find a flash of red in the repetative black and white landscape (which can be confusing, as the enemies are usually red, but so are certain small plants/flowers). The soundtrack becomes dull, as all you hear is the sound of the wind and the odd growl from the monsters roaming the map. The combat is repetative and boring, widly going from one-shot easy kills to mobs that kill you in a few hits. The weapons are limited to bow, crossbow, pistol, musket, rifle and melee (with sub-weapons like tomahawk and bomb), but are very clunky to use (rotating between them should be smooth, but turns out awkward and sometimes doesn't work at all) and the variety within said weapons is small. The gameplay gets boring, very fast.The setting gets dull as you notice there is very little difference between the zones. Trees, long grass, and the odd small fort/camp. The stealth mechanic is pretty bad, as you are caught between walking (the enemies see you easily), running (the enemies see you very easily) and sneaking (the enemies shouldn't see you, but mostly do unless you're at a far distance).Overall, it felt like this could have been a great game, but just missed its mark.

												Some games click with you immediately. Others you have to warm up to. Honestly, Betrayer was a cold fish the first time I played it. It was slow, it was repetitive, and it just wasn't something I felt like spending time on. But I put in the time, and it didn't take long before I started getting to the meat beneath the tough exterior.You awaken on a beach near a fort in the New World to find the place deserted and bestial conquistadors roaming the countryside. Your only friends are a mysterious lady in red, an equally mysterious merchant, and the sundry spirits haunting the fort and the wilderness. The game is assembled as an open-world mystery, where you are free to explore the VERY expansive map in search of answers, clues, trinkets, and gear scattered about. There's a great deal of walking to be done across the gorgeous environments, but there's a very handy and well-implemented fast travel system that cuts out some of the tedium.There are a few kinds of foes to face as you explore, and care must be taken in handling them. It's an FPS with a major, MAJOR emphasis on stealth and intelligent approaches to fights. Enemies have basically the same field of vision as you do and will spot you from across fields and valleys. They're just as fast and just as wily about getting hit, and your weapons are limited in their utility. However, shadows and underbrush can hide your approach, gusts of wind can muffle your footsteps, and headshots kill far more effectively. Your bow will be your best friend for much of the game, but the flintlock pistols and muskets have their uses in dispatching single enemies efficiently. You also get a one-hit kill tomahawk with limited range and explosives for when you're feeling overwhelmed. Combat is an involved experience and can get a little repetitive when you really want to get somewhere, but mastering it is a rewarding experience.The story is intriguing and should keep you moving forward to uncover more and more secrets about the mysterious world you find yourself in. Characters are well-written and there's a very useful journal which holds all your clues and profiles and investigations. There are plenty of items to find, including plot items, interesting trinkets, and equippable gear that improves your abilities. You'll also be helped along by some clever systems like listening for ghostly echoes to point you to places of interest. The sound design is excellent and important, so make sure you have good directional speakers or headphones for this one.Above all, the atmosphere is top-notch. It's desolate and confounding despite the simple setting, and the graphics push it even further (and can be completely reconfigured, including playing in color, if you don't like them). Betrayer is not a hard game to play but it can be hard to get into, the way it marries open-world exploration and low-tech combat. It risks becoming repetitive at times, but it is most definitely worth experiencing.			"

												I had been anticipating this game since I first heard of it and I was not disappointed.Betrayer is a perfect example of how less can be more sometimes, who minimalism can really work in favor of a game. The spooky and somber atmosphere with its natural desaturated visuals (which can be changed in the options, but you really should at least play SOME of the game like this) ends up being very engaging. The game lacks any kind of voice acting, favoring solely text, and even music is absent from the game. Instead your soundtrack is the noises of the wildlife around you (birds and insects), the rustling of wind through grass and trees, and your own footsteps. The crisp clearness of sound makes even the sound effects stand out, the sound of an arrow shaft being drawn across the bow limb or filling the musket chamber with gunpowder... every sound is painstakingly focused as sound is the primary focus of this game. You'll have to use sound to locate your enemies, as well as extra items like treasure chests and journal pages.Hunting down final collectibles in the end can get a bit tedious (namely the chests when they become far less useful to you) and most areas look very similar, if not identical, but can be easily overlooked. Even the terms of story take a more subdued approach, filled in with the journal pages you find (amongst other things that I won't spoil for you).Betrayer is not a run-and-gun sort of action game and typically requires more stealth approaches and a more reserved style of play, so if you like to take things slowly, the game will suit you perfectly.Overall, I rate Betrayer an 8.5/10. The beautiful sound effects and impressive visuas far outweigh any negatives.			"

												TL;DR: A moderately spooky FPS with no puzzles, a bloated narrative, and tons of backtracking. Buy it on sale if you like chores and nonsensical conclusions to unengaging stories.A tad harsh, perhaps. The game isn't entirely devoid of fun, after all. The combat and weapons are entirely serviceable, and the environments can be quite pretty.The game starts off pretty well, too, with a setting somewhat uncommon to games (Early seventeenth-century America,) a sense of dread, and a large area to explore.Your character (Unnamed) starts the game washed  ashore with no memory of who he is or what he was doing, aside from sailing on a doomed ship. Finding these things out is your earliest motivation as a player. You will not find these things out.Upon meeting the only other living character in the game, you will find a map detailing the precise location of every item in the game, as well as an item which will allow you to hear spooky sounds which lead you to anything important not on the map. Suddenly, you are no longer exploring a vast and haunted forest, but running errands from point A to point B.The first enemies you encounter in the game are red-eyed monsters in conquistador armor. They're fast enough to outpace you, should you be spotted, and strong enough to kill you in a few hits. And you will be spotted, more often than not, as their senses are keen. Their armor can occasionally deflect the arrows from your bow, the only weapon you have at the beginning of the game. Obviously, engaging them in combat is a bad idea. You are encouraged to sneak around them, and give them a wide berth. This is the best part of the whole game. The animalistic sound these things make when they spot you is probably one of the more memorable ""Oh,♥♥♥♥♥♥"" moments in recent memory. Fantastic.It doesn't last. You will very quickly find a small arsenal for yourself in these woods. Within the first hour of the game I had two primitive firearms and a tomahawk, with which I tore through these poor saps like wet tissue paper.Stronger enemies did eventually appear, yes, but not before I had the equipment to eviscerate them. The remainder of the game is spent with more of a hope for danger than a sense of it.Enemy design is nice enough. A zombie conquistador here, a skeleton with red eyes there. Nothing to write home about overall... with one exception. I will admit to a great appreciation for one late-game enemy design. A ghost, made up of a thick black swarm of insects with two long, skeletal hands and a silver skull floating over them. I love that thing.I mean, you can kill it in one hit, but it certainly looks cool!So, now that we've established that the enemies won't be much to fear, where else can we get our horror fix here? Well... nowhere, really. Not in the ""I'm afraid of this thing"" or the ""Please get me out of here"" ways, anyway. Your character's goal in the game, the chore list I mentioned earlier, is to find the remains of settlers around the forest, find clues as to how they died, and bring their spirits closure. Now that I've typed that out, I realize that it sounds pretty flipping sweet. Sadly, it's not. It's excrutiatingly boring.Every mystery is solved by following your map to every item and ghost listed on it, and every spirit put to rest in a  brief dialogue tree. It's somewhat interesting at first, but by the end every ghost's story blends together, and their characterization so thin that I could not relate or sympathize with them. ""Yes, yes, you were a terrible murderer♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and/or tragic murder victim♥♥♥♥♥♥victim, I'm sure your passing was very sad. Now, hurry your♥♥♥♥♥up to the great beyond, I've things to do."" And, yes, that's where the game's horror lays, with much♥♥♥♥♥♥ murder, and betrayal. It wears quickly.Each ghost's story ties to others in their section of the forest, and each section's story ties into the greater plot. Which is great, on paper. Sadly, writing the plot on to paper would result in a page primarily composed of fluff, with maybe a paragraph of interest and a quick nonsensical sentence to wrap it up. So many ghosts end up playing such small roles in the story that you're left only to wonder why so much of the game was dedicated to them. Entire sections of the game could have been cut, and I'd only have been thankful it took less of my time.The ending has quite the twist, too! The twist is that there is no ending.And no, not in a Twilight Zone-style ""Eternal personal Hell"" way, either. The game has no ending.			"

												I had taken interest in Betrayer a few years back but only now did I end up picking it up and playing it.Sadly, the gameplay quickly proved to be very repetitive, the loop was go around the map collecting items, then do the same in the otherword (a sort of ghost dimension) and finally talk to characters about said items to move on to the next area, were we'd do it all over again.From the forums I learned that only in the current patch (1.9) did the items become marked on the map, before requiring the use of a listen mechanic (which I never used) to find said items. I honestly don’t know if the listen mechanic would have made the game better or simply more frustrating having to cross the large maps constantly pressing the listen key to find the items.Combat felt frustrating and broken, perhaps it was my poor skill but my shots seemed to always graze the enemies without hitting them, stealth was no better as I’d hear enemies enrage and run straight at me before I’d even seen them or while I was trying to sneak, even worse every enemy had a ranged attack with undodgeable projectiles combined with every weapon having a long reload time and even a chance to glance doing zero damage made it painful to fight long group of enemies, making pikaboo and AI exploiting tactics the default strategies, that is until I found melee.When combining the melee attack with a few of the items that gave it bonus damage made it 1 shot kill practically every enemy in the game, so for over half of my time in Betrayer combat simply revolved around me running from enemy to enemy to melee hit them before they had time to shoot their ranged attack which made all the weapon progression in the game totally irrelevant.Still, I would have been willing to forgive these shortcomings had the story gripped me from the start and motivated me through until the end, but alas it did not. Every new character I met felt like the previous one, down to how their lines were written making them devoid of any kind of personality, I have almost completed the game but feel little interest to return to it to see it’s conclusion which is really the biggest fault I could put on the game.I wished I had better things to say about the game, I felt it had  a lot of potential, perhaps with some more polish on the combat system and a revision on the writing it would have been a game I would recommend. But as it is, I’m afraid I’d have to suggest that you spend your time elsewhere.			"

												Ah, betrayer. I just don't know what to say about this one. I love the visuals of this game, and shooting things is fun at first, but the novelty wears off rather fast. I like the visuals where everything is either black or white, or saturated with color. Sadly, this game feels like a huge fetch quest, forcing you to collect random items scattered all over the map while fighting enemies here and there. The concept is quite interesting, and I love the visuals, but the gameplay is dull, and I feel like I struggled a lot to get  through this game. The execution was kinda poor. Which is sad, this looks like it had potential.I'm kinda neutral on this one. I want to recommend it, but personally, I didn't enjoy it. I know there are a few persons out there who will, though.

												Do yourself a BIG favor. Do you see that 'add to cart' button? Yeah, that button. Now click on it and start throwing money at your screen. Betrayer is so polished, that I could have sworn that I found some rags and a mop bucket somewhere on one of the levels. From the opening splash screen I just knew that the quality would be superb - and I wasn't wrong. The user interface is simple, elegant, and sublime - it all just works, and yes Virginia, there IS an FOV slider (goes up to a perfect 110).(There is enough info here on the storepage to where I feel that adding anything else is unnecessary).This is perhaps my finest purchase on Steam in a looong time, and I think you will agree with me if you give it a chance.

												Betrayer relies way to much on collectables and text with ghosts and npcs to try to tell a story, That already rings alarm bells, first of all you've already forced the player into a collecting chore. Nobody buys a game just to collect items.The game has 7 areas, and in each area you just collect, collect & collect, to progress through the game you need to get rid of corruption by fighting ""A"" wave of monsters and there's usually only about 5-6 minimum,(you do this about 3-4 per areas) not that difficult. To get the ending everything must be done expect for collecting loot from chests, That means a lot of backtracking.You get access to a shop which you can purchase various items such as crossbows,shortbows,longbows,muskets,pistols and these stat boosters, you can hold up to three weapons and three stat boosters but to be honest some of the stat boosters do jack sh!t I think the only two decent ones I came across were the reload 20% and 200% melee damage.I think this could have been a better game it was executed pretty poorly, and i cant really call it a horror game as well since its not at all scary, its got a spooky atmosphere to it but that's about it.

												I started playing this game not knowing what I was getting myself into. I just saw the video on the Steam store page and figured it was worth a try. I'm really happy that I decided to get it. All in all it is a rather solid game. What got me interested were two things. I thought it looked amazing and I liked the idea of using the wind. I wasn't disappointed with how the game looked (especially when I maxed out the settings). It was so immersive to just wander around the different settings and marvel at how pretty it all was. The windwas more enjoyable on the asthetics side of things. As far as using it for stealth it was really only handy when I was going for the backstabber trophy. Beyond that I just did everything I could to keep my arrows on the mark. The plot was interesting too. I like that I needed to piece everything together. This game doesn't do any hand holding, and that was very appreciated on my end. It helped me feel more like I was exploring a new world, rather than feeling like I was being shown a new world. I will say though, that if you aren't the type to dig into every single nook and cranny and pick up everything in this game, EVERYTHING, then the plot could end up feeling more shallow.There is a draw back to the game though. The combat is pretty bad. The enemies are dumb as bricks, and that might be offensive to the bricks. Once you figure out where they usually are on each map, and what the different sounds mean, the game becomes much easier. For most of the game this aspect didn't really detract from my experience too much (well except when I looked a conquistador in the face, they just look weird). It really didn't become a chore until I started going for the combat achievements. Then this game became a slog. All because the enemies aren't interesting at all. If they could figure out a way to fix that this game would be amazing.If you're like me and you love games that let you explore this is a very good one. If you want a game that you can crank up to max settings and just be in awe of how pretty it all is (I recommend playing in color to get the full enjoyment) then this is the game for you. If you're looking for something that hands the plot to you in a direct manner, or if you're looking for solid combat, this is definitely not the game for you.			"

												I'm a big fat baby when it comes to scary games and movies. I'm not sure how I made it through this one. Maybe the art and play style were fun enough to overcome the scary? I doubt it, because I remember quite a few times I got spooked, jolted in shock, or had my heart racing from anticipation. Most likely I was able to make it, because the idea of sneaking-out-in-the-open seemed a bit more fun than your normal sneaking-in-rooms type of game. The idea that you should walk while the wind was gusting to mask your foot steps was also a most likely reason. The game does a good job of holding your hand halfway through the first level, but then drops you in a pit surrounded by ravenous beasts. And I do not mean that in a fun way. Perhaps I was not smart enough or maybe I didn't care enough to read every clue, but I couldn't figure out a lot of what I was supposed to do to free all of the souls. Most of them I got, but some of them I had to look online at YouTube videos or guides on where things were. You have to explore each level with a fine tooth comb in both the day time and night time. Then after you find a lost soul, talk to them back to the base, then go back to any previous clues you may of found and you might see a wraith near where they died and where you found a clue to their death. Then after that go back to the lost soul at base, then find another clue. Wash and repeat. I wouldn't of minded the running around chores since the game's atmosphere and environment are fun to run around, but not knowing where to go or not being able to mark anything on your map as a reminder made completing this game impossible for me without the aid of a good guide or two already posted on the steam community and a few YouTube videos.That being said, if you don't mind having to look up things while you play, I recommend playing this game. It was a lot of fun. I still have to go back for the kill 1000 enemies and stealth-kill 200 enemies achievements.			"

												I wasn't sure what to make of Betrayer when I first saw an advertisement for it a few months ago...a first-person action/adventure game set in the 1600's and rendered in a heavily contrasted, black and white environment similar in style to the wood etchings of the time period? Sounded interesting in the very least. The trailer was convincing too but it was still in Early Access on Steam and I wasn't in a pay-to-test mood so I put it on my Steam wishlist and promptly forgot about it.The Steam Summer Sale, 2014 re-acquainted me with this title and I was thrilled to pick it up for a mere $5.00 via the digital distributor. I dove into it immediately and became obsessed...'I awoke, washed up on shore as the waves lapped the stone-strewn beach around me. I immediately realized I must have sustained a head injury during the storm that tossed my ship against the rocks for I was color-blind! Dizzy, my head aching, I pulled myself from the sandy, salty froth that ebbed and flowed around me. I lurched to my feet and stumbled over to a nearby crate, still wobbly from my ordeal and headsore, shielding my eyes from spray of brine and piercing rays of sunlight alike.Armed with a sturdy tomahawk and an old longbow I stumbled through the surreal landscape my damaged eyes showed me, making my way towards Fort Henry, the coastal stronghold for the colonies I was sent to investigate for the Crown...'Indie developer Blackpowder Games has crafted an exquisite experience for anyone willing to brave the chiaroscuro the game initially presents to the player. The familiar control scheme and minimalistic interface become immersive strengths as the artistic design seemlessly meshes with the twitchy, responsiveness of the Unreal Engine, drawing you in with austere beauty and heart-pounding action alike. To top it off the story is very well done and relayed to the player through various elements ranging from visual clues to conversations with ghosts.After a while I got sick of the black and white motif and was pleasantly surprised to find the in-game visual options which allowed me to colorize the graphics and adjust contrast elements. Game developers often cut costs on graphics by skimping on texture quality and dressing their graphics in post-processing effects that cover up glaring flaws. This is NOT the case with Blackpowder Games and the colorized textures are very detailed, even up close.The sound design is also very well done and positional audio is relied upon often for clues and direction in the large, woodland areas that lend themselves to becoming lost in. Furthermore, I encountered no game-breaking bugs and the most annoying glitch I encountered was the graphical artifacting and tearing I found, which was mostly mollified via tweaking video settings.However immersive and compelling the game elements are, Betrayal has some negative aspects depending upon individual preferences. Weapons and the enemies you fight with them are very limited and there is not a huge variety of anything in the game world. The player is locked into the FPS perspective and there is no ability to zoom out with the camera, which can be tough on people who get motion sickness from such experiences. The combat is very twitchy and dodging enemy fire is important to survival thus hand-eye coordination is paramount to success in Betrayal. The in-game map is unmarkable and there is no mini-map overlay so keeping track of places of interest and your relative position in an area can be tedious.In summary, Betrayer is an excellent first effort from Blackpowder Games. It's a great example of what talented game developers can do with a limited budget and a time-tested game engine. Minimalism has been played to great strength in this title, resulting in an immersive experience populated by tragic tales, beautiful environments, thrilling combat, and expertly designed mechanics. A satisfying romp for any fan of FPS action/adventure games.			"

												I started playing this game not knowing what I was getting myself into. I just saw the video on the Steam store page and figured it was worth a try. I'm really happy that I decided to get it. All in all it is a rather solid game. What got me interested were two things. I thought it looked amazing and I liked the idea of using the wind. I wasn't disappointed with how the game looked (especially when I maxed out the settings). It was so immersive to just wander around the different settings and marvel at how pretty it all was. The windwas more enjoyable on the asthetics side of things. As far as using it for stealth it was really only handy when I was going for the backstabber trophy. Beyond that I just did everything I could to keep my arrows on the mark. The plot was interesting too. I like that I needed to piece everything together. This game doesn't do any hand holding, and that was very appreciated on my end. It helped me feel more like I was exploring a new world, rather than feeling like I was being shown a new world. I will say though, that if you aren't the type to dig into every single nook and cranny and pick up everything in this game, EVERYTHING, then the plot could end up feeling more shallow.There is a draw back to the game though. The combat is pretty bad. The enemies are dumb as bricks, and that might be offensive to the bricks. Once you figure out where they usually are on each map, and what the different sounds mean, the game becomes much easier. For most of the game this aspect didn't really detract from my experience too much (well except when I looked a conquistador in the face, they just look weird). It really didn't become a chore until I started going for the combat achievements. Then this game became a slog. All because the enemies aren't interesting at all. If they could figure out a way to fix that this game would be amazing.If you're like me and you love games that let you explore this is a very good one. If you want a game that you can crank up to max settings and just be in awe of how pretty it all is (I recommend playing in color to get the full enjoyment) then this is the game for you. If you're looking for something that hands the plot to you in a direct manner, or if you're looking for solid combat, this is definitely not the game for you.			"

												I'm a big fat baby when it comes to scary games and movies. I'm not sure how I made it through this one. Maybe the art and play style were fun enough to overcome the scary? I doubt it, because I remember quite a few times I got spooked, jolted in shock, or had my heart racing from anticipation. Most likely I was able to make it, because the idea of sneaking-out-in-the-open seemed a bit more fun than your normal sneaking-in-rooms type of game. The idea that you should walk while the wind was gusting to mask your foot steps was also a most likely reason. The game does a good job of holding your hand halfway through the first level, but then drops you in a pit surrounded by ravenous beasts. And I do not mean that in a fun way. Perhaps I was not smart enough or maybe I didn't care enough to read every clue, but I couldn't figure out a lot of what I was supposed to do to free all of the souls. Most of them I got, but some of them I had to look online at YouTube videos or guides on where things were. You have to explore each level with a fine tooth comb in both the day time and night time. Then after you find a lost soul, talk to them back to the base, then go back to any previous clues you may of found and you might see a wraith near where they died and where you found a clue to their death. Then after that go back to the lost soul at base, then find another clue. Wash and repeat. I wouldn't of minded the running around chores since the game's atmosphere and environment are fun to run around, but not knowing where to go or not being able to mark anything on your map as a reminder made completing this game impossible for me without the aid of a good guide or two already posted on the steam community and a few YouTube videos.That being said, if you don't mind having to look up things while you play, I recommend playing this game. It was a lot of fun. I still have to go back for the kill 1000 enemies and stealth-kill 200 enemies achievements.			"

												dece old school style fps, 8hr to complete. a little on the long side maybe.you're (most likely) shipwrecked on a once habitated, now grim and desolate island, littered with abandoned villages and roaming ghouls and undead conquistadors etc. walk around, avoid or kill the undead and discover clues about the now deceased former occupants - all succumbing to extremely grim ends.Then find the ability to visit the spirit world. speak to these occupants first hand and cross reference stories between them - developing a kind of rashomon style detective story. help these wandering spectres get their♥♥♥♥♥♥straight. unfortunately i really couldn't be ♥♥♥♥ed to read more than a couple of these stories and skimming over them they all tell the same♥♥♥♥♥♥""this person was stabbed♥♥♥♥♥♥♥beaten/impaled by this person who then killed himself and his daughter'. I didn't really have a reason to care about these ghosts who all used identical models and simply used text to communicate. i just didn't find a reason to care. however, even skimming contributes to the atmosphere and i think atmosphere and a broad understanding of the story is all you need to enjoy it.forunately combat is super satisfying. old school fps mechanics with 1700s style weapons; bows, crossbows, pistols muskets that you gradually improve over the course of the game, as well as charms that boost your abilities (speed, attack, defense, reload speed etc). stealth exists and is pretty useful in early game. you find your role moving between hunter and survivor as you move through the areas (about 6 open areas with fast travel / loading screens between). final boss battle is challenging but fun af. which is what i want.style is cool. hand drawn maps are great, ui is nice to use. the red/greyscale drew me in initially but are just kind of ok. there's also a curious option to use full colour, as if they couldn't decide what to do. cool game, not amazing. 6/10? 6.5/10?

												Betrayer is both bleak and beautiful - with a striking style that is often its first talking point. Thankfully, those who would find the blatant visuals unappealing (or sore on the eyes) can always disable its monochromatic look (at least in the 'normal world') and enjoy the lush and vibrant visuals in full colour - for a time.Blending stealth-shooter with paranormal detective work, the game flits between secret-searching exploration and dismal (often very eerie) otherworldly exorcisms - the victims of which all have well written and intriguing (albeit grisly) tales of woes to tell.While the exploration and occasional combat are a treat, the game does eventually become somewhat tedious as it rarely deviates from what it has offered to you from the early stages - though on the flip-side, given the game itself is quite short, this will only effect those unwilling (or unable) to reach the conclusion quickly.A nice addition is the high reliance on sound, where listening through the ambience may give a forwarning of the dangers ahead that you may not be able to currently see. In the otherworld, your travels will be paved by listening to the wails of the dead, leading you to those you need to speak with - that is, if you're not fleeing for your life from vicious skeleton armies and floating skull-headed thieves who don't appreciate your living presence.Overall, the game is quite enjoyable and well worth playing despite being a short, slightly repetitive affair, with an ending leaving things up in the air. I'd certainly welcome a sequel, provided it expands on the foundations to make a more varied experience.Thumbs up!			"

												I'm giving Betrayer a recommendation, but it's a shaky recommendation. The game is beautiful and plays well, but it is not without faults. The gameplay gets pretty repetitive pretty quickly. That said, I never felt bored playing it. It's a fun game of exploration and sneaky fps fighting. The story and mood it sets is really interesting, but I hope you don't mind reading.Also, I recommend messing with the color settings. Everything is black and white by default, which helps the mood of the game, but the world is just too pretty to play without color. There are ""night-time"" sections that transform the world into a spooky black and white forest anyways, so you don't miss out too much as far as theme is concerned.This game is not for everyone, but if you think you'd enjoy a spooky exploratory fps then try it out! You definitely could do worse.			"

												It's got conquistadors that sound like bears, flaming guys that sound like wolves, skeletons that sound like... well, skeletons, ghosts, corruption, bells, bells, bells, THE CONSTANT RINGING OF BELLS!But anyway, I haven't beaten the game, and personally I hope the end is still another 10 or so hours off, as I am enjoying the game so much. The game looks and sounds beautiful, using red highlights and audio that helps draw your eye to important things, such as enemies or treasure. And the use of the whispers in the wind to find key objects I feel is an amazing touch.I play with no HUD, on the hardest difficulty, so my experience may differ from someone who plays it in a more standard way, but the reliance on sound and a keen eye adds much to my enjoyment.The combat relies a lot on stealth, as once you enter open combat, a single weak enemy can kill you easily, so you always have to be careful, and cannot just yolo your way around.In the end, my final verdict is: I have no idea what I'm doing, I'm dying repeatedly, I hear the bell ringing in my ears while I sleep, and I love this game! Go buy it!			"

												A fun departure from the norm. A quirky little game that takes a lot from different genres and makes it work, with a cool visual style. Combat is clunky, stealth is iffy,  and the difficulty curve is all over the place at times, but it is fun and tense to explore. There was a lot of the quest mechanics that I didn't really understand until late in the game, but the lack of handholding ended up being a refreshing change. Clues and notes that I collected mechanically at the outset slowly coalesced into interesting, tragic stories towards the end. Unfortunately, controller support is an obvious afterthought. While it's okay ingame, navigating the menus without a mouse can be incredibly frustrating. Even so, worth a look, and a no-brainer at sale prices.			"

												Interesting game... CONS: - Hard to stay motivated; feels more ""empty"" than open- Once you figure out how to down the enemies, it's not hard to do (no challenge)- Not digging the ""alternate world"" thing so much... it's cool, but it makes it kind of confusing, depending on what your goal is.PROS:- Brilliant visuals; the contrast between black and white, and eye-popping scarlet reds is amazing.- Gameplay mechanics are intuitive- Satisfying immersion within the world- Interesting things to discover...I won't ramble with this review, as I want to keep this short.Betrayer is amazing visually, but some may find it suffers from an acute case of ""FarCry2-itis"". If it's on sale, sure, pick it up!Don't recommend for people who expect fast-pacing and instant gratification.			"

												The game was great from the beginning to the end, although backtracking can be a PAIN most of the time, it was still fun to do, given the enviroment, the sound design and everything there is to it. Those parts are perfect. As is the combat, although it ain't ""realistic"" per say, it's also not complete fantasy, and takes a bit of punishment to learn how to bow your way properly, shooting and stealthily. The story asks a lot of questions, of which will keep you going forward, it also answers then through your own investigations, and you feel a lot satisfied when you're done discovering what was hidden.The biggest flaw of it is the emptiness, there really ain't much to be done, and there will be a point where you will ask yourself ""why am I running again?"", because that's basically all you do 80% of the game.But... I couldn't finish it, a bug at the very end wouldn't let me through, as simply, nothing happened. I tried googling, looking at walthroughs, rewinding my steps, nothing worked. Had to see the ending through a vid, wasn't disappointed with it though.So if I recommend it or not: well the game is easily a 7/10 IF it works for you. For me it was a lot disappointing to not be able to play the ending. Overall: Buy it on a sale so you won't be so mad.			"

												In betwixt the barrage of dime-a-dozen garbage titles on steam; Minecraft rip offs, jumpscare games, and completely broken messes lies Betrayer.Betrayer is an atmospheric FPS explorative survival game and it's god...damn...good...The game starts off with you on a beach after a shipwreck, that's literally how it starts. What entails are either two things depending on how you play: A mystery about this strange land you find yourself on, or a battle for survival in this desolant nightmare. It all depends on how interested you want to get.Regardless, you will have to try and stay alive either way. Among this beautiful black and white landscape, lay ahead skeletons, coated in clear red. They will kill you. And they will kill you fast.There is no directed object in the game, just explore and stay alive, and by god is this ever done well.It's gorgeous, ominous, and is completely unique. "

												For a first person shooter this game offers so much character. Notes left scattered among the island will tell the compelling stories of a place gone dead The battles are worth every long bow arrow, running for health because you are often overtaken. The sound effects reminds me of real rual areas, not some fantasy made up fairy tale land. The ""ping"" from deflective armour is also really cool. The unreal 3 engine done right very very optimised. It could have been one of best recent adventure games imo. Shy of just some polishing on it's ""searching"" mechanic im profusely spamming the (x) button. Battles however iconic could have shown damage and more varied enemies. Theres much more to this game, but those are mostly my only quirks apart from the abrupt ending. Again almost perfect fps that is totally unique and got mediocre reviews. Another instant sequal in the dust :(HIGHY RECOMMENDED			"

												Betrayer is an atmospheric survival horror / exploration game. The exploration and survival combination is nice. It doesn't suffer from the ""I shouldn't explore anywhere I don't have to because I'll run out of matches/batteries/bullets"" annoyance of most survival horror games. The visuals are interesting, the high contrast black and white makes it difficult to pick out enemies at a distance. The story is intriguing as you uncover it through clues. The only downside is that it can get fairly repetitive. I'd recommend grabbing Betrayer, although not at $20, wait for a sale.			"

												Betrayer, a name which will forever conjure forth images of enraged spirits, the haunted screams of a corrupted Totem Pole, and so many deaths by Musket - all of which were due to my own lack of paying attention. To be short, sweet, and simple, the game is a masterpiece of ambient noise and well-thought quests which leave me fighting off sleep in a desperate attempt to discover just how far things went South before I, too, meet the fate of many a Native , colonist, and Spaniard. This speaks volume considering it is Early Access. Buy this game, contribute, and be taken away into a mystery to rival the greats.			"

												Betrayer is full of betrayals (as one might expect), most of which are discovered in the course of playing through this intriguingly visual mystery first person adventure stealth shooter all the way to the end. You awaken, shipwrecked on the shore of pre-colonial North America, the world around you rendered in vivid black and white with bare highlights of red. This art design decision works well to frame the story, but also describes the almost exclusively binary decisions you'll have to make in the game. You can change the visual settings if you wish, but I recommend playing at least once with the original settings.Walking to the British colony to which you were traveling, you'll encounter hostile Spanish troops, and maybe catch a fleeting glimpse of the local natives who reportedly still populate this quiet land. There are also, other... things. Guttural sounds, glimpses through the underbrush. Something here is displeased at your presence. Best to keep moving.Overall, the story is fairly muted within the gameplay. You can have frequent conversations with game characters, who offer cryptic clues to the story. Combat with the limited period weaponry is the same throughout the game, although you can find/buy better versions. A few useful items you discover allow you to sense things others cannot, almost mystically.A HUD compass at the top middle of the screen shows your heading and any discovered locations in the current region. You can use a map to fast travel among them as well. This is very helpful as the game regions are all open and explorable. Many additional details can be found if you explore outside the beaten paths.The sound design is excellent, as it must be since a crucial game mechanic relies on listening. To find clues, stop and use the “listen” key (once you've acquired the item that let's you hear things that others cannot).When you “listen”, if there is anything to be heard, you'll hear a low sound from the direction of undiscovered items. On the compass' right and left edges will appear guides indicating if the sound is stronger from your right or from your left. It will make sense when you use it.It can be easy to lose track of your purpose, but these are three things you should remember:1 - Your journal is pretty thorough. Check it frequently.2 - You can “listen” for locations of characters and hidden objects. This is crucial to resolving the story.3 - You can ring the village bell to move from the daylight world to a world of twilight, each world having its own clues and mysteries, most of which all tie well together in the end.The game's pace is deliberately slow and combat is infrequent unless you're careless. When you hear the howl of an enemy who has just discovered you, there are a few frantic moments as you look around trying to see from which direction the threat is approaching. But that's about the height of “excitement” in this wonderfully atmospheric game. I took a chance on this game because it offered a fresh look, and it makes for an enjoyable few hours to pull the story bits together until the final betrayal. I'm glad I did as it's well worth trying.			"

												I wasn't sure what to make of Betrayer when I first saw an advertisement for it a few months ago...a first-person action/adventure game set in the 1600's and rendered in a heavily contrasted, black and white environment similar in style to the wood etchings of the time period? Sounded interesting in the very least. The trailer was convincing too but it was still in Early Access on Steam and I wasn't in a pay-to-test mood so I put it on my Steam wishlist and promptly forgot about it.The Steam Summer Sale, 2014 re-acquainted me with this title and I was thrilled to pick it up for a mere $5.00 via the digital distributor. I dove into it immediately and became obsessed...'I awoke, washed up on shore as the waves lapped the stone-strewn beach around me. I immediately realized I must have sustained a head injury during the storm that tossed my ship against the rocks for I was color-blind! Dizzy, my head aching, I pulled myself from the sandy, salty froth that ebbed and flowed around me. I lurched to my feet and stumbled over to a nearby crate, still wobbly from my ordeal and headsore, shielding my eyes from spray of brine and piercing rays of sunlight alike.Armed with a sturdy tomahawk and an old longbow I stumbled through the surreal landscape my damaged eyes showed me, making my way towards Fort Henry, the coastal stronghold for the colonies I was sent to investigate for the Crown...'Indie developer Blackpowder Games has crafted an exquisite experience for anyone willing to brave the chiaroscuro the game initially presents to the player. The familiar control scheme and minimalistic interface become immersive strengths as the artistic design seemlessly meshes with the twitchy, responsiveness of the Unreal Engine, drawing you in with austere beauty and heart-pounding action alike. To top it off the story is very well done and relayed to the player through various elements ranging from visual clues to conversations with ghosts.After a while I got sick of the black and white motif and was pleasantly surprised to find the in-game visual options which allowed me to colorize the graphics and adjust contrast elements. Game developers often cut costs on graphics by skimping on texture quality and dressing their graphics in post-processing effects that cover up glaring flaws. This is NOT the case with Blackpowder Games and the colorized textures are very detailed, even up close.The sound design is also very well done and positional audio is relied upon often for clues and direction in the large, woodland areas that lend themselves to becoming lost in. Furthermore, I encountered no game-breaking bugs and the most annoying glitch I encountered was the graphical artifacting and tearing I found, which was mostly mollified via tweaking video settings.However immersive and compelling the game elements are, Betrayal has some negative aspects depending upon individual preferences. Weapons and the enemies you fight with them are very limited and there is not a huge variety of anything in the game world. The player is locked into the FPS perspective and there is no ability to zoom out with the camera, which can be tough on people who get motion sickness from such experiences. The combat is very twitchy and dodging enemy fire is important to survival thus hand-eye coordination is paramount to success in Betrayal. The in-game map is unmarkable and there is no mini-map overlay so keeping track of places of interest and your relative position in an area can be tedious.In summary, Betrayer is an excellent first effort from Blackpowder Games. It's a great example of what talented game developers can do with a limited budget and a time-tested game engine. Minimalism has been played to great strength in this title, resulting in an immersive experience populated by tragic tales, beautiful environments, thrilling combat, and expertly designed mechanics. A satisfying romp for any fan of FPS action/adventure games.			"

This is seriously a great game for its price. I got it on sale for $1 and it gave me about 10 hours of enjoyment. I often find most games boring and tedious and even though this game requires a lot of backtracking and running back and forth, I still found it pretty fun. In contrast I finished 'Rise of Tomb Raider' in about 12 hours and paid about fifty times as much money for the same amount of gameplay as what Betrayer had.Betrayer is very unique. Everything from its colour palette to its mysterious story is something that I have not seen done anywhere before, and to date I haven't played really any game like it. The graphics were great and the game looked pretty amazing in 4K and played far better than I expected. I was really surprised at how well optimised the game is. I turned colour on for my playthrough because I felt that the high contrast and black and white visuals would hurt my eyes after a short period. Roughly half the game is still in black and white however even if you turn back on the colour, and I feel that this was a perfect balance.For the most realistic colour I used the following settings: Dark Intensity (2.8), Light Intensity (1.1), Colour Saturation (1.0). I found these settings delivered the most perfect balance of light and shadows and provided me with a rich stealth experience.It's the year 1604 so expect medieval weapons like bows and surprisingly enough 'guns'. The game is mostly a hide and seek, hunter and stealth styled game. You wake up shipwrecked on a beach and must find clues as to what catastrophe blighted the land.This is a first person stealth game with enemies that are quite unique. I won't go into any detail as to spoil them because finding new and increasingly challenging enemies was very much part of the quality experience that I had.

												Betrayer really surprised me. The graphical style is interesting. Everything mostly appears in black and white, for most of the game, with important things appearing in red. The difficulty isn't extreme but enemies do hit HARD. The quiet nature of the game really adds a level of nervousness to every encounter. Blackpowder games really did a good job with this adventure game. I definitely recommend picking it up.			"

												Before I start, I need to second the other review that suggests adjusting the saturation to make the colors appear. The game is absolutely gorgeous.So where to start... The story telling is pretty amazing. Without spoiling, your goal is to travel through some settlements to find out what happened to everyone. You explore the towns and wilderness to find graves, lost items, and ghosts that each tell a part of an overall story. Some of the stories are sad, some unsettling, and some are horrific. All of them are pretty well written.One cool mechanic the game has, is the second world you enter through the town bells. Ring the bell and jump into the next world where you get to talk to the ghosts of the people who have died to piece together the stories. There are new enemies in this world, and everything is black and white. You go back to the normal world by silencing the bell.There isnt any music, but the game sound is pretty well done as well. You can hear enemies approach, and you hear animals (though you never see those) as well as wind. The ambience in the second world is absolutely creepy.The combat stuck out to me as well. I loved it. The weapons are simple, though varied, and you can ""equip"" three different ones. There are guns, as well as bows, and your mele weapon. Ammo is limited, and if you choose to rely on bows, you can go find your used arrows, or claim them from fallen enemies. In a prolonged fight, you might end up having to dance around picking up arrows as you use them. I loved how missing a shot felt like it actually mattered, as did landing a shot. The enemies, no matter the difficulty, are all fairly strong, and you will probably die at some point. The game has an option for you to drop your items when you die if you like making things even harder.The map also has options to show where all the chests, graves, ghosts, etc are on the map, or lets you hide the locations. I left them all revealed.That also reminds me of an interesting mechanic the game uses. There is an ear you find early on that lets you ""listen"" to find where ghosts are, items, and things of interest. You go into the dark world and ""listen"", then follow the whispery sound. Its like quest tracking through audio, which is great if you dont want to keep checking your map every few seconds to see where to go next.Overall, I would highly recommend it, especially if youre into a more subtle, creepy horror style, or if you just love a great story.

												This game is different than other games. I don't know why. Betrayer has a gloomy climate, filled with riddles. The music is very climate, and sounds in ""other world"" causes me goosebumps. Enemies are not that hard to kill, but it does not make game easy to play. Graphics are amazing (It's unreal engine) but i can not play in sin city mode (Everything is black and white, but enemies and important items are red) because my eyes hurt :D In my opinion this game looks more awesome with normal colors, but playing in black and white style for somrthing like 20 minutes is also a good experience. Betrayer is kinda scary game, but not much. Enemies are interesting and diffrent. I gives this game 8/10 Buy it! Get into this enigmatic world!EDIT: After 2 h of playing this game I have to admit that this game is kinda hard on normal level of difficulty, but it's still fun :D			"

Nice little game for the 5 bucksLongbow is your friend, and also tomahawk with G button,have to pick up again after throwing. Try not to stealth, because its way too hard and sloweasy achievements, last 2 take time as killing 1000 enemies takes 2 playsStory is kind of meh, if you dont like reading a boring dialoge, just skip them.

												Worth it.This game uses muskets and flintlocks better than most. (going so far as to include a ram-rod for the former)The dark and edgy graphic style is matched perfectly by the narrative, but if you prefer your forests more green (i'm lookin' at you skyrim fans) the graphic options allow you to standardize things somewhat.in this game you'll collect clues, and investigate the sordid events around many inhabitants' deaths. the combat however, felt very detached, the damage one takes often happens without any ability to evade, and the reaction your character has correlates in no way to the damage taken. coupled with the instant, and infinite healing available, things often had no repurcussions.the sound design was amazing, and the lack of music constantly playing lead to a more immersive experience, but the stock 'BONK' noise from whack-a-mole whenever a shot would deflect was, albeit Comical as all get-out, but didn't seem to fit.If you're into dark games, stories, or agile women in red, check this out.

""Betrayer is a stealth horror action-adventure played from a first-person perspective. It uses a monochrome art style that Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead described as ""undeniably striking"". The game has no clear missions or markers for quest objectives, aiming to initially perplex players by not providing a defined sense of direction. While progressing, any clues found are meticulously documented in the inventory windows. Similar to The Elder Scrolls series, players can quickly navigate from one location to another by clicking a point-of-interest icon on the game's map."" - Wikipedia page for BetrayerBetrayer has a lot of great things going for it. Its art direction, sound design and world creation are phenomenal. (In my personal opinion) One of my favorite things about this game is the enemy design. While most horror-esque games have the generic zombie, ghost or some mutated person this game has strange but intriguing designs. (aside from the skeletons although they have their own flair to make them their own thing.)The lighting and coloring to this game is great, although I did bump the color up to 0.5 or 1 just to have a dramatic contrast from the normal world to the dark world.One of my only issues with this game is about 30 minutes from the end I became completely lost. This was primarily due to the fact that I was intoxicated and skipping dialogue on accident, but that is beside the point. In all honesty I would give this game a 7.5 or 8/10. Solid indie game.TL;DR: Game is kinda spooky at times but still really good. Sound, music and art are great. Only bad thing I didn’t like was getting lost near the end. 8/10 would buy from Black Powder Games again. "

												I'm a big fat baby when it comes to scary games and movies. I'm not sure how I made it through this one. Maybe the art and play style were fun enough to overcome the scary? I doubt it, because I remember quite a few times I got spooked, jolted in shock, or had my heart racing from anticipation. Most likely I was able to make it, because the idea of sneaking-out-in-the-open seemed a bit more fun than your normal sneaking-in-rooms type of game. The idea that you should walk while the wind was gusting to mask your foot steps was also a most likely reason. The game does a good job of holding your hand halfway through the first level, but then drops you in a pit surrounded by ravenous beasts. And I do not mean that in a fun way. Perhaps I was not smart enough or maybe I didn't care enough to read every clue, but I couldn't figure out a lot of what I was supposed to do to free all of the souls. Most of them I got, but some of them I had to look online at YouTube videos or guides on where things were. You have to explore each level with a fine tooth comb in both the day time and night time. Then after you find a lost soul, talk to them back to the base, then go back to any previous clues you may of found and you might see a wraith near where they died and where you found a clue to their death. Then after that go back to the lost soul at base, then find another clue. Wash and repeat. I wouldn't of minded the running around chores since the game's atmosphere and environment are fun to run around, but not knowing where to go or not being able to mark anything on your map as a reminder made completing this game impossible for me without the aid of a good guide or two already posted on the steam community and a few YouTube videos.That being said, if you don't mind having to look up things while you play, I recommend playing this game. It was a lot of fun. I still have to go back for the kill 1000 enemies and stealth-kill 200 enemies achievements.			"

This is seriously a great game for its price. I got it on sale for $1 and it gave me about 10 hours of enjoyment. I often find most games boring and tedious and even though this game requires a lot of backtracking and running back and forth, I still found it pretty fun. In contrast I finished 'Rise of Tomb Raider' in about 12 hours and paid about fifty times as much money for the same amount of gameplay as what Betrayer had.Betrayer is very unique. Everything from its colour palette to its mysterious story is something that I have not seen done anywhere before, and to date I haven't played really any game like it. The graphics were great and the game looked pretty amazing in 4K and played far better than I expected. I was really surprised at how well optimised the game is. I turned colour on for my playthrough because I felt that the high contrast and black and white visuals would hurt my eyes after a short period. Roughly half the game is still in black and white however even if you turn back on the colour, and I feel that this was a perfect balance.For the most realistic colour I used the following settings: Dark Intensity (2.8), Light Intensity (1.1), Colour Saturation (1.0). I found these settings delivered the most perfect balance of light and shadows and provided me with a rich stealth experience.It's the year 1604 so expect medieval weapons like bows and surprisingly enough 'guns'. The game is mostly a hide and seek, hunter and stealth styled game. You wake up shipwrecked on a beach and must find clues as to what catastrophe blighted the land.This is a first person stealth game with enemies that are quite unique. I won't go into any detail as to spoil them because finding new and increasingly challenging enemies was very much part of the quality experience that I had. Some enemies are really quite creepy and a few particular encounters can be really tough.Graphics: 8/10Gameplay: 8/10Story: 6/10Pacing: 7/10Replay Value: 3/10Music: 2/10Voice Acting: 0/10Bugs: None really that I could findMy only complaints are due to all the running back and forth just to speak to NPCs again after getting an extra clue and also I found that the end-game is non-existent.

												Really great game played the demo awhile back thought it's was alright. Later saw the game was on sale for $0.99 so I thought what the hell, and so it sat in my steam library for about 2 months. Untill the other night, where I was craving a new adventure very badly. There she was shinning brightly through my eyes into my very soul. Booted her on up and never the less I fell in love really quick. Game has an open world feel to it even though there really isn't like a GIANT overworld just mainly open=ended level's where you have to explore and collect while solving the mystery of a young girl, and what happend to this new community that you were set to live in. Don't skimp up the exploring though you will regret it! for the story and survials sake! Shooting things and sneaking around is alot more satisfing than it is at first. Wait until you get the crossbow thats when the stealthy aspect of the game really heats up and makes you feel pretty good about sticking a spaniard in the eye with a bolt or 2. The game really can scare the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you as well and I just don't mean your cheesy jump scares that seem to destroy the naritve that is ""Horror"". But this game is all about atmosphere as it should be and that's what makes a good horror game for me. Your not waiting for the next jump scare to come out and scream in terror becasue you new it was coming but not when. In Betrayer very rarely will you come across a jump scare and it really scare's you because you don't expect it at all. Which is the beauty of this one. The only couple of problems I would have with the game is that it does feel like a collect fest at times some items do not have any real value and you find them to give to the ""Girl in Red"". Don't get me wrong here either though, a lot of the items you find do has value to a lot of the Wraiths you find and try help figure out who they are and what happend to this ""New World"". For a buck though?really you just cannot beat a game of this quality for a dollar. Verdict: 9/10 "

Its a game like dark souls where you are put into a world, and you don't know a single thing.  Additionally, there are very little npcs, and they don't know anything either.  you have to explore the world, and slowly piece things together.			"

												I just finished ""Betrayer"" a couple of days ago and I really enjoyed it.  It's a FPS set in the early 17th century in the New World, has an interesting story and fun gameplay with contemporary weapons that require some skill to manage.  (You can strafe with the hard-hitting musket and pistol, but both have longer reload times than the shortbow, which fires at a more traditional-to-current-shooters semi auto rate)  There are no different difficulty settings, and the game seemed a little overtuned to me since I usually play games on easy these days and enjoy the story, but I had a lot of fun adapting to the challenge.  If any of you decide to play the game, I'd recommend turning on colors.  (By default it's set in black and white, with important objects and enemies having red outlines to them)  While the black and white might seem artsy at first, (and enemies are slightly easier to see with the contrast) it started to give me a headache a couple of hours in, and the game looks really really nice in color.  I set the shader to 8/10, but your mileage may vary.  The game allows you to customize difficulty to a limited degree, with the option of showing all treasure sites on the map or searching for them, and an option for quasi-permadeath where your items stay on your corpse, and you lose everything on your corpse if you die before retrieving it.  (By default you retain items and gold when you die)The game also has a cool day/night system that you can activate by ringing a bell in the settlements you come across.  By day, you face soldiers from another nation in the wilderness, as well as giant spider-beasts.  By night, ghosts and skeletons wander the lands outside of the towns.  You have to complete objectives in both day and night to progress from one area to the next, and the nights are particularly spooky.My only complaints were that the ending was a little meh, and that the game boasted dynamic enemy respawns where when you die, the enemies in the zone respawn in random locations.  The problem was that it didn't work as advertised; there is one outpost where an enemy was outside the gates and charged me literally every time I fast-traveled there.  I made short work of him, but it made me question the game's programming.  Also, the game has limited replayability, although the devs put in Steam achievements to try to encourage players to keep going after the game ended.  (Kill 1000 enemies, etc.)Overall, I really enjoyed the game; it was original, beautiful, fun, and at times scary.  I had more fun playing it than I've had with many AAA titles, and I'd give it a solid 8.5/10.			"

It combines a nice, but partly frightening, atmosphere and subtle storytelling. The game build up a huge mystery arround the character and the world itseld, which supports the gameplay in matter of keeping in touch with the game.

												A very atmospheric arcadey shooter with survival elements and a twist: automatic guns haven't been invented yet. Can get repetitive at some point, but it keeps you going until you answer that one fatal question: ""What the ♥♥♥♥'s going on here?""PROS/CONS+Very atmospheric. Interesting (literally) monochromatic approach adds to that, but it is optional, which is nice.+Gameplay fits the setting AND is fun. I never thought musket firefighting could be thrilling.+Hard, but balanced. 1 to 10 disadvantages eventually become 1 on 1, with progression and adaptation.~~ It is not action packed, nor an horror game. It's something in between.~~ Story may appear to be disconnected tales in the beginning. Might discourage immediatists.- Stealth system is almost ignorable. Fire your first shot and perhaps remain unseen. That is, if you haven't been spotted on the move.- It gets repetitive. Objectives are usually the same. Enemies hardly ever change. Plotline makes you keep moving.8/10			"

												For such a simple game it was really satisfying in an odd way. It's a horror style game and you will jump and be freaked out at times.Sneaking around in the bushes with a crusty old musket sniping monsters in French Conquistadors uniforms is fun enough but the story line and character actions add to a sense of "" I can believe they did that"".You can switch from monochrome to full color if you don't like the red/white. I played full color because the monochrome only really works when you ring the bell.			"

												One of the most lively and atmospheric games I've ever played. Every type of trees and bushes, small and huge stones, hills, ravines, glades, every type of terrain, abandoned forts and villages - everything is alive, despite everything is dead and haunted in fact. Immersion at its best! Even if the whole game was absolutely empty of NPCs, it could be one of best explorational ""walking simulator"". No matter if gameplay in all of its aspects from fights to puzzles is a bit repetitive the Betrayer is worth having in personal collection as a unique conquistadorish game.			"

Found myself wondering around the map looking for any form of clues on what to do before losing interest all together. Only fustrating part for me was no armour, did have fun taking out enemys in 2 hits though.I give it a 5 outta 10, looks good, wish it played better!			"

												My review of BetrayerPros: Fantastic setting,  Incredibly immersive and atmospheric,  Beautiful art style, The stories you uncover are very well done and quite tragic,  Firearms are realisticly slow to reload which adds a level of strategy, Good sound design, The wind mechanic is cool.Cons: Repetitive,  The world lacks depth,  Combat is fairly bland (Lots of kiting).Rating: 7/10-Good.  Betrayer features a gorgeously haunting world and a tragic and interesting story, and although it is repetitive and lacking in depth I would say theres more good then bad, I really hope the Devs deside to make more games and maybe even a sequel.

If you want a tricky, stealth(ish), thoughtful story driven game then you should play this.There are LOADS of good points (story, setting, style etc), with very few negatives. In fact I'm struggling to think of any negatives.Take your time and enjoy the setting and enviroment. It's worth it.			"

												Betrayer is an FPS with emphasis on stealth that is both very atmospheric and has some very interesting supernatural elements that adds to the gameplay. However, there just isn't much... ""game"" there. It's almost all a ""sandbox"" to play with, and there really isn't much to do except run around until you encounter something you can kill. And unless you want to challenge yourself to stealth kill everybody, it would almost seem there is very little activity in the game, when this game just needs a bit more... shall we say... handholding to be a really good game. You were supposed to arrive at this British colony in the New World back in the late 1700's, in a convoy, and two of your fellow ships have turned back due to heavy damage and storm... and your ship finally sank in a storm almost in sight of land. You woke up on a beach, with nothing except your cloths, and nothing salvageable except a weapon. You walk inland and somebody wearing red, apparently a woman, shot an arrow into a post near you... it is a note to be careful. You continue slowly found some weapons, and found that Spanish Conquistadors have apparently taken over, and is attacking all strangers. You kill some with your new found bow and captured some weapons and whatnot. You arrived at Fort Henry, and found it empty of life. There were some ash figures, human sized, as well as grave markers all around the area, some dead of disease, some from attacks... you also found various pages of writing scattered about. Notices, diaries, etc. There were signs of Indian attack on the fort. What happened to the colony? What could have cause the ash people? The problem there is you don't really have anything else after this. The scattered bits of text do add some back story, but your objective screen will tell you if you've found all of them, as well as all the graves, and whatnot. The conquistadors respawn when you load a savegame or when you die and respawn. And they can be better armed than you at first. You will have to kill a lot of them to gather loot, including old weapons, and trade those in at the few merchant spots for better conditioned weapons (which will do more damage). And being historically accurate, the pistol and mustket are VERY slow loading, but packs a real punch. The game has heavy emphasis on stealth and ambush. You are encouraged to use the wind to cover your approach. As the wind russels the tree branches, you can rush in and whack the enemy in the back. Surprise attacks score extra damage. You can also throw your tomahawk, which does quite a bit of damage at a distance. On the other hand, ammo is very limted. You're limited to 8 musket shots and 12 pistol shots, and 16-20 longbow arrows, your starting weapon. Don't waste them. In fact, you can reclaim them from corpses (but you'll lose a few here and there)And a bit of spoiler from here...You soon discover the bell in Fort Henry lets you access... the dark world, where there's perpetual fog and darkness, where skeletons roam the land, and evil lurks in the darkness... You can ""kill"" the skeletons, but they respawn like the conquistadors if you die or load a savegame. And there are parallel mission in both the ""light"" world and the ""dark"" world. The problem is... you're never really told what the missions are except in rare circumstances. For example, in an explicit mission, more of a side mission though, you found a ghost near Fort Henry, a captain who can only recall that he last remembered seeing his wife, and you need to help him find her. Actually before this you need to discover 3 witch items, an eyeball (for seeing ghosts), an ear (to hearing ghosts) and a mouth (for speaking to ghosts). They are all in Fort Henry though, easy to dig up. Any way, you have no idea where his wife can be except ""it's on a hill"". So you basically have to run around the map (which is pretty big if you have to travel on foot) and hopefully recognize the spot where you found some skeleton, and you dig up a necklace for the ghost.However, those side missions are explained, the PRIMARY mission wasn't ever listed, i.e. how do you get out of this area onto the next level. Turns out you have to scour the map for ""corrupted totem poles"" and visit them in the dark world and kill all the skeletons near them to ""cleanse"" them of corruption. Once you did that for all the totem poles the gate to the next area will open. There are also side missions in the dark world that deal with a ""thief"", but that's covered nowhere apparently. it's just something you can encounter. Most games that have free roam have a ""find next mission"" or ""find next objective"" button or such. This one does not. It basically left you to figure out everything, and that can lead to ""WTF do I do now?"" questions, which often leads to ""why the **** am I playing this?"" and rage quit. I've been told the ending was  a real letdown and the game almost without warning turns into a free-roam game where your sole purpose is to go for completion achievements (i.e. find all the notes, all the graves, etc. etc.) All in all, this is an experimental game that managed to achieve that certain mood, but in the end, failed to create a real GAME out of it. I can't recommend it it at full price. It may be worth picking up when it's very very cheap for the experience, or you like games that don't tell you what to do. NOTE: default game graphics was set to black and white palette, which can be very jarring to some people. You can adjust the graphics to add a little color, which IMHO contrasts better with the pure gray ""dark world"".			"

												  Betrayer is a weird beast. It's another game that holds its narrative higher than its gameplay, but it still tries to fit more combat into its story and atmosphere than other games like Gone Home, Master Reboot, etc.  It also features a very striking artstyle at first, although I'm not quite sure the developers knew exactly where they wanted to go with it.    You arrive in 17th century America, and go from camp to camp, trying to figure out the world around you. To do this, there are some pages spread around the maps, and also ghosts. You can see and speak to them, and little by little, by finding clues around the maps, you'll be able to understand who they are, how they died, and thus investigate the strange happening of each camp.   I really like the concept, and it's certainly different, but I don't think the execution is perfect, for the game's length. It feels like it would be a great element in a game, but not the sole focus, as is.   There are various enemies spread around, with different tells. You'll have to be methodical in dealing with them, and use sound to your advantage, moving stealthily to avoid certain death.   Let's go more in-depth with its presentation. You've probably seen from the screenshots that it's a very important aspect of this game.   The game is essentially in greyscale, with heavy contrast and lighting, and then features some live red for you to spot enemies and other important clues. There is the option to set normal colors though, and it looks pretty good as well, as long as you adjust the contrast and the lighting as well.   There are two worlds, a living world, and the ghost world, which you switch from and to, depending on your objective. The ghost world is far grimmer and darker. However, since both are black and white, I think it loses its punch, in general. I played the whole game as it was by default (always greyscale). After that, I went back to find missing collectibles, and used normal colors. Even in the living world, the game is far more tense with colors off, but the shock in switching worlds is significantly lessened.   Playing without colors can also be quite confusing at first, and I honestly don't know how I feel about it. It's just weird. And in the context of this game, it works! The whole time, I was just trying to understand what exactly the game was trying to do.   Another crucial aspect on this game is its sound design. There's no music, it's only ambient sounds.Now, the greyscale serves a purpose in the game. It makes you realize that you see the world differently than others in that world. You can clearly see enemies and interactable objects, while they can not. This also plays a role in sound design, as enemies have a much harder time seeing how. They can however, hear you if you're not careful. So you'll constantly be trying to walk crouched if you hear enemies around (or see them) not to get spotted. There are also occasional gusts of wind that mask your sprinting sound.   Some enemies are very clear with their red tells. Others, however, are also hidden, until they spot you. The only way for you to tell they're around, is through the sounds they make. There's a lot of nuance to it regarding its sound and visual design and the combat, actually, it's pretty cool.   There are also audio tells for when you are near an objective, or a collectible. You can also press X to be guided towards a close ghost/main objective, with a distant sound effect. There is a visual aid to it in the options menu, but I recommend playing only based on the audio cues.   It's hard to review this game, as it has so many details that shape the experience. I'll have to say the it's very heavy on atmosphere. It's not an horror game, but it can make you uncomfortable at times, and unexpected enemies can make you jump every once in a while. But I loved how tense it made me. The visual and audio design was spot on to make you feel that something was wrong at all times. Great job on that.Well, there goes half of the review and I haven't began talking about gameplay.Each map if self contained, and you can only progress to one after you've done every important objective for the previous. If you guide yourself with the sound cues, you'll have no problem with it. Most of the maps are very empty and barren woods, with 2-3 camps or important landmarks in each one. There are Pages, Chests, Clues, Ghosts, Graves, and Totems spread around. You have a notebook that checks most of what you find, regarding clues, locations visitted, graves found, etc. You also have a map to guide you (and fast travel between landmarks), but you can not make annotation in the map. This is a huge problem. If you're after the chests, pages and clues, it's a nightmare to go look for them again without map markers. There are also some clues that you can't uncover until you get a Shovel late into the game. Without marking these when you find them, going back after you get it is a pain... You'll forget most of them, and overall, it's very inconvenient to simply walk around hoping you'll stumble into something. This is only a problem with the optional stuff, but it's annoying nonetheless.    Regardless, let's go back to the game. There's also a vendor, from whom you can buy weapons, ammo, and the like. Enemies also drop weapons, although much weaker than the ones you get from the vendor. There are also 16 unique weapons that you can find from Chests, or with the Shovel. These are even better from the ones in the vendor, and it's worth scavenging for them.    In the normal world, you'll have to clear the camps of Spaniards (to set your checkpoint there) and find a Bell, to mount in it. By ringing the bell you change worlds. This is where it gets more interesting.   In the ghost world, you'll go around trying to find lost souls and wraiths. There can be both colonizers and natives. If they're lost, you'll point them to the camp, you can speak to them there. As you find more ghost and clues for each map, you'll be able to ask them questions about each other, and the items you find. This reveals how they died, little by little. It's usually episodes of people betraying one another (hence the name). While they're not groundbreaking, I thought they were cool, and also set the tone for the game's world. It's not historical or anything. It's mostly a way of integrating the narrative with the gameplay, and that's very good.   There's also a main plot (that's related with these side-stories as well), about the normal human being you find. She can't quite remember what happened, and so you go around trying to find her family.   The problem with this, is that I can't understand the point of this story. There doesn't seem to be a message in it, for the most part. It's just... there. And while the world itself, and the side-stories make the game interesting, it doesn't seem as directed as I would have liked. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed playing the game, but there's something missing, and the potential is there!  I hope you get a good enough idea from this to know if this is for you. I just find it really hard to fit this game into a review.   Another aspect that I want to touch, is the moral of your actions. With the enemies, they completely dehumanized the enemies, weirdly enough. The Spaniards are just armored humanoids that sound like bears. Seriously, if you hear a freakin' bear, it's a Spaniard. They also have a full helmet, so you never see their face. The natives are fire-y ashen being and whistle to communicate with each other. None of them feel actually human, so you have no problem with killing them, as they're just hostile beasts.   Overall, it's a very interesting game. Execution is half stellar, half lacking. It feels a bit incomplete, pacing-wise. But I'd say give it a go! You'll probably have an odd feeling of enjoyment while playing it!			"

												Really intriguing game. I love the color effect thing that you can set yourself. (I like to add a hint of color in the game.) It isn't really that spooky or horrifying, but it's really really eerie and alien. Love the feeling of it. Also the 17th century setting is really nice change. The game is mostly about survival and exploration. I like exploration more than survival, so luckily you don't drop all your items when you die, you only respawn. Those who look for more challenge can enable the item dropping so you would have to go to where you died and pick all your stuff back up.If you are easily intrigued by mysterious settings and secret things, this game can do it well and I would recommend buying it.

												This was a great change of pace from your typical FPS.  Set in 1604 you arrive on the shores of America thinking you are joining a colony of English colonists, but instead find them all dead and the land devoid of color and Spanish ghosts and American Indians plaguing your every step.  Your only human companion is a girl wearing red who can't remember who she is.  The weapons you use in this game are from the time period of the 17th century and are very fun to use.  There is no soundtrack and it is strange to wander the beautiful landscape with only the sound of bugs and the occasional gust of wind howling in your ears.  I would have liked a bit more closure to the story personally, but I would still recommend this to anyone who enjoys FPS games or American history, or horror/surviror games.			"

												A strange blend of Dark Souls style mechanics, Thief style stealth, and open world item hunting. Included with that is the duality of being able to switch between dark and light worlds, each filled with their own pickups, threats and quests.The visuals are breathtaking (whether in colour or black, white and red), the setting is unique, the story is obtuse and will not hold your hand, and it's crushingly difficult at times. All in all, it's a winner. Well worth the low price you're bound to pay for it.Pro-tip: Turn up the colour saturation a bit for a harder experience, as the enemies and treasure pickups won't be as obviously visible anymore, and you'll have to rely on your keen sense of hearing.

												I don't even know what to say. It is sort of a stealth/adventure/mystery/horror game. But the real horror isn't things popping out at you, or the creepy atmosphere (both exist). The story of what happened to the people on this island is what remains with me, like a piece of lead in my heart. I can not say I recommend it as a game, because the game here is fairly simple and mostly easy. But if you ever want to see a macabre story unfold voer 6-9 hours, Betrayer has you covered. As a side note, the stealth elements can be mostly ignored.			"

												A brief summary of Betrayer:This game is an excellent buy, especially for the price. Steeped in mystery and leaving much to the imagination, you are cast into a dreamlike version of the New World. This game is delighfully macabre, and offers increasing variations of challenge.Despite what others may say about the game quickly losing flavor, I find that the various difficulty options give the game a little more depth. The game is somewhat strange to get used to at first, but you will quickly find yourself discovering exactly what you need to do next completely by accident. There is also an option to drop loot much like you do in Dark Souls when you die, making the game capable of greater difficulty on the hardest setting. The game explains very little, and some areas of the game will prey on your most primal fears as you creep through shadows and forests to find hidden clues and treasures, all the while wondering what might pop out at you next. The combat does offer a challenge at higher difficulty levels, and you will often feel panic set in as you are unexpectedly discovered by enemies, some that tactfully blend in with the environment. The game does play pretty quickly, but has decent replay value with the several difficuly options and the option to switch to full color mode as well (although I personally love the gritty black and white texture because it reminds me of old horror films). Honestly, for a $5.00 game, I was very satisfied with my purchase, and I think Blackpowder will come out with more great games in the future with a little support.  "

												Betrayer is a mix of stealth, action, and a little bit of horror. The ship you're on ends up stranded on land that is inhabited by strange beings, with demonic glowing eyes and evil red auras surrounding them. Through exploration, you slowly uncover the truth of what happened to the inhabitants of the land.While the enemies can be tough, taking the time to line up a headshot with the bow or musket really pays off.

												This is quite a gem of a game. This game has many elements balled up into one. It has mystery, some horror, fighting, and exploration all in a Roanoke like experience. This game was really well done from such a small developer. Obviously it wasn't long enough for my taste but thats ok because it was such a steller game. My only complaint is that the fighting achievments were not so hard. The amount of people you have to kill for them is really high. Finishing the game I was only half way on all the fighting based achievments. Still, achievments aren't really my thing anyway so it all works out. Fantastic game that I highly reccomend. Also, you should start in black and white but eventually move to color.			"

												Let's start from the top, shall we? First off, there's only one thing I can say regarding the environment: absolutely beautiful. From the details of a single leaf (straight down to the dew), to the rocks on the ground (actually ROUND when you look straight down, not like flattened choco-chips of even the latest generation of games), to the flowing water, bustling trees, and dimming landscape, there's little to say but phenomenal. Caught myself more than once trying just standing admiring the landscape..... inspite of the oncoming errors finding their way to my knee in hopes of ending my journey as an adventurer (shut it, Skyrim fanboys). Best part is, regardless where you are and the color saturation, the landscape still remainds creepy as hell in areas. Speaking of the color-sat settings, Betrayer works a great-but-simple slider system in order to turn your landscape from shiny-green trees with monsters waiting to kill you, to some ""Sin City"" black-and-white-with-red-highlights setting to solidify the creep factor. But, wait, there's more for you traditional suspense-horror folk. Want to go back to that creepy, B-rated 80's horror film feel? No problem. Adjusting light, dark, and color saturation gives you that all-star black-and-white feel for when you're about to be eviscerated. Aaaand speaking of eviscerated (and moving on), there are a number of enemies to preoccupy your time between smelling the roses. Unfortunately, every time a new one pops up (literally, I mean exploding out of the ground to eat your entrails), it's a whole new world of ""oh S%!^!! as you've now got to learn the attack pattern on the fly, which still won't help you much, while all the other enemies are swarming after you..... And that's if your lucking to land 'em all in the same spot. Even as much as the newer, harder enemies introduce themselves, the older get stronger, faster, smarter, and, in the zombie-Spaniards cases, better equipped. One prime drawback to the enemies, though, is one shared on the aestetic side. Whereas the flora and overall landscape of the game looks down-right gorgeous, the fog, wraith's miasma, totems' and world's corruption (don't worry, you'll find out), look blocky and pixelated. Don't be discouraged though, as you'll inevitably see from the up-close and personal view of their heads and whatever solid extremities they may have, they're still creepy as hell and will still kill ya. Combat is simple, but having to manually work the pistols, muskets, bows and crossbows feels natural. By natural, I mean loading a pistol will take a lot longer then a shortbow, but it'll also do a hell of a lot more damage with less chance of deflecting off surfaces. Headshots, as expected, will deal more damage, and as with the old adage, ""Nobody wins in a knife fight,"" if you're going in for a close kill, don't expect to come out unscathed as you're human. They're not. They're faster. You'll find out who ""they"" are. Story-wise, Betrayer definitely takes its cues from older horror and suspense movies, only there's no chance of a happy ending with any of 'em, and they're generally more depressing and brutal then you were expected. It's more of a mystery novel with a horrorific veins than an adventure/FPS. The closer you think to completing a puzzle, the more you find out how many pieces are missing. Those pieces are generally worse then you were thinking, as well. Betrayer does not earn its name for no reason, folks. Oh, and once again, there's no way any of the ""arks"" end well, which holds especially true for the first few missions. In summary, even with  a few quirks you'd expect in an ""indy"" game, Betrayer holds up in all grounds, combat, scenery, and storytelling. Without further ado, you'll F^!(ING HATE THE ENDING.			"

												Betrayer was a very nice surprise that more than met my expectations of it. The visuals are haunting. I sincerely recommend not turning the saturation up because the black and white effect seems clearly designed for the game.  The gameplay is often tough and somewhat unforgiving. Betrayer doesn’t hold your hand like so many other games these days, you have to actually do a bit of reading and investigating to figure out what's going on. From the moment I started, the score and the visuals had me tense. I'm someone who loves older horror games and the simplicity of this game really appealed to me. The ambiant sound is fantastic and keeps the player on edge. I sincerely got goosebumps more than once from playing this.I have to say though, like all things, it's not perfect. The entire game revolves around you going to different places on the map and finding things. These locations are all marked on your map when you enter a new area. I would say that the game's lack of hand-holding probably would prevent a lot of people from even getting far enough to criticize the collect-em-all nature of it, but that's neither here nor there. Beyond the story itself, it's really just a collection game and that can get tedious. Overall, I loved it. It's a solid game with pretty tight gameplay and honest nightmare material with an interesting plot to boot. It has its flaws and can get repetitive and boring, but all games have flaws.  Betrayer reminds me of why I fell in love with horror games to begin with.			"

You get to upgrade your weapons, although the weapon animations aren't that great, I think that's mainly because they were trying to focus on the story. It has nice graphics and lots of playtime. You get to explore, fight the dead, save people, hunt thieves and lots of other stuff. Also, the price for this game is just right.			"

Every type of trees and bushes, small and huge stones, hills, ravines, glades, every type of terrain, abandoned forts and villages - everything is alive, despite everything is dead and haunted in fact. Immersion at its best! Even if the whole game was absolutely empty of NPCs, it could be one of best explorational ""walking simulator"". No matter if gameplay in all of its aspects from fights to puzzles is a bit repetitive the Betrayer is worth having in personal collection as a unique conquistadorish game.			"

												A very atmospheric arcadey shooter with survival elements and a twist: automatic guns haven't been invented yet. Can get repetitive at some point, but it keeps you going until you answer that one fatal question: ""What the ♥♥♥♥'s going on here?""PROS/CONS+Very atmospheric. Interesting (literally) monochromatic approach adds to that, but it is optional, which is nice.+Gameplay fits the setting AND is fun. I never thought musket firefighting could be thrilling.+Hard, but balanced. 1 to 10 disadvantages eventually become 1 on 1, with progression and adaptation.~~ It is not action packed, nor an horror game. It's something in between.~~ Story may appear to be disconnected tales in the beginning. Might discourage immediatists.- Stealth system is almost ignorable. Fire your first shot and perhaps remain unseen. That is, if you haven't been spotted on the move.- It gets repetitive. Objectives are usually the same. Enemies hardly ever change. Plotline makes you keep moving.8/10			"

It combines a nice, but partly frightening, atmosphere and subtle storytelling. The game build up a huge mystery arround the character and the world itseld, which supports the gameplay in matter of keeping in touch with the game.

												Part horror, part stealth, part open-world shenanigans. Great audio design also. Things I don't like, however, are the frequent backtracking and the poor variety of weapons and enemies, which is why I fear it will become rather repetitive in the long run (have only played a few hours so far). I would also recommend to adjust the color saturation since there is a game mechanism that bleeds the colors away anyway. The lush vegetation looks strikingly beautiful and should not be hidden behind that monochrome filter  all the time.			"

The music is very climate, and sounds in ""other world"" causes me goosebumps. Enemies are not that hard to kill, but it does not make game easy to play. Graphics are amazing (It's unreal engine) but i can not play in sin city mode (Everything is black and white, but enemies and important items are red) because my eyes hurt :D In my opinion this game looks more awesome with normal colors, but playing in black and white style for somrthing like 20 minutes is also a good experience. Betrayer is kinda scary game, but not much. Enemies are interesting and diffrent. I gives this game 8/10 Buy it!

												I bought this game almost purely because it has wind and it's effects in it.  So few games realize that wind is a critical component to building a believable world.  After all, it is a very common and natural thing that our minds expect to be in an environment.  This game also makes it into a mechanic.  Unfortunately, unless there is a gust of wind, there is no wind.. so that is not as good as it good be, but it's still nice to see High detail wind in a game.  (I'd like to see this used for a nuke at medium range in a forest.)Anyway, putting all that aside, it's a solid game that seems to be heavily inspired by Dark Souls in it's mechanics. I'm impressed that I like it considering that it is a genre I normally don't play.			"

												Betrayer is a beautiful game that showcases a solid atmospheric experience, but lacks in game play dynamics and a clear and precise goal system.Betrayer, the first offering from Blackpowder Games, seems to perfectly display what these Ex-Monolith developers did so well on F.E.A.R. and No One Lives forever, and what they may have left behind. Overall the game is a decent offering which will entice those that heavily favor the mood a game sets, but may leave those that look for strong game play elements feeling worn out and frustrated.I bought Betrayer during its Early Access debut on Steam after having its unique, alluring high contrast and mostly black and white color scheme catch my eye. Simply put, the graphics of Betrayer are gorgeous. Set in early 17th century colonial Virginia, most of the game takes place in heavily wooded areas, and Unreal Engine 3 does a fantastic job rending a large amount of individual trees, grasses, and shrubs to portray a relatively realistic wilderness. Every few minutes a gust of wind will come along and shake the vegetation, causing a truly dazzling display as each tree branch and grass leaf bends and moves, which is amplified by the lack of coloration.The sound design of Betrayer handily backs up its striking graphics. There is no music in Betrayer outside of the games main menu and credits, so it's up to the ambient noise of the forest to do the heavy lifting. Sound in Betrayer is sparse, but (aside from one combat noise that is outlandishly cartoonish) the sound of wind rustling the leaves, birds in the branches, and your characters footfalls are well mixed and convincing.Unfortunately, for as well designed as Betrayer's world is, there is not much to fill it. Betrayer is divided into seven open area levels, six of which have both a light and dark side that the player must switch between to fulfill different objectives. Enemy types are introduced between the first two levels, and then disappointingly stop, leaving only a sparse eight enemy types to lock horns with, two of which are simply stronger variations of previous enemies and another two of which are almost never used at all. The weapons also follow suit with this, with only seven weapon types being available, most of which you will have by the end of the second area.The combat in Betrayer is decent but simple, with most enemies also having projectile weapons or rushing toward you with knives. The AI of your adversaries is not very good, but it does fit with the overall theme of the story. The combat near the start of Betrayer is easily where it shines brightest, with each engagement being tense and difficult. Combat after the first few areas takes a disappointing turn, however, as the better weapons and items the player has amassed at this point are far too powerful to make the same enemies pose a challenge any longer.  Aside from having stronger weapons, having more water flasks that allow the player to heal all but eliminates the need for stealth.The majority of the game is spent exploring each area, uncovering clues, and speaking with confused wraiths to piece together stories of betrayal from each area. Although Betrayer gives you a “Listen” skill that will help you find these clues and wraiths to help push the game forward, there is also a lot to find in the world that can only be found by simply exploring. These include not only treasure chests that contain gold to help you upgrade your items, but also paper fragments with more bits of story if you care to further elaborate on the world. Although personally I did not have a lot of difficulty making sure that I covered all the possible ground of each area, the map Betrayer gives you is about what you would expect from the era, and at times the landscape can look vague, which will sometimes lead to frustration trying to find everything contained in a level. Thankfully, Betrayer does alert you when you have found all of a certain item in an area, in addition to when you have found everything possible about a subject or area, which gives a sense of accomplishment and closure before moving on to the next stage of the game. This is where the meat and potatoes of the game lies, as without this exploration, simply using the “Listen” skill to push the story along quickly turns the game into nothing more then a very short, twenty dollar fetch quest.Overall Betrayer seems to be a solid first offering, especially for a discount price, although it is certainly geared more toward fans of games like Dear Esther or those that enjoy exploration, and even then many may find themselves a bit worn out from the repetitive game play as they approach the middle and end of the game.

Unfortunately, unless there is a gust of wind, there is no wind.. so that is not as good as it good be, but it's still nice to see High detail wind in a game.  (I'd like to see this used for a nuke at medium range in a forest.)Anyway, putting all that aside, it's a solid game that seems to be heavily inspired by Dark Souls in it's mechanics. I'm impressed that I like it considering that it is a genre I normally don't play.			"

												utterly, shamelessly redundant, repetitive and pointless. Sure, everything seems dandy when you first ring the bell or fight the uninspired enemies but once you find out Betrayer is nothing but a collection of side-quests, stretched along around 7-10 hours of boring walking and running around in half-empty forests, you wouldn't applaud yourself at all for spending you dough on this game. Such a shame, really. I've loved pretty much everything by these developers in the past but Betrayer is simply not on par with even their earlier works. They probably had a millionth of the budget they had when they worked on the F.E.A.R titles or whatever but in the end, I feel like a fool simply for being tricked by this game's black and white aesthetics. Great sound design though. The first couple of hours are supremely satisfying but when you get used to the one-key environments and enemies and having nothing to do but go from point A to B because of fetch quests, you'll probably think like me as well. Story is there and is passable but too predictable, barebones and not deep enough to hold attention. Nothing here really does, to be quite honest. I'd say it's ok to buy the game when the price is super cheap; but outside of that, you can easily cast Betrayer into the shadows of your memories.			"

												At least it looks pretty... it makes it that much disappointing that the game itself is so dull.  Completing the game is mechanically going through a checklist.  Open the map, go to highlights on the map, repeat until the credits roll.  Yes, there's some combat in the game, but it feels like it's just there for the sake of giving the player something to do.  It's not satisfying in any way, and the weapon upgrades, charms, and economy are so rudimentary they may as well not exist.  The story is supposedly your driving factor for progression, but what could have been some dark and compelling character exploration is delivered in simple, uniformly wooden text that caused to me not care about anyone inhabiting the world.  This makes the moral choices the game asks you to perform toward the end (by backtracking, of course) fall so very flat.  Ultimately Betrayer feels like someone with a ton of talent created a gorgeous environment, but couldn't find a way to fill that world with anything interesting to do.Roaming the black and white forest of Betrayer is a visual treat; you could take a screenshot of any frame of this game and call it art.  Unfortunately that's how it's best enjoyed; just look at some screenshots and save yourself the slog.			"

												Betrayer is a beautiful game that showcases a solid atmospheric experience, but lacks in game play dynamics and a clear and precise goal system.Betrayer, the first offering from Blackpowder Games, seems to perfectly display what these Ex-Monolith developers did so well on F.E.A.R. and No One Lives forever, and what they may have left behind. Overall the game is a decent offering which will entice those that heavily favor the mood a game sets, but may leave those that look for strong game play elements feeling worn out and frustrated.I bought Betrayer during its Early Access debut on Steam after having its unique, alluring high contrast and mostly black and white color scheme catch my eye. Simply put, the graphics of Betrayer are gorgeous. Set in early 17th century colonial Virginia, most of the game takes place in heavily wooded areas, and Unreal Engine 3 does a fantastic job rending a large amount of individual trees, grasses, and shrubs to portray a relatively realistic wilderness. Every few minutes a gust of wind will come along and shake the vegetation, causing a truly dazzling display as each tree branch and grass leaf bends and moves, which is amplified by the lack of coloration.The sound design of Betrayer handily backs up its striking graphics. There is no music in Betrayer outside of the games main menu and credits, so it's up to the ambient noise of the forest to do the heavy lifting. Sound in Betrayer is sparse, but (aside from one combat noise that is outlandishly cartoonish) the sound of wind rustling the leaves, birds in the branches, and your characters footfalls are well mixed and convincing.Unfortunately, for as well designed as Betrayer's world is, there is not much to fill it. Betrayer is divided into seven open area levels, six of which have both a light and dark side that the player must switch between to fulfill different objectives. Enemy types are introduced between the first two levels, and then disappointingly stop, leaving only a sparse eight enemy types to lock horns with, two of which are simply stronger variations of previous enemies and another two of which are almost never used at all. The weapons also follow suit with this, with only seven weapon types being available, most of which you will have by the end of the second area.The combat in Betrayer is decent but simple, with most enemies also having projectile weapons or rushing toward you with knives. The AI of your adversaries is not very good, but it does fit with the overall theme of the story. The combat near the start of Betrayer is easily where it shines brightest, with each engagement being tense and difficult. Combat after the first few areas takes a disappointing turn, however, as the better weapons and items the player has amassed at this point are far too powerful to make the same enemies pose a challenge any longer.  Aside from having stronger weapons, having more water flasks that allow the player to heal all but eliminates the need for stealth.The majority of the game is spent exploring each area, uncovering clues, and speaking with confused wraiths to piece together stories of betrayal from each area. Although Betrayer gives you a “Listen” skill that will help you find these clues and wraiths to help push the game forward, there is also a lot to find in the world that can only be found by simply exploring. These include not only treasure chests that contain gold to help you upgrade your items, but also paper fragments with more bits of story if you care to further elaborate on the world. Although personally I did not have a lot of difficulty making sure that I covered all the possible ground of each area, the map Betrayer gives you is about what you would expect from the era, and at times the landscape can look vague, which will sometimes lead to frustration trying to find everything contained in a level. Thankfully, Betrayer does alert you when you have found all of a certain item in an area, in addition to when you have found everything possible about a subject or area, which gives a sense of accomplishment and closure before moving on to the next stage of the game. This is where the meat and potatoes of the game lies, as without this exploration, simply using the “Listen” skill to push the story along quickly turns the game into nothing more then a very short, twenty dollar fetch quest.Overall Betrayer seems to be a solid first offering, especially for a discount price, although it is certainly geared more toward fans of games like Dear Esther or those that enjoy exploration, and even then many may find themselves a bit worn out from the repetitive game play as they approach the middle and end of the game.

												This was a fun game.  I'd like to see a sequel expand it and smooth out some of the flaws, but it was certainly a good time.  It definitely has the mark of Monolith all over it and I always dug their style.  The 17th century, colonial setting was definitely a highlight.  Unlike some reviewers, I found the old school sometimes frustrating weapons to be quite a blast to shoot.  Since the enemies weren't overly difficult, the slow and possibly accurate reload times made for a few tense fights, especially against the floating skull like enemies in the dark world.  The story/backstory that you discovered by interacting with ghosts, journal entries and spirits was appropriately cryptic and swirling with American Gothic touches.  Oddly enough, it reminds me of a more polished version of the underrated Gamecube game Geist sans the possession element.  But it has that similar mix of low key exploration and bursts of combat.   The option to play with different color saturations was pretty awesome and despite the temptation and a few experiments with color, I found the default black and white to create a trippy, foreboding atmosphere.  When you break it down the overall mix of the game was like combining a hack n' slash loot collector with survival horror and typical first person action/adventure/shooter elements.  I ended up mixing up my arsenal quite a bit, even if the longbow is man's best friend and the ultimate equalizer.  All told the environments were alot of fun to explore and I found myself trying to locate the majority of POIs during my time in the game, although I missed a couple of things.  I also actually enjoyed that all of the story and character interactions were with text instead of bad voice acting of some sort.  It lent a relaxing feel to the more town-based segments of the game; a good breather from all of the woods wandering and shoot outs with psychotic conquistadors.    With all of the positives I feel about this game, it did have some drawbacks.  After awhile the gameplay started becoming a tad repetitive.  It wasn't a nailing mistake but towards the end a few objectives borderlined on tedium.  Perhaps after beating Deadlight on nightmare, this game just didn't feel challenging enough.  Once I got the shovel and had all of the strongest gear and most of the upgrades, I was a pretty unstoppable force.  Those friggen spiders put me down a few times though.  Enemy variety is also pretty scant and though they were fun to fight, I got somewhat tired of mopping the floor with the same dopes over and over again.  As a hardcore gamer I of course played with the deadliest enemies setting and while I got taught a few lessons early on whenever I was still figuring out the gameplay/mechanics, once you get the hang of what you're doing and stock up on deadly gear, only a few select sections provided any challenge.  The final boss battle was also a joke and took me only one try to complete.  But overall this is a pretty great game to play through once.  I might leave it installed and someday go back and earn some achievements I left in progress, but once you're done there really aren't any extra features/modes to come back to besides a free roam of the environments with baddies still lurking.  The Steam achievements I did miss are already mostly completed or on their way, so even with the things left undone, I really feel that I got the most out of the game I could get...  The campaign was a blast though with a runtime that should take you over 10 hrs to complete, depending on how much you want to upgrade (I personally maxed out health, ammo capacity and weapon types to their fullest).  Overall this is worth your time if you're looking for a first person blaster with more esoteric ideas and rural Americana vibes.  So, for those who don't want to read all of my b.s., let me break it down a little further from a gamer who has been smashing buttons since '84!Pros:-Very cool atmosphere with unique color saturation options and an eerie black n' white world-Lush colonial setting with fun period weapons-Not alot of monsters but the ones you do encounter are fun to fight (even if they are a bit thin in the IQ department)-Interesting use of two distinct worlds (light/dark) with a gameplay rhythm that develops between the two-Solid graphics and excellent landscapes with intricate special effects (wind gusts, dynamic lighting, etc.)-Mostly satisfying campaign with enough to do and see to keep you progressing-Adventure elements well-employed with almost a light Zelda style exploration/backtracking for loot/treasure/equipment-Intuitive inventory/map/journal system that was fun to use/manageCons-Easy enemies even on the hardest setting once you have the mechanics down/enough upgrades   -Safe zones/forts were a nice touch, but could have used more fleshing out (like being able to enter buildings)-Some design choices seem half-baked (giving items to Alison/lady in red with seemingly no game effect, etc.)-Tasks/objectives become rather samey 2/3s through the game.  -Only a few enemy types and weak final boss encounter-As much fun as I had it's really a one playthrough affair.  -Could have used a few actual boss fights for some variation...it would have been fun to see how they would have played out with the primitive weapons.  -Sound design was average which took away some of the potential horror chills.  The creepy ambience of the nether world, wind and atmospheric cues were all good.  Guns, weapons, enemies were all rather laughable.  Rating:  7.8/10For me this is so close to an 8, but just not quite that good.  Still, I think it's well worth a go and I'd sign up for a sequel or any DLC content in the future.  Happy gaming gang!

												Gameplay can be a bit tedious at times and the objectives are not always clear so if you are looking for a game that tells you exactly what to do or where to go this game may not be for you. With that being said if that does not scare you away the times inbetween the objectives really add to the erie alone feeling you get playing this game just as the plot suggests. As far as general scary moments that you would associate with the horror genre this game is lacking but the atomosphere and traveling between reality and the ""other world"" makes the horror feeling undeniably present. The colors and texture add to the immersion into your environment and make the sometimes boring exploration enjoyable This includes the option to customize the color of your world between a more realistic color scheme all the way to black and white which seems to magnify the texture and detail of the already beautiful level design.  Betrayer relies on your curiousity and your drive to reveal more and more of the story and of your objective as you go along. Definitely a steal for the price, sure to give you hours of game play if you allow yourself to be drawn into to the unique story and environment.			"

												I'm just gonna lay it out straight and honest: Alot of the game's content is repetive, You're given NO feedback whatsoever, It's difficult to figure out when you're finished with an ''investigation'', The weapon system is boring as you're only given a few options. And for anyone thinking/saying that the combat is ''Non-trivial'' and is actually ''difficult'' don't listen to them... You can survive any encounter with a crappy bow! I was really liking the kind of story-line they were going with. However with no voice acting AT ALL it got really boring and ended up skipping pretty much everything even though i love Story heavy games more than any other genres! The ''quests'' you are given are boring and meaning-less to the story... If your job is to figure what actually happened then why the actual **** are you solving family crisis'?Pros: Great atmoshpere and art-style.			"

												Although I'll admit that you're going to spend a lot of time wandering back and and forth in this game; it's oppressive atmosphere and subtle soundtrack really put you into the game. The old-school weapons also provide a nice touch. The frustration of dealing with muzzle-loaders, flint-lock pistols, and crossbows also zero in the frustration of these low-tech solutions. I don't mean that this is not a welcome change of pace from games that seem to want an automatic in your hands as soon as possible. Combat in this game rewards both the bold and the stealthy, although once you get to a certain point, you'll hear your enemies, but spotting them before they spot you is REALLLLLLLY hard.So to break it down:Combat: Stealth or run-n-gun. Explosives are okay, but I never use them. Use cover to your advantage, and the wind-swells to mask footsteps. Atmosphere: From the lonely shore you wash up on, to the sad bastions of fortresses where the ghosts of some truly deplorable people dwell all give this game a kind of hopelessness that is engaging and eerie. Moving between day and night worlds is a kind of Silent Hill-esque treat.Issues: I wish the markers for ghosts that aren't available would disappear until they were available again. After every piece of evidence, I'm back to wandering in the woods to see if a ghost popped up.This game doesn't give you a ton of info up front, so let me help:1. The corrupted totems can only be dealt with at night, and you can ""listen"" to them (starting a battle) with ""X""2. You can switch back to the world map and you don't have to go back through each area, you can warp to any point you've created, across any map.3. Make sure you check the map that you want everything to show up! I made it to the fourth area before I realized it wasn't showing me ghosts.4. You won't get the shovel to dig up the rock-piles until quite a ways into the game, so don't keep looking for the damn thing until you get like four or five maps in.Anyway, great game for the price, and I bought it and forgot I had it in my library for a few months. I then went back and actually played it, and I've been playing it every night for the last couple weeks!			"

												Betrayer is a first person shooter/mystery/walking simulator in which you piece together the fractured remnants of the history of the island you find yourself on. You take on demonic Conquistadors and spectral horrors as you pass back and forth between diffferent veils of reality, clearing the various areas of enemies and helping lost spirits remember their stories and gain absolution. It is an exercise in restraint - everything from the soundtrack, to the visuals, to the story is constructed carefully and sparingly with great intention. There is no music but for the wind through the trees and the grass, and the contextual sounds that alert you to the presence of nearby points of interest, and this sound design is excellent. However, the minimalism also extends to the gameplay - you'll do a bit of shooting, a bit of stealth, and a lot of walking from one place to another and back again. The locations exhibit little variation, and you won't see much beyond trees and grass and rocks along the way. The layers of atmosphere, the oppressive feel of the dark other world, and the genuine tension when you hear the bark of an enemy all expertly manipulate the player's emotions, and the stories themselves are well-written and feel like they reflect believable and uniformly tragic struggles of a once-living colonial population, however the overreliance on mystery can leave you feeling without purpose, and the sheer amount of trudging back and forth is tedious. The last couple of hours of the game are striking in that you begin to get a little variety in locations, the story finally gets momentum, and the difficulty unbalances heavily in your favour, and I found this the most motivated section of gameplay, but to trudge through 4 repetitious hours beforehand was not an altogether enjoyable experience. This is one of those games that you can really appreciate for its parts, especially from the perspective of artistic risk-taking, but it is not greater than the sum of those parts, and you may have trouble feeling compelled to finish it. I recommend it because it's well-made and unique, but I recommend it tentatively because its design makes getting through it a bit of a slog.			"

												Betrayer is a game best played without prior research or information, but it's also a very polarizing game that you will probably either love or hate, and I'll try to talk about the things that would hold you back from purchasing this title and the things that you might come to love about it while trying not to leave you feeling like you've already played the game.In simple terms Betrayer is a fantastic FPS with a huge focus on immersion with discovery, exploration and detective elements. Set in the first decade of the 17th Century as a colonist arriving on the shores of Virginia, there are a number of interesting and fairly unique mechanics that all help to compliment the world and the players exploration and while it requires a level of attention and self learning, it delivers more the more you put into it. For me, this is a game that exemplifies underrated or hidden gems.HighlightsThe last game I can remember grabbing a hold of me and making me feel so immersed and part of its environment was Metro 2033, and with a much smaller budget and development team, it's commendable how incredibly well designed this is. There's a depth of elegant graphical and audio options for players who want to get rid of the HUD, turn up the difficulty and increase the realism even more, but even out of the box it's very reactive and real. Everything from the get go is designed with this in mind, the HUD elements can be mostly forgotten about and blend into the background, the weapons are all accurate to the period, and reload animations look and feel natural and even small things like reloading while running support the level of realism.The audio and animation and art style all stands out as exceptionally well made. Using the games listening mechanic feels like stopping to♥♥♥♥♥♥your ear and is a genuinely useful part of play. The rustling of leaves in the wind can give you a scare if you mistake them for something else and paranoia takes hold often. Similarly, visual elements like light shaded ferns and foliage or bent tree branches blowing in the wind can easily be mistaken for assailants or hazards and catch you off guard.Mistakes & AnnoyancesA common complaint about Betrayer is the lack of depth in terms of gameplay, and that it quickly gets boring. While it's true that the combat and actual progressive gameplay are straight forward and arguably limited, they're not the whole focus of the game, and shouldn't be viewed as the reason for playing. Instead, the game is about discovering clues, finding out who and where you are, what's going on and what happened in and to the environment and characters around you. Still, players expecting a different take on an FPS are justified in feeling out of place here, I just feel it's a complaint that doesn't take into account the rest of the game.Finally, the ending receives a lot of criticism for being abrupt, not making sense, and explaining very little. Like the rest of Betrayer, it requires a level of thought and comitment from the player, and a developer explanation helps confirm what most people will take away from the ending, but it still feels poorly conveyed and ends like a movie that left you feel wanting for an explanation after viewing.All in all the biggest issue I had with Betrayer is that it's one of those games that leaves you feeling like it could've been much more. I can't criticize a game that's taken interesting new approaches to common gameplay mechanics, and I feel they've simply been used as the best solution to the game design in mind and they serve it well, but players should know that it will probably make them want for more, or for one of the mechanics to be explored more in depth. Whether that's a good or a bad thing is more down to individual taste.* Due to the ambiguous nature of gameplay and the focus on realism, almost everything is left unexplained, be it the mechanics, the enemies and even the controls. It compliments the playstyle very well, but also creates for some frustrations. I remained ignorant of the fact that I could use melee weapons far into the game purely because an enemy spawned too close during the brief explanation of the controls, and made me feel like a fool later on.* Spoilers For a game with such incredible sound design and natural assets why on Earth are the enemies using generic animal sound clips that I've heard in games and moves? A conquistador should not make dog noises and skeletons should not be roaring like a bear.RecommendationsWith an average playtime of around 8 hours, and a price tag at £6.99/9.99€/$9.99, Betrayer feels fairly priced and fair value for money. The caveat is that, being a love it or hate it kind of game, it may be worth waiting for a sale of -50% or more for anyone who's unsure. Though a demo is available on the Store page and will help anyone on the fence.The already visually impressive graphics can be heightened further via use of SweetFX settings, and FPS can be unlocked to allow greater than 60fps. Further explanation is listed in these guides.			"

												I've had great fun playing this game, despite not being a fan of stealth games or open-world games with item-hunting being a major aspect of gameplay. The game has a great atmosphere, especially with its nice touches, such as realistic wind effects, and the ability to change the colour saturation when playing.At first it appears as though the game has no story. You arrive in a wooded area with scattered forts and military outposts. Everyone aside from one NPC are dead and it's your job to find out what happened to this place. As you travel from one open area to another, you find clues and remains of the conflict. In each area you are able to traverse between the normal world and the dark world. In the dark world you are able to communicate with the spirits of the dead, hearing out their side of the story, and eventually putting together the clues that tell you how they died and why.In each area, there is a variety of enemies you encounter, each of which poses a threat, especially when they come in groups. This means you often have to approach them with strategy and stealth, because most weapons are either not that powerful or take a while to reload. It kind of felt like Dark Souls but in 1st person - dangerous enemies, dying takes you back to a safe place with all enemies in the area revived, and most of the story told through clues in the environment.I generally enjoyed the game and found myself very immersed, but there were a few minor drawbacks. For example, it started to feel like it was dragging on a bit in the latter stages since the gameplay did not change much between each area. I also found exploring the dark world to be a bit tedious because the environments were being bland. I think it could've been made a bit prettier with some more detail in the environments. Just because it's meant to be grey and dark does not mean it has to feel empty. There were also very minor gripes, like some wearable charms having useless bonuses, like having a 4% chance of being harder to spot (why equip that when I can equip charms that increase my melee damage by 50 or even 100%).In general, this is a solid game. If you're into games with an open-world feel and lots of things to collect, and story being subtle, you should enjoy it. If you're not into those things, you might, just like me, enjoy it still.			"

You can switch back to the world map and you don't have to go back through each area, you can warp to any point you've created, across any map.3. Make sure you check the map that you want everything to show up! I made it to the fourth area before I realized it wasn't showing me ghosts.4. You won't get the shovel to dig up the rock-piles until quite a ways into the game, so don't keep looking for the damn thing until you get like four or five maps in.Anyway, great game for the price, and I bought it and forgot I had it in my library for a few months. I then went back and actually played it, and I've been playing it every night for the last couple weeks!			"

												this game is pretty sweet. lots of fun.i haven't play any game like this before, it's very unique.though i'm not very far into the game yet, i can already tell i am going to play it all the way through, and i can tell i'm going to love it.i recommend this game because not only is it different from other games, but because it's also very fun, and the developers did an amazing job at creating the game. it runs beautifully.the everything being black and white i don't understand just yet, and the fact only red seems to be visible as of yet is strange, but in some way adds to the game. very hard to explain just what i mean.check this game out, i'm fairly certain you wont regret it.

												Betrayer is a simple game once you get do's and don'ts of survival codex, but more important is that you start to understand the title of this game the deeper you sink with relations, with characters, the more you see and not because you wander in a daylight and in the darkness like you can be called, at later part of gathered survival strength, The Darkness Itself but because Betrayer changes over time as you play - it starts as hardcore, if you dare, survival game and ends as psychological reminder what matter in our lives. One more technical thing on top of that - audiovisuals are really well made here. Put aside inconsistencies and you will enjoy Betrayer much more, otherwise you might fasten yourself onto those and kinda make whole experience worse. You cannot change what happened. Let go of the demons inside you and the past that bind you here and be at peace... 7/10			"

Fantastic atmosphere in more ways than just its striking visuals.Betrayer was quick to draw me into its world. It is a world that manages to feel, at the same time, both desolate and packed with intrigue. There are places to explore, mysteries to solve and threats looming around every bend. This is a game that isn't afraid to take some risks in terms of game design. The results are sometimes wonderfully successful and other times ineffective.What first drew me to Betrayer was its artistic design. While it does look as good as the screenshots, the novelty of it does wear off over time. I eventually experimented with turning on full color and was pleased with how things looked that way as well. Just know that simply turning up the color saturation slider doesn't make for something pleasing to the eye. You'll have to change the light and dark intensity sliders as well. I had both of them moved most of the way to the left.As eye catching as the graphics style is, the sound design is equally as good and is an integral part of the experience. Even though the only music is during the main menu and credits, I never felt like the game was missing a soundtrack. All the sounds of the forest and the way you ""listen"" for clues and collectables makes your ears as valuable as your eyes as you explore.Hunting for certain collectables can be a chore due to your long range ""listen"" ability being restricted to leading you only to story related locations. That can make for a lot of aimless wandering for completionists like me, which gets frustrating when you're still missing something after going through an area quite thoroughly. This could have easily been remedied by a late game unlock to be able to ""listen"" for everything. It also doesn't help that there isn't a lot of variety in environments. In fact, around the halfway point in the game zones start to blend together and no new enemies are introduced either. The final zone is very cool and unique, however. From around 50% to 85% of the way through the game is easily its weakest portion. Contributing to that is that it is around this point that you begin to identify gameplay patterns, making things feel predictable and repetitive.If you're into murder mysteries then I suspect you'll enjoy Betrayer. Each area you visit has its own stories to tell. Some of these stories offer clues as to what's happened in the larger region in which the game is set. Others simply flesh out the local histories. It is up to you to decipher what fits into the grander scheme of things.			"

												Pretty fun game. Color scheme was cool, but made some enemies (flaming natives) nearly impossible to see. Thankfully you can adjust it on the fly. The animal sounds for enemies has had lasting effects. I played and finished this game about a month ago. Lately I've been watching True Blood and those bird call in the background of the show are idential to a certain enemy type in the game. When I hear that in the show my ears perk up a bit since I'm used to thinking there is an enemy near. 7/10			"

												I can't think of anything available now to compare the game to. Everything from the pure soundtrack of nature all around you, creepy sound cues to pull you in to an unexplored territory, the black and white and red graphics (or color if you prefer), the antique time pieces, the mostly open world to explore and some really creepy enemies really make this game a stand out all on its own. The story falls into pieces with exploration and other things (no spoilers here) and you really have to tread carefully. Just walking along and not paying attention can and will get you killed. This type of game isn't for those looking for a ""Skyrim"" type experience. It's far from that. However, what it does offer is a very twisted take on early America and some very bizarre stories to accompany the theme. It is a gem of a game and one you should very seriously take a look into.

												Interesting game. Different to the stuff I normally like but atmospheric and unusual enough to keep me interested. It is not perfectly bug free and it is very linear, however, it is unusual enough to be worth a go if you feel like a bit of a moody ghost story with some gun play.  Its has a ton of atmosphere and a sort of melancholy spookiness that appeals (to me).   When I say linear, it doesnt force you to do a certain thing at a certain time per se but it is pretty channelled to keep you in the story.  It is a good story but unfortunately, I am the ultimate open world free to do anything game sort of guy (yeah, I am often disappointed).   However, I like this and would very much recommend it as a really great quirky game which you wont regret paying for.			"

												Have to say it's an interesting game, and fun. There is no voice acting mind you, but either way the story is well pieced together. Also for those who don't like the monochrome look, they offer the option to turn color on, how ever I highly suggest you stick to that black and white look. The game it self is not necessarily scary, though it might just be me, but the atmosphere is definitely eerie and unsettling. Stories of what become of certain victims are also quite disturbing once pieced together. The Ai is straight forward, they can hear and see you, but you can hide and mask your approaches with the wind as advertised. I wouldn't call the game open world exactly, but rather several large connected areas. It does the job of giving you the impression you're in a forest, and you're alone with the exception of some skulking phantasms.I think the game was great, but I would imagine it's not for everyone. Some might find the story and setting a bit too ""artsy"" or too simple to really get into. It's odd simply put.			"

												Betrayer is a stealth horror action-adventure played from a first-person perspective. It uses a monochrome art style that Eurogamer‍‍ '​‍s Dan Whitehead described as ""undeniably striking"". The game has no clear missions or markers for quest objectives, aiming to initially perplex players by not providing a defined sense of direction. Sound plays a central role in exploring the game world, as it is used to lead the player to clues and other points of interest. While progressing, any clues found are meticulously documented in the inventory windows. Similar to The Elder Scrolls series, players can quickly navigate from one location to another by clicking a point-of-interest icon on the game's map. In the game, players stealthily kill enemy conquistadors by creeping through tall grass and hiding their movements by timing them with strong gusts of wind. Enemies are killed using a variety of antiquated weaponry including bows, crossbows, pistols, muskets, and thrown tomahawks. Taking inspiration from Dark Souls, when the player dies in the game all of their items are left on their corpse at the location of death. The player then respawns at the base fort and must journey back to where they died to retrieve their items from their corpse. If the player dies again before retrieving their items, then the items on that first corpse will disappear and can not be recovered. Sometimes Betrayer seems like more horrible  than Outlast or Amnesia. One time my emotions get the better of me and i was screamed .I sincerely recommend this game for all people who likes horrors and stealth in one bottle.  "

												First, let me tell you that the gameplay of Betrayer feels pretty great. You can use gusts of wind to sneak up to enemies, using this and the environment for stealth works nicely. Also, the idea of using muzzleloaders with only one shot and long reload times is awesome, and makes drawn-out fights tense.My Problem is with the Narrative of the story. There are 7 maps in the game, and only on the 5.th map, the ""real"" story starts. Over the course of the game, you will get hints about awesome and mysterious stories, but not a single one of them is picked up again. The ""real"" story of the game turns out to be the weakest, most clichéd and uninteresting story you find, with all the other mysteries just being red herrings. As for the ending, I would have been content with a sad or tragic ending. But the ending you are given is just ridiculous. It clashes with every detail of the story that you have been told earlier, and explains nothing. The ""endgame"", which consists of lots of backtracking, completely put me off with its clashing emotional tones.Don't let me fool you, the mystery of the things you find will make you invested in the game in no time. My problem is that all the mysterious happening lead up to a bland and uninteresting final game.For example, the mystery of the game lead you to question the origin of the enemies you encounter (and the enemy designs are fantastic, so it first seems likely to suspect a deeper story about where they came from and what turned them into this.) However, only one type of enemy can be connected to the story in any way, while the others are just nice ideas without any backstory.What I want to say, is: The gameplay first seems to promise you a deep and mysterious story, and if you take the bait, you will be heavily disappointed.However, if you can play the game just for the gameplay itself, without any interest in the story or narrative, you will have a great time.

												Don't get fooled by the PR and nice video, the game is nothing like it is shown.I actually demanded a refund for this game.Do not get fooled by all those folks giving it a ""Thumbs Up"" with an average of 2-3 hours logged.The main attraction to this game is the story of course. There's a mystery to be solved and guess who has the task to solve it?You start the game stranded on a beach. Pressing 'M' brings up a map with a bunch of red circles that are areas of interest.Eventually you arrive at the first ""hub"" of the game where it's an empty colony populated only by one mysterious individual.You have the ability to go into ""Ghost Mode"" meaning that there are technically two worlds: the one with colors and the black and white one you see in all those screenshots.Unfortunately, even with a decent ""horror"" narrative (which is a highly questionable tag; not once did this game scare as much as bore me), the gameplay is downright rudimental. Aiming is hitscan and not accurate. The enemies' AI is... well let's just say that I'm doing a favor to those NPCs by saying any kind of AI was implemented in them.I'm not sure who this game is for: there's no building elements; there's no voice-overs; no cut-scenes. It's just going to the Red Circles on your map and trying to figure out a mediocre narrative.			"

												I wanted to like this but it commits a cardinal sin in that it goes out of it's way to waste your time and stretch it's content by doing so.Not only is this frustrating and boring but it also damages any sense of immersion as you walk through the same territory for the 20th time!Every time you die (and expensive ammo/weapons/overpowered enemies means that happens quite a bit) you're thrown back to the start with new enemies randomly spawned.  That means you cannot just run back to where you died, you have to use caution and get past the new enemies first - which is just a game of patience and ammo attrition and I gave-up because I was - frankly - bored with it.It is very pretty - it is quite atmospheric (tho enemies spawning from thin-air breaks that quite a bit) - but as a game it's a poor effort and it requires a LOT of patience to proceed...

												Betrayer is kind of a neat game and unlike anything I've ever played before. It's got some good ideas going for it, but there's a lot of blandness and repetition that bogs it down in the end.The stealth gameplay is pretty decent, feeling genuinely rewarding as you successfully maneuver around in the shadows and take down unsuspecting enemies. At least at first. Sometimes when you're in a hurry to do something, all this stealth can get kind of annoying. So instead you run as fast as you can, alerting the entire forest and hucking tomahawks at everything that moves. Which is kind of satisfying... but these are pretty much the only game mechanics, so it sometimes gets a little old. There are guns and such, too, but it takes so long to reload a musket that it doesn't get much use... more of a one-shot-per-enemy-encounter type of use.There's lots of stuff to run around and find, but there's so much of it that you would never happen upon unless you search the entire forest. But who's gonna do that? Nobody. So you have to look up a guide and compare your game map to the guide map to slowly collect everything. And there comes to be a strange satisfaction in all the tedium, but you collect everything in one area, then move onto the next one and repeat, counting how many more areas of the game there are until you're finished. And when you start to look ahead at how much more of the game there is until you're finished rather than letting it unfold on its own, that's never the mark of a good game.The story's pretty bland and uninteresting. It's made up entirely of meeting ghosts, asking them what happened to them, then finding clues around the area and confronting the ghosts about them to unlock their memories of how they died or whom they killed, etc. The individual stories that each ghost tells are somewhat interesting but don't amount to much. It's sort of the one trick of this one-trick pony. There's an over-arching storyline that tries to connect the whole thing, but it again ends up being just another story that's sort of amusing but nothing more. However, there is also the occasional note that gives a bit of story that seems to be completely unrelated to any other parts of the story. There are some genuinely neat little stories in some of these.The game does have a decent atmosphere, though. Its default black-and-white look with the occasional stark red highlight on points of interest and enemies is pretty captivating. Though by the end of the game, it starts to feel a little lifeless. And wouldn't you know it... it wasn't until I finished the game that I found out there are color options to play the game in full color, which looks so much better... lol. The sound design is great, giving distinct audio cues for different enemies, allowing you to pinpoint not only when an enemy is close, but what kind of enemy it is and where it is, so you can get the drop on it.I can't tell if Betrayer is trying to be a horror game or not. It's not scary. However, it does do some cool things. The presentation of ringing a town's bell to change the scenery from day to spooky night is startling and very well done. The ending's not very good, nor did I care enough about the story even if it was, but the very final moment of the game, although confusing, was actually pretty freaky. I have no idea what it meant, but I like freaky, so props for that.Anyway...4/10			"

												this game was interesting. Nothing more nothing less. I would recommend this game if it wasn't 20 bucks. In the end this game was boring after a while. I like how they give us free rein over a giant area at the very biggining, but without any objective it becomes boring very quickly. Not to mention te fact that the fights are very poor. They rapidly desending into who has the most health, and do you have enough ""water skins"" to heal you if you fail in the first category. once the enemy spots you it's like they throw some unseeable flare that alerts everybody in the near 5 mile raduis that they found some nice noms. It would't be that bad i mean you can run away. Oh wait sorry i was thinking of another game. No the flare onl goes away after you killed every enemy chasing you, and all the enemies you atrracted while trying desperatley to run away , and to reload your weapon with the speed of sombody who dosn't know how to work there fingers. So the battles are poor, and the lack of meaning gives the large maps no purpose. But it looks pretty, you know if you like black and white. That and your not afraid to burn out your eyes trying to fix the brightness. I could go on about other things, but anybody who has acually read this much knows my opinion by now. In short can't recommend find somthing else worth your money			"

												This had potential to be good, but the bland enviornments (nice art style, but all 7 maps look the same), lackluster story, and backtracking make this game too much of a chore. I wasn't sure what to do to finish the game (I probably have to talk to more ghosts), but I didn't care enough about the story or gameplay to finish it. I did look at the ending on YouTube though, and it ends very abruptly without much of a resolution. The combat is fine, but it's a slow trudge with too much backtracking with little explanation of what I'm supposed to do next. Anytime I play a game where I need to use a guide, it becomes less fun and more of a hassle.			"

												This game doesnt really seem all that remarkable mechanically or visually but perhaps these limitations were intetional because they work towards adding tension to the game and its a very tense game.  I found myself often jumping in my seat due to being surprised by enemies or events, the sound design contributes greatly to this. It is all around a very dark experience, whether you are learning about the horrifying tragedy that befell all the characters in the game or fighting against the beastial spaniards or dark inhabitents of the otherworld a sense of dread descends upon and hangs over you while you play.  I especially appreciate the story elements to the game the events that you uncover are truly horrifying.  I think the setting of this kind of new world lost colony thing is pretty fresh, cant say i've played a game that used that before(not saying there arent any).  All in all I highly reccomend this experience.			"

												Having played the game some hours I can't say I have anything to complain about except there being a small drumlike sound when an enemy has spotted you, which removes the pant wetting moments you'd have otherwise.The atmosphere is amazing, and the world really feels empty and cold in an amazing way, it is open endless wilderness with content scattered around for you to find on your own.Finding the clues, piecing together the mystery part by part is also a rather refreshing experience seeing as you get ♥♥♥♥ all help from any objective or mapmarkers(big plus in my book).And ringing the bell for the first time having the already uncomfortably eerie world get even darker and more unpleasent? This game is a very refreshing, hard, and new experience for me within the horror/mystery genre.No cheap jumpscares, no cliche tropes or any of that copy paste sillyness. This is simply a great gaming experience for a cheap price, I strongly recommend the game.Ps even toasters can run it and have it look good.			"

												Betrayer is definitely not what I'd call ordinary. It's strange - both visually and in terms of plotline. It's also nearly as vague in its explanation of the world as Dark Souls is vague in its everything, as you receive all your information from various clues and paper scraps scattered throughout the different zones. However, after you grow accustomed to the grayscale world and its darker counterpart, you'll come to appreciate this colour scheme as well as the superb employment of sound and tension as you uncover the island's mysteries. Also, I have never felt so much enjoyment from using a bow in any other game. Betrayer is definitely worth the price.			"

												Have you ever had your mouth and eyes wide opened while looking at something? That was my constant reaction during the 9 hours it took me to finish Betrayer 100%. During these 9 hours I journeyed through these sinister and ominous places filled with mystery in this colorless and lonely world. Filled with nothing but skeletons and other horrors during the unnatural night and Spaniards that resemble more beast than men during the day. I had never heard about this title before. Seeing it's black and red image with a skeleton walking on a hill quickly seduced me into trying it out. Before I could say 'I love this game' I was already in awe when I started the game on the shore of an unknown land after a shipwreck on a black and white world where at the ring of a bell the sun vanishes from the sky and the unsettling terrors of the night come out to haunt the land.Betrayer is extremely beautiful in it's black&white choice of art direction. If you want you can access the options menu and get rid of the black&white and add color to the game but I really don't see why anyone would do that if they want to experience the game in all it's dreadful wonder. I have only chose to add color after I finished everything just so I could see how everything looked. But after a couple of minutes of seeing how things looked with color I instantly changed back to the black&white because I think that's how the game should be played in my opinion and that's how I enjoy it. I think it adds to the strangeness and mystery of the whole adventure. Regardless of the visual art choice you prefer, the game is beautiful with or without color. But give it a shot with black&white and after you finish the game you can always replay it all colorful.You start off at the beach like I mentioned before and as you make your way through the woods you come across Spaniards that growl and moan like animals and charge at you the moment they see you. You then reach a village where you meet a Woman in Red and that is where the game truly begins. You can free roam as you see fit. The game is composed of diferent zones where you can play. You start in one zone and if you want to change places you gotta go to the waypoint that connects that place to the other and go through the loading screen in order to change locations. Kind of like Fable. Where instead of having an open world like the GTA franchise. You have a world that you can free roam as you want but it's sectioned into zones.On these zones you will perform the necessary quests to advance the story. You will find the locations of your objectives via your compass displayed at the top of the screen and via a haunting sound that guides you towards your destination. At the ring of a bell that exists in each town of each of the diferent sections of the map, you turn day into night and vice versa. Your objectives will consist of talking to ghosts and finding out what happened to them and that place. This will involve walking around the map looking for places to dig, shrines to cleanse and finding journals and letters and other types of items that will help you piece together the story of each individual trapped in that land as well as the story of the haunting place where you find yourself in. So maybe it can get a bit repetitive though I must say that I never got bored because everything was so hauntingly seductive to find out. At least for me because I am a big fan of games that set a nice dreadful and mysterious mood.The stunning visuals goes hand to hand with the sounds present throughout the game. While the game only has 2 or 3 actual songs that are used basically on the menu and at the credits. It doesn't need an actual soundtrack to add to the imersion of the game.The menacing stillness of everything around you is amazing. Everything is so frozen in place and quiet it's unerving. From time to time the wind will blow through the fields, masking your footsteps sounds and thus enabling you to sneak up on enemies and it's a sound that you will quickly associate to running as fast as you can while the wind is blowing. The sound you hear when you headshot a Spaniard with your bow at a rather long distance is extremely satisfying. The growls of said Spaniards when they are alerted of your presence will make look around everytime. The sounds of wraiths and skeletons will unerve you. And the sound you have to follow in order to get to your objective and the sound the bell makes when you ring it will stay in your head throughout the whole game. Those two sounds stuck with me for a while as I thought they were really awesome.The game was very fun for me to play. I can't express this enough but to me the most important thing is the ambience, the mood the game sets and that weird gut feeling you get. By saying this I am not disregarding the aspects that compose a game such as gameplay mechanics. But to me if a game sets a good mood and ambience it won't matter that much if the other aspects of the game aren't as good. This is what I look for and I was extremely surprised to find Betrayer in this day and age. Making something diferent that modern games no longer try to do. Games have become rather generic but once in a while you find a cult classic like this that deserves to have a bigger community. Like I said, mood and ambience are very very important to me and Betrayer nails it. I was instantly gripped to it the moment I saw everything black&white. It fills me with a will to find out more. To think there are mysteries and secrets on that universe that I must uncover. Wanting to find out what everything means, the 'why' and 'what' of everything. It's a game that leaves me going ""Han? What is this? What the hell? I don't understand!"". Even after you finish the story you hope there is more!Betrayer will seduce you from the start with it's gripping ambience. And will keep you hooked with the amazing mood set through out the game. The sound of the bell will get you everytime. That journal you just found and read will tell a story that will stay with you for a while. And it's these things that matter to me. These simple things like reading a journal and at the end of it thinking ""what does it mean? does this mean something?"" that make a game go a long way and immerse those who play it. You will most certainly feel the palpable dreadful strangeness of this hauntingly captivating world as you immerse yourself in it.			"

												I’m still not completely sure how I felt about this one. Betrayer is a FPS exploration horror game from Blackpowder Games. Let’s get rocking.The GoodI just want to lead with this: when it comes to reloading, Betrayer has it’s♥♥♥♥♥♥together. You can reload your gun while you sprint, consult the map (which I didn’t know I had until about three hours into playing the game), open chests, interact with various objects, jump, etc. Every shooter game out there should be taking notes when it comes to this. Every. Last. One.Using flintlock weapons throughout the game was very fun and, for me, a first outside of the Assassin’s Creed franchise. (Well, excluding the Gekokujo mod for Mount & Blade: Warband, but that is a story for another time). The guns were incredibly accurate (something which is, by no means, historically accurate, but what is?) which made sniping enemies at a distance not only feasible, but a regular occurrence.I loved the quasi-day and night cycle. Ringing the bell in the game turns the area from day to night and unleashes different enemies upon you as well as revealing wraiths and lost souls scattered across the maps for you to track down.Betrayer had a consistently unsettling atmosphere. The lack of music was a big addition here, but also the feeling of loneliness. Apart from the wraiths, monsters, and the mysterious hooded lady, you’re completely alone in a fairly large wilderness. It was great and it really worked for the game.The BadCompared to everything else you encountered, I felt like the skeletal enemies were poorly animated; as were the spider creatures. This was my only real complaint though.The MehThe game being set in (predominantly) monochrome was kind of cool to begin with, but it gets old after an hour or two. Splashes of red break up the monotony, but it’s just not enough. That’s right kids, don’t be fooled by the trailer, this game is colored in black, white, and red.While the weapons are fun to use, there are not many of them. You’ve got your trusty knife and you have access to longbows, shortbows, crossbows, flintlock pistols, and muskets (all of varying quality). There are unique weapons to find, but they don’t look any different from any other weapons.There are not many types of enemies you’ll end up fighting either. You’ve got your conquistadors, big conquistadors, natives, ash people, spider creatures, skeletons, and demons. That’s all there is.Verdict: YeaFor a $9.99 price tag, Betrayer is worth a playthrough or two. It’s a fun game with an interesting story, but it doesn’t have a whole lot of replay value. If it goes on sale, definitely pick it up.			"

I would really love to see more games like this, or more games from this company.  The HUD is a little rough, but it more than makes up for it in story and gameplay. And in the barebone HUD's defense... it definitely does convey all the information you need, it just doesn't look pretty doing it.Honestly, this game is a work of art and I would highly suggest experiencing it.EditJust beat it and I have to say this game is nothing short of a masterpiece.

												Betrayer is a PHENOMENAL game in my opinion. I was browsing steam one day and saw this game on sale for $5 and was just like, ""Hell, why not?"" I have not regretted that decision for a single moment. In a quick synopsis of the game, you play as an early American settler ditched on an uncharted part of America. You soon find out that you can talk to spirits and that early America is haunted by  ghostly Spaniards  I'll let you figure out the rest. Worth the buy, would recommend to anyone who wants a fun time.10/10 would  kill another giant Spaniard  again			"

												A very artistic, narrative game. There isn't a whole lot of depth to the actual gameplay, just a bunch of ""run here, now back to there, now here again"" plus some rudimentary combat. But where this game really shines is in the story that it tells. It's also a pretty long quest to do and see everything in the game. It took me about 10-12 hours to 100% the story, plus a couple more for the achievements.7/10 - If this game was a movie, I'd Netflix and chill with my non-existent girlfriend while watching it.			"

												You've been shipwrecked, you've landed on a strange island populated by spaniards and the spirits of the dead... but what is your quest? Who is this helpful maiden in red? Why is going on around here? Those questions are what you must find answers to during the playthrough of this game.There is two phases in the gameplay - one is the ""light"", where you explore the island for chests, clues and cleanse it of the various enemies around. The other is the ""darkness"", what you're doing there is finding the spirits of those who have died during to various reasons and helping them to find peace by completing the investigations they put upon the player. Even though most of the gameplay is running around the forest with either some sort of bow or musket, it feels so serene doing it. It can be due to being pretty easy right up till the last fight, that is the only real challenging part.The graphics and artstyle of 'Betrayer' is BEAUTIFUL. By default mostly everything is in black and white during the ""light"" and black and red during the ""darkness"", the only thing in the ""light"" that breaks the contrast is the red color that lights up chests, arrows, loot and the beforementioned maiden.I found this game entertaining and would recommend it to anyone, the only thing that could bring it down is the investigations. They become somewhat tiresome towards the end of the game and it feels mostly like fillers.			"

												If you like exploration games such as The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, then you may enjoy this game. While I didn't find the game scary or even remotely 'horror-esque,' it did have an unsettling nature to the game itself that made me curious as to what was really going on. Even with the in-game map (which is a recent update, if I recall correctly), there was still a lot that had to be found on your own alongside an interesting story - and even the story is somewhat fragmented in the way that it is presented. I rather enjoyed being able to piece together things before they were confirmed.However, the fact that there is combat in this game might make some not want to play it, as there are certain times where you have to clear an area before you can progress. I didn't hate the combat, as there were a few options that you had to consider depending on what you come up against, but it wasn't the shining star of the game. If you dislike FPS-style combat with early American / british weapons, you may not enjoy it overall since there is no way to skip certain fights. It's not the focus of the game, luckily. 8/10			"

No more excuses for garbage pixel art assets with the ""retro"" cop out because the devs wanted an art budget of $1.50. Step your game up, indies. Blackpowder just served you.- The default desaturated filter is interesting, and I can appreciate it for what it is. That being said, you can absolutely play the game in color, and I set mine to be in color within the first hour. This doesn't apply to Otherworld (which will make sense once you play the game).- The setting and story are cool, and I thoroughly enjoyed the investigation aspect of it.The bad:- Lack of polish, particularly with audio. There are almost no sounds in this game. No music at all.- The investigation aspect falls into the same trap as a lot of games with investigation: too much walking. Walking is not gameplay, but you're going to be doing a lot of it, even with quick travel.- The ending is utter crapola. I won't spoil it here, but it's pretty contrived and pointless.- Speaking of pointless, you can run around the handful of maps after beating the game, for some reason.- It's very short. I beat it with 100% completion in less than 10 hours.Though I could come up with more bad than good bullet points, I think the good points are worth more. Definitely worth a play.			"

												I love first person shooters that have ranged weapons but break from standard FPS conventions. In the case of Betrayer, the convention break to get used to is painfully long reload time with muzzle loaded muskets and ball and powder pistols. It's one of the few games I've played where the reload time really does force you into cycling through your weapons because you just won't have time to reload them when being chased by multiple enemies. I think it could have gone further in this area, since there's 5 primary weapon types but you can only equip 3. I would have loved to cycle through them and fire them off, then swap to another, fire its one shot, etc.The story is interesting. It's something that only works in text, which is always interesting to observe. This is because the words being said by characters are true, but the picture they paint quite often is not, which was a really unique experience in a world full of unreliable narrators.The core mechanics for the story progression start off intriguing and fresh, but by the first couple of areas, you'll have pretty much seen what you'll be doing the rest of the game. That doesn't mean it isn't intriguing, however.If you like slower paced, atmospheric first person games, you should check out Betrayer.			"

												This game doesnt really seem all that remarkable mechanically or visually but perhaps these limitations were intetional because they work towards adding tension to the game and its a very tense game.  I found myself often jumping in my seat due to being surprised by enemies or events, the sound design contributes greatly to this. It is all around a very dark experience, whether you are learning about the horrifying tragedy that befell all the characters in the game or fighting against the beastial spaniards or dark inhabitents of the otherworld a sense of dread descends upon and hangs over you while you play.  I especially appreciate the story elements to the game the events that you uncover are truly horrifying.  I think the setting of this kind of new world lost colony thing is pretty fresh, cant say i've played a game that used that before(not saying there arent any).  All in all I highly reccomend this experience.			"

												Having played the game some hours I can't say I have anything to complain about except there being a small drumlike sound when an enemy has spotted you, which removes the pant wetting moments you'd have otherwise.The atmosphere is amazing, and the world really feels empty and cold in an amazing way, it is open endless wilderness with content scattered around for you to find on your own.Finding the clues, piecing together the mystery part by part is also a rather refreshing experience seeing as you get ♥♥♥♥ all help from any objective or mapmarkers(big plus in my book).And ringing the bell for the first time having the already uncomfortably eerie world get even darker and more unpleasent? This game is a very refreshing, hard, and new experience for me within the horror/mystery genre.No cheap jumpscares, no cliche tropes or any of that copy paste sillyness. This is simply a great gaming experience for a cheap price, I strongly recommend the game.Ps even toasters can run it and have it look good.			"

												Betrayer is definitely not what I'd call ordinary. It's strange - both visually and in terms of plotline. It's also nearly as vague in its explanation of the world as Dark Souls is vague in its everything, as you receive all your information from various clues and paper scraps scattered throughout the different zones. However, after you grow accustomed to the grayscale world and its darker counterpart, you'll come to appreciate this colour scheme as well as the superb employment of sound and tension as you uncover the island's mysteries. Also, I have never felt so much enjoyment from using a bow in any other game. Betrayer is definitely worth the price.			"

												I can honestly say this is the best exploration game I've bought in a while. This game has unique weapons, a huge map, undead enemies, and so much more. It gives you the feeling that your being watched at all times and danger around every turn. It's like playing Fall Out 4 with GraFix Texture Overhaul 2.1 (As it should be). If you don't like the hair standing up on your neck, don't buy the game, unless it's a gift for someone that knows what a good game is. Rating: 10/10			"

												I'd describe ""Betrayer"" as a dark detective and exploring FPS. It may not sound that interesting, but it's really a good game, one of a kind.An FPS where you can use long or short bows, crossbows, tomahawks (for throwing or as a quick melee attack when enemies get too close), pistols and muskets. What's kind of cool about the pistols and muskets, you gotta reload them - the OLD SCHOOL way.I also really like the black, white and red thing going on, it's appealing to me. Should you not be very fond of it, you can just add colour through the options menu.			"

												Starts off very fun and difficult and a bit scary too. As the game progresses you will learn what to look and listen for and figure out the different mechanics and types of enemies. So far so very good. But for me the last part of the game just absolutely ruined it. It feels completely unpolished and simply frustrating. So far the game was a solid 78/100 for me, but the last part drops it somewhere where I didn't finish the game myself but watched the rest in a youtube-video. In the spoiler I will explain, why: After you discovered all the wraiths, pretty much cleared all the areas and your equipment is so good that killing enemies is easy you have to release all the wraiths in order for the story to progress. If you try to take on the final boss before that it will just spawn endless waves of monsters. Now here is the thing: For some wraiths I apparently missed some stuff, so I couldn't release them all even though I collected all the clues and had no more talking-options available. So the game apparently needs me to search all the maps all over again because I missed something small somewhere. Without an indicator where you found something or where you had been already (like a fog of war on the map f.e.) this becomes an absolutely frustrating experience. Also the ending is bad, because unnecessarily unexplainable and it feels very rushed. Would not recommend like this.  "

												Very confusing in the beginning, but after you figure out what it's about (cleaning ""corrupted"" totems by destroying undead stuff in some kind of twilight zone) it became pretty uninteresting pretty quickly. Aside from the main plot, it's a pretty basic and blandly repetitive game, after the novelty effect has worn off. Couldn't even be bothered to play it through. I'd rate it ""so-so"" or ""meh"" if that were possible.You can't enter buildings (i.e. maps feel like 15 years ago) and if you crank up the colour the initial black and white ""wow"" effect gives way to mediocre landscape design and averagy graphics capabilities that look dated even on a high-end machine.

												I think a lot of the other reviews will give most a good idea of what the game entails, so, I'll fill in a couple gaps.I'm running this on a PC (i7 - GTX690 - SB Audio - Triple Monitors) with all the graphics pretty much maxed and the frame rates are smooth with no stutters. The game started in my native resolution of 5760x1080 so aside from maxing out the other graphics I didn't have to do anything else, the aspect ratio (100) is good.The game itself is actually fun and does do a good job of pulling you into the story overall with little notes left around to give you hints of things that transpired before you arrived.  I only have less then an hour into it now but it's enough for me to say ""Hmmm, well that's interesting, I think I'll push ahead and learn more"", so I'll be putting a lot more time into this.I did get this at the sale price and if you like games of this nature then this is a MUST buy, if it's at full price then it's up to the buyer, I'd check and see how much actual play time is involved but in any case, even at full price (so far) it looks to be worth it and priced well.Bottom Line, I like it, it plays well and keeps me interested enough to dig deeper while having enough badguys for me to kick their fannys...

												Horror, in my opinion, is one of the most undeveloped genres in gaming. Not for the lack of trying, obviously, but for the lack of originality. How many awesome horror settings are out there? Countless amount, but most developers stick with something known and familiar: asylums, haunted towns, schools full of ghosts of virgins. Boring.Well, in terms of setting Betrayer is definitely not boring.Still, it is a very specific game, clearly more oriented towards an 'old school' type of gamers, who're used to a very slowly developing story, thick atmosphere, that doesn't captivate you at once, but is rather chewing it's way through you a bite at a time. Nevertheless, Betrayer has a solid core gameplay, rich and captivating atmosphere, and black and white gamma that can be toggled to your likeness (or turned off completely), which is nice.Just give the game some time to deploy itself. You'll get drawn from there.__And I've got to mention another of my experiences with the game. Thing is, I started playing it long ago, just after it was released. So technically my savefile was of a very ""young"" version of the game, before the patches. When I resumed my playthrough recently, I discovered that the game's last achievement simply refuses to be gained, even though I met all the required conditions. Since I wanted to get all the achievements for the game that I liked quiet a lot, I wrote an email to the developer Larry. And he replied just 2 days later! He apologized for the bug and sent me a savefile to solve the problem. I mean, such a fast response from a developer even 1,5 years after his game's initial release - that's pretty sick.+2 to the developers' coolness.			"

												Betrayer has a beautiful art style and a somewhat good combat system.The graphics and the ambiance are good in their own way and the mysteries you solve while completing quests are intelligently designed. Most of the dialogues hide clever and dark details on what you will soon discover. However all the msytreries you solve and the quests completed will lead you to expect a decent and satisfying ending. I can tell you beforehand that it will not happen. The game has a unsatisfying ending and i don't say this just because i personally didn't like it. Why i say the ending sucks because  the only character that exists in this game besides you and who happens to have a very well designed strong character will act out and add some cliché elements to story  . Overall i believe this is a good game that's worth a shot and i would gladly play if a sequel were to come out.			"

												Full Review:A first-person open-world-survival horror game set in the 17th Century New World presented in a bold monochromatic visual style. Is this refreshing recipe bound to succeed?No intro, cutscene or voiceover explains what happened. I wake up on a beach. Everything is black or white (not even gray). On the horizon I see a wrecked ship, there is only one direction I can take: A small path leading into the island.Soon I notice something red stand out in the monochromatic but serene looking dense forest of the island. Before I know it a Spanish conquistador with glowing red demonic eyes is out for my blood - his growl lets me know that he’s not really human anymore. Thankfully I have a bow and a knife to defend yourself.After these first intense moments as well as an mysterious encounter with a woman in red, Betrayer got me hooked. Venturing out into the wilderness where I discover graves, handwritten notes or other clues and hints that tell me more about what happened on the island give me the feeling that I love the most when playing a new game. Exploring and getting to know a new and strange world.Yet soon after I discover that Betrayer greatest strength lies somewhere else: After some events that I don’t want to spoil you encounter ghosts of deceased that speak in riddles.These lost souls and their story unfold like little detective cases. You need to find evidence, murder weapons or remains of the ghosts to solve what lead to their demise. Their mostly terrible fates are not only well written and interesting, they also create an atmosphere of desperation and really makes you feel that the island is not a place you wanna stay for a longer time.As interesting as these ghost mysteries are, as problematic is their integration in the gameplay. After figuring out how the game and the environment is set up, you are basically just running from clue to clue and fight every enemy that pops up in between. The game keeps the battle interesting by offering a good weapon roster like Tomahawks, Rifles and Crossbows - all with different attributes in the RPG side of the game. The combat encourages you to plan ahead a bit as stealth gives you an advantage and realistically long reload  times force you to rather switch weapons, but after a while it gets repetitive and there aren’t really a lot of different enemy types. The AI is not really challenging as most foes just chase you straight down once they see you.All in all, Betrayer is a very interesting game that definitely tries new things in a refreshing scenario. The visual style, the writing as well as the gameplay mechanics are good and interesting, but combat and exploration gets repetitive after the first two areas and the horror subsides after you become familiar with the few enemy types. I still enjoyed my stay on the island and would like to revisit the place in a possible sequel with more refined mechanics.			"

Posted: January 27, 2015
												One of the most well-paced, compelling and atmospheric first person ""action"" games I have played in a long time. I will summarize my thoughts categorically in the following bullet points.* The combat is slow-paced and challenging but ultimately rewarding. Multiple weapons are unlocked and can be upgraded throughout the game, and the variety is adequate. Enemy variety is not exceptional either, but the deliberate methodology required to dispatch hostiles reliably makes the combat more tactics focused yet somehow nothing about the it feels forced or obtrusive. In other words, you might be surprised with how enjoyable it is to exploit simple mechanics like line of sight and the terrain in order to deal with encounters creatively and effectively.* The game world is one that adequately balances the threat of the unknown with the reward of exploration. Enemies often lie in ambush when you are off the beaten paths, but collectibles and monies are scattered across the maps serve as adequate encouragement to explore. Nonetheless, it still combines well with the other aspects of the game to accomplish it's ultimate goal; you will feel as if this is truly a land of the forsaken. * The story is purposely vague at first but is willing to offer answers to those willing to go deep inside the dark and twisted rabbit hole that it is. It consists of an unexpectedly dark collection of tales about betrayal, suicide and human savagery. I thought it would simply be a matter of ""we are all dead because of the spooky skeletons"", but I was (un)pleasantly surprised by it, and it is this aspect of the game that is perhaps the one I find to be most memorable.* The visual aesthetics of the game are, oddly enough, the thing that I was least impressed by (and by ""impressed"" I mean it quite literally as ""that which left the least impression on me"") despite the obvious hard work that had gone into it. The enemies appeared intimidating, the items looked realistic, and the use of red to highlight objects is more than just a gimmick once you've been engrossed by the atmosphere of the game. The look of the terrain and objects in the game is all tied together very well, stylistically speaking. Besides that though, graphics are not something that I pay that much attention in a game to unless something about it is very unique. And to be frank about the black-and-white filter(s), it just felt off to me and after no more than an hour or two I had lowered the contrast and increased the saturation to slightly more natural levels. I like that the option is there for those that find it just a bit too harsh on the eyes, and I feel as if the changes I made kept the original feeling well enough to not impact my overall experience negatively.* The audio design is minimalistic, but entirely functional. Perhaps there could be more work done to add music and improve the sound effects and maybe-just-maybe add some voice acting, but I think works well enough without those things. In fact, the lack of music actually helps further impress the game's lonely and bleak atmosphere, at least for me.			"

												The plot is less one big grand thing, and more just a lot of smaller happenings.  The story telling is generally pretty solid, though at times it does rely a bit too heavily on the location finding mechanic.   I do appreciate, however, that effort was made to avoid simply giving you a big glowing exclamation point.   It is a bit short, but I feel it doesn't overstay its welcome. The graphics are generally gorgeous, the sound design is inspired if not perfectly executed.  The environments are pretty if somewhat repetitive.  The enemies don't show much diversity, but serve the purpose of giving you something to shoot at, and can be quite challenging if you're not careful.  All in all, I rather liked this game.  It has generally solid mechanics, gameplay, and storytelling.  If some of those things were not stellar, none of them were poorly done.			"

												Well this game got me suprised i will tell you. And in a good way.Horror surivival game where you are trying to survive and solve clues to open up the world. You start with a bow and later and you are limited with ammo so dont shoot like crazy. Good thing is that you can pick up your arrows if you dont goto far away. You will be collecting old gold coins of the scary souls you kill and with that you wiil be able to buy upgrades ex more ammo upgrades, quiver upgrades, more helath, sneaking etc. Some enemies you kill you can get weapons like a flint pistol and flint rifle, same goes here you are limited with ammo wich you can buy at store or pick up from dead enemies if you are lucky to find some.Out in the world you will be finding hidden cheasts, clues and if lucky some boxes with ammo. You can allways buy ammo from store in the unlocked camps. In the camps you can also heal yourself, phew. ;)Anyway i enjoy this game alot. Its designed to be in black and white but you can if you want put colours on but then you will loose the atmosphere the developer has put in the game. The enemies are colored red in normal world but as soon you get the soul dimension you will meet skeletons wich are white in a deeper black and scarier world dimension. You will probarly be tipping on your toes the first time. ;)I have been sneaking alot in this game because the enjoyment of putting 1 arrow kill in the head is awesome. And later  in the other dimension you will walk slow tipping because you can barely see anything but you will hear skeletons razzle but not seeing them before they are running againts you.Another cool way If you want? You can change options so you drop your loot if killed.  If dropped you have 1 chance when you resurrect to get it back where you died. Myself is to coward and saving that option untill i have finished the game. :))GFx 8-10 (Gfx and effect is really nicely executed and the atmosphere did get me chilling cold)SFx 7-10 (Sounds is great in this game and i understand why they have the forrest atmosphere. cool)Design 9-10 (GFx art style is really clever, you will have no problems enjoying it)Please note! I have not finished the game because iam looking everywhere to find all hidden stuff. And iam enjoying to sneak kill those soldiers hidden. And if lucky getting some coins or weapons to use in store. ;) I will still gladly recommend this game. YES!...(I have found several spelling errors but i will sort that later becase time her is ZZZzzz )			"

												You've been shipwrecked, you've landed on a strange island populated by spaniards and the spirits of the dead... but what is your quest? Who is this helpful maiden in red? Why is going on around here? Those questions are what you must find answers to during the playthrough of this game.There is two phases in the gameplay - one is the ""light"", where you explore the island for chests, clues and cleanse it of the various enemies around. The other is the ""darkness"", what you're doing there is finding the spirits of those who have died during to various reasons and helping them to find peace by completing the investigations they put upon the player. Even though most of the gameplay is running around the forest with either some sort of bow or musket, it feels so serene doing it. It can be due to being pretty easy right up till the last fight, that is the only real challenging part.The graphics and artstyle of 'Betrayer' is BEAUTIFUL. By default mostly everything is in black and white during the ""light"" and black and red during the ""darkness"", the only thing in the ""light"" that breaks the contrast is the red color that lights up chests, arrows, loot and the beforementioned maiden.I found this game entertaining and would recommend it to anyone, the only thing that could bring it down is the investigations. They become somewhat tiresome towards the end of the game and it feels mostly like fillers.			"

												This duotone open world fps is creepy. Not only for eerie atmosphere and jumpscares , but also the tragic story of everyone in a colony. Pro:Eerie atmosphereThe duotone sin city-ish colour is lovely, but for a long playtime, i suggest to choose normal colour to help your eyes.Good storiesCons:Many unexplainable things. (or the dev tend to have a sequel for this one?)Need more enemy type(IMO) This game tend to be a stealth game with scarce ammo and lethal enemy (and really slooooow reload time), but sometimes we are force to do a rambo-like war with plenty of enemies.Ending is kinda dissapointing. As far as i know, there's only one ending despite of plenty in game choices.conclution : 7.5/10 - i will never ring a bell anymore			"

												Full Review:A first-person open-world-survival horror game set in the 17th Century New World presented in a bold monochromatic visual style. Is this refreshing recipe bound to succeed?No intro, cutscene or voiceover explains what happened. I wake up on a beach. Everything is black or white (not even gray). On the horizon I see a wrecked ship, there is only one direction I can take: A small path leading into the island.Soon I notice something red stand out in the monochromatic but serene looking dense forest of the island. Before I know it a Spanish conquistador with glowing red demonic eyes is out for my blood - his growl lets me know that he’s not really human anymore. Thankfully I have a bow and a knife to defend yourself.After these first intense moments as well as an mysterious encounter with a woman in red, Betrayer got me hooked. Venturing out into the wilderness where I discover graves, handwritten notes or other clues and hints that tell me more about what happened on the island give me the feeling that I love the most when playing a new game. Exploring and getting to know a new and strange world.Yet soon after I discover that Betrayer greatest strength lies somewhere else: After some events that I don’t want to spoil you encounter ghosts of deceased that speak in riddles.These lost souls and their story unfold like little detective cases. You need to find evidence, murder weapons or remains of the ghosts to solve what lead to their demise. Their mostly terrible fates are not only well written and interesting, they also create an atmosphere of desperation and really makes you feel that the island is not a place you wanna stay for a longer time.As interesting as these ghost mysteries are, as problematic is their integration in the gameplay. After figuring out how the game and the environment is set up, you are basically just running from clue to clue and fight every enemy that pops up in between. The game keeps the battle interesting by offering a good weapon roster like Tomahawks, Rifles and Crossbows - all with different attributes in the RPG side of the game. The combat encourages you to plan ahead a bit as stealth gives you an advantage and realistically long reload  times force you to rather switch weapons, but after a while it gets repetitive and there aren’t really a lot of different enemy types. The AI is not really challenging as most foes just chase you straight down once they see you.All in all, Betrayer is a very interesting game that definitely tries new things in a refreshing scenario. The visual style, the writing as well as the gameplay mechanics are good and interesting, but combat and exploration gets repetitive after the first two areas and the horror subsides after you become familiar with the few enemy types. I still enjoyed my stay on the island and would like to revisit the place in a possible sequel with more refined mechanics.			"

												One of the most well-paced, compelling and atmospheric first person ""action"" games I have played in a long time. I will summarize my thoughts categorically in the following bullet points.* The combat is slow-paced and challenging but ultimately rewarding. Multiple weapons are unlocked and can be upgraded throughout the game, and the variety is adequate. Enemy variety is not exceptional either, but the deliberate methodology required to dispatch hostiles reliably makes the combat more tactics focused yet somehow nothing about the it feels forced or obtrusive. In other words, you might be surprised with how enjoyable it is to exploit simple mechanics like line of sight and the terrain in order to deal with encounters creatively and effectively.* The game world is one that adequately balances the threat of the unknown with the reward of exploration. Enemies often lie in ambush when you are off the beaten paths, but collectibles and monies are scattered across the maps serve as adequate encouragement to explore. Nonetheless, it still combines well with the other aspects of the game to accomplish it's ultimate goal; you will feel as if this is truly a land of the forsaken. * The story is purposely vague at first but is willing to offer answers to those willing to go deep inside the dark and twisted rabbit hole that it is. It consists of an unexpectedly dark collection of tales about betrayal, suicide and human savagery. I thought it would simply be a matter of ""we are all dead because of the spooky skeletons"", but I was (un)pleasantly surprised by it, and it is this aspect of the game that is perhaps the one I find to be most memorable.* The visual aesthetics of the game are, oddly enough, the thing that I was least impressed by (and by ""impressed"" I mean it quite literally as ""that which left the least impression on me"") despite the obvious hard work that had gone into it.

												It's not like it's just explore, fighting and try to understand clues and make investigation.I think the deeper sense of the game is to show us 2 levels of our mind, our psyche. We are normal people, open to everybody, world is colourful ( when it's day in Betrayer ). But when we ring bell ( go deeper in our psyche in case of something especially for us, good or bad memories ), we will feel more, we will feel and see things that we don't understand in our daily routine. The demons will be awake...Probably i'm wrong and they are just my insane feelings and thoughts, but for me it is the main sense of game, even if creators of Betrayer didn't know about it.9/10, excellent graphic and atmosphere.

I bought this in a sale and can honestly say that I wish I had thrown my doubt into the wind and bought this, it's an astounding game, for all those who don't want to play the game in black and white there is an option to turn the colour on :), either way the games art is excellent and I found myself extremely wrapped up in its story. definite 11/10 from me. The only thing left to say is that the ending is kind of a WTF moment where I wasn't quite sure if everything was tied up or if it was being left open for a sequel (please god let there be a sequel, I'll buy it the day its released I promise XD).

												Betrayer has a beautiful art style and a somewhat good combat system.The graphics and the ambiance are good in their own way and the mysteries you solve while completing quests are intelligently designed. Most of the dialogues hide clever and dark details on what you will soon discover. However all the msytreries you solve and the quests completed will lead you to expect a decent and satisfying ending. I can tell you beforehand that it will not happen. The game has a unsatisfying ending and i don't say this just because i personally didn't like it. Why i say the ending sucks because  the only character that exists in this game besides you and who happens to have a very well designed strong character will act out and add some cliché elements to story  . Overall i believe this is a good game that's worth a shot and i would gladly play if a sequel were to come out.			"

												This game has about 30 minutes of content spread over the course of six hours.  Over that time I was able to think what it was like, who it would appeal to.  The closest thing I could think was it was like playing an MMORPG, but with bad graphics, no leveling, less well designed weapons.  What it shares with an MMO is that you will do the same action over and over, you will cross the same terrain over and over, and you will travel from one area to the next just to shoot the same 3 enemies the entire time.  Also the enemies are stupid.  Like - run at you and hit kind of stupid. Yep! Just like an MMO.So after you've completed your mandatory takss (90% of the time you will be running across the map activating a checkpoint or required script) you are paid back with a pathetic end, not a single cool cutscene nor explanation... the game just ends.Ummm positives...The one music score was okThe fast travel system was ok The exposition was completely dull, so there's almost nothing to say with regards to it's delivery.  There was never an explanation of who you were, why you were doing stuff, who the people who growled like dogs and the flaming indians were (literally flaming).Hated it.			"

This video review is from the first time I played the game, and I quite like it so far! I've played it another couple hours after this, and still haven't lost interest. The game storyline is not obvious, you must dig, and search to figure out what has happened in this world. Honestly, I still don't really know what's going on, but I'm enjoying the journey! If you like a good horror/mystery, challenging gameplay and unique visuals, this is a great game to check out! Wish I had looked into it sooner.			"

												Ugh not a very good game at all, 3/10.  Buggy gameplay (almost gamebreaking in the final part), poor AI, the ""art-style"" was an afterthought to presumably give it more of a unique selling point (the proof in that being you can turn the colour on - and the last area wouldn't have been done differently to the rest of the game had this not been the intention).  That ploy worked in my case but I wish it hadn't.  Expect to run from one place to another not really knowing what's going on and above all else repetitively.  Pity because there are some nice ideas.			"

												A wonderfully cryptic story with a Madworld visual style that is unfortunately let down by less than stellar gameplay. The premise is simple but effective: piece together what has happened through notes and talking to mysterious figures (dead? alive? are you?!) while relying heavily on stealth. As with anything like this at first it all seems fun and simple enough to either sneak into position or wait for an enemy to move out of place but with the wide-open map and the imprecise routes this becomes incredibly tedious.Furthermore you have factor in that the map does not reveal what areas you have visited, what items have been retrieved, place of note discovered and does not give you the option to place your own map notes in lieu of an automated system. This can be quite frustrating when you switch between the ""light"" and ""dark"" worlds (spoiler I guess?) and trying to keep track of where you've been becomes tiresome, especially if you find yourself returning to camp to heal and restock where needed.Despite all that I would recommend at least giving this game a shot because it's strangely enchanting and I'm sure there's a diehard, old-school fanatic out there who has the patience to really enjoy the game for what it is. However there's just a few features missing that would make this game possible for someone like me.			"

												Betrayer is a game made by Blackpowder Games, a new development studio made up of members split off from Monolith Games, the creator of many of my favorite games. I don't know who went where in the split between what now remains of Monolith and what is now Blackpowder Games, but considering one group went on to make a creative and unique game called Betrayer and the other went on to mash together Ubisoft's franchise catalogue into one big homogenized Lord of the Rings game, I think it's somewhat clear to me which group to look forward to in the future. Betrayer is largely a game about exploration, and the game's design works fairly well towards it. The game's art style is mostly monochrome (though you can change the color settings in the options if you're a big loser baby), which both gives it a really great look and also serves a gameplay purpose by using color to define things like enemies and items. Sound is also used pretty extensively, serving as your compass as well as providing positional audio cues to help you find enemies before they find you, so headphones are recommended. The combat and story are also well-executed, and finding the stories of each of the members of the settlement is a lot of fun.However, one thing I will note is that the game has changed since I played it in Early Access. In the original releases, you were left to navigate on your own, using the map like you would a real one and navigating using landmarks and sounds. This worked really well in my opinion, and added a lot immersion to the exploration that made it feel like you were navigating a world on your own and not just following a dot on the map. But at some point along the line they updated the game, adding markers to the map that display both your position and the position of almost everything there is to find in the game. This isn't a deal-breaker, as these can all be disabled in the options, but I want to mention them because I would very highly recommend doing so as soon as you get the opportunity to. Leaving the map markers on is practically the equivalent of playing the game with a walkthrough, and I really wish they had defaulted them to being off so that they didn't encourage new players to play the game with them on and just follow the dots.

												This is the video game equivalent of an archaeological dig. Betrayer is presented as an FPS game with stealth mechanics but that's all really very shallow. With only a fistful of enemy types, no bosses and only one model for each weapon with new versions simply increasing stats there's really nothing here but the lore and environment, which you will spend A LOT of time walking through.I still recommend the game because that lore is surprisingly good. It's split up into short bits (ghosts remember things as you remind them, short blurbs written about things you find, scraps of pages strewn about) so you won't feel like you're just reading a book. The game is composed of about a dozen short stories about the life of people in this lost colony, coming together to explain the source of all the madness around you.Rated -1/10, with all eleven points deducted for not having an autorun key.Recommended for anyone who's into lore and mysteries, and has a stack of quarters on hand to hold down the W key for them, though $20 was definitely way too much for such a short game.

												I really wanted to like this game, and for a while I really did.  But in the end I tired of it about halfway through.  Why?  Because, in terms of gameplay, it is just a grind.  The first couple of maps are interesting because little is explained and you are just figuring out what to do and how to play, but then everything is just more of the same for each successive map: scour the map for collectable items while fending off a couple of different types of enemies with a small selection of weapons that are all available very early (although better versions of each become available as time goes on).  There is no sense of progression as nothing really changes from map to map, not even the scenery, so while it is beautiful and all, it is a chore to finish.  On top of that it likes to crash on start-up after taking over the screen, so you have to sign out or reboot to get your desktop back.  Disabling steam overlay helps, but it still does it sometimes, and has done for a long time (look at discussions), so apparently the devs don't think it is worth fixing.			"

												Betrayer is much a game that doesn't hand anything to you and after your starting items and explanation of how the world works, it's much a game that leaves you on your own to fight for everything you have. To be clear for those who are unsure if you like the visual style the game is going for, there are some very flexible options in the game that let you play with the color levels of the game so yes, you can play the game entirely in color even if you feel it might take away from the atmosphere.That being said, Betrayer isn't some big game you should go into expecting a horrorifying experience. Betrayer has a serious level of atmosphere, but it ISN'T a horror game. There's ghosts abound, enemies that can be somewhat unnerving or startling but it is not a horror game. It's a game about fighting off ghostly spaniards with the voices of hunting dogs and other ghastly creatures while trying to find clues as to what happened to this place that left it so lacking of life, a CSI Roanke if you will. That being said, some of the emotional punches of the game are lacking given that for likely budget reasons the game lacks voice actors. I see you running away at the sight of those words, and please don't. Betrayer is a rather interesting game, a great game to get a break from the norm you're used to. You're stuck with colonial era weapons like single shot pistols, bows, rifles and tomahawks (all with their own upsides and downsides) which in addition to the health system at play which gives the intertwined combat and exploration a feel closer to hunting or carefully managing your supplies so you can stay alive longer and keep going.Fights will often turn into an affair where the roles of the hunter and the hunted switch constantly as you and your mostly spaniard persuers trade rather high damage attacks. This is one of the few games I can think of where stealth isn't just a way to play that the game gives you if you for some reason don't prefer going guns blazing, but rather a rather sensible way to lessen your chances of getting seriously hurt and having to head back.That being said, as atmospheric as the game is, and as cool as many of the concepts behind the game are, it can't hide it's budget for long. As cool as the location is and as tense as the combat can be, this is not a game I'd reccomend marathoning. There's about 1 or maybe 2 if you're lucky new enemies every area you progress and after a while the gameplay mechanics can rub you the wrong way after having to listen to the wind and run toward the next clue for the 6th time with the same tricks employed over again. I'd personally reccomend taking breaks and playing something else every area or two just to keep things feeling a tad more fresh.That being said, if you've liked the hunting feeling bits in games like Far Cry 3 or Skyrim, like atmosphere and exploring strange places and want to see a game that's not afraid to put you into a situation where a stand-up fight is not only a costly idea but one that might get you killed later down the line, I can't see a game that would give you a better breath of fresh air.

												Love the game but iwould the ability to add markers to the map and use the overhead compass like in skyrim to navigate. But a word of warning first the game doesnt start you out with that much of a storyline and is slow passed at least to me. the story is worth the wait though.			"

												Clunky combat and hard to see enemies and objects (white view) makes this a annoying game to play. Hitting stuff is also pretty hard but not for the enemy if I move around they still hit me full on if they move I just hope for a lucky shot. The only way you know it will hit your target is if you hit the centre body. Also I feel like I need to use the map function to much to find quest items.			"

												I just can't bring myself to recommend this game. It just doesn't satisfy in any of it's claims. Perhaps as a mystery it has some interest, but I couldn't get past the overall dullness to enjoy it. As a horror game it doesn't do much for me, sure getting my♥♥♥♥♥kicked by a skeletal conquistador would be terrifying in real life, but gets boring quick in this game. As a exploration game it is beautiful. However after about 5 minutes you've seen it all, there's nothing new to see, just a large map to shlep around. To be fair this may be the best way to play the game. turn the difficulty all the way down and the color saturation all the way up and just wander around.As a combat adventure game it just falls flat. Unless you're completely new to gaming there's nothing new here. And what is here is limited and boring. The weapons all feel the same and the enemy AI is simplistic.As a stealth game.... Well it just isn't a stealth game, and they should never have claimed it was. They have their one unique stealth element (wind covering the sound of footsteps) but i is useless in actual gameplay. The enemy detection is absurdly high and unless you know just where they are you are going to be the one snuck up on. Again the story is interesting, and if you can put up with the rest of this dull slog of a game to pick it out you may enjoy it.4/10			"

												In short. Masterpiece.It is very beatifull game with atmosphere of Dark Souls, but with much better controls and graphic. Plot is very nice, and if game is slightly repeting in mechnics it is still very short and don't start to be boring. I finish this game in one day in full (all ghost released) - anyway I just can't turn it off before that. I think it is highest praise to any game. Then you just can't turn it off before the end.I will be waiting another game from this studio. This is for sure. I hope now they have enought money and fame to make longer game with much more text, long plot and scripts, and monsters and all. And once again - graphic was so good on Unreal Engine. They can use it again and again. It is very nice.			"

												Do you like No One Lives Forever? How about No One Lives Forever 2: A Spy in H.A.R.M.S. Way?If you answered yes to any of those, buy this game! If you never heard of them continue reading.The story? Discover that for yourself. An interesting twist on most games where you know the story and have to unravel the mystery of why the story is that way or to find an ending. In this game, you have to discover the story, the background, and see it to resolution. The gameplay is great.You should really wear headphones to get the full audio experience. Sure, there is an option to play it with color, but to complete the experience with headphones and be drawn into the world, you'll need to play it in black and white. The color was just added because there were so many people complaining that it was only black, white, and red. The developers were nice in giving people what they wanted, even at the expense of their vision. Color is nice, and once I beat the game in B&W, I'll probably replay it in color to see what I missed.Highly recommended.			"

												With the small amount of time I played this game (unrelated to its quality,) I can say that it is fantastic, especially considering its ""indie"" status.You start off in what seems to be the middle of nowhere after the ship you boarded to the New World crashes. Along the way you will find the only living soul, as it seems, who immediately foreshadows what the game has in store by telling you to ""Turn back now.""With ignoring that warning, you will discover a real-life -- or is it? -- hell. Just as soon as you find the game repetitive and fairly pointless, ringing the bell in the abandoned colony found in the landscape brings you to a new, dark spirit world that will terrify you.I'll be honest, I never ventured back to the spirit world after my first journey. It was ominous, horrifying, and unsettling.Not many games can legitimately frighten you while you enjoy it, but this one did.			"

												[Taken from my online blog]Well, its a Wednesday today which may be news to you but if it isn't and by some miracle you've actually returned to this site, you'll know that this isn't my usual release date. Something went awry with my schedule however. I was all set to review some game that some right old knob has been asking me to review for a while when I saw that there was a Steam sale. 'Blimey', I thought,' I wonder if any recomended games would be worth buying'. You see, I take punts on games like these. More obscure games that have some sort of gimmick bolted onto the end of it. So I bought the Betrayer.Now I love atmospheric games and having recently weaned myself off Alien Isolation with a bit of Outlast and Betrayer, I have to say I've been craving more. The Betrayer IS an atmospheric game for damn sure. Made by Blackpowder games, this black and white tale takes place in New England and if you're from New England then allow me to tell you that New England actually means America. You arrive stranded on a beach, waking in a anamnesia state with your vision blurred and no other backstory about how you actually got there, so basically just my average Sunday. You can see a few ships off the coast, however you never seem to try to make contact with them. Odd enough when you consider that you are supposed to be trapped there. From there you take a linear path up to your first location serving as the only form of communication between player and game, which is pretty much how the game starts to go on. You are not lead through the game thats for sure. Once you find the first location, Fort Henry, you're pretty much on a free reign to discover at your own pace all the while being blue-balled by a literal red riding hood.The game's gothic influence is a strong aspect I have to say. There's no disputing the fact that the eerie sound design, black and white (with a hint of red) visuals and the spooky monsters you fight all fit the bill of old gothic literature. Having said that though, it reminded me more of those old horror films set in time periods similar to this one (17th century) like Witchfinder General and other masterpieces that have been cut from the same cloth. It's definitely not Five Night's at Freddies where things jump out at you for a few minutes before passing out face-first into the dirt, but Betrayer is asking for more than three pound fifty, so it knows it needs to grip the viewer preferably by the gonads as you're lead through dark forests and solve elaborate and chilling mysteries of the land's previous inhabitants. The lack of direction may be a middle finger to some players who are used to the half arsed games like Skyrim where you can click a location to immediately and inexplicably warp there. In Betrayer you can only use this trick if you're in the specific location and only to travel to the predetermined 'safe points'. I gotta admit, I quite like this system. There will no doubt be a literal horde of angry GTA fans, still wounded from last week, that will claim that the game doesn't direct you enough, but that's just it. The beautiful thing about this system is that you are lost, destined to wander the world in search of the next enlightening piece of the story pie. It feels atmospheric and gothic with only a slight whiff of the pretentious artsy-ness about it which only becomes obvious when the black and white mode is on (which you have the option to switch off). If I were a gambling man, I'd be ready to say that you may be worried for my health at this point viewer. After all, I am the kind of guy who's idea of a wild night is to sit in his room with an oil burner silently getting drunk and slinking into the arms of the weeping abyss of self loathing. But even I like things, and the Betrayer is one of the things I like. It oozes atmosphere all over the place which is pretty difficult to explain when people come to visit. Guest scaring aside however, I like the Betrayer because it's something a bit new. I could play through the thousands of modern warfare games in a week and walk away like I've just been given a frontal wedgie by Hulk Hogan, or I could sit down to play some original games. Sure, modern warfare games are good for spectacle if nothing else but that's not what a game is there for. If someone said you were going to watch a good film and hands you a book that's just a lie and it's the same principle when a game developer gives you what amounts to a film with a few button prompts. Luckily the Betrayer doesn't betray the gaming audience and instead gives us an atmospheric and mysterious little gem that's got a few cracks in it, but ultimately would make Indiana Jones a very happy man.Having said that, there is a point in this game where the atmosphere receives a little hairline fracture. If you've played the game you'll know what I'm talking about because I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but I want you to let me know if you had the same experience. It's a moment in the game where straight-up combat takes sway and you're forced to fight wave after wave of evil dudes, kind of like World War 2 without the fast pace of a heavy machine gun. For the combat here is effective yet slow. As to be expected with a company that names itself after a slow-firing weapon, the combat has some pacing issues in that fighting large numbers of lads can result rather quickly in your brutal demise, which is fine... For a while. However when you're only way to stop the armoured target running towards you is to shoot him with a horribly inaccurate blackpowder weapon that has a 10% chance of deflecting off of the target and there's five of the buggers now so hurry you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I can't help but wonder if there's a bit of a design flaw. I would say that it's intended though. As I mentioned, when you're fighting a reasonable amount of guys with rusty, inaccurate and slow-firing weapons, the encounters with the fast brutal enemies can become all that more intense. After all, man hath no fear of hell, if handed a high-grade assault rifle.8/10- Yes! I've done it! A good review! Well, as good as I can get before downing the rest of the bottle and passing out in a road side ditch.Please be sure to stop by my site to egg me on in my content and help support me and what I do.

												Psychedelic-noir visuals cannot distract me from a game that is more 99 cent Xbox 360 Indie Game than full fledged hard work echoed into a brilliant Indie Game. I'm not impressed with the minimalistic style as I am with games that are much cheaper than this. Perhaps I have not played enough but this game doesn't exactly encourage you to keep playing in any way. There are tons of better RPG's that kick you out of the door and say,"" No explanation, no hand holding."" Better games than this have tried and failed in this respect. Don't get me wrong, I love a good Spanish Inquisition style story, as it is almost never done. I just can't immerse myself in a game that confuses itself ten more times than it confuses me. I hope to see better things in Blackpowder Games' library for I am all for Indie Developers. This is a bit harsh of a review but if you want to make it in the gaming industry you have to do your best to make a perfect game. Even if it isn't in fact perfect. A promising game but lacking enough substance to make it a fully enjoyable Indie experience. Not gonna rate this because I still haven't figured out what it deserves.			"

												Don't play this if you don't want a good scare. It got to me at least, with those sounds ;) A simple little gem in a cool setting. Black/white/red mode sets the mood well. No cinematics, but that's a positive, I like my games 100% gameplay. There's a bit of tedium cleaning up the 'ghosts' right before the end but that's the only negative. I think if you like open world adventure style action RPGs but also FPS shooters, or just like 'medieval stuff', this is a good little one to keep you until the next big one. I thought it was value for money for the 15 hours game time anyway. :) "

The good:Visuals, once you return the colour.The setting. The game is set during the pilgramige to the New World. Atmosphere, particularly the sound. It's great m8. Positioning is very precise and sound is often used as a guidance for points of interest. The eh-not-so-good:Area desgin: despite great visuals, areas are just vast rectangular fields of nothing but same reused meshes and textures. There is very little variety although despite the lack of assets every area feels unique and remarkable in some way. A testament to the area designers who had to work with few materials.Quest design: the investigation is neat in concept and if you forget about gameplay conveniences (such as quest compass), requires you to pay attention to the dialogue but quest progression is extremely linear and all of the backtracking involved make, what could have been, a compelling and engrossing investigative experience, into a nuisance.The bad:Enemies: There is no variety. AI is terrible and very easily exploitable. Backtracking. There is simply way too much of it even with fast travel and quest compass it becomes tedious amd pointless as hell.As for the story:You are a nameless guy that ended up in a 17 century Silent Hill where everyone is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and you have to find out their grimdark stories to make things right. In short, everyone is a horrible human being and it is in your power to cast final judgement and doom them for eternal torment or release them into nothingness. Your choices bear no consequence whatsoever though.All in all, the game appears to have been rushed. A few promising concepts that went nowhere and decent story that is buried under tedious gameplay. P.S.: The game would have benefitted greatly if you could leave markings on the map for navigation, imho.			"

												Good: The visual style is a smart way for players to seek small details in a seemingly endless forest. There are plenty of notable audio cues to guide the player to important quest objects as well as to detect enemies hidden in the forests. The combat mechanics are mostly well built and well polished, the encouters are mostly well balanced with just the right amount of complexity to make them challenging. The writing is creative even to the very end of the game and will still draw enough interest to carry on the story. The visual tones and audio cues allow this game to have a daunting feeling, even when you're 6 hours into the game, you'll steel feel some chill when you go into darkness.Bad: The stealth mechanic is gimmicky, once you shoot an enemy your position is immediately known by all enemies within range of that enemy. 100% stealth kills is not possible in this game. The listening mechanic is also a gimmick that forces that game into a completely linear experience. While it may be possible to complete investigations in different orders, relying on listening will ensure that you complete the game in the same sequence every single time. They should have just used quest markers like in skyrim, it serves the exact same purpose while saving the player some extra time that is spent honing in on ghosts/objectives. Exploring and finding chests simply is not that rewarding, aside from the slight chance that you'll find a very good weapon, most of the time you'll just get some gold or a charm that you might not even want to use. Perhaps if they didn't have anything interesting to put in such a big forest, then maybe they shouldn't have spent the time on making it so big in the first place.Ugly: This game simply turns into a linear chore after a while. You gather all the evidence while in light, then go into darkness and follow a string of dialogue and other bits to finish that zone. In essence this game is comparable to ""Dear Esther"" with some combat thrown into the mix. The primary content of the game revolves around going from place to place and reading dialogue. The combat itself might have some polished mechanics, its simply ruined by the unnecessary gear level system. There are like 4-5 different qualities of each weapon, and each one does slightly more damage than the last. the improvements are absolutely marginal, and in the final sequences of the game it seems frustrating that the items you just spent several thousand gold on don't seem to be making a real difference in how well you can kill things. Combine this with an annoying AI pathing system that ensures that the enemy you're about to hit with an arrow will zig zag around some terrain right as you shoot towards it, leaves the player longing for something slightly more polished and more fun.I would give this game a 7/10. It's not perfect, but its unique in its own way and offers some decent fun factor, its worth playing, but get it on sale. "

												I don't really understand the 'very positive' rating. If anything, I'd say this deserves a neutral score.+ Unique art style, and the option to tune the colors/contrast is a nice touch+ Seems like an interesting, but vague story+ Controls are tight and feel nice- Too vague on what the object of the game is. Resorting to Google to figure out the direction of the game is a problem.- Enemies are either really cheap, or really dumb. Not middle ground. Makes combat a chore after a while.- Gets frustrating and off-putting at first when you constantly combine the two above- Enemies constantly respawn if you leave an area, which for obvious reasons, as stated above, gets old.

												I was planning on actually getting near completion of the game to give myself more credibility, but I can't;  the game's just that boring. The main selling point of Betrayer is the atmosphere, but it's just stripped away from the lack of suspense. Betrayer offers a midieval stealth based combat system; the stealth based is a lie. The story is as lifeless as the aparitions telling it. The graphics, which may seem pretty at first, just start seeming bland and uninspired. It just dosent feel like this game is actaully finished. This is most evident with the combat system. Here's a list of each weapons/items I've encountered that ruin any appeal the game could have had.Bow- Its not even a bow. The arrows have no arc, nor does the bow or any other weapon have recoil/spread. Your cursor is a white dot that never changes from weapon to weapon. Tomahawk- This thing just breaks any fear you would have had from the enimies. Every enemy I've hit with this thing died instantly no matter were I hit them; every other weapon requares a headsot for an istant kill.The knife- Why even use this if you have the tomahawk?The flask- Not a weapon, but this is another major factor that ruins the horror and diffiulty. Its basically a health potion which heals about half your health instantly. This just lets the player run up to an enemy, heal any damge just dealt, and throw a tomahawk right into the enemy's face. There's also barrals to refell your flask scattered everywere.I also would like mention that the only difficulty setting this game has is an option to make the enemys weaker. Thing is that the Ai is so stupid that I can just run around in circles, and for the most part come out unharmed.I've been reading other reviews saying that this game has been in early access. Is this what Steam calls finished?p.s.- You can buy Amnesia: A machine for Pigs for about the same price as this game			"

												This is an interesting game... that said, I thought I'd like it more than I did, but it wasn't terrible by any means. Just, not quite what I hoped.My general feeling on this title is it just sort of throws you into a scenario with a vague sense of what to do from beginning til end. This would not be a bad thing, but the game is remarkably... well, empty. You cross large tracts of wilderness looking somewhat blindly for clues to an investigation as well as treasure. The former you can locate easily by using a special listening function whereas the latter is just a matter of being in the right place to hear the chime. There's a great deal of backtracking and exploration, which I usually like to some degree, but the landscape has very few landmarks, let alone features to it. Everything winds up looking pretty much alike and the setting (not the scenario) lacks character.As for the plot, it mainly ties together in the end, although I didn't find the overall investigation to be particularly interesting. There's a lot of wandering from one empty town to another, reading small notes and talking to conveniently amnesiac wraiths in a poorly utilized 'otherworld', but you never really feel for anyone or care as the NPCS are a mix of boring and a--holish. It's mainly just a series of exercises that feels more like padding out the game than really telling a story, at least until the end.There's a lot of potential in Betrayer, but it just doesn't go far enough with the premise or the writing to really sell it. I enjoy exploration titles a lot, but like many things in Betrayer, the experience is sort of empty. Mind you, I don't mean to sell this as a very negative review, but this is already a very niche title that doesn't really work for me in execution.Be advised, there is a suspicious amount of downvotes for any negative review of this title. Keep that in mind when you read the positive ones.			"

												I am soooo♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off for buying this piece of crap. I tried to like this game because of the good amount of positive reviews it got. I bought it, though I am not into FPS but I believed that with its atmosphere It could amaze me.I was so freaking wrong.I do not have any problem with the atmosphere, the beginning was so promising until the appearance of the wraith and a red hooded girl. I said well, I want to know what happened to these people. I was exciting to reveal what's behind all of it.Then I went out to the black and white world which was definitely empty and boring. Geez, literally nothing out there just those zombie-like Spaniards, who attack you in sight. Sometimes we bump into treasures and we need to dig now and then.And then the gameplay... I like hard games, I remember how hard Stalker was, two shots and you are dead. But there was something to balance its hardness: tactics, you could hide and get closer to them, find another way to hunt the enemies down etc. Not to speak of the Gothic series. If you took the wrong path, you were dead.But here: they say you can get close to the enemy by using the wind. I had no chance to make use of it. They see me from a long distance even if I was sneaking. Most of the time, I could not even get close enough to kill them with my bow. And when they see you, they just rush like hell towards you. The only option is to run away, turn around and shoot, then run, turn around and shoot until you die, because you will die, a lot. The problem is not this but the fact that there is no reward. I don't feel, after killing the big, rock-throwing guy for example, that yeaaah I made it, (I died 5-6 times before). In games after dying, you should feel that probably you made a mistake, that if you had used a different way to get through, you would be alive now, then you try it again. Frustration comes when you start feeling that you are not the responsible of your death. In this game, I feel I am not to blame, I think in this case the devs are the cause of this.Well, I just lost my interest after all, I got so frustrated because of the numerous deaths. When playing you need to feel that it was worth suffering so much, but after I kill a Spaniard just look around and I feel loneliness, I see a forest without life around me and don't feel like playing this game anymore. It is so sad because it could have been something, there is something in this game but ... It seems to be unfinished, it needs to be filled up with more life and content.			"

												i think this game is a great step in the direction of a fresh breath of air into the the stale mundaneness that is gaming these days. I was very interested in this game with its exceptional graphics for an indie game, deep mystery, and subtle horror genre inspirations. However, the one thing that holds this game back is combat. You use a bow, a gun, a tomahawk, and there isnt a whole lot of difference between them. Stealth is basically nonexistant, so youll be duking it out with what appears to be the same enemies consistently and based on other reviews, it seems there is no boss type fights in this game. If you can get past the combat, the story and atmosphere are a 10/10, so itd be worth a shot for you.			"

												Had a lot of potential but the experience is too restrictively narrow.  Unless you play the game the exact ""right"" way that the devs expect you to, you can't progress.  I googled, read the forums (including dev responses) and still couldn't progress because I wasn't properly following the vague esoteric ""audio clues"".  I had very high hopes and enjoyed the first few hours but it soon turned into a constant series frustrations. Primary among these was the fact that enemies respawn and player location resets anytime you save the game. If you clear the map of enemies and are sitting at the exit but have to save the game for any reason (yes, I have children, a job and a life outside of gaming) when you load your supposed save, you are back at the beginning and all enemies are repopulated.  Why push a boulder up the hill only to have it roll back down once you reach the top?  Noble ambitions but poor execution.			"

												Betrayer is a nice game, but you shouldn't get any false expectations.For starters, it's not a horror game. It's not scary. Well, sometimes you'll be startled, but mostly it's just creepy and unsettling. Something like an Edgar Poe story.Another thing - there's not much going on. You'll be running around, occasionally fighting skeletons and such, reading notes and trying to find all clues before proceeding to the next area. Yes, it's repetitive. There's almost no gameplay progression throughout the entire game, except for some tougher enemies introduced and some new equipment gathered. Once you learn the mechanincs the game becomes quite easy, too. Especially since you have infinite respawns, as well as infinite sources of loot.If these characteristics don't look like critical flaws to you, well, then you'll most certainly enjoy what Betrayer has to offer:- Story. Remember what i said about Edgar Poe? Add some Fenimore Cooper to the mix and wrap it up with Silent Hill, and you'll get a hint of what Betrayer is about. I'm not gonna say it's something AMAZING, but the setting is original, the characters are believable and the main storyline is intriguing enough to hold you tight till the end. Lots of good ol' reading, too.-Visuals. Doesn't matter if you play in monochrome, as intended originally, or if you use the full palette, Betrayer's visual style is captivating. The haunted forest you're scrambling through looks stunning in its every form, and it really helps to immerse yourself into the game's world. It's actually amazing how indie developers nowadays could achieve this without the need for high budget.-Sound. The game doesn't have much to offer in terms of different sound effects, but the ones present actually make up an imortant part of the gameplay, as you've got to listen carefully in order to find clues. This feature is implemented perfectly. Atmospheric noises are decent, too.-Gameplay. As repetitive as it gets, it's still not so bad. You get some RPG elements, like weapons ranging in quality and magic charms that boost your attributes. Exploring for clues and loot is fun, and there's also fast travel in case you'll get tired of running around. Combat gets a lot less challenging over time, rendering stealth elements almost useless, but it still feels rewarding shattering those spectres' skulls or putting down a zombie with a tomahawk.Overall, Betrayer is an enjoyable experience, with some original gameplay ideas, rather nice story and great visuals. If you like slow-paced games, centered around exploring and collecting stuff, try it out. But if you expect an action-packed heart-pounding thriller - better move along, or else you'll be disappointed. "

												My overall rating for Betrayer: 71/100Betrayer is set in New England, year 1604. The mystery, what wiped out the whole colony is to be solved by you, an unknown adventurer in a grim world coloured by white, dark and red. Game promised to be a stealth detective horror experience, what was not always fulfilled. But let's see in detail.GAMEPLAY+ Wide locations+ Various enemies+ Day/Night possibility+ Possibility to turn off hints and still find your goals- Grinding and collecting things- Tendency to be repetetive and boring- Stealth not always possibleGameplay is definitely the weakest part of whole game. Though there are various locations you can explore and feel free to do so, enemies designed as Spanish soldiers, or ghosts and skeletons at night, most of the time you will be running from one end of map to another and collect things needed for the solution.Progress is linear, clear the map, release all the spirits and move to next region. I got bored several times here, even the horror atmosphere was weaker, because I could expect the same change after moving to the night and back. It seemed later to me, that day is even more scary than the night!It states here, that it should be a stealth game, but a lot of enemies appear right next to you, when you are passing them by, so there are not a lot of chances to get them undetected. That pays also for groups, longbow or crossbow, stealthy or not, you are hunted by the whole group, does not matter what your tactics are.But there is one point, that you cen turn off your hints and try your detective skills at their best. Good luck!VISUALS+ Perfect atmosphere in a comics' book style+ Details of armours and colonial stuff- Possibility to play in regular coloursAt this part of the title, I am amazed. The white-dark-red combination set a grim and uneasy atmosphere, it really has somethign from horror, I do not recommend to set natural colours, because after that, it becomes just a colonial-style FPS. What Betrayer is not at all.CHARACTERS+ Variety of characters+ Releasable or banishable- Most of them are not important for the storyThere are plenty ghosts, their stories need to be revealed. You can search and find out, what was their crime, or that they were victims. But most of them are just for keeping players in the game and their only purpose is to unlock next destination. But in the end, you can decide, whether their acts are forgivable or not. Interesting point.SOUNDTRACK+ Eerie sounds- Not existingEerie sounds are good for this type of game, but in the end, it is not sufficient to create all the impression from playing. It is just a part of the composition and there needs to be something more, that drives player further into the story. And there was nothing else, sadly. What a waste of potential.SUMMARYBetrayer had a great potential to be one interesting and captivating game. But it seems to me, that the developers did not see, or were not able to use it all and their work acts half-finished and tacky. I was very puzzled after finishing, open end did not change anything and it was predictive as hell.Therefore, I can not recommend this game. Either buy it during a huge sale (-75% at least), or, better, watch a gameplay from YouTubers.			"

												Looked and sounded like a great game. A mix of fps and puzzles. After my first day of playing I am rating this a 5 out of 10. The ""bad guys"" are so powerful that it seems I die in a single stroke. When you die, you drop your items. If you die again before picking them up, you lose them. I have lost a lot of items learning this the hard way. There is limited money it seems as well, which means once you find all the tresure chests in an area, you have no opportunity to get more loot to buy weapons and ammo. Which means you have to start the entire game over if you want a chance at progressin.While the game play is fun, it is 100% too frustrating to call this a great game. Save your money until this is in the $5 bin. That is all it is worth.			"

												Betrayer attempts to do a lot, but rarely does it go beyond anything other then a good game.  The story itself is okay, almost a noir style set during a time period with mustkets, indians, and spainards.    It does provide you with a decent mystery that keeps you giong through the motions.   The gameplay is very generic, especially at first.  However it is still fun, it definitely could have been improved upon, such as the bow feels rather anti-climactic.   The way you discover clues is okay, you basically uncover parts of a story an then have to go find the rest of the story by uncovering secrets such as a body on the ground, or talking to people.  The eviornments themselves are very atmospheric and very enjoyable.  A.I. is basic, there are times when they can be very challenging especially when you start to encounter different enemies.All in all a game that could have done a lot more with what it had.   However that being said it is worth a playthrough.  Check out my playthrough on youtube for an idea of what to expect.rustnMAN's Betrayer Gameplay "

												This was my gamble purchase during the 2014 summer sale, and I don't regret a single cent spent on it.  Betrayer is absolutely stunning visually and the use of audio is done really well, though some of the weapons could be a bit louder.  The stark contrast of the monochrome world really makes the setting, and played in a dark room it has a great immersive and eerie quality.  Headphones will enrich the experience as the developers implemented an audio waypoint system in addition to a visual one.  As I write this I am currently half way through the game and will update with more information as I dig further into the games mysteries.I have just finished the game and I must say I stand by everything stated before and then some.  The only drawback to Betrayer is the lack of voice acting, everything else about this game is fantastic.  The story is worthwhile if you don't mind reading your way through it, and the combat never lets down.  This game may end up being my personal game of the year, though there is still a half a year of potential contenders.			"

												This game has so much going for it but ultimately completely falls flat. You never know wtf it is you're supposed to be doing. Unless that is, you're getting gangbanged by 7 enemies at once, in which case, run. The only way to survive most encounters is to sneak up on the enemy. Which means you end up slowly crouch walking the entire game. Otherwise, you suddenly get spotted by 5 enemies, appearing out of nowhere, with SWAT sniper accuracy. The graphics are nice. The setting is new and interesting. It has the trappings of an interesting story but you're basically doing boring fetch quests.It's a shame because this game feels like it's so close to something. Maybe it eventually pays off? But you're probably going to get bored and annoyed before that comes due to lack of direction and obnoxious combat/harassment.			"

												This game had so much potential when I first started playing.  The idea was original and the setting was intriguing.  I was so excited to see the way that English and Spanish colonialism would be compared by the game, and then the added element of Native American interactions was especially exciting.  And then the game did nothing with the differences between these groups.  The enemies are all the same.  The tasks and quests are completely repetitive.  You are forced to march back and forth over large maps with very few fast travel points.  Even worse, they make you visit and revisit these maps over and over again, spending at least half of your gameplay time running across repetitive landscape to visit places you have already been three times.  Also the ending was jarring and forced.   There are better games to spend your time and money onl			"

Tapi satu hal yang aneh adalah kenapa game ini hitam putih semua? okay mungkin ingin membuat game ini menjadi unik tapi buat gue malah aneh. Bukan nya bernuansa hitam putih tapi bernuansa film negatif. Tau kan film negatif? itu lho lembaran film yang belum jadi.. duh anak yang tahun 2000an pasti bingung.Gameplay:Game ini berusaha menjadi RPG.. atau adventure... atau action. IDKWTFIWTG. Mungkin gue yang salah baca tag di steam atau game ini yang salah menawarkan fitur. Ketika mencapai titik ini gue udah malas melihat kembali ke dalam game. Banyak hal yang gue bisa tuliskan agar lo tidak membeli game ini. Salah satu hal yang paling krusial dari game ini adalah TIDAK ADA VOICE ACTING! Gue main 1 jam, ketemu banyak hantu dan lady in red, tapi semua dialognya ya dibaca gitu. Cmon... visual novel hentai aja ada suaranya, masa game ini gak ada? terus gue mau diharuskan baca gitu dari awal sampai akhir? males.. mendingan gue baca skripsi gue lagi.Story:Gue cuman mainin sejam dan yang gue tangkap adalah lo terdampar disuatu pulau pada tahun 1500an. Lo lari menuju benteng tapi orang orang disana udah menjadi batu. Setelah itu lo mencari misteri dibalik itu. Game ini bernuansa agak horror tapi horror yang gagal. JANGAN BELI GAME INI. Kalau lo mengharapkan petualangan yang seru, sistem RPG yang menarik, atau menikmati pemandangan virtual, beli lah game lain. Serius deh, gue berusaha untuk suka game ini tapi.. duh.. susah.			"

												Wanted so badly to like this game but just couldn't. The trailers and pictures make it look much different of a game than what it is. The game starts out nice enough with you crash landed, and there are good parts. The white contrast is striking and very different from anything normally used in games. The atmosphere is good with the sounds of nature, rustling of the wind, and original feeling of lonliness. Those are the only positive things to say. The game is plain boring. You wander around these giant open similar looking forests and go into empty towns for the entire game. There is no story or direction, just basically open chests, and read random scaps of paper that don't add to the game or story at all and just include things like ""papa got lost in the woods tonight, guess I'll have to go find him."". The scraps don't come together in any real way and are basically incoherent and worthless. The problem is you don't know what you're doing or why you're doing it. Oh ok I found a few clues, what do those do and what am I supposed to do with them. The game never changes are there is only 1 person you see. I get the game does the ""no hand-holding"", but just walking around hoping to find random collectables that are impossible to see half the time because they are on the ground and not visible enough, just isn't fun. The combat is not good as guys just rush at you in giant packs and then can hit from you super far away as your guns take 20 in to reload. The money system makes no sense as you pick up 3 gold and 30 gold from chests but you need like 700 to buy 1 thing, and its an upgrade for 5 damage on a weapon so you blow all your money on nothing. The charms you wear give worthless stats like 4% better reload speed (why even waste your time making use of charms if they are a waste?). The stealth doesn't work 2/3 the time as a guy sees you while turned sideways and who is 300 feet away. You use the same 3 guns the whole game. I got stuck towards the end because even though clearing totems get's you to the next area, for this area it didn't work for some reason, and I still don't know why or what I was supposed to do instead. There are things like crosses and clues and scraps but you have no idea if you need to collect them, or they are just superfluous, or if they actually accomplish something. Back to the drawing board guys, this is literally a game wandering around collecting objects that you don't know what to do with and are hidden while you get shot at by guys that run up and stand there. No better way to describe the game. 4.5/10			"

												This game has a unique graphical style and a really creepy atmosphere- at first. The opening of the game and the discovery of the first settlement are eerie. The ringing of the bell is outright shocking and really scary. Unfortunately, after that wears off, there's nothing to keep the player on their toes and interested, or to escalate the creepiness again. The game becomes a series of fetch quests and loses its impact. Some variety in the environments could have helped- although it's set in a period when there weren't a lot of buildings or manmade things around, exploration of caves or battle sites could have added to the creep factor quite a bit. Maybe more of an examination of the witch trials, and more interation with actual humans. I understand that the isolation and loneliness of the empty world are a big part of the game's aesthetic, but I think it would have benefitted from something like Silent Hill 2- a small cast of enigmatic, somewhat threatening characters could have added a lot to the game and not made it feel so much like a walking simulator with some creepy elements.

												This game is like spending 8 hours running in circles on the first map of Silent Hill, then giving up and reading the summary of the plot on Wikipedia.  Starts well with great creepy atmosphere and sound, and ends up having a pretty good story and ending.  The problem is that this game is fun for about an hour at the start, and about an hour at the end, but the 5 or 6 hours in between are incredibly tedious, repetitive, and pointless.  You will run in circles for hours covering identical areas to find clues that tell you nothing and fighting the same enemies over and over, until any sense of fear or curiosity is burned out of you by sheer over exposure.  Even accidentally skipping over some minor and insignificant clue will force you to go back and search for it, only to learn that it ""reveals"" some uninteresting fact you had already guessed hours ago.The sidequests are what ruin this game.  Even the sidequests that have a plot and point to them, you'll either figure out what happened or stop caring long before you finish the breadcrumb trail.  And the game forces you to do every single time sink of a sidequest to progress to the main story, requiring a huge amount of backtracking and busywork in a game that was already painfully repetetive.  I would mark it as neutral, just for the visuals and sound, which are excellent, but that isn't an option.  I can't really reccomend it unless you enjoy very slow, meticulous, and repetetive games.

												This game has a cool atmosphere to it. But I quickly got to difficult parts where I repeatedly get killed and respawn. I couldn't defeat the first large enemy, so I eventually gave up. It's a shame that I lost interest before getting into the game more. It might be more worth your time watching gameplay footage from people who manage to do well. That way you still get the artistic style without getting frustrated. Or having to spend money.			"

												Good. Combat is simple and solid. Story is interesting. Graphics are gorgeous. Recommended colour settings are really something else than what you normally see in games. Black & white with a tiny bit of red. Actually works very well(I completed the whole game like this). It is possible to change the sliders any time. Finding all the collectibles takes quite a bit of time but isn't so difficult you need a guide. Visual cues and audio help with it. Overral I'd say the game is very athmospheric with a decent story and good combat. 7/10			"

												4 Hours in this game, I still cant see how this game resembles Monoliths work, the developers of acclaimed series' F.E.A.R and NOLF. Perhaps the only thing i sense in this is the ridiculous difficulty level in the game. The only way to deal with enemies in this game is stealth; no other way around it as there are rifles and whatnot but its not suited for that gameplay with mobs closing in on you. The games default look and aesthetics hurt my eyes, so i had no choice but to put down the contrast and raise some color but this game really is meant to be played in black and white because there are red visual cues (Sin City) that let you know when a enemy is in the distance where as in color, its hard to spot. There are no character and personality between the people you are supposed to help, so when i find quests and stuff to do, I lack the inspiration to do so. I find it really hard to give 20 dollars to a game that still feels like its in early access. Also, pressing X for audio cues on what to do next is the dumbest way to find missions.			"

Now, it could just be my computer itself, not being the best of the best; but if I can get Fallout and Skyrim, along with several other demanding games to run smoother than butter, there is no excuse. But, I guess everyone has thier own cup of tea, and mine is not this game.			"

												I BARELY can recommend this game. BARELY. Don't let the few hours of game-time on record fool you. That is a lot of time to spend in this game, given it's mostly a jogging simulator.It gets boring FAST. Can only play in ""bursts"". Just like running. HAHAHAH!I will only focus on the BAD. If you can get past these, then buy this game!1st off, this game uses the Unreal engine...poorly. The game looks like something about 5-7 years old, but runs very poorly. Just not optimized I suppose. Skyrim came out in 2011, has vast terrain, mountains, hills, forests, you can see faraway, runs great. This game, is like taking some outdoor map in Unreal Tournament 3, and making it bland and unable to rival Skyrim graphics. Not to mention, it runs like POOP! OMG, it's a ""confined area"" level design, just small bumps for hills, trees, and rocks. This is inexcusable.2nd. The game plays out in Black and White. I really tried to play as intended. I had no problem with the ""somethings are red, somethings are not"" gimmick, but here is what killed it for me, forcing me to turn on the color: you can see better in color, it looks better, and the red became annoying. Like seriously, arrows and other weapon related items are in red. Clues, chests, things you need to find or will help you progress are red. I think the B/W was to hide the ""Captain Obvious"" that people couldn't find crap, so they make those things glow red, then people feel they are being hand-held, so they say ""Let's make everything else black and white, this way, the things we painted red...MEAN SOMETHING. Like it HAS MEANING NOW. WHAT MEANING? I DON'T KNOW! ITS A.....MYSTERY! YES! THAT'S IT! OOOH!""Naaah, no thanks. It would have been cooler to play in B/W if there was tons of blood, you know, like in other FPS games using the Unreal engine (or any). Seriously. A horror-FPS-type game and there are no blood splats on the ground or everywhere? I mean, when your whole game makes ""A THING"" out of the color red being the only color, and it's a horror game, why make it so bloody BLOODLESS (except for a few red puffs from hits?)Makes no sense, and people will find it annoying. They'll think ""OOOh Red is only color? It's a horror game? It's also FPS? I'm ready for some horror splatterfest!"" Instead it's like ""The Red, you see, it means something. It represents a reflection on humanity's fascination with violence and looking for truth, and answers in those truths. Take for example the history of colonialism and the native americans, which the story of the game....."" BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH - that's basically the impression the game gives you throughout as far as Red relating to the story goes. Or rather, in color, as probably game was intended, Red was simply to show the clues which leads me to 3rd.(Quite note, I went to a pile of glowing rocks, ""a clue"", that gave a pop-up describing there is blood on the ground around the clue"" instead of just showing it. HAHAHAH.)3rd. The game holds your hand ridiculously. You are dropped on the the coast of what I will call ""Level 1"". As you go through, you immediately have the ""4th Wall"" (those who don't know what this means should look it up) to hold your hand from the start. Wow, really? I thought. So basically, you have to figure out ""what happened to the colony"" or colonies since there are ""Levels 1, 2, 3, etc."" which each have a settlement/fort of some type. There are literally FRICKEN NOTES or clues laying in a fricken field in the middle of nowhere, or in piles of rocks. When you go to use it, you get a pop-up telling you what you find (RATHER THAN JUST SHOWING YOU lol). How to find these? Look for glowing red spots, but some are very deep so you must explore. THAT CAN TAKE FOREVER.So why do that when you can simply pull-up your IN-GAME MAP of the ENTIRE ""Level"" that comes with a legend already marking where everything is? You can even filter it out to only show chests, only show clues, or spirits that are not actually there, in fact, some things are not even there. Instead, you have to somehow progress and unlock stages of progression to where that thing marked on your map will not spawn. This means you have to run all the way the hell back there to then continue progression so you can what? Get the hell out of that level.Rather than have some kind of plot device or something like that in the game to give you a clue where to go, you get a map showing you. The kicker is not all things are there. So THIS, THAT, THIS clue will progress the ""quest?"" so THAT, THAT, and THIS clue, will be there, basically. So you will still spend the whole fracking game running around from one side of the map, to completely the other side. It feels they designed it this way to extend the play time, to make what would really be a short game, much, much, slower. 4th. You die alot. The game's combat mechanics are brutally frustrating. If they are going for realism, I GET IT, musket weapons take forever to load. But if going for realism....why are weapon racks ""Stores"" where you can buy/sell stuff? Why can't I buy health potions? Instead, you have to drink from a glowing red barrel of water, that doesn't heal you right away. Instead, you store up ""invisible"" health potions and usually third time you heal fully. That's great.So, you leave a place that is at, and then get attacked. You get shot, arrowed, fisted, and almost dead, using up your ""healing water invisible things"" only to have to go back and get another drink of water from the barrel. SO, can you imagine? You leave the center of the ""hub"", immediately get attacked by 3 dudes who move very fast (and some spawn from nowhere), if you survive, you have to run back to refill. Then, you go out again, maybe that spawn-point has refreshed, or maybe you run into another mob, and then get beat up. Then you have to run all the way back again. In one level, they put a barrel on the road. HOW NICE OF THE DEVELOPERS TO DO THAT!So, the whole ""realism"" thing is a completely mental argument. If it was done for the sake of horror, that makes more sense but still sucks compared to the combat mechanics, and people complain. You can take the stealth approach, which works best, but as some others have mentioned, as soon as you tag an enemy, the ""magically"" know where you are no matter what. Eventually, the game turns into a death-fest and ""avoid the spawn point"" fest. OH, AND GET THIS, THIS IS THE BEST: If you die: you simply respawn! Of course, you respawn back to wherever the game decides was your last ""checkpoint"" (it was never clear on this). But so do all of the enemies, and all the respawn points reset too. That means, you get to run the FRAGGIN gauntlet ALL over again. It becomes like playing an old-school game where you have to ""beat a level"" and it's a tough level, and you always die, but you have unlimited lives to keep trying and trying. ""Like someone unraveling a cable-net sweater you keep on knitting, and knitting, and knitting, and knitting, and knitting....hegh-hegh!""5th. It feels like what we are playing is not the original intended design of the game. Almost as if people complained about so many things, that they did all those things I mentioned above.Last. Why recommend? The game succeeds with the, albiet illusionary, non-linear design. Here is the next ""map"". Figure it out. Collect the pages. Whatever. The sound design is excellent as is some of the art style, the dark-world mode is incredibly creepy and works well. They hit the right marks in all other areas than what I mentioned (REMEMBER, I spoke of the bad only).  If you want a game with great atmosphere, a bit of freedom to explore (try it without using the map!), some interesting surprises, then buy it. Prepare to spend 90% of your game time, running around. This game requires A LOT of patience. GO INTO THE GAME WITH THAT IN MIND, and you'll be fine. Maybe, play at a party where everyone is wild. HAHAHAH!			"

												I, and a lot of people as dumb as I apparently am, bought the 'early access"" to this game.  We reported bug after bug, we got into some really good discussions with the developers where we felt they really listened to us, (and maybe a few where they didn't).  We waited for each new update andicipating some good changes.  Updates 2, 3 and 4 came within just a few weeks of each other.  Then nothing.  Then months later, bang, finished product.  But.....where is it?  Sure they completed the missing areas, and changed a bit of the storyline which made it a bit more interesting.   But the text interface still looks like it was created using notepad.  And don't give me that ""we wanted to make it look old timey""  or ""we wanted to make it simple like the black and white world"".  That's total BS, you didn't want to spend the money on developing an interface that looks like you put some thought into it.  The map interface still sucks, where is the ""you are here"" marker?  It's still WAY to hard to tell game elements from background scenery, even worse from a distance.  You still can't tell which way a spaniard is facing from a distance if he's not moving.You have to sneak everywhere, or pretty soon you'll get suddenly noticed, for no reason at all, by 7 enemies at once that converge on you from all directions.  You'll die, when you respawn, all your stuff will be in the middle of all those enemies, that ALSO respawned!There are no storyline cues, you just have to wander around and hopefully remember, and be able to make some sense of , everything you read.  There are no quests.  My understanding is that somewhere in the course of the game you find a way to  ""heal"" the world and make everything in color again but the game has no quest path to this goal, you just have to guess and hope you get it right.As far as I can tell there is no ""you are here"" marker on the map, so you don't know where it is you are standing once you leave the fort.  And there are at least 3 different ""paths"" marked in the map that you wouldn't know you are standing on by looking at the world itself, so it's nearly impossible to make sure you've walked the whole map.  The developers promised to fix this by making fast travel points on the map but how can you fast travel somewhere you can't find because you can't navigate to it in the first place?Don't buy this game.This is yet another example of the ""let's get this to production as soon as possible, I don't care if it's not ready"" philosophy.  If I hadn't have bought the early access to what sounded like a cool concept, and I had played a demo of the game as it is now.  I would never buy it.			"

												It's sandboxy, die and try again, kill baddies to get better at killing baddies, collect the things, stealth but not really, horror but not really... INDIE GAME.But not really. The studio that made this are backed by some big talent, people with real games to their names. But this feels like an indie game. Something that came to be in a bedroom.There's no real focus, no tension, no pacing. You'll be completely numb to the enemies within minutes, which is a shame, because there's definetly something to them, their wreckless charges, their dead stare as they aim at you. There might have been a real sense of fear and dread at the sight of them if it wasn't so easy to pop them all in the head and take their dead coin like a soul reaving robin hood.The visuals? Marmite. You're given lots of sliders so you can alter that harsh black and white to something more your taste. It's not core to the game; for something so striking it seems strange to allow players to turn the 'art style' off. I personally toned it down just a pinch and I really believe I improved on the default setting. You know, the one the artists chose. Bunch of wasters.			"

Product received for free
My playtime: 24.8h (based on steam).Grindy Achievement: Yes (4 achievements).Optional Achievement: Yes (20 achievements).Difficult Achievement: No.Developer Response: No (last response is in 23 Jun 2015).IntroBetrayer is a first person adventure game mainly in black, white, and red which sets in 17th century. You'll arrive in a land lacking of people and you'll have to find out what happened in that place. Although the game starts in black, white, and red, it can be adjusted to color, although imo, it's easier to play it in default color.MusicThis game's bgm gives off eerie vibe with some environmental sfxs such as rustling grass and breezing winds. Some sfxs can surprise you with its sudden noise, especially when it's combined with the eerie graphics. Personally, i think that this game's music is one of the best part of the game.GraphicsAlthough the game doesn't have an AAA style graphics, the black, white, and red color gives of an eerie atmosphere perfectly. However, i have to admit that the graphics look weird after you change the default color to a more colorful setting. The in game text might be quite small, although it's still readable.StoryThe game has a separate story in each area, although the story in the last few areas stay connected with each other. The game mainly tells about betrayals which are done by the people living in the area, which are resulting in death. There are also some clues which are written in a piece of paper about anything that happened in the area. This game doesn't have a fixed ending which makes you to have to interpret the ending and some part of the story by yourself.The gameYou'll arrive in a land with no people and all you have in your hand is a bow. The game will start teaching you a few controls, although it missed some controls, such as the sniper mode which is initiated with right click. Although the game teaches you some of the game controls, i ended up forgetting most of it.You can do stealth kills in this game which can be either done from close or afar. There are some items which can help you to not getting noticed by your enemies and there is also a wind which will help you to blend in with the surroundings.In this game, you'll mainly collect some things in the area and kill some enemies. Most of the area requires you to do the same thing which can make the game quite boring.The game environment is very gloom and dark, which sometimes can surprise you when something shows out of nowhere. The battle sfx can also surprise you, although you'll get used with it in no time.Because you'll mainly use long ranged weapons in this game, ammos can be quite costly. I didn't know that you can get some ammo by dying, which will help me to upgrade my weapon instead of spending the cash for ammo. Some of the ammo that you are using will also remains the area, although sometimes the ammo will stuck in some places which makes you have to rebuy the ammo.I experienced some frame skips in this game. It's quite annoying, especially when you want to snipe the enemies from afar. The mouse also runs slowly and i'll get more frame skips if i try to make it faster. The game also loads very slowly when it's transitioning from and to areas. The game lags after i'm alt tabbing and it will be not responding if i'm alt tabbing for too long. The weapon can also fire randomly by itself when you change maps.There are 5 kinds of weapons in the game, which are crossbows, shortbows, longbows, guns, and muskets. All of them have their own strengths and weaknesses which can be covered with charms, tomahawk (mid range single targeted weapon), explosives (mid range area targeted weapon), and melee attacks (which is mainly used for stealth kills). The charms can give you some buffs, such as health boost and movement speed boost. There are 3 unique weapons for each type of weapons which can be considered as ultimate weapons. All of them has different stats which can be chosen based on your play types.This game is focused on two worlds, this world and the other world, where the spirits resides. You'll have to travel between both worlds to uncover the mystery in the land you are in.Lastly, you can adjust this game difficulty with 3 difficulty settings in the options, with normal being the default.Pros:- 5 different type of weapons- 15 unique weapons- 3 difficulty settings- Great atmosphereCons:- You'll do almost the same thing in every maps- Frame skips- Loads very slowConclusionThis is a thriller adventure game where you have to find clues about what happened on the land you are in. There are no jumpscares, but the sfxs can surprise you.Should you buy this game?No.I actually want to recommend this game, but this game has nothing to offer besides the eerie atmosphere. Although the story might be interesting, the game play doesn't really satisfy me very much. You can get boring after you traverse through several areas because you have to do the same thing in each area. The technical issues i'm experiencing also gives another reason for that.However, if you want to play a thriller game with no jumpscares in it, buy this game. "

												The gameplay can be atmospheric, but the writing is fairly grating.  The phrase ""Eve and Adam"" appears at some point, which is like saying ""jelly and peanutbutter"" with a touch of pseudo-enlightenment, and there's plenty more where that came from.  I avoid games that parade this sort of mentality, which is why I'm mentioning it for anyone else who cares.			"

Well about the combat I felt it was enjoyable I felt like a native american using guzzila tactics agnist my foes. The two things I felt are the best part of the game would have to be it's black and white graphics I truley was thinking wow it looks like graphic novel and the last location in the game was the stand out moment it was unexpected.

												The amount of time taken to put the detail this game has is amazing,the fact that the is just black and white with the odd red colour making an presence makes the game look attractive. the detail with every bit of grass to the leaves of the tree is well made but to make it all look better is when from time to time wind picks up and every thing starts to move like trees and grass in teh real world, if you like a game with investigation and action this is your game, only two things wrong in my eyes; To find the next item etc you have to hear for the voices to guide you there which some times is hard to pin point and the other one is it states horror but the enemys make their presences known before attacking so you have enough time to get yourself ready. overall i do recomend this game it is alot of fun   85/100			"

												Great first person exploration and paranormal murder mystery game set in the 'new world'.The game combines fighting, sneaking and exploration in a very well done way.The atmosphere is phenomenal, the way the foliage reacts to the wind is some of the best i've ever seen done in a game, on top of that, the gusts of wind rustling the foliage add a tactical advantage as enemies can't hear you run up to them.There's a large variety of weapons and lots of goodies and secrets to be found (although the latest patch makes hunting for them rather trivial as the devs added markers on the map that show all locations.)Enemy variation is good enough for the run of the game, which when going guns blazing (or bows blazing?) can take between 8 to 12 hours.Graphics are very well done (though i suggest to add some saturation and brightness and lower the contrast a bit, something the devs where kind enough to implement.)Overall, a very good game and I hope the developers haven't gone out of business, seeing the studio has been silent for quite a while.

												this is the type of game that would deserve the neutral/maybe option on steam. it has a lot of good ideas but ultimately doesn't work as a whole.you're thrown into an atmospheric world that tries to be too mysterious for its own good (which makes the story fall really short of expectations). the mystery is not that interesting to really make you put up with the gameplay, which you soon realise consists of fetch quests and tons of filler - very simplistic, gets stale quickly.the gameplay mechanics are not balanced, with stealth being pretty much useless and an artificial way to lenghten the game. the combat doesn't feel precise, which ain't helped by the atrocious pathfinding of your enemies.visually striking - the colour and contrast customisation freshen up the experience.the audio design is top notch - the best thing about Betrayer. skeletons are finally spooky again and I've never been so careful around statues.looked to be a short game worth finishing at first. six hours later I'm confident I will not return to it. collectathons are not my cup of tea.Let's just be glad Monolith have been ressurected.

												A FPS of sorts where you have crashed on an island that has been inhabited by settlers who have all ""disappeared"". I loved the noire look of the game (didnt even bother putting colour on to see the difference) as the black/white makes the red enemies/items pop out. The story is very interesting and I enjoyed following it right to the end... but the end did confuse me a bit. The achievements are not hard to get though a couple require grinding through maps to get kills. The game mechanics work well and the weapon types are great (prefered the longbow myself). All-in-all I enjoyed this game greatly.8/10cons: frustrating that pistol/musket/crossbow reloads to so long even with charms (caused a lot of my deaths)			"

												TL;DR at the bottomBetrayer is awesome.  It definitely brings something new to the table in a world were every FPS game is the same, Betrayer takes one of my most common complaints of FPS games and smashes it (That being that we always see the same setting WW2, Vietnam, Modern, and most recently the future.)  This takes you to what seems to be the 17th century (more specifically after  the colonization of America.)  where the guns are single shot and the best weapon is a bow and arrow.   This game heavily relies on stealth, most interestingly the wind, you use it in order to hide your foot steps.  Now with all that none sense out of the way let's talk about the most interesting parts of the game.  The mystery and the atmosphere.   When you first get into this game you have no idea what the hell is gonig on, when you first arrive at Fort Henry and start reading scraps of paper that you start to slowly understand what happens.  it gets really interesting when you start talking to the ""folks"" there.   Trying to piece together what happened at the fort and what is happening in general.  The atmosphere.  When it is day time the landscape is beautiful it's bright, it's lush, it's vibrant.  It makes you feel some what relaxed, that is until you meet your first enemy.  The ""ngiht time""  is the definition of forboding hearing things off in the distance like screams when you come near a corrupt totem poll.  To skeletons randomly popping out of the ground to destroy you. So far I have encountered 4 types of enemies.  The game definetly gets frustrating after a while but nothing too bad (as of now.)   How ever the game seems as though it is a little too hardcore at times, which is  never be a bad thing in my book.  However not having a map can be a bit aggrevating, because when you die you end up either at the start of the particular map you are on or at the last place you visited that shows up on the compass.  All that being said I love this game so far, I couldn't be happier.  8/10 I think it is worth it, if it's on sale pick it up!			"

												I really enjoyed the first 9.7 hours I had in the game.Pros:*The game has a very nice aesthetic to it that can be customized to how you like it.*There are numerous side stories that you can do. I really liked doing these, and found them to be the better part of the game.*The game has a decent atmosphere.Cons:*There wsn't much music. I get that it might clash with some parts of the game, but the lack of music really holds the rest of the atmosphere back. even a bit more ambiance would help.*There isn't a huge variety of weapons. There's three types of bows counting the crossbow, and two kind of guns. I only used the bows in regular combat until I could get a gun, then I used the crossbow in any kind of stealth scenario. I feel that bows needed a good reason to be used. Sure around mid game you can get a really fast short bow, but by then the pistol you have will likely out damage it. Heck, by then I was able to oneshot many of the enemies with my weapons.*Enemies are pretty bland. There's eight enemies that I can think of. For the most part, enemies can fall into one of two or three groups. There is an enemy that made combat interesting on the first encounter, as it requires a specific way to damage it. Once you figure it out, though, they just become a nuisance. *Combat is pretty basic. aside from the two main types of weapons, you have bombs and tomahawks. I think I accidentally used either of the special items than I did on purpose.*The ending of the main story leaves a ton to be desired, honestly. The ending left me pretty confused. After watching other people play through the ending, I saw I'm not alone, and it's a case of too little information. This is a serious shame, as by this time I was really enjoying the story. I really wish we could get some sort of followup, because I REALLY want to know more.*Stuff just isn't explained. there's no lore behind any of the interesting bits. Like what is this dark world and why can I go into it? Why can I talk to ghosts? What are these ashen figures? What are these burning enemies? Why is there a bunch of conquistodors that appear to be possesed? what are these totems? What is this corruption stuff? What are these weird spidery things and spores? Who is the merchant guy and why have I never seen him? His letters talk to you the player, and suggest he stocks all the shops. Heck, What's the deal with the ending? So, looking at the list of pros and cons, there's obviously a ton more in the cons section. HOWEVER! This is not a bad game. I did really enjoy it. I even found the collectible hunting sort of fun. Do I recommend it? Sort of. I think it is a very interesting game, and it had a ton of potential, but the ending mixed with the lack of useful lore really held it back. So, If you want a game with some decent side stories, try and get Betrayer while it's on sale.			"

												I was initially skeptical about playing a game which PANDERED solely to the colour blind, but my initial displeasure was soon overcome upon realising that Betrayer is not about some pseudo-medieval fantasy thing, but actually the worlds best world war I simulator. The aim of the game is to run around the maps and kill untermensch (including inexplicably spanish lions, spooky skeletons, gollum, and ♥♥♥♥ off irritating floaty skull things) in order to put down an iron cross on the map. you can then use the power of the kaiser to teleport to these bastions of teutonic power, which makes the game of 'touch the small circles on the map' a lot less boring. there is also an 'interesting' minquest about finding an elusive spade who has run halfway across the country for no obvious reason. this game really explained to me that it's not really surprising that the germans lost world war I, because all of their weapons are shockingly bad and it would have been so much easier if they just artillery striked all the skeletons, who can shoot lightning while you can only shoot arrows and crossbows and those type of bullet which you have to assemble before firing. the other half of the game involves being a psychotherapist to some ghosts. overall a pretty good training manual worth the two quid i spent on it, and it taught me a lot about world war I and ghost counselling, but i fear i will not be able to put this experience on my cv because of how niche these vocations are.

												Saw this one on sale cheap, it looked interesting so why not give it a try? I was pleasently surprised. Betrayer plays like an open world forest similar to Skyrim and Far Cry 3. The world is smaller and broken up over several levels the player can travel back and forth between exploring and unlocking story/secrets/etc. Additionally, there's a ""ghost world"" the player can transition into where the world is the same, but with new hidden things and monsters. Combat is fairly basic. I played mostly stealth using a bow and melee for backstab attacks. There are also pistols and muskets for big loud attacks. I felt slow and weak at first, but once I reached the second area I was comfortable and strong.Betrayer in a nutshell is running around the woods in Colonial Virginia looking for treasure, and sometimes being attack by ghosts.

												This is a review for those unsure of purchasing. First of all yes you can restore color to the game; as much or as little as youd like. Secondly, this game is all about atmosphere. It is the driving factor of the entire experience. It has features akin to Dark Souls of loot recovery but controls as smooth and simple as Far Cry 3 or Battlefield. The enemies are quite smart and devilishly accurate. Stealth plays a major factor in survival so keep your ears and eyes out. Sound is another tool you must use to navigate and investigate clues and items. This game is for those who enjoy unraveling a story and becoming emersed in its atmosphere but also enjoy some visceral combat.			"

												This game is a fantastic introduction to medieval adventure games.  It has the cliche shipwreck intro, a linear story that opens into seperate open-world map sections, collectables, interesting supernatural elements, and mystery.No blood, a basic combat system, and brutal difficult all combine to make a great ""intro to adventure"" game.Would suggest to anyone that has a kid they want to introduce to the genre (no blood but skeletons/ghosts) or wants to play a semi-relaxing singleplayer rennaisance-era first-person adventure mystery game. Black and white optional.			"

This is a game by 8 devs that worked on the FEAR series so ofc its a spooky atmospheric kinda game running on the unreal engine and boy does it look great (if u get rid of the black and white and add colour to it in the options).Your shipwrecked and ur basicly trying to find clue to wtf is going on but while doing that there is some strange spooky♥♥♥♥♥♥going down aswell.

												Even though I haven't beaten the game or even come close to, this game isn't about story, more of roaming around and just exploring the world of Betrayer.  (Sorry if this review is a mess, tired, and not in the best mood)Betrayer starts off on a beach and far off in the ocean is a wrecked ship. You came from that boat. The time is the 17th century and you are pretty much abandoned on this island or whatever. You are a misterious character with no name but, we shall call the character Betrayer.In Betrayer, you can help dead and confused spirits by going into the towns of each area and ringing a bell which takes you from the light zone (Life) to the dark zone (Dead), where you meet people called Wraiths. They are lost and confused spirits that don't know how they died, what happened to loved ones etc. You find clues that may hint at where to go or that might trigger the Wraiths to remember what happened. Of hand, you can explore and sometimes help spirits in the light world. But, in each world there are people or monsters that attack you. For example, in the dark world, skeletons attack you and in the light world, conquistadors attack you. Knowing that, you might be able to find out where you actually are.The games graphics are amazing, even though the game uses a black and white color scheme, with some red to highlight important objects, enemies, NPC etc. I'm not a fan of black and white, since I can fall asleep during black and white movies but, I enjoy this color scheme, it works well with this game. The atmosphere of this game is really nice, that abandoned feel of empty and eerieness walking around alone just seeing emptyness.My only complaint about this game would be the map. The map has a lot of stuff on it but, you can get lost so easy and the only way back in the map's fast travel so that won't even be that bad of a take off of the score.So all and all, this is a great game, everything about it is great, I haven't beaten the game yet, but people predict (that have beaten it) it's around 8-9 hours. For 20 bucks, that's not bad. So go get this game, its a pretty nice game. I'm so happy I got it, I've been eyeing this game since its early access period (PS Thanks LightestEnd for getting it for me)			"

												I'd only recommend this game if you catch it at low price. It has a very unique style, both graphically and narrative, however the lack of dinamism makes it somewhat short, and worst of all, repetitive. So the replay value is barely present. I know the developers had to struggle with a tight budget but I always used to think that's not an excuse for making a great title.Overall, the story is what shines here, the dialogs and texts are nicely executed as well as the whole historycal-based context which really makes you feel you are shrouded in an ominous ambient full of sin, death and of course, betrayal.Score: 7/10			"

												Quick review so I don't ramble for days. Game is solid overall. Explorations elements are cool, but turn off the map if you want the real experience. I played the game before the map was added and it's a much better experience. Combat is a little on the janky side. Hit detection is questionable but each enemy can be defeated without taking damage. Enemies do a lot of damage, you will need to practice before you get good. You can enable Dark Souls mode which will cause you to drop all your money upon death. The biggest drawback is how repetitive the game gets. Every time you get to a new area you repeat the exact same sequece of steps in order to move to the next area. There are ~12 areas in the game and this gets old fast. As for the story, I skipped the vast majority of it. It's there if you care about it, but I didn't. If anything, pay attention to the Maiden in Red as she is the only other human character in the game. Visually the game is very nice, but not extremely well optimized. Expect to get huge frame drops if you are running at high settings. I experienced framerates between 75 and 144 on a 980ti at 1440p. Worth the price for one playthrough, subsequent playthroughs can drag due to the repetitive nature of the game. Atmosphere is very good and the game gets darker and darker as your progress through.

												I really did enjoy playing this game. It is an alternate historical/supernatural game that plays out in monochrome with interests highlighted in red, or you could have the option of color, but I prefer the monochrome. Adds an ethereal and lifeless feel to the atmosphere that already starts off feeling ghostly and displaced. I feel that is is very exploratory in that you search for clues, tie together pieces of information and have to solve mysteries all while defending yourself against unknown entitites turned dark and twisted. There really have been no know glitches I encountered but that is just from my experience of playing.The end was also enjoyable as the end ""Boss"" did not make anyone rage-quit or feel overdone. Everything in my opinion was seemless and flowed nicely. NOTE: This is my personal opinion and thoughts of the game, not an overall view if the game for general audience. As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research.			"

												'Unique' is the number one buzzword to describe Betrayer. I'm unable to find a more meaningful description of the game - Betrayer is quite simply, a very idiosyncratic experience.It's basically one of those 'atmospheric' walking simulators that have been popping up in recent years on digital platforms, but with a dash more substance. It has shades of Far Cry, Skyrim and Dark Souls, so it isn't shy of taking inspiration from the AAA games industry. Gameplay is first person, with an emphasis on stealth, sneak attacks and fighting from a distance.It can be played in colour, by the way. Trailers on the steam page show much of the game in black and white, with only certain things (like dropped items and enemies) highlighted in a rich blood red tone. It's certainly arty to look at this way, and a good challenge to play, but its just as good to play by applying colour to everything.The game is set in the New World, in early colonial Virginia. You awake upon a beach, with your only motivation to head inland and explore. You soon meet a mysterious girl in a red hood and the motivation then shifts to you finding out about who she is and what she wants, though this takes a fair bit of time and interaction with the other elements of this world. Betrayer exudes elements of bizarro, Lovecraftian horror in it's story and the enemies you encounter. I won't spoil the fine details as its certainly a game to go in with very little forward knowledge about, but a large portion of the game is spent in a spirit plane which mirrors the living one. Except its constantly night-time and has this very oppressive and heavy darkness where things immediately ahead of you is enveloped in an enthereal fog, which covers the approaches of many of this world's adversaries, unsurprisingly comprising of skeletons and wraiths.I mentioned it takes inspiration from Dark Souls before - this being in the fact that, when you die, your inventory remains on the spot you died. You respawn at only one location within each map (usually a fort in the centre). You have one shot at retrieving it, though dying in the attempt or elsewhere on the map makes it vanish from the game entirely. It would give the game an element of strategy, if only ammo and money weren't easily expendable resources. Supplies are all over the space. There's even a trader, though he exists only in some other plane of existence even beyond the capabilites of our unknown protagonist to reach, and offers his wares via a weapons rack at each fort.The main strength of this game is really its atmosphere alone. Combat is simplistic, what with the weapons on offer being old guns which you slooowly reload after one shot and bows, not always the most accurate quickfire weapon when the AI enemies almost always exhibit the classic tactic of running right at you. The game's story has no real variety to itbeyond solving mysteries of some dead folk. The main story I won't discuss in detail but, overall, I found it rather bemusing and very much open to interpretation, which suits the ethos of this kind of game I guess.What the game is is part relaxing, with the lush vegetation swaying in the breeze, and part spooky, often edge of your seat scary, though never enough to make you, ahem, pee :D. In terms of stealth, its not great - killing one enemy often leads to another auto-detecting your position and sprinting towards you, to kill you often in two hits on hard difficulty.For all its charm as a unique game, Betrayer's fundamental gameplay elements fall short of its bigger and better competition. However, it's atmosphere and world are actually strong enough positives to give this game merit and make it worth a recommendation from me. 7/10 overall.+ excellent, brooding atmosphere+ its an exploration game to its core and its generally fun to find out the fate of the world's inhabitants/visitors+ main story and the other little stories/mysteries you solve are generally interesting to unravel and are strictly   tied in with the collectible documents you find- combat is serviceable but nothing special- stealth is actually quite bad- not very replayable			"

It didn't need blood, gore, and scary monsters jumping into your face to be disturbing or creepy, it just manages to do that with the sounds and the default visual settings along with various creatures which instill a sense of looming dread on the player.

												<h1>Betrayer</h1>... Well what is it? What will I get from it? and possibly the most important question of them all how much will it cost me, and is it worth my hard earned money? (for me yes)What is it... A PC game that will delight, astound and more than a few times have you jumping out of your knickers. .It's neither a FPS nor a RPG although there is plenty of your friendly Skeletons (blow them apart), Spaniard/Spanish soldiers with demonic eyes, spiders and weird floating beast's to kill. How about a FPEGA (first person exploration ghostly adventure game). Blackpowder regard it as a first person action adventure game (Indie). What-ever call this Indie Game it's well thought out and extremely pleasing to play.Once you clear the first map you're on your way to a rather pleasant and rather unique game (my opinion).Your playing field is forest, forts, Indian villages, settler cabins and more forest. You should not expect any-thing else, after all, the game is set around 1604 colonial America, and this is were settlers set up homes in them days (forest and farming land), and tried to live in peace with the local Indians.The expanse of forests is (what can I say) massive and very much like reality. The attention paid to the greenery. grass, trees, plants, worn pathways all tremendous detail... superb. Buildings, boulders, flags flying, forts very much what you would expect to see, if it was possible to time travel back to that era.The only gripes I have is the use of the sound director. When trying to find all the chests, which I did near the end of the game, could for me have had a greater range. It was like looking for a needle in a haystack at times, and voice over. These guys have still come up with the goods on limited funds. Me... I am a dedicated RPG fan known to sometimes play First Person Shooters, Action Adventures, MMO's and Multi-Player games. I found this game to be a refreshing change and will put these guys at the top of my list and keep my eyes open for their next release... May the force be with you			"

												This game, in many ways, mirrors some of the accomplishments of F.E.A.R. (for obvious reasons); for instance, it forces players to choose and use a small selection of weapons at any one time, and the game has a sense of immediacy in its control scheme lending itself to direct action (I half expected to nail enemies with flying kicks). The otherwordly effect of a child's voice conjured experiences of Alma Wade, as does the duality found within the persona and actions of the antagonists' structures. With these similarities in mind, is Betrayer a good game? Yes.Betrayer is a good game, and stands on its own merits: a strong narrative, striking presentation, and effective use of audio. The dependence on audio cues is rewarding. Dialogue between the player character and non-player characters are accomplished through simple trees, whose options are unlocked when clues are discovered. Roaming the world of Betrayer harkened to Silent Hill, but was animated and alive in a way that allow a player to imagine themselves in the midst of a breathing, sighing forest, tinged and tainted with subtle blood-red cues. When action happens, the player's speakers tend to explode with a rushing, beating heart, and enemies are deadly.The challenging enemies serve to emphasize the theme of the game, and its narrative. There is a lot of text in Betrayer, and it is well-written; the investigations often reveal cruelty or tragedy, and all tie into the eponymous conceit of the game. I'm not sure if spoken dialogue would have improved things, because voice acting on a budget can do more harm than good, and often precludes narratives from achieving the depth text otherwise provides.While well written and compelling, the text of the game can sometimes be confusing. Players have to backtrack and search areas again, which made the later game feel systematic rather than fluid. Stick with it and its rewards will yield themselves.			"

												Holy fantastical fishsticks does this game nail the spooky atmosphere. the first time in town was amazing, and the way the weapons work I believe is a MAJOR attributer to package as a whole. single shot weapons really add to the creepy feel making you worry about placing your shots well. The stories of the characters in the game really REALLY add a neat creepy factor, as does the random things you find out in the overworld. it's just really really well done, and if you like a scare that isn't simply a jumpscare, but comes from wandering around in perfect eere enviroments then this game is for you. my only problem (and it's a minor one) is using sound to find the next waypoint. the only reason i have a problem with this is because for me as a person with a hearing disorder it's sometimes next to impossible to pinpoint where it's coming from. despite this however I would rather them keep this system. it's innovative and only adds to the feel of the game.

Now I wasn't one of those people that left it black and white because that's not how I feel video games should be played, I'm amazed that they added the option to change how the enviroment actually looks (good decision).  Would have been much better with voice acting and a system (that you can turn on-off) to direct people to objectives.			"

												Very atmospheric horror/investigation type game. Sound plays a huge part of the game, and the lack of music (but loads of atmospheric effects) in the game really adds to the feeling of isolation.Around half-way through the game, the mechanics get a bit same-y, but it's definitely worth sticking with the game for the story.Also, if you don't care for the black/white aesthetic, you can turn colors back on again easily. All in all, a good experience, and one that I can recommend.			"

												This is a game that would certainly not appeal to everyone. It's not like F.E.A.R. (Seeing the developers are ex-Monolith) where you'll find a lot of action. This game is not at all action based in my opinion, but it does succeed in capturing the unnerving feeling of horror like the early F.E.A.R. games did. And this is because of the interesting decision of keeping the whole setting in Black, White and Red, and revolving a plotline that fits well with the game's color scheme! The soundtrack is also one of the key aspects of the game here, since it enhances the atmosphere by a great deal, creating a feel of dread on every corner. The game does get a bit dull after you put a few hours in because it's open world and there are no quest markers. So you'll have to play detective, or just keep roaming here and there to finally come up with something interesting. But I somehow enjoyed this as well. I would certainly recommend a buy if you like horror games, and are tired of all those ""jump scare"" shooters.			"

												this is the type of game that would deserve the neutral/maybe option on steam. it has a lot of good ideas but ultimately doesn't work as a whole.you're thrown into an atmospheric world that tries to be too mysterious for its own good (which makes the story fall really short of expectations). the mystery is not that interesting to really make you put up with the gameplay, which you soon realise consists of fetch quests and tons of filler - very simplistic, gets stale quickly.the gameplay mechanics are not balanced, with stealth being pretty much useless and an artificial way to lenghten the game. the combat doesn't feel precise, which ain't helped by the atrocious pathfinding of your enemies.visually striking - the colour and contrast customisation freshen up the experience.the audio design is top notch - the best thing about Betrayer. skeletons are finally spooky again and I've never been so careful around statues.looked to be a short game worth finishing at first. six hours later I'm confident I will not return to it. collectathons are not my cup of tea.Let's just be glad Monolith have been ressurected.

												I was initially skeptical about playing a game which PANDERED solely to the colour blind, but my initial displeasure was soon overcome upon realising that Betrayer is not about some pseudo-medieval fantasy thing, but actually the worlds best world war I simulator. The aim of the game is to run around the maps and kill untermensch (including inexplicably spanish lions, spooky skeletons, gollum, and ♥♥♥♥ off irritating floaty skull things) in order to put down an iron cross on the map. you can then use the power of the kaiser to teleport to these bastions of teutonic power, which makes the game of 'touch the small circles on the map' a lot less boring. there is also an 'interesting' minquest about finding an elusive spade who has run halfway across the country for no obvious reason. this game really explained to me that it's not really surprising that the germans lost world war I, because all of their weapons are shockingly bad and it would have been so much easier if they just artillery striked all the skeletons, who can shoot lightning while you can only shoot arrows and crossbows and those type of bullet which you have to assemble before firing. the other half of the game involves being a psychotherapist to some ghosts. overall a pretty good training manual worth the two quid i spent on it, and it taught me a lot about world war I and ghost counselling, but i fear i will not be able to put this experience on my cv because of how niche these vocations are.

												Calling this a horror game would be a bit misleading as it is less like Amnesia: The Dark Descent where death looms at every step you take and more akin to Bioshock where you are exploring the aftermath of some possibly terrible event.  If you're expecting a deep and complex story then this game probably isn't for you.  If you play through this game following only the main story then you might be left disappointed, but if you're the type who enjoys walking around a semi-open world and collecting memorabilia then you'll discover more about the events that have occurred and come to appreciate the atmosphere the developers have crafted.  The gunplay is fairly enjoyable and can be quite challenging at times especially when facing multiple enemies with anitquated weapons.  The pistol and musket feel immensely satisfying to fire.  Even the basic bow feels nice to shoot with.   The only complaint I would have about combat is the lack of variety of enemies when in the dark side.  One other complaint would be the bug where stepping into certain rock formations can leave you perpetually stuck in them as you can never jump out, forcing you to save and quit and reload the game.  Thankfully progress is saved.The game can feel repetitive after a while, but for those looking to do a bit of exploring while shooting enemies with a one shot pistol or crossbow, this game is fun to play.  I hope the developers make another game in the same vein as this one as it shows good potential to become something even greater and more complex.			"

												Well, the game was good enough that I saw it through to the end and I actually enjoyed a decent chunk of it, but it's just way to hard to recommend such a short game for $22 (CDN). Like, for the same price at time of writing, you can get Skyrim which is infinitely better.The good is the game looks great, especially if you keep it set to monotone + red, it sounds amazing (the enemy sounds are incredible), the combat works well for the most part, though you'll die fast if you go guns blazing which is a good thing in a surivial game. This all come together to create a great setting and atmosphere that you could really get into.The bad is that nothing really happens in that atmosphere. For the most part, you're just running across the map trying to dredge up clues relating to a bunch of ghosts of people you've never seen or heard of. Too be honest, with no face, voice, personality, or attachment to the player, it's hard to care about the ghosts... they just feel like quest vending machines. On top of that, basically nothing gets answered about what happened (or why you should care about what's happened). There is an attempt of an explaination near the end but it's so weak and vague that it makes things worse. I just feel there was so much potential for ""Oh wow!"" moments that blow your mind (see Bioshock), but you just get a few forgettable ""oh, ok""s which is a real waste.Overall though, if you see Betrayer in a bundle or on sale, I'd recommend you pick it up as it's different enough to be worth checking out, plus a lot of people seemed to have enjoyed it more than I. However if you get bored, my advice is don't feel pressured to finish as the game really doesn't have anything new to offer after the first hour or so.			"

												Betrayer is a very interesting, if flawed, game. The gameplay is a fascinating take on standard FPS faire. However, at times it can be repetitive. The weapons are for the most part bows and black powder weapons, both are single shot and have a significant reload time. This makes for tense combat but sometimes it gets boring to watch yourself reload over and over while fighting the same enemies. However, I feel that the end of the game makes up for the repetition of the mid-game. Visually, the game is stunning, with a very interesting setting (17th century, new world). At times, I wished that the setting was more connected to actual historical events and places but the trappings on their own are more than enough.  Overall, I'd recommend this game, not at full price though.			"

												Great game...  not perfect, but well worth the reasonable (discounted) cost on Steam.  10/10 SettingCreepy, sinister graphics and sounds.  Turn the lights down, and turn the volume up.6/10 StoryA little convoluted at times, and suffers from the ""run around and click"" weakness of so many games nowadays, but still not bad.  Well written, anway.9/10 Combat Unreal engine with some nice twists.  17th century guns are scary when being chased by nasty mobs.  I like that you can run out of bullets, and you can play where you lose your loot if you die (recover by fighting your way bak - maybe with low/no ammo!).  Awesome fun.  6/10 ProgressionNo levels or skills, no unique qualities for your toon at all.  Weapons and 'charms' progress a bit, but I found them uninteresting and predictable.   I took my time and wandered around a lot, enjoying the creepy setting, but this whole story can likely be run through in 10 hours or so.			"

I thought that it helped to focus more on some of the sound effects. The sound can be very important if you are close to an important object in the game but not on top of it.Switching between the real world and spirit world was a nice aspect as well. That also helped to build the tension as the game progressed. The story line was good as well, although I would have liked it to be fleshed out just a little bit more. I thought that trying to neatly tie everything up at the very end could have been done a little better, leave a little more mystery!Great game though, really enjoyed it!			"

												Disturbing story, leaves you thinking... Violent stuff has happened and you must find out who did it (find artefacts and present them to related 'persons', no puzzle other than finding the stuff in the first place), and ultimately you must judge whether or not those people should be set free or left to torment on their deeds. Boils down to a binary choice, yes, but it made me think about stuff I probably wouldn't otherwise.Game-play is quite fun, actually, with you exploring several right sized locations for items and 'people' to talk about those items. The maps are populated with some enemies, that re spawn when die, and a nice mechanic is implemented to let you approach those enemies with some stealth. You also have perfect indication if you have been spotted or not, as well as noises that you learn to recognize that point to nearby enemies - which can be pretty hard to spot when not enraged and charging you. New enemies (with accompanying attack mechanics, mostly hit and run but with different flavours) are introduced at a right pace. At least one of them made me jump when they first showed up, which for me is quite hard to achieve in games where the character has some means to defend itself... You must also use a nice mechanic to switch to 'dark mode', which changes the enemies, the colour scheme turns dark, and severely limits your view range. The idea is to explore in light mode, mark up the spots (by hand or by cellphone photos, as the map has no marker functions) and then revisit some places when you have the equipment or on the right mode to progress in story. You also can ask for audio and visual cues to where you should go next, which will help you find the elements relevant to the story.Overall the game was a dark and tense experience but also a quite enjoyable exploration. You are not powerless or forced to do stealth, and although you are encouraged and should use it to at least dispatch the stronger enemies first in a surprise attack, charging up in the right zig-zag pattern might left you alive at the end. Still I recommend do not panic and remember an axe to the face is quite effective in discouraging those pesky charging foes.			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed this game. I have a rule of thumb that when I buy a game, I EXPECT to play an hour of gameplay for each physical dollar that I spent. Is this a short game? Yes. Is it worth the asking price? Definitely. While I have read that a lot of people are on the down side for the fact that the only weapons in the game are: a bow (longbow and short bow), a crossbow, a pistol, and a musket; and the throwing weapons are a bomb and a throwing hatchet, all I can say to those people is, “This a game set in the time when the first settlers were coming to America, did you expect that you would have more weapons than were available?”That being said, the game was quite immersive. I found myself yearning to figure out what each of the wraiths did to keep them in this world. This aspect of the game never got old or repetitive to me. Each of them had a distinct and different story to tell. Yet all of them were bound to the world by one defining factor that you learn through talking to them all.The downside of the game for me was the map, honestly. While it was necessary for the game considering that the map for each level, having a map to look at that displayed both the light and dark worlds made the game rather simple to navigate once you figured out how they dispersed enemy movement. You become all too cautious around all of the way markers and can take out the enemies that surround an item. The “savages” (also known as burning men) are a nice change of pace with the fact that the red outline is less distinct for them.I have also done a full color play through and fully recommend it, especially if you play with the “Death Drop Loop” option enabled. The game takes a new turn in difficulty as the rogue-like aspect of the game comes alive with this option.			"

The scare factor winds down toward the end as you arm yourself to the teeth, but the fights still offer a good challenge.  The rate at which new items and enemies are added to the game could have been spaced out a little better (it is all rather front heavy as it is), but in spite of all of these things, I enjoyed every minute of those 13-14 hours.

												If you are thinking of buying this game, just get it for the story and make sure you pick it up on sale.The stealth system is flawed.  The reason most stealth games work is they take place in enclosed areas.  Unlike Thief, you are in an open area and because of this, when you kill one enemy all of the surrounding enemies will hear and see you and you will be attacked.  After the second area, it is almost impossible to remain in stealth.  The stealth system became so tedious that I found myself putting the game on the easiest difficulty and running from point to point not caring if I had been seen.Combat becomes more tedious than fun.  The amount of hits required to take even the weakest enemies down (if you don't consistently get headshots) makes each encounter more annoying than fun. You will begin to roll your eyes every time you are forced into a fight due to the poor stealth system. And since there is no teather distance, the enemies will follow you around the entire map!Those are the main problems with this game.  It is a great story if you can force yourself to put up with the terrible stealth and combat mechanics, but I can't recommend this game if you are looking for good gameplay.			"

												This is a mystery horror done well!Betrayer was designed with combat, and it fits in flawlessly! Combat is a perfect complement to the style, setting, and story! This genre can often be combat free and I personally enjoy those games. However I always find that challenging combat makes the game far more enjoyable! The combat is so fun in Betrayer, that I actively engaged every enemy I found, on the hardest setting.Betrayer has some really unique art too! That is mostly with the use of colour ... or lack there of. There is a really creative use of mechanics that change what is essentially day and night (that's the spoiler free version). When the player initiates (except in one instance) the art, monsters, and story all change on the same map.I want to go on, but am afraid of spoiling the ending. The point is that this game is fantastic, truly unique, engaging, rewarding, and positively confusing. If you're looking for a short and complete game with a mystery that keeps you thinking a while after – then this is a good choice.			"

												Great Game. It's like a stealth, horror, roguelite with a nice story in it. I thought the gameplay was a tad bit repetitive with a lot of going back and forth, but it wasn't that bad. Combat is nice, you get this old school arsenal so planning while fighting is a must. Sound is amazing, from the sound of enemies to the listening of objectives, immensely good. The visual though, whether you choose to use the default or coloured, they're both strikingly beautiful and so vibrant.8/10			"

												It's hard to make something of this game. It'c climatic, the story is interesting, the ending quite nice. It's cheap, I've got it for 1 euro during a sale.But it's unfinished. It lacks voice-acting, which would be a nice addition. Combat is rather minimalistic and repetitive. The trade at the posts rather silly and unnecessary. It's basically a connect-the-dots game where instead of drawing a line between them, you run between set points until you've been everywhere. You don't have to use your brain at all, you don't need to read the story at all. Over all the game isn't very engaging.All the combat and running could be taken out as it's mostly a waste of time. But the game itself is interesting in a way. It's main problem is probably a low budget and the fact it's intended to be so small.			"

												Simply put, Betrayer is stunningly beautiful and hauntingly mysterious! It's use of black and white, emphasizing the color red, gives it a unique look not seen too often in games and when paired with the frequent breezes, swaying vegetation and nature sounds truly make the experience surreal.  The selection of weapons in pretty impressive for a budget game and there are even charms you can find, that when equipped, will enhance your movement speed, HP and other attributes.  Both the charms and weapons (muskets, rifles, crossbows, short/longbows, etc.; it takes place in colonial times) have varying degrees of strength depending on the type, such as crude, quality and exceptional. There is a light and dark world you must trek through in order to solve the mystery of what's going on in the game and in particular, with the Maiden in Red.  There are collectibles such as chests and letter scraps  and gifts to find and also clues that will allow you to solve other, lesser mysteries involving ghosts you encounter along the way.  There are also a decent number of enemy types, such as skeletons, spider=like crustacean things (yeah, no idea what these things are but they're cool), undead Spaniards, phantoms (skull/deer=headed ghosts....don't ask about the deer heads, freaked me out first time i saw them, thinking it was the Wendigo or something coming after me...) and burning, undead Native American warriors. You can even unlock destinations and quick travel between them, as well as upgrade how many times you can heal. You even have tomahawks and explosives to throw, and like arrows, the tomahawks can be retrieved from fallen enemies which is very nice.Keep in mind this is a budget game, so the amount of content the developers put into Betrayer for only $20 is truly impressive.  I know this was certainly one gaming experience I won't soon forget. I highly recommend buying this game, even if it's not on sale.  Enjoy!!			"

												Gameplay: 4/10Fun adventure, but a little shallow.It can't be denied, for a surprisingly simple game ""Betrayed"" is surprisingly fun. It's easy to figure out, nothing is too taxing and the gameplay ebbs and flows between a parallel dimensional concept. However after a short time I found myself wanting more variables to play with. Where's my stamina bar? Why can't I climb trees? I want more items. More dynamic enemies. My health goes down too fast (I can only imagine they did this to lengthen the game duration as you are forced to regularly go back for health). Overall the gameplay felt a little mechanical and 2 dimensional, unfinished, yet relaxing, quite enjoyable and hopefully the start of something big. Game ambiance: 5/10There isn't really much, but what does have I like.Ambience? What ambience? Well... The grass and the tress bend, sway and dance as the wind blows through on a sunny day. Shhhhh, I'm going to take a nap.   ...was that a bird?Reliability/Stability: 10/10Reliable. No crashes/problems/errors to report.Story/Plot: 6/10Not bad. The plot was never dull for me. I enjoyed it throughout. There were a few elements that were original and some that sounded religiously suspicious. That being said I felt I had to drop the score a few points because, again, the game felt unfinished, or more like a concept than a full release. Concept: 7/10Brilliant. It's good to see a bow and arrow and black powder arms game. I love the way you can play with the colour and how colour is part of the game. The quests are great too.Concept execution: 5/10Good clean simple fun. I really hope there is a Betrayed 2 and it's literally, in every way,  twice the game this is.Textures: 5/10Average. Characters look somehow ""plonked"" in the there without much visual continuity with scenery textures. Although the shrubs on the ground have nice textures.Modelling: 6/10Average, but better than the textures. Weapons look great. Plant leaves are ok.Graphics: 6/10Overall they are ok. Despite it's shortcomings the game is by no means intolerable.Sound: 5/10weapons are great! As for the rest the game needs a bigger sound library.Music: 6/10Menu music is nice.			"

												just as i thought! never trust an indie game maker. they always write lousy code, they don't have the funds or funbase to test their games in various systems, and they are never around when you need support...betrayer betrayed me just on the 2nd map. it keeps crashing as soon as i step into some place called fort henry...so i'm betraying betrayer and deleting it from my hdd never to see it again...--So this was my first review about Betrayer. I tried to play it at my ex-laptop, and since I've upgraded to a new one, I said what the hell, why not give this another chance?It's good that I did. What I saw simply became one of my best experiences in horror gaming.Actually it is pretty simple: Search, fight, repeat in an Open World-ish map in 18th century new England. Nice touches of RPG genre, stealth, good weapon dynamics and good opponent AI etc etc...The catch is; it is all in a monochrome horror atmosphere! Which is good and matches the overall mood of the game.Tho the game does not bring much new stuff to the genre, I especially liked the stealth running in gusts, the eerie other world, the usage of sounds and noises, and the stealthy indians which can be spotted by the bird noise they make.In the end it is a decent game and I am converting my recommendation from No to Yes...

												Well if you had, one shot, to kill a group, of demon possessed spaniards, with a musket and a bow and arrow... would you go for it? Not gonna lie, this game makes you think about your plan of attack. You're working with 17th centruary technology, meaning your musket isn't a freaking AK-47. One shot, long reload time, fighting against angry spirits that will drop you all over the floor like your mothers fine china. Your are out gunned, out numbered, out classed, and still trying to be a detective in your own right. Just remember, the wind is your friend, the wind is your only friend.

												The game has two things going for it. The black and white visuals, and at time the combat is amazingly fun. But this product feels so unfinished. With so many problems like terrible visibility. Especially the games signature black and white visuals. Unfortunately i had to switch the game to color just to see the enemies. The game has very limited check points. The story runs out of steam after the first map and seems like it is forgotten about. The mysteries are so boring, and all the same. Every mystery in the game is hitting the bell, listen skill, talk to ghost, and/or kill enemies aroung him first. Another Con to the game is very limited enemy types. there are 3 types of enemies in the light, and i believe 3 in the dark.Everything about the listen skill is absolutly infuriating(From the lack of a Tutorial to a skill needed to complete the game. The fact is its utter♥♥♥♥♥♥to use and has you spinning in circles just to figure out where to go, the fact you need head phones for locating the targets when you get close,and that speakers without surround sound are detrimental to play with, and all without a warning from the game to use headphones. The biggest complaint is that you cant choose what you target, and with multiple mission targets at once you will be sent all over the map at random. it will sent you to The north west corner of the map, and then send you to the south east corner to find out there was another target in northwest corner so you will have to spend all that time running back, and in each map there is a bell the must be found and rung, so you have to complete each map with the bell ringing and not ringing. So a ungodly amount of time is back tracking. Like over 65% is ♥♥♥♥ing back tracking.)Dont be fooled by the intriguing visuals, this is a game far better for looking at then actually playing. "

Atmosphere is good and environment is nicely done (though a bit minimalistic), game mechanic is well learnable and I think the game does a good job as an action adventure. I enjoyed the combat, searching for better weapons and treasures. The listening compass is good idea also.My only (very minor) reproach would be the map for there is no way to add a custom waypoint to it and follow it - it just would be nice but I can live and play well without it.

The combat is satisfying and there are a number of weapons and ways to take down your enemies. The environment is deeply immersive, and the story is interesting enough for you to care about it. I found myself exploring the island for no reason whatsoever, but that's not a bad thing. Recommended!			"

												The game's not very engaging from what I've played:The black and white aesthetic with the occasional red object is neat at first, but it quickly gets monotone and tiring. There's very little in the way of sound design, and what is there sets up the mood well, but it's a case that quality just doesn't supersede quantity.Some experimentation is needed to figure out what all the buttons do on the pad. Figuring out how to switch weapons was especially polarizing, seeing as how you don't get a radial menu or anything, but instead a single button (LB) cycles through all three weapons at once. Otherwise the controls are fine.The interface feels very clunky in some spots. Cycling through fast-travel locations is a major pain, and so is navigating your equipment menu. The minimalistic interface design also has the unintended side-effect of making the whole thing seem very budget-y and not very well implemented.The combat is a bit one-sided. At first it feels quite visceral, with enemies dashing towards you as you try to put one more arrow into them, and the game does have a neat mechanic in masking the noise you make when a gust of wind hits your surroundings. However, the combat just doesn't feel deep enough: you get a handful of ranged weapons which all perform very similarly to one another, a short-range tomahawk which you can throw for massive damage, and a few bombs which help to thin out crowds. Enemy patterns don't differ so much from one another that you need to adopt any different strategies: aggro enemies in front of you, wiggle left and right repeatedly to dogde projectiles, fire projectile of your choice back at them. The odd inclusion of an option to drop your equipment when you die is meant to make combat more tense, but it doesn't add anything meaningful to it in my opinion, it just makes it more annoying.I couldn't figure out how to attach myself to the story in any point. You're a shipwreck making his way inland where Englishmen and Spaniards have set up camp and constantly have skirmishes with indians and each other. Death permeates all of the camps however, and after digging around a bit, you gain the ability to talk to the wraiths of the people that lived in the region, and piece together how they died. Reading by this narrative ultimately isn't really interesting: while the backstory of these people is well-written and often pretty gruesome, the medium by which they are delivered falls short: there are no cutscenes and no voice acting, leaving you with a pretty paltry dialogue box and your imagination (nothing wrong with that, it's just not for me).There's also a lady that follows you around in the camps, the only other apparent living human you can talk to. You can give her things and talk about the apparitions you're seeing, but she doesn't share in your ability to see the dead or the strange ashen figures scattered throughout the camp. Making you question the main character's sanity like that is a legitimately cool plot point, but the lady herself is hardly engaging: like the other characters, she lacks a voice actor, and any other kind of different idle animations or behavior. Her dialogue isn't even that engaging to make you care for her all that much, and giving her gifts, if it did anything at all after, passed right by my head.There's just not that much great to say about the game. I gave it a few hours, and made it to the third map you can get to. Maybe that's not enough time, but the lack of sound assets, strange choice of visual style, clunky interface and simplistic (unnecessary even?) combat meant that I didn't want to give it any more of a chance for it to grab me. It asks for a fair price though, so maybe someone with a bit more patience can find enjoyment in it.			"

												Great game...  not perfect, but well worth the reasonable (discounted) cost on Steam.  10/10 SettingCreepy, sinister graphics and sounds.  Turn the lights down, and turn the volume up.6/10 StoryA little convoluted at times, and suffers from the ""run around and click"" weakness of so many games nowadays, but still not bad.  Well written, anway.9/10 Combat Unreal engine with some nice twists.  17th century guns are scary when being chased by nasty mobs.  I like that you can run out of bullets, and you can play where you lose your loot if you die (recover by fighting your way bak - maybe with low/no ammo!).  Awesome fun.  6/10 ProgressionNo levels or skills, no unique qualities for your toon at all.  Weapons and 'charms' progress a bit, but I found them uninteresting and predictable.   I took my time and wandered around a lot, enjoying the creepy setting, but this whole story can likely be run through in 10 hours or so.			"

												This is going to be a short review since I only did one playthrough and it was months ago. However, this game has an amazing atmosphere and the story is also very interesting as well. The game mechanics feel pretty fluid, but the stealth system leaves a bit to be desired. Graphics are well done, but the game starts in black and white (which is somewhat atmospheric) but you can change it to show colors if you wish. It makes target acquisition easier. This games got some good spooks involved, also the skeleton war rages on within the game so there's always that. Maiden In Red is Bae. This game has basically no replay value, but the one good runthrough takes on average (going from my playthrough and other reviewers) seems to be about 10 or 11 hours. I feel the experience that was given to me (I got it on sale, I think.) was worth the full price of the game. That's basically it. I don't really think description of the setting is necessary because it's well put in the store page ""About this Game"" section.			"

												A game about exploring, investigating, uncovering mysteries, with combat more or less as a side activity.This review basically complements or simply adds to the hundreds of other reviews already posted.The highlight of the game is the stories you uncover. Each wraith you meet can't remember what has happened or what is keeping them from resting in peace, and will at first only remember one thing that happened. For example one will only remember staring into the barrel of a gun, which will make you assume the wraith was murdered, until you uncover more clues and belongings which will help the wraith remember what happened and you will eventually realise that your assumptions of the events that took place are completely different from what actually happened. Your first impressions will never be correct. In fact, they will be far off. And this is what, to me, makes the game really shine.There is no true horror in the game. The game will feel creepy for the first hour or so but after that you will realise this is not a horror game. There is virtually no hand-holding or tutorial. There is a mysterious woman, also with amnesia, who has her own past she is trying to discover who will a few times direct your next move, which include assisting her in figuring out her own. The majority of the side stories also tie together to the main story line involving the said mysterious woman.The combat is challenging at times but revolves around switching between weapon types for either faster firing or more damage for different enemies, while dodging their attacks. Virtually no replay value however (unless you want to witness the ending again) as all investigations are recorded in a book so you can always read back at what the stories are, and there are no cinematics.For $20, you may be wishing there to be more content, otherwise when the game goes on sale it is definitely worth a buy. Lots to do for 100% completionists out there too!			"

												The graphics are simply amazing, the greyscale style looks great, and if you don't want it in greyscale the saturation can be changed in options. The story is mostly told through the stories of ghosts, what the maiden in red tells you, and notes that you find. The game is open world, and while the world is split into maps, they're large maps with varied terrain, and there are treasure chests and buried treasure that gives a reason to explore, if the great scenery isn't enough. There's also fast travel.There are armored soldiers and stealthy natives patrolling the area, and stealth is a viable option if you don't want to run in guns blazing. The weapons are well designed and animated, with 2 flintlock guns, 2 bows, a crossbow, a tomahawk, and grenades, a nice break from the usual ""pistol, SMG, rifle, etc."". The guns, bows, and crossbows can be bought in different qualities, and there are unique weapons with even better stats hidden around the maps too.On each map there is a bell that moves you to a very atmospheric alternate dimension where you can talk to ghosts and try to solve some of the area's mysteries while fighting skeletons. There is a unique ""listen"" feature that helps you find clues, ghosts, and statues by making a sound near their location, which prevents the frustration of not being able to find the next clue.Overall, definately worth buying.

												I initially jumped into this game not knowing what to expect other than the beautiful and realistic environments I had seen briefly in various gameplay videos. The overall mood portrayed by the lighting and environment is perfectly suited for the style of gameplay.With that being said, do not expect this game to simply guide you through the campaign by automatically setting up new missions after arriving at checkpoints. It doesn't work that way. You're expected to figure everything out with little to no guidance whatsoever. To me, this very aspect is the genius of the game. Taking place during a time period devoid of any type of helping-hand technology, I feel that the developers were able to accurately capture that sense of vulnerability and uneasiness that should be expected from a game of this nature.Overall, for an indie game I'd rate it 4.5/5. It's a perfectly good game that I'll be following for quite a while in hopes of new additions being added over time.			"

												I really liked this game. The black and white graphics (which can apparently be changed) really gave the game a different feel. I thought that it helped to focus more on some of the sound effects. The sound can be very important if you are close to an important object in the game but not on top of it.Switching between the real world and spirit world was a nice aspect as well. That also helped to build the tension as the game progressed. The story line was good as well, although I would have liked it to be fleshed out just a little bit more. I thought that trying to neatly tie everything up at the very end could have been done a little better, leave a little more mystery!Great game though, really enjoyed it!			"

												The art style is absolutely gorgeous. An eerie environment and momentarily gusty winds make you want to creep around every corner. Finding all the pieces to every puzzle starts off straight away, getting you into the groove of looking everywhere, but a ""nearby item"" tone makes things less grueling. Combat is, actually, fairly realistic. The bows are absolute trash until upgraded versions become available, and the one-shot nature of the guns I've used so far makes combat absolutely difficult. Tactics are needed more than brawn, so be wise.FOV can be adjusted for those that FPS games make a little nauseous. But I will say, the constant black-and-white nature of things doesn't help.			"

												Very Atmospheric Game!As for some of you who don't know, there are not a lot of games that take place in the early 17th century that center around the colonization of the Americas, where this game takes place in.  It's one of those time periods (in my opinion) that don't cater much to certain people primarily, but this game stands out.The atmosphere is what makes this game, with an open world similar to Skyrim in a smaller scale.  The options of changing color is nice and the whole concept is there.  It gives you a lonely feeling where you only interact with the girl in red and the spirits while enemies are out to hunt you.The only 2 minor problems I have is the fact that you can only have 3 weapons at a time when there are only 5 in total.  I use the Musket, Pistol, and Longbow primary and not the shortbow and crossbow at all.  I would consider setting the 4 and 5 key as a 4th and 5th weapon slot so that we wouldn't have to set the weapons from the inventory slot.The other problem is the lack of enemies in the game.  Sure, the nature and huge world are nice, but I feel that some more action would be nice. I find that the Spanish Conquistadors and the Statues are the most fun to take out but there's not enough of them.Other than that, Great game and will recommend to people looking for a new themed first person shooter/adventure! 9.5/10			"

												I want to recommend this game. I really, really do want to say I liked this game a lot and that I would recommend it to anyone. But the tedious and repetitive gameplay, the unclear ""path"" I am supposed to be following (mostly a criticism for the end of the game), the multitude of--what seem to be--red herrings, and many other problems, keep me from being able to positively review this game.It's classified as an ""action-adventure"" game, but I think of it as more of a ""horror-atmosphere mystery game with a little bit of (pointless) fighting-action."" I was initially interested in the game because it seemed like it placed a lot of emphasis on its creepiness--the horror atmosphere. I am not enthralled with it as a ""horror"" game. It wasn't scary. It kind of pulls off the ""creepy""-thing with the black&white color choice, the demonic-eyed conquistadors, the shadowy natives, the periodic blood splatters. But the creepy atmosphere is pretty much lost after the first zone. It's reptitive by the second zone. Nothing changes. It's just a copy-paste of each level, each ""monster"" or shadow. Horror games don't thrive on monotony. Even if this game is only ""atmospherically"" horror, it's completely lost in the repetition of the zones.If it fails at horror, does it at least stand up as a mystery or action game? Ehhh...Not really. The only ""action"" in the game is killing the demonic conquistadors and natives. And spiders, in later zones. (Woowheee?) At first it was interesting, like I was actually trying to survive because there were creepy murderers (or whatever) on the loose, and maybe these conquistadors are related to that! And whoa, they make this creepy sound when they recognize me! And then I've killed my 20th conquistador and the novelty has officially worn off. Same for the natives and spiders. There are 3 types of bows (crossbow, long, and short bow), 2 guns (musket, pistol), throwable hatches, and explosives (grenades). I never used anything but the bows because the guns have impractical reload times (even the best guns in the game) and mediocre damage compared to the speed of the bows. The bows are also the only ""stealth"" option in the game. It's not super easy to stealth, but I was able to pull it off a fair amount of the time. (Betrayer Stealth crash course: Crouch a long ways away from the enemy. Shoot them with your bow. If you're lucky, you 1-shot them. If not, be prepared to fight 5 consquistadors all charging at you at once). It doesn't matter which weapon(s) you choose to use. It doesn't matter if you choose to kill everything you see, or avoid everything you can. The ""action"" part of this game does not matter at all. There are a few scripted fights, which are fine, but anything outside of the script is pointless. No amount of dead conquistadors has anything to do with anything. I'm not even sure the game clearly explains where the demonic conquistadors/natives come from (and, although I do have a foggy idea, I will spare going into it for the sake of keeping spoilers out of this review as much as I can since it is supposed to be, I guess, a Mystery game).I also believe it falls flat as a mystery game, though. So many of the stories in the game ultimately did not, I felt, tie in to the ""main"" storyline surrounding the Maiden in Red. Actually, I found some of the side stories more interesting than the Maiden's (and, yes, I did play through the entire game, and I still find some of the other side stories more interesting). I wish that all the stories tied together. It seems like some of them tied together loosely, but I wanted more direct connections to the Maiden. The stories themselves are another complaint I had: there was SO MUCH DAMNED READING. I don't mind reading a sentence here-or-there on page scraps, but when you start getting a dozen or more page scraps per zone, plus clues, plus talking to people, you have completely lost my interest in reading every word on every clue and every scrap by the end of the 3rd zone. I skimmed everything in the end of the game, unless the story was directly related to the Maiden. I do understand this is a story-telling game (much more so than an ""action"" game), but holy cow it was not interesting enough, or connected enough, for me to give a damn about reading every side quest NPC's sob story about how this-or-that brother or mom or dog or whatever got murdered. I get it. You all murdered someone, or were murdered by someone. Is every zone like this? Oh my God, yes, every zone is like this. Does ANY of this have to do with the main story? Nope. No, it does not. Well,♥♥♥♥♥♥ Lost my interest.I also think it's a huge problem when there were a couple points at the end of the game where I was totally lost. I didn't feel the game gave me enough pointers about what I was supposed to be doing. I had to do a few web searches to figure out what I was supposed to be doing to progress the story. It is NOT a good thing when a story-driven game isn't able to help prod you along to continue the story. If the developers intentionally left it difficult, saying I am supposed to explore and find these things on my own, that feels very strongly like a lame excuse for poor writing and decision-making about expectations of the players. Here are the things I DID like about it:» The Black & White color scheme. Although I see this as a common complaint, I really enjoyed it! I am happy they gave me the option to play in color, but I chose to stick to black&white through the whole thing. It's clear the developers intended for the color scheme (or lack thereof) to be a part of the game's ambiance. I felt it worked very well for creating a creepier environment.» I did actually like that combat was a little more difficult in this game. If you want me to feel I have to ""survive"" then making combat brutal is a way to do it. It's sort of a flimsy thing to like, especially with all of my critiques about it, but I suppose I liked the difficulty of it, if nothing else. » I liked the story-telling concept. I liked the stories, for the most part, when it wasn't starting to bore me to death to read everything and piece it all together (seriously, it requires some willpower to retain and remember all the information you get, especially because it's piecemeal and sporadic). The ending of the main story was interesting, though not surprising. I was disappointed that I was able to guess the end of the game less than halfway through (not all the exact details, but the gist of it). I think they had some really neat concepts, though the rest of the game ""wrapped around"" the story was not as well-executed.» The totems. I don't know why, but the totems and their screaming was awesome every time I heard it.» The Thief. I think the idea is interesting, and it was fun to hunt him down. I thought it was silly there was a Thief for every single zone. Maybe make him unique? Or actually worth something unique, and not just gold? I felt like there was a lost opportunity for this ""character."" Why not make him related to a side quest, or more directly to the Maiden? Why not have him relate to *anything at all*? [[[[[[MILD SPOILER]]]]]] » Hearing the bell ring for the first time. It scared me half to death. It was less cool each time I had to ring the bell, especially at the end when the game makes you backtrack through towns a couple times.As I said at the start, I REALLY want to recommend this game because it is fairly unique and there were aspects I did like. But until the game is either really overhauled or they've added/changed enough content to make it very different from its current conception.			"

												Amazing game, but doesn't feel polished up to it's potential.It's been a long time since I've played Betrayer, and for my first few hours of the game, it was pretty entertaining. One moment I'd be shooting down one guy only then to be fighting three more monsters that caught on to what happened. Another moment I'd be in the Underworld, dodging energy blasts, staving off angry banshees, and doing something similar to a ""run and gun"" shootoff. Graphics are pretty, and if you're like me and you turned the color way up, the world looks very beautiful and lush. On top of that, the monsters (despite them losing their scare after a while) are fairly good at making you panic, be it a giant armored bear(?) chucking rocks at you or a banshee making cheap blows from behind.I guess the only thing this game is missing is the desire to come back. Despite some of the fights being pretty entertaining, the combat feels kind of dull. Stealth is also annoying and arbitrary, as most of the time you kill one monster and then everybody else knows exactly where you are.Another issue is that the story (and how you figure things out) isn't nearly as satisfying as how other games dish out story. There's nothing wrong with the ""whodunnit"" detective style of figuring what happened to people in the abandoned camps, but when you discover that ""this person killed herself over the reckless accidental suicide of her child,"" you don't get the emotional ""pow"" you normally get from some other game. This would probably be because of the heavy text-based dialogue or the complete absence of cutscenes, but I don't want to bash the devs for lack of resources.All in all, this game is enjoyable in some sense, but it can be really hard to keep playing it, especially if there's other games to play. You might want to pick up this game if it's on sale; despite its lack of keeping you fully engaged, the trading cards are cheap and the backgrounds and emoticons are really cool.			"

												Where to begin....this game starting out may have the one up on a few jumpscares for you but you get used to it after a while. The artwork is nice to look at whether you want to keep the monochrome look or want some more color added to your life. The story is rather well done too but with an expected ending. Unfortunately, it's not the most difficult game even with the enemy settings set to max difficulty. However, it's worth a few hours of your time to check it out.8/10 would betray again.			"

												I *HATE* games that use an exclusively first person point of view.  I've got a list of reasons why (and they make sense to *me*), but the long and short of it is that it's just my personal preference.  Having said that, in this game the ambiance was so visually striking and creepy, I found myself not caring about the perspective.  After playing for only a short amount of time, this game managed to give me the unmistakable feeling of vulnerability, as if something dreadful is watching just out of view, waiting to enact some malicious intent.  It was able to make me feel like I had just stumbled through a fissure and had broken through into another world, similar to our own, but at the same time wholly unsettling in its differences.    For a cheap indie title, this game is stylish and manages to hit the ""horror"" nail on the head better than most triple A developers.  With Betrayer, the devs show that they understand that jump scares aren't scary, just startling, and that mystery is half of an effective horror story.  I'm looking forward to what they come out with next.			"

												First things first, the game looks much better with color, that option, which I don't recall if it existed when I first got the game last year, made it more enjoyable. The game has an interesting idea, a first person survival horror adventure, though, regrettably, it fails at the survival horror part. There is nothing to fear, except random attacks from enemies, which after a time, you can learn where they spawn, so, it stops being a threat. Ghost stories are pretty interesting, but then again, they seem to be almost always the same, oh, I thought I was innocent, nah, I just killed him/her, whatever, they deserved it. Stealth, a joke, no need to use it, could have been implemented better. Enemies, always the same, some ranged attacks, then they charge into melee. The ending, dissatisfying to say the least.			"

												It's hard to make something of this game. It'c climatic, the story is interesting, the ending quite nice. It's cheap, I've got it for 1 euro during a sale.But it's unfinished. It lacks voice-acting, which would be a nice addition. Combat is rather minimalistic and repetitive. The trade at the posts rather silly and unnecessary. It's basically a connect-the-dots game where instead of drawing a line between them, you run between set points until you've been everywhere. You don't have to use your brain at all, you don't need to read the story at all. Over all the game isn't very engaging.All the combat and running could be taken out as it's mostly a waste of time. But the game itself is interesting in a way. It's main problem is probably a low budget and the fact it's intended to be so small.			"

Really interesting take on FPS, walking sim, and survival horror genres, with early 17th century weapons and challenging enemies. Can be tough if you want it, but the worst that happens is that you respawn at a safe place. Lots of interesting collectibles and investigations, and very well written and thought out. Plus the art style is cool, even if the environments are repetitive. Highly recommended, 8.5/10			"

Also noteworthy is the need to use all of your arsenal and weapons in dealing with different kinds of enemies, and the low ammo availability.

												What a great game with some well written narative that drives the story forward.I would recommend playing it in it's default black, white and red mode as I think it really adds to the storyline and also makes looking for clues a little easier too.Thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to seeing more from the developers.

												The game isn´t bad, but I cannot say that the game is perfect. I enjoyed the time with ""Betrayer"" and it was so good that I played it twice. Here some advantages and disadvantages:+I felt the spirit of the new and dangerous worldthe open world is created beatiful and the b/w colors suits well to the gamelarge choose of weapons: from knifes and tomohawks during bombs to smoking barrelsthe story is nice and I enjoyed the finding of the truth in the darkness, but the end....No stupid alliesThe Different between day (this world) and night (after/another/world)-IA of enemies isn´t good. You will ever hear if they detected you.Small number of different enemiesNo final Boss just some waves with old boring enemiesthe final scene didn´t satisfy me. It´s as the story doesn´t finish yet but it isdialogs with the red girl. Almost of them are useless "

												This game is just cool. The world is large enough that the amount of content you are looking for doesn't seem miles away, but the trip is perilous enough that you are on edge through most of the trip. I don't play horror games often, but when I do, they don't necessarily get to me. This game lets horror sit in the back, and kicks my seat when I just barely get too comfortable. At the time of writing I'm not even close to completing this, but I find the Wraiths stories compelling and tragic, I find the combat well paced and interesting, I find the enemies to be well varied and unnerving in ways that I can't adequately describe with words. I've never panicked so much at a new sound. This might sound silly, but if this game were to support VR I might just have to get involved with that. I haven't had an experience that let me feel so engrossed in what I was doing that I ended up immersed like this game has made me.			"

												If you are looking for a stealth game, Betrayer is just barely worth it, and only because there are so few stealth games that it gets into the top 10 by default. If you are looking for an FPS game, a story game, a game with unique art style, a game with intersting morals, or a game that will be fresh, new and unique; you will find some exquisite morsels drowning in a cauldron of time consumption. What was there wasn't enhanced, built up, or polished to a shining beacon, but instead buried and muddied and lost in overgrowth. It really is a shame, because this game had amazing moments. I looked forward to every conversation I had with the Lady in Red. Though they ultimately weren't substantive, they were still emotionally interesting to me. The setting was extremely unique, and supported and enhanced by all the types of interactions in the game. The enemies were strange and exciting when they were newly introduced. There was a strong atmosphere of forbidding at key moments. Atmosphere was created naturally, not artificially. The weapons felt nice. The graphics were beautiful and it felt good just exploring the area and engaging in skirmishes with the enemies. The stories were realistic in the sense that they were tangled messes of human tragedy, without simple solutions. But then Betrayer backpeddled hard over all it had going for it.The progress is entirely composed of digging up items after circling and crisscrossing the map two or three times. The maps have a nice coat of paint, but underneath they are just empty expanses. There are ferns. There are trees. There are some forts. There are large boulders. There are some broken fences. I might not have noticed the lack of substance, I might not have even minded.... except first I had to clear the locations of enemies so I didn't die constantly or have to circle around them for an even longer traversal. Then I had to clear the map of items and clues scattered across the landscape. (this is just arriving at the location, clicking, reading a sentence description, then moving on to the next 40 items.) Then I had to run around the map for a third time, but now in the dark, to retrieve a few more things. Wash, rinse, and repeat for all 8 maps. Don't expect the gameplay to vary or become more interesting (which the game conveys openly reasonably clearly). There are a few new enemies introduced over time, but the interaction with them is largely the same. Worse, what was once strong and salient in the game, becomes tedium and annoyance.Almost all of the above problems could have been solved if this game was 1/3rd the length. But of course then it would have only been 1/3rd the length. Not a problem in my book, but it would demonstrate more obviously the lack of new content in the game. It is hard to say the game ""lacks content,"" because the maps have loads of treasure and things to find scattered across them. Clues are unique, notes are unique, stories are unique, but they don't really add more to the experience. If you have read Atlas Shrugged, you might know what I mean about it being good except that the second 2/3rds are just the first 1/3rd over again. It is worth it in terms of unique experience and good storytelling plus excellently executed atmosphere early on, but not worth it in terms of time spent jogging across maps and slowly dissolving amounts of fun. 10-15 hours total, ~4-8 hours of worthy content.It is enjoyable, and yet a slog at the same time. (Maybe get it anyway?)			"

												This is going to be a short review since I only did one playthrough and it was months ago. However, this game has an amazing atmosphere and the story is also very interesting as well. The game mechanics feel pretty fluid, but the stealth system leaves a bit to be desired. Graphics are well done, but the game starts in black and white (which is somewhat atmospheric) but you can change it to show colors if you wish. It makes target acquisition easier. This games got some good spooks involved, also the skeleton war rages on within the game so there's always that. Maiden In Red is Bae. This game has basically no replay value, but the one good runthrough takes on average (going from my playthrough and other reviewers) seems to be about 10 or 11 hours. I feel the experience that was given to me (I got it on sale, I think.) was worth the full price of the game. That's basically it. I don't really think description of the setting is necessary because it's well put in the store page ""About this Game"" section.			"

												first things first, don't read into the story of this game at all. don't even read the discription, go into this game blind and discover it all as your character does. this game is amazingly written, and is probably the best done adventure game (with horror elements) i've ever played in the sense of it's story and exicution. it will fill you with the most terrifying kind of curiosity as you're compelled to find answers even when you may be uneasy about going forward. and when i say horror elements i don't mean things jumping out at you, there's non of that weaksauce, i mean the environment, the ambiance, the mood of the game is unsettling and uncanny while in a wold so beautiful. and remember, it's an adventure, you don't know where to go or where to look but you'll find it, just use your senses. and lastly at least for your first play, don't mess with the color settings. Tip: if you get stuck check your notes to see what things still arn't checked off as having al the information for them, it will give you guidance on where to go.10/10!			"

												This is a review for those unsure of purchasing. First of all yes you can restore color to the game; as much or as little as youd like. Secondly, this game is all about atmosphere. It is the driving factor of the entire experience. It has features akin to Dark Souls of loot recovery but controls as smooth and simple as Far Cry 3 or Battlefield. The enemies are quite smart and devilishly accurate. Stealth plays a major factor in survival so keep your ears and eyes out. Sound is another tool you must use to navigate and investigate clues and items. This game is for those who enjoy unraveling a story and becoming emersed in its atmosphere but also enjoy some visceral combat.			"

												An interesting visual experiment, and highly atmospheric, but a bit weak on actual gameplay.

It is noticable - the aesthetic aspects of the game are brilliant, but the landscape is almost bare of gameplay adm the story is too artisiticly jumbled to be entertaining for long.

												Nothing Special but Not BadThere are some interesting mechanics to Betrayer, which is good because its repetitive nature means you'll have plenty of time to grasp them as you do area after similar area, killing enemy after similar enemy.  You're explained little at the start, which allows the player to piece together the mechanics so by the time you're late game you should have most of it figured out.For those who enjoy a slower paced game, focusing on sneaking up on enemies and taking time to aim, this could be for you.  It is not a *bad* game -- but it's not one with high replay value, repetitive levels, and three achievements based on grinding over being actual achievements.  The simplicity of the game would almost be a strength had the pacing been different and more thought put into not making things feel like a game (chests and the typical game-style merchant) would have helped it a lot.  Not a game for people who don't like searching for stuff, even with the stark contrast and cues that help the player.100% Game Complete in 20 hrs.  I used a map guide, but even without the map I managed to nab all the best weapons as soon as I found the shovel and the longest part was just grinding for stealth kills.The Good:- Stylized world- Interesting use of Sound and Limited Colour- Discovery- Fast-Travel optionThe Bad:- Extremely Repetitive- Lack of variety of enemies- Flat characters, uninteresting story- Poor hit detection			"

												Betrayer is a little hard to describe; on one hand, the developers know their craft from FEAR, and they haven't done any less with their work here. On the other hand, it has one of the bleakest worlds I've seen in a video game, sometimes involving wandering for hours just trying to figure out what clues you might have missed. I bought the game during Early Access and it's progressed quite a bit since it first came onto Steam, and as such I can't recommend it enough, at least to try, for the sake of the things it does well in its atmosphere, storytelling, and gameplay.

												This game, in many ways, mirrors some of the accomplishments of F.E.A.R. (for obvious reasons); for instance, it forces players to choose and use a small selection of weapons at any one time, and the game has a sense of immediacy in its control scheme lending itself to direct action (I half expected to nail enemies with flying kicks). The otherwordly effect of a child's voice conjured experiences of Alma Wade, as does the duality found within the persona and actions of the antagonists' structures. With these similarities in mind, is Betrayer a good game? Yes.Betrayer is a good game, and stands on its own merits: a strong narrative, striking presentation, and effective use of audio. The dependence on audio cues is rewarding. Dialogue between the player character and non-player characters are accomplished through simple trees, whose options are unlocked when clues are discovered. Roaming the world of Betrayer harkened to Silent Hill, but was animated and alive in a way that allow a player to imagine themselves in the midst of a breathing, sighing forest, tinged and tainted with subtle blood-red cues. When action happens, the player's speakers tend to explode with a rushing, beating heart, and enemies are deadly.The challenging enemies serve to emphasize the theme of the game, and its narrative. There is a lot of text in Betrayer, and it is well-written; the investigations often reveal cruelty or tragedy, and all tie into the eponymous conceit of the game. I'm not sure if spoken dialogue would have improved things, because voice acting on a budget can do more harm than good, and often precludes narratives from achieving the depth text otherwise provides.While well written and compelling, the text of the game can sometimes be confusing. Players have to backtrack and search areas again, which made the later game feel systematic rather than fluid. Stick with it and its rewards will yield themselves.			"

												This game is very strange, maybe that's what I like about it, but what is Betrayer? Betrayer is a game of survival and exploration steeped in mystery and a spark of the paranormal. You wake up on a beach, don't know who you are or what's going on, as you pick up scraps of paper that are scattered throughout the landscape which give you clues as to what happened in this place in your absence and your role in it. You discover locations from the initial coastal shipwreck site by exploring on foot and unlocking landmarks as you happen upon them (and there's a fast travel system so you won't turn into Walking Simulator 2014) which makes up smaller parts of a greater world map. You are discovering the new world after all. It needs to be said that the atmosphere in this game is quite possibly my favorite aspect of it. You're in a constant state of being a little on edge. You might find yourself feeling a little more at ease when you get the mechanics down but there's still this fleeting dread I feel when I'm playing. Especially when you're in the otherworld.The supernatural element is interesting but it hasn't been clearly explained as to why you're able to tap into the spirit world to talk to ghosts/wraiths and collect from them what I would call side quests. The how happens very early in, the why is a mystery to me. If you care about graphics, it's a pretty looking game too. And if you don't like the black and white style, there's a saturation option to add the color back in. Spirit world is always black and white however.The only issue I have is with the intuitiveness of this game. There is a listening mechanic that gives you a clue as to where you need to head but never tells you whether or not it's necessary. The same sound is used for graves, chests, mounds, totems, etc. And it's not always clear as to what needs to be done to proceed. The sound of enemies spotting you is great and kind of shoots a little shock to your system if you're skulking around and suddenly hear the telltale ring followed by a mild panic until the target is in sight. Furthermore, it should be noted that I'm not one who needs to be led by the hand by my games - this is beyond non-linear, it's just a bit confusing at first. Broken down:Pros:+ Very creative+ Great artistic direction+ Control are tight and responsive+ Movement and weapons feel great (Thanks Unreal engine)+ Heavy atmosphere+ Exploration never gets dullCons:- Vague sense of what needs to be done- Listening mechanic, while creative, isn't always helpfulOn the whole: 9/10. Especially if you can get it on sale.			"

												Please note this is an intial review, i havent put any serious hours into this yet and is merely what i have experienced so far.Harking back to the old days of gaming, this game gives you minimal assistance, introducing you to the basic controls it then kicks you off the boat and leaves you to it, no waypoints, no shiny arrows telling you what to do, just go sort your self out. Personally i enjoyed this, completing a quest or stumbling over an important item you get a genuine sense of achievement. The bad guys are quite cool and the ""other world"" you have to run around in is genuinley eerie. I wouldnt say this is an outlast or amnesia type scary but its a great atmosphere and the use of contrast actually adds to the feel of the game.TL;DR:Solid first person adventure game, good for people who want a challenge with lots of exploration and atmosphere, but if you want a run around no brainer you may want to give this a pass.

												Very interesting game indeed. The story isn't exactly detailed as your traverse the beautiful forests but it adds to the mysterious nature of the game. Combat is fun, using bows is always a pleasure for me and sneaking around was simple and effective. Sound was awesome, with eerie tones and listening for whispers was haunting and engaging. Graphics were amazing, lush forests and great color saturation (if you changed the color from black and white to color). Enemies were engaging but overall were not very difficult, although I don't believe they were supposed to be. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who is willing to play something mysterious with engaging first person combat. It's not very long, coming in around 6 and a half hours or so, more if you spend time looking for ever single chest, scrap of paper, etc. Don't expect a lot out of the ending with this one but it adds to the mystery. Definitely wait for it to go on sale, I paid $4 for it and felt I got my money's worth. I would say $5 and under for this one. Have fun!			"

												Really interesting concept, although if you try and multitask like I do (e.g. game on one monitor, Netflix etc. on the other) it can be a bit of a challenge, since a part of the navigation is based off of sound. Sure you can try and use the blocks next to the compass, but it's infinitely easier to use the sound.Overall I like the game a lot. Plan on playing it quite a bit more, and definitely recommend it.

												I've enjoyed Betrayer so far, having played quite a few hours to get a feel for the atmosphere, mechanics and enemies. I recommend it strongly if spotted on sale, and a warm recommendation at regular price especially if you are a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like myself. The game isn't hard to figure out or learn to play, though the introduction scene is short and is not comprehensive. I would have liked to be able to practice more sneaking and using the bow before moving into the game world proper, as this is the majority of the gameplay. Betrayer relies on text in scraps of notes or with NPCs to transmit the details of the world. If reading a sentence of exposition or a super-short paragraph of dialogue isn't your thing, you've been warned. I appreciate being able to piece together ghost stories by finding clues with the 'listen' mechanic. Finding treasure chests and other goodies while stumbling through the wilderness adds to the experience.As I said, sneaking and stealth kills are the majority of the game. How stealthy you are to the enemy is not communicated to the player besides simple simple video game common sense. Crouching and walking are near silent, walking is loud, running is right out. Being in shadows seems to help tremendously, though if you are within line of sight of an enemy looking in your direction you are likely to be found out regardless. Detection distance is irregular. Sometimes I'll be spotted across a flat field with little ground cover, sometimes I can get away with it. This isn't terrible, but it forces the player to be cautious, especially since it is easy to be overwhelmed.All out combat isn't preferable because the player is fragile. A group of enemies is deadly, and it is best to pick them off with stealthy arrow kills. (You deal more damage when the enemy has not detected you yet according to the tutorial.) When hard combat becomes necessary, it is difficult enough to survive that you learn quickly not to charge into any group of foes.Progression is measured in areas you move into, as well as what items are available in the shop (which also become available as you move to new maps). The weapons handle distinctly and feel great. Charms add passive bonuses to actions (musket reload speed, run speed, stealth, etc) and most everything you need can be found or purchased. Broken or shoddy versions of weapons can be found on enemies and sold for currency right in the field from the inventory screen. Ammunition is picked up from enemies or purchased from the shop. The game also allows you to conservatively retrieve arrows and other thrown weapons' ammunition from dead enemies. If you miss, sometimes I've been lucky enough to find the arrow in a tree, bush, or in the ground far behind the intended target. Ammo bought at the shop is cheap, but money is better spent on fancier versions of weapons to start, and this encouraged me to pick shots carefully.The intial black and white visuals are what I heard and saw first about Betrayer. While it was a nice introduction to the game and set the tone appropriately, I eventually turned up the color to saturate the natural environment. This also grew tiresome because the bright red of clues and enemies was easily lost in the woody greens and fields. I opted for a medium saturation, and the game ends up looking washed out enough to know that there was color, but still allowing the red signals to catch the eye and keep the bleak, lonely feeling of the game world. This setting becomes moot in the shadow version of the world, where everything becomes black and white anyway, so I don't feel like it changes too much of the experience.Sound, particularly listening to the environment, is extremely important in Betrayer. The primary 'listening' mechanic allows you to locate plot clues in the area by briefly adding markers to your compass HUD. The marks change width and brightness when your heading to the item is true, then fade out until you 'listen' again. It's an old idea, but I like the system because it is not as precise as a simple waypoint on your map and allows accidental exploration. Simply listening to ambient noise is incredibly helpful because item caches and enemies will make sounds at a distance as well. This gives the player the opportunity to explore, avoid, or maneuver around these opportunities. I appreciate that different enemies will make different noises. For example, I did not figure out until the umpteenth ambush that Naturals have a birdcall idling sound; I previously thought it was an ambient bird sound from the forest. Again, this is an old idea, but it fits well with the gameplay and setting, and is executed very well.Mystery, suspense, horror, paranormal activity, and good old-fashioned, New World mysticism are all wrapped into one tight package. Hours of fun were had combing the woods, listening tensely, and hunting Spaniards. I'd give it a solid 9.2/10, an A-, a 4.7 out of 5. Play it, especially if it goes on sale again.			"

												Yea, I can't recommend this game.Everyone else is right, the graphics, setting, progression and combat, those are all spot on. The detective feel at first is excellent, and the mysterious anxiety provoking music and sound are spot on. HOWEVER, this game is first and foremost a story driven game. Everything else takes a back seat. Mainly because combat is repetitive and uncommon, there's only a handful of things to do and collect, and the exploration is tied to the story. SO all that considered, we can't say this game is focused on any of those things. So it has to be the story? RIGHT?Well here's my issue, the story is really just your character getting washed ashore and making your way to the first settlement. After this point, the game is solely focused on collecting evidence and investigating murders, but none of them have anything to do with the end result, and they don't have any affect on the game. The things you're doing amount to zero. You read all the dialogue, talk to everyone you need to, and for what? I feel like there's no reason, until the end. I'm not going to ruin the end, but did anyone else have an issue with that? WHAT THE HELL!??? Really? All that and no explanation of what the heck just happened? I'm all for suspense in endings but having nothing to do with the story at all, and not adding to the story is just a bad call. This game is good except for the story, but sadly the story is what this game is all about. If they had just taken a few seconds to read the story they were making, they'd definitely be like, ""yea we have to change some stuff around, it makes no sense!""It's not a horrible game, but at under 7 hours to complete and 6 of those hours are you running back and forth between maps, I just can't recommend it.I do recommend it if it's on sale, or if you are looking for a really unique take on investigative gaming, especially if you're into this time period.

												The amount of time taken to put the detail this game has is amazing,the fact that the is just black and white with the odd red colour making an presence makes the game look attractive. the detail with every bit of grass to the leaves of the tree is well made but to make it all look better is when from time to time wind picks up and every thing starts to move like trees and grass in teh real world, if you like a game with investigation and action this is your game, only two things wrong in my eyes; To find the next item etc you have to hear for the voices to guide you there which some times is hard to pin point and the other one is it states horror but the enemys make their presences known before attacking so you have enough time to get yourself ready. overall i do recomend this game it is alot of fun   85/100			"

I played like a thief, sneaky and all, and it was a bit impossible near the end as I was spotted before even having a glimpse of an ennemy, but the experience was still worth my money.

												I have not completed the game at this moment, but I'm about 3/4s of the way through and have a pretty good opinion of it at this point. The game is good, not great, not bad. Pros:Interesting concept and settingGood lookingScary at times (Ghost World Place Thing)Weapons well reflect Time PeriodStory is interestingOnce breaking learning curve, game becomes fun and challengingAlways a sense of mysteryEnemies are challenging and can be fun if one the right difficultyHistoric (Not sure how accurate to time period, but it feels historic in a good way)Cons:GIANT LEARNING CURVE. Took me at least an hour until I made any signifigant progress because of this.No voice acting, wish there was something. Game needed more sounds (There is NO MUSIC)Enemies sometimes act weird, easily spot youEnemies are hard to killWeapons hard to useEasy to get lostGame lags time to timeObjective based (Go here, Then go here)Overall, the game is worth it if you are a big historical geek, looking for something different, or it has a good sale. Not worth the full price, but I only paid around a dollar since I got this in a bundle. Worth a play though, game has some strong points most other games lack.7/10- Burning Man Approved "

												This is a very strange game to recommend. It looks like it should be terrible (clunky gameplay, amateurish presentation, no voice acting, wonky story pacing, 2005-era map inventory, map, and upgrades) but something about it is strangely compelling. After half an hour of playing it, I realised that all these flaws and poor design choices became endearing, and oddly complemented the better elements of the game: the beautifully eerie graphics, the foreboding yet atmospheric sound design, and the apt sense of loneliness and trepidation created throughout. It's an oddly appropriate way to tell the story it is trying to tell, and I actually don't think it would have worked as well had it been more slick and professional. It is far from perfect, and I can see how some people would hate it, but it's one of the more memorable gaming experiences I've had in years.			"

												Seriously amazing! The first thing I saw in options was you can choose to drop loot (just gold) on death. It made me say ""Dark Souls Option!"" so of course I am hunting with Deadlier Enimies and Loot Drop. It is a great storyline and I love how they have music, sounds, and effects yet no dialog for characters themselves - saved them a ton on disk space and left room for more content and story. There is one thing I didn't notice right away that made me go - ohhhh I see what you did here! There is no Load Feature and it is auto save on quit too so you are in this til the end. I do love their Return To Last Position feature, that is really nice!I cecommend this game to anyone who loves a simple shooter yet old school. There is no real RPG factor that I can see yet. The controls are decent and the Reload Style of shooting is pretty unique. Enemies are smart, they do not follow straight line to you so not always easy straigh aim like some others out there. I actually shot my bow at one and he actually dodged to the right of it - impressed.Just get this game, it is 100% worth your time !			"

												Betrayer is a fundamentally basic game with a great atmosphere and simple yet intriguing story.  Over the course of 8 hours or so you'll spend a lot of time hitting X in order to listen for audio cues that will direct you to the next point of interest.  Once you know the general direction, you'll dart through the forest to find a clue or ghost that will move the story forward.  Along the way there are fights with skeletons or demon Spaniards that spice things up a little bit.  On paper the game may sound pretty lame; but the atmosphere and story really hold everything together to make it a memorable experience.			"

												Simply put, Betrayer is stunningly beautiful and hauntingly mysterious! It's use of black and white, emphasizing the color red, gives it a unique look not seen too often in games and when paired with the frequent breezes, swaying vegetation and nature sounds truly make the experience surreal.  The selection of weapons in pretty impressive for a budget game and there are even charms you can find, that when equipped, will enhance your movement speed, HP and other attributes.  Both the charms and weapons (muskets, rifles, crossbows, short/longbows, etc.; it takes place in colonial times) have varying degrees of strength depending on the type, such as crude, quality and exceptional. There is a light and dark world you must trek through in order to solve the mystery of what's going on in the game and in particular, with the Maiden in Red.  There are collectibles such as chests and letter scraps  and gifts to find and also clues that will allow you to solve other, lesser mysteries involving ghosts you encounter along the way.  There are also a decent number of enemy types, such as skeletons, spider=like crustacean things (yeah, no idea what these things are but they're cool), undead Spaniards, phantoms (skull/deer=headed ghosts....don't ask about the deer heads, freaked me out first time i saw them, thinking it was the Wendigo or something coming after me...) and burning, undead Native American warriors. You can even unlock destinations and quick travel between them, as well as upgrade how many times you can heal. You even have tomahawks and explosives to throw, and like arrows, the tomahawks can be retrieved from fallen enemies which is very nice.Keep in mind this is a budget game, so the amount of content the developers put into Betrayer for only $20 is truly impressive.  I know this was certainly one gaming experience I won't soon forget. I highly recommend buying this game, even if it's not on sale.  Enjoy!!			"

												I'll start by saying that I really enjoyed this game. The visual style is immediately striking and equally effective in both realms of reality. Same goes for sound design; I was blown away by how effectively such a modest soundtrack could convey a wide open world with mysterious undertones just as well as an oppressive darkness that looms down from the trees unlike any presence I've felt in a game before. The commitment to minimalism really helps establish player immersion for the purposes of exploration and narrative exposition, which is refreshing to see. The colonial New World setting really lends itself to this minimalism, and in turn proves to be a perfect setting for a vast supernatural mystery to take place. I found myself driven to find clues and spirits to advance my understanding of the situation, but the game never told me to do that. It was an implicit curiosity that the abandoned settlements and their ghostly inhabitants sparked in me, and the story resonated far more strongly because of it. In terms of gameplay, this is pretty standard crouch-run-shoot FPS fare, but with weapons that don't feel overpowered or out of place. Combat is generally fair and challenging enough, if not a little repetitive.Unfortunately, it's not a perfect experience. My main problem was technical; the game would crash on startup about half of the time, and that issue was terribly frustrating when it arose. In-game, the textures and animations all work very well, but the HUD and various UI components have a sort of cobbled together feel to them that could have contributed more to the experience had they been somewhat more polished. It would also be nice to see some voice acting implemented, but the text worked well enough. I would lastly suggest slightly more fleshing out of the regions and variation of quests within them. I'm not totally sure how much addition is advisable though, as I truly think the minimalism is a tremendous strong point of the game. Still, I hope the potential for deeper and more varied side activities is implemented at some point should a sequel ever come about.I'm afraid that if I say more, I'll start giving away story points or just keep repeating myself, so just get it already. If you like first person exploration, mystery, and horror that feels truly eerie rather than cheap and jumpy, you will absolutely come to love the game as I have. It sits at a solid 8/10 for me.			"

This game is an honorable exception, not only it succeeds in submerging the player in a grim and mysterious, atmosphere, but also the gameplay is entertaining and somewhat challenging relative to modern day FPS. Also noteworthy is the need to use all of your arsenal and weapons in dealing with different kinds of enemies, and the low ammo availability. This game is in all aspects a worthy successor of the old-school survival horror FPS, genere. Definitely worth every single cent.			"

For some reason I feel in love with the wind in this game.  I don’t think I’ve played a game with such realistic sounding wind.  I go hiking all the time and I swear if I closed my eyes while playing the game I would think I’m out in the woods, and the fact they tied that into the combat mechanics was very insightful.  Combat was fun and edgy for this type and size of game and was enjoyable esp. the period weapons.  Storyline was epic, I did feel kind of confused by the ending and felt maybe it was rushed or changed at the last second but other than that good job guys!!!!			"

												Very interesting game indeed. The story isn't exactly detailed as your traverse the beautiful forests but it adds to the mysterious nature of the game. Combat is fun, using bows is always a pleasure for me and sneaking around was simple and effective. Sound was awesome, with eerie tones and listening for whispers was haunting and engaging. Graphics were amazing, lush forests and great color saturation (if you changed the color from black and white to color). Enemies were engaging but overall were not very difficult, although I don't believe they were supposed to be. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who is willing to play something mysterious with engaging first person combat. It's not very long, coming in around 6 and a half hours or so, more if you spend time looking for ever single chest, scrap of paper, etc. Don't expect a lot out of the ending with this one but it adds to the mystery. Definitely wait for it to go on sale, I paid $4 for it and felt I got my money's worth. I would say $5 and under for this one. Have fun!			"

												Absolutely incrediable game highly recommend this game.1. Great story that keeps you wanting more info on what happened to the residence of the territory2. Great game for people who like emersion games and not being spoon feedWARNING: If you like games like Skyrim with markers and clear trails of where to go to complete quest than avoid this game, cause this game is like the Divinity series where it will not tell you where to go to the least, it is up to you to pay attention to the dialogue of characters to figure out what to do. Personally i love games that make you feel like you are actually in the world you are playing in and have to figure things out, so if you are like me and love emersion games than pick up this gold mine, but if you want a game that tells you and shows you exactly what to do then avoid this game cause you will have a very hard time with it.Props to developers hope I see more great work from you guys soon, wish i would of bought it for 20 bucks to support you guys more			"

												Even though I haven't beaten the game or even come close to, this game isn't about story, more of roaming around and just exploring the world of Betrayer.  (Sorry if this review is a mess, tired, and not in the best mood)Betrayer starts off on a beach and far off in the ocean is a wrecked ship. You came from that boat. The time is the 17th century and you are pretty much abandoned on this island or whatever. You are a misterious character with no name but, we shall call the character Betrayer.In Betrayer, you can help dead and confused spirits by going into the towns of each area and ringing a bell which takes you from the light zone (Life) to the dark zone (Dead), where you meet people called Wraiths. They are lost and confused spirits that don't know how they died, what happened to loved ones etc. You find clues that may hint at where to go or that might trigger the Wraiths to remember what happened. Of hand, you can explore and sometimes help spirits in the light world. But, in each world there are people or monsters that attack you. For example, in the dark world, skeletons attack you and in the light world, conquistadors attack you. Knowing that, you might be able to find out where you actually are.The games graphics are amazing, even though the game uses a black and white color scheme, with some red to highlight important objects, enemies, NPC etc. I'm not a fan of black and white, since I can fall asleep during black and white movies but, I enjoy this color scheme, it works well with this game. The atmosphere of this game is really nice, that abandoned feel of empty and eerieness walking around alone just seeing emptyness.My only complaint about this game would be the map. The map has a lot of stuff on it but, you can get lost so easy and the only way back in the map's fast travel so that won't even be that bad of a take off of the score.So all and all, this is a great game, everything about it is great, I haven't beaten the game yet, but people predict (that have beaten it) it's around 8-9 hours. For 20 bucks, that's not bad. So go get this game, its a pretty nice game. I'm so happy I got it, I've been eyeing this game since its early access period (PS Thanks LightestEnd for getting it for me)			"

												Pros: -Betrayer has an awesome atmopshere, utilizing sound in a way that is very little used in games lately.   -The black, white and red contrast is something that really brings potency to the gameplay, being a bit of a hunt and find themed game.   -Fear wise, the sound is very crucial part of the ambience and game progression.  Getting that, 'oh sh*t was that the cat?!' response out of you many times more than visual stimulation.  -To date, no encountered bugs.  (Maybe I was lucky.)  - Interesting and decently developed story.Cons:  -Repetitive.  So very very repetitive.  -Only one ending that I know of?  -An unfortunate rely on revisiting older sections of the map, which becomes very tedious.About 15 hrs of gameplay without going for achievements.

												Betrayer is an incredibly atmospheric 1st person 'shooter' with a very interesting black and white and red look. Not as creepy as it is brooding, you are asked to rely on your intuition as you explore the landscape. I have yet to complete the game, but for those looking for a different vibe, yet still playing a game with a familiar combat style, I'd definitely recommend this one!			"

												Betrayer has proven to be a game worth picking up.  It's biggest selling point is it's beautiful graphical style, which really set the tone of the game.It's story started out very strong, told through a series of non-voiced text boxes which really was a positive aspect as it stayed in line with the overall theme of the game and didn't ruin the immersion.  Without ruining the plot, the theme is that you arrive on land after a ship wreck.  You meet a girl, and shortly thereafter you are unraveling the secrets of what happened to the inhabitants of the island.  The story is overall told very well, however one of the big downsides is the last reveal.  It's meant to be vague, but also was thrown together almost as if it were an afterthought.  Despite this, the rest of the game and plot is worth getting through.  In terms of gameplay, one of my biggest gripes was in this department.  Some things were done fantastically, such as using environment to plan attacks, planning type of weapons for different enemies, and the fluidity between melee and ranged weapon use.   There was so much lost potential for what could have increased the immersion.  For example, all of the items can be found by using the map that you already have at the beginning of the game.  Most of the ""quests"" as you progress through the game require no thought - just simply find an item, bring it to a person, choose the only option to make you progress.  It reminded me a lot of Far Cry 3, which also for me lost it's appeal due to this idea of ""run here, kill this, make waypoint, hand in item"".  My suggestion to make this better?  If a sequel to Betrayer is made, I'd like to see something implemented such as in Condemned: Criminal Origins.  When you have to solve a mystery, you need to really engage the environment, piece together the clues, and figure out what happened.  Give the player choices with consequences, and allow it to have an effect on the plot.  Adding this aspect not only will help the player feel more like part of the story, but we can use our brains to take a break from the repetition.  It may also change the fate of certain characters and the overall ending if done right.With all that said, I really hope the developers plan a sequel.  This game has a lot of potential, and the next plot can really be fleshed out on the next go with good script writing.  Cheers to Blackpowder for a very successful game.			"

Can't wait for the sequel!Interesting but shallow combat with a story that doesn't live up to the promise of it's setting and premise.GameplayEnemies usually go down with one or two hits but can kill you without many shots themselves, and you can't dodge or take cover very effectively either. In combat I mostly found myself kiting enemies, sprinting away as I reloaded before spinning around and firing off my one shot. Stealth is pretty binary, enemies are nearly blind but all instantly know where you are if you miss a shot with your stealthy bow. More polish and depth is needed to make it more than a novelty.Story You never find out anything about what's going on or why it's happening until the last second, and even then it's never shown how any of this stuff happened. Nor does it explained why half of it happened in the first place. Why Spanish people turn into angry zombies but British people get turned to ash?I had to search through the forums to find out how to advance from area to area because how you did so was never brought up or even connected to any of the plot.

												I wouldn't pay full price for this (it doesn't feel like a $20 game), but on sale it is worth every penny. It's really just a chain of fetch quests, exploration and somewhat mediocre combat, but somehow, some way, it works. The design aesthetic is really cool, what with the lack of color (which you can actually tailor the colors to what you want, but the black, white and red really adds to the game). THe sounds (and lackthereof) really add to the sense of isolation and desolation. And man, this game manages to be pretty creepy. Over all the game does a good job of trying something different, and for the most part it works.Thus far I am enjoying this game. Like I said, it feels a bit too bare-bones for $20, but $10 or less works for it (and right now it is $3.99).			"

												This is a really fascinating and atmospheric experience hampered by remarkably bad gameplay.   Sure, having the baddies have incredibly long lines of sight and unerring aim might be realistic but it's certainly not fun to play against.  Putting them in groups and having them all wear helmets right after the first tutorial message about headshots is just ludicrously bad game design.  The pacing of the gameplay is just terrible.   The mystery/atmosphere/visuals are really cool.   I'd like to see what happens if these guys ever decide to make a video-game.			"

												   One of the few games where I willingly dig up and pocket a tongue, an ear, and an eye.   An intense feeling of dread as you fear you may miss and have to search for your arrow. This is where the horror lies.   This man is so honor-bound that he won't steal anything at all from the merchant's little pile of incredibly useful and necessary hunting materials. Instead he runs around killing ghosts and they drop gold so he can run back to buy things from a man that is nowhere in sight.   In this game, water has been replaced by liquid band-aid.   10/10 Would rob a skeleton again.			"

												It's hard to make something of this game. It'c climatic, the story is interesting, the ending quite nice. It's cheap, I've got it for 1 euro during a sale.But it's unfinished. It lacks voice-acting, which would be a nice addition. Combat is rather minimalistic and repetitive. The trade at the posts rather silly and unnecessary. It's basically a connect-the-dots game where instead of drawing a line between them, you run between set points until you've been everywhere. You don't have to use your brain at all, you don't need to read the story at all. Over all the game isn't very engaging.All the combat and running could be taken out as it's mostly a waste of time. But the game itself is interesting in a way. It's main problem is probably a low budget and the fact it's intended to be so small.			"

Not gonna lie, this game makes you think about your plan of attack. You're working with 17th centruary technology, meaning your musket isn't a freaking AK-47. One shot, long reload time, fighting against angry spirits that will drop you all over the floor like your mothers fine china. Your are out gunned, out numbered, out classed, and still trying to be a detective in your own right. Just remember, the wind is your friend, the wind is your only friend.

												Yea, I can't recommend this game.Everyone else is right, the graphics, setting, progression and combat, those are all spot on. The detective feel at first is excellent, and the mysterious anxiety provoking music and sound are spot on. HOWEVER, this game is first and foremost a story driven game. Everything else takes a back seat. Mainly because combat is repetitive and uncommon, there's only a handful of things to do and collect, and the exploration is tied to the story. SO all that considered, we can't say this game is focused on any of those things. So it has to be the story? RIGHT?Well here's my issue, the story is really just your character getting washed ashore and making your way to the first settlement. After this point, the game is solely focused on collecting evidence and investigating murders, but none of them have anything to do with the end result, and they don't have any affect on the game. The things you're doing amount to zero. You read all the dialogue, talk to everyone you need to, and for what? I feel like there's no reason, until the end. I'm not going to ruin the end, but did anyone else have an issue with that? WHAT THE HELL!??? Really? All that and no explanation of what the heck just happened? I'm all for suspense in endings but having nothing to do with the story at all, and not adding to the story is just a bad call. This game is good except for the story, but sadly the story is what this game is all about. If they had just taken a few seconds to read the story they were making, they'd definitely be like, ""yea we have to change some stuff around, it makes no sense!""It's not a horrible game, but at under 7 hours to complete and 6 of those hours are you running back and forth between maps, I just can't recommend it.I do recommend it if it's on sale, or if you are looking for a really unique take on investigative gaming, especially if you're into this time period.

												Try out the demo first. I know I should have.  The game looks nice. The trailers pretty realistic about what you can expect visually, but not gameplay wise. The stealth mechanics are really lacking, or almost non existing. Enemies see you through grass, so if you're coming up over a hill then they will have seen you before you knew they were there. The wind-blowing mechanic is cool, but you wont use it nearly as much as the game will have you think. Encounters with enemies are mostly just ""what order do i have to kill things to save on HP. They don't see you if you go behind them, but wether you are able to chance upon them from behind is seemingly random, as the blurry camera makes enemies even capable of seeing you before you see them in a straight line.The AI is dumb as bread. Enemies either A) run straight at you. B) shoot at you. C) in the case of the natives, just move around a bit to ""seem"" like they're doing dodging things. The only time i was impressed by the AI was when a monster walked up to another monster he had seen get killed. Other than that, you'd almost wonder if there was any thought into the AI at all.The quests are OK if you like storie telling. Everything is text. Everything consists of fetch/delivery quests and dialog with NPCs. you press the ""listen"" button to get a noise indication of where you have to go next. You would think that with all the stories and footnotes the game stores in your journal, it would expect you to take on the challenge of thinking about where to go next, but no. You can beat the game by just spamming through dialog all meanwhile doing dull-as-water fetch-quests where you have to battle the♥♥♥♥♥♥poor AI that pops up every now and then along the way.. though once you've unlocked all the quick-travel locations in an ""area"" then you're just going to try to do as little walking as possible.I got to the third and last area, and realized they want me to backtrack through the game for the rest of the story. That's when I quit playing.			"

The horror elements get grading after a while, the action elements (shooting with bows ect) are ok, but nothing extraordinary and the rpg elements are nothing short of a string of ""go get X to talk to Y "" . but when it all comes together it makes for an alright experience. In short sessions , the game is pretty good and at times legitamatly scary and fairly hard. If you can get this odd-gem on sale (lower than 10 dollars) I recomend to buy it and try it out , you might find a good experience.			"

												Betrayer is an excellent game with some very clever ideas. You start on a beach with no knowledge of what you need to do. As you travel through the land you discover things that start to fill in the larger picture. The story line is good and it keeps you going, looking to find out just a bit more.You can play this game in greyscale or if you change the default setting you can choose to play in colour. Some parts can only be played in greyscale but however you choose to play it's good. The combat is nicely done. You won't need reflexes of a God or knowledge of any fancy blocking or offensive moves to survive. Having said that it isn't a walk in the park either. You'll need to get weapons and choose your tactics.You will die but death isn't a major factor unless you choose the option to leave your belongings at the scene of your death. This means you have to go and recover them before you die again or lose them permanently. Death normally just means you're resurrected and the enemy has respawned, possibly at different locations and you have to try again.There were bits I thought could be done differently but overall a very enjoyable experience. It's nice to see someone trying something different in game development. Well done. Recommended.			"

												At first I was really impressed with this game. The atmosphere, the development of the plot.. etc. But after just a little over 3 hours of gameplay I found that I couldn't finish it. As another reviewer had commented, it was way too isolated and became boring pretty quickly.When I had first started playing the game, (I played for about thirty minutes and then got busy with school), I was recommending it to all of my friends. After getting some time on my hands and having a chance to continue playing it, I could only do it for another 2 hours or so before I realized I had made a mistake on my recommendation.It does feel unique in comparison to any other game I've played and that's worth something, and I've played games where you're very isolated before (Myst, Traitor's Gate, pretty much any point-and-click adventure game), but this didn't have enough story to fill in the isolation like point-and-clicks do and so yeah, I couldn't get through it.

												Starts strong but doesn't really manage to deliver.In the beginning you will ooh at the environment, get lost in the soundscape and explore the stark and spooky environment collecting clues, piecing together what's going on and getting attacked by evil ...things. It really is quite brilliant. However once you've wandered through the tutorial and first area and you reach the second area you'll pick up the pattern - i.e. how the levels work - and there really is no variety from there on in. You do the same things you did in the first area in a slightly differently landscaped environment. It's not until (I think) the 6th environment that you get the shovel necessary to dig up rocky blobs that have been scattered across all the previous levels (and these are not helpfully marked on your map, nor do you have any way to make any marks on your map yourself) meaning you are left to painstakingly search your way through areas you've already been encouraged to ...painstakingly search your way through... again.It starts out with a huge amount of promise - a really awesome environment, some great mechanics and the prospect of a pieced together story. However the gameplay really isn't expanded on past the first area and the story, rather sadly, ends very weakly. Your character's presence is never explained - you don't fit into any of the narratives really and the seemingly organic discovery of other characters stories is quickly rendered into a ""go here, click this, go back, click that"" as they are actually surpisingly linear and you simply can't discover the details out of order.Oh and one of the achievements completed for me in game but not on steam. It's totally worth a look at, especially if you can pick it up in a sale or a bundle because the first couple of hours you spend exploring will be truly spooky and quite awesome. Definitely will be keeping my eye on further offerings from this company and I may well return to this just to amble around in such a nicely crafted world.			"

												Betrayer takes me back to a time in my gaming career when games made very little sense to me and even though things were linear I still felt like I had control over the situation. This game is also one of the few to creep me out simply because of its color scheme, its black and white tones will give you the chills for sure. If the creepy colors aren't your style that's perfectly ok as well because if you're like myself then you may find that this game can cause a bit of a headache and the developer has place a nice option to change the colors to normal ones. This, in my opinion, does not take away from the experice and therefor should not be a reason for not purchasing the game. I hope this review helps, good luck out there colonists!			"

												I initially jumped into this game not knowing what to expect other than the beautiful and realistic environments I had seen briefly in various gameplay videos. The overall mood portrayed by the lighting and environment is perfectly suited for the style of gameplay.With that being said, do not expect this game to simply guide you through the campaign by automatically setting up new missions after arriving at checkpoints. It doesn't work that way. You're expected to figure everything out with little to no guidance whatsoever. To me, this very aspect is the genius of the game. Taking place during a time period devoid of any type of helping-hand technology, I feel that the developers were able to accurately capture that sense of vulnerability and uneasiness that should be expected from a game of this nature.Overall, for an indie game I'd rate it 4.5/5. It's a perfectly good game that I'll be following for quite a while in hopes of new additions being added over time.			"

												Very Atmospheric Game!As for some of you who don't know, there are not a lot of games that take place in the early 17th century that center around the colonization of the Americas, where this game takes place in.  It's one of those time periods (in my opinion) that don't cater much to certain people primarily, but this game stands out.The atmosphere is what makes this game, with an open world similar to Skyrim in a smaller scale.  The options of changing color is nice and the whole concept is there.  It gives you a lonely feeling where you only interact with the girl in red and the spirits while enemies are out to hunt you.The only 2 minor problems I have is the fact that you can only have 3 weapons at a time when there are only 5 in total.  I use the Musket, Pistol, and Longbow primary and not the shortbow and crossbow at all.  I would consider setting the 4 and 5 key as a 4th and 5th weapon slot so that we wouldn't have to set the weapons from the inventory slot.The other problem is the lack of enemies in the game.  Sure, the nature and huge world are nice, but I feel that some more action would be nice. I find that the Spanish Conquistadors and the Statues are the most fun to take out but there's not enough of them.Other than that, Great game and will recommend to people looking for a new themed first person shooter/adventure! 9.5/10			"

												The graphics are simply amazing, the greyscale style looks great, and if you don't want it in greyscale the saturation can be changed in options. The story is mostly told through the stories of ghosts, what the maiden in red tells you, and notes that you find. The game is open world, and while the world is split into maps, they're large maps with varied terrain, and there are treasure chests and buried treasure that gives a reason to explore, if the great scenery isn't enough. There's also fast travel.There are armored soldiers and stealthy natives patrolling the area, and stealth is a viable option if you don't want to run in guns blazing. The weapons are well designed and animated, with 2 flintlock guns, 2 bows, a crossbow, a tomahawk, and grenades, a nice break from the usual ""pistol, SMG, rifle, etc."". The guns, bows, and crossbows can be bought in different qualities, and there are unique weapons with even better stats hidden around the maps too.On each map there is a bell that moves you to a very atmospheric alternate dimension where you can talk to ghosts and try to solve some of the area's mysteries while fighting skeletons. There is a unique ""listen"" feature that helps you find clues, ghosts, and statues by making a sound near their location, which prevents the frustration of not being able to find the next clue.Overall, definately worth buying.

												When I bought Betrayer I had no idea what to expect. All I'd seen of the game was screenshots from the steam page showing black and white visuals with a bit of crimson thrown in, and the occasional spooky skeleton. All I could think about was ""dis gon be gud"".Betrayer is an action/adventure RPG game by the indie developer Blackpowder Games, and was released on March 24 of this year and it's reception upon release was pretty good but not enough to make it to the big leagues.When I first played the game I was immediately fully Immersed in the monochrome tropical world in which i'd been thrown. The black and white visuals did not only enhance the experience but did in fact make up most of it, and the atmosphere and ambiance owe most of it's glory to that decision and the crimson colours on some of the objects within the game create a beautiful visual experience that gets you completely invested in the game.The game play is decent but it lacks a little bit of flare to make it stand out in any way, but the simplicity of the controls make it easier to get lost in the visuals as well as the narrative, which is outstanding and has a lot to offer.All in all I recommend the game for everyone.""Go get it"" out of 10			"

												By far one of the most original concepts in gaming that I have seen in a long time. After watching vids, reading a few short reviews and ""first impressions"", I was sure that I had a full understanding of what this game was like, what it was trying to achieve, and, most importantly, what type of titles it leaned on to give it its general feel. Very soon into the game I realized that everything I thought I knew about the game was wrong. There is really nothing like it. It doesnt appear to have ""leaned"" on or borrowed any ideas from other games. Game play is simple and solid. Nothing weird. Nothing that takes a special touch or extra time to master. So many games try to go crazy with making unique gameplay that they screw-up the basics. This doesnt do that at all. They dont need to. The originality is in the way the world unfolds in front of you and not in the form and function of core gameplay. So everything works just fine and anyone can start this game and start playing immediately. This is one of those small publisher games that everyone should play. Its also a small publisher game that large publishers will likely borrow ideas from.The color scheme is really pretty genius. I thought I would bring it up to full, regular color early on. But I didnt. I put just a touch of color saturation into the world and it seems that that graphics engine really looks cool that way. But again, its all preference and I cant believe that no other games had this option before.Betrayer also fills a market gap on time period of the game setting. We have futuristic, modern(early 20th-21st century), medieval, and even ancient FPS games. But the 17th century is a relatively underutlized time period. I think the reason is that the time period itself is just not as popular as the latter I listed. But it does make for an interesting environment. Many games have a bow. But few games take place in the time period where the bow is a relatively strong option when compared to other weapons available to you.It just seems that the devs and the publisher ticks all the right boxes when it comers to making a truly unique game. I have been watching this title for some time and I am glad that I finally pulled the trigger today and purchased it. But there is nothing to compare it to. So I cant say ""If you like [insert game title here] then you will love this!"", but I do highly recommend this game.The only downside so far is that the enemies dont seem very challenging. With that being said, the stealth mechanics work just fine but because the enemies are easy, there is no real reason to be stealthy. That may change as I am only an hour or so in the game and I have now seen a new type of enemy. Will update if it becomes more challenging.			"

												The monochome setting with touches of red to highlight relevant things like items and enemies was very nice. The sound effects of the wind blowing were lovely. The cryptic nature of the goings on seemed like it might have a potentially interesting story if they keep moving forward with it.  A flintlock pistol is neat since you have that ""panic"" moment after every shot where the enemy didn't die. However, the game seems to heavily want you to use stealth, and enemies can spot you where enemies in other games really wouldn't, and from so far away. Once an enemy has seen you and it gets close, it's almost impossible for that enemy to miss or for you to get any distance again. The combat difficulty ramps up too quickly for me to really enjoy this title. This definitely isn't a bane on Steam's existence, by any means, but I wouldn't recommend buying this game.			"

												This is a great and unique game. It does an excellent job of using sound both as a gaming device and for atmosphere/intensity. At its core it's a game of Marco Polo where you hit the ""Listen"" key and listen to the responses; taking note of both the direction and the intensity of the sound to find out direction+distance; this is far more satisfying than the typical RPG that just shows an exact location on the map or a magical compass point. Throw in creative use of color contrast for the ""ghost"" and ""regular"" worlds, with harrowing investigations and you have a winner.My only compaint is it can be a bit repetitive at times. Having to cover both worlds on every map gets a bit much, especially later in the game when you have to do back tracking. All-in-all though the mystery keeps you hooked until the very end.			"

												For an indie survival game, it is not bad at all. The game has a good atmosphere and enough mystery to make you want to play it, however it is not really my kind of game hense why I haven't played it a lot. The combat mechanics are alright but don't expect them to be Skyrim's level. Also do not expect a masterpiece or the scariest game you will ever play and expect a few moments where you will be unsure what you are supposed to do. However if you ever see the game on sale or part of a bundle, be sure to check this out. + Good atmosphere+ Stylish aesthetic+ Decent performance- Confusing at times what to do next- Combat could be betterP.S. Jim Sterling likes the game and I think we all know how harsh he can be with games!			"

												Betrayer tries to work more with audio then most games and to it's credit pulls it off nicely. I would seriously recommend using a decent headset while playing this game. Most of the times when a game tries black and white(and red I guess) gameplay it can become difficult to differentiate objects, especially when off in the distance though I never had an instance where I had any issues. The game also has some decently implemented mechanics, like the wind rusteling through tall grass and tree's to drown the sound of your footsteps out makes for a great effect.Sadly enough I feel asif Betrayer has far too few mechanics to keep it intresting. There's not a big variety in enemies or weapons to use. But my biggest complaint of the game is the dark world.Basicly, the game has 2 'worlds' ; the light and the dark world. The light world would be considered the 'normal' world,  You feel asif you are in a real forest as the light world is richly detailed with plantlife, small settlements, filled with audio effects,.. Basicly you feel asif you are walking through a real forest. The dark world, is basicly the exact same as the light world, without the many audio effects, a much smaller view distance, a darker light filter and different enemies; though in theory, those 'different enemies ' are just reskins. the standard light world enemies use bows/muskets while the standard dark world enemy shoots bones. You'll deal with them in the same manner so they are pretty much the same.I also feel that the many mysteries involving the deaths of the people on the island could be a bit better worked out, you can never seem to speculate what happened untill the puzzle is solved through the various NPC's you'll encounter, you pretty much run from one place to another gathering evidence, showing it to NPC's and they'll tell you the story.All in all, I liked Betrayer; asmuch as I disliked having to go to the dark world because it felt like padding out the game just to reach a justifyable play time, the light world does carry it as it's simply a beautiful environment			"

												The game has two things going for it. The black and white visuals, and at time the combat is amazingly fun. But this product feels so unfinished. With so many problems like terrible visibility. Especially the games signature black and white visuals. Unfortunately i had to switch the game to color just to see the enemies. The game has very limited check points. The story runs out of steam after the first map and seems like it is forgotten about. The mysteries are so boring, and all the same. Every mystery in the game is hitting the bell, listen skill, talk to ghost, and/or kill enemies aroung him first. Another Con to the game is very limited enemy types. there are 3 types of enemies in the light, and i believe 3 in the dark.Everything about the listen skill is absolutly infuriating(From the lack of a Tutorial to a skill needed to complete the game. The fact is its utter♥♥♥♥♥♥to use and has you spinning in circles just to figure out where to go, the fact you need head phones for locating the targets when you get close,and that speakers without surround sound are detrimental to play with, and all without a warning from the game to use headphones. The biggest complaint is that you cant choose what you target, and with multiple mission targets at once you will be sent all over the map at random. it will sent you to The north west corner of the map, and then send you to the south east corner to find out there was another target in northwest corner so you will have to spend all that time running back, and in each map there is a bell the must be found and rung, so you have to complete each map with the bell ringing and not ringing. So a ungodly amount of time is back tracking. Like over 65% is ♥♥♥♥ing back tracking.)Dont be fooled by the intriguing visuals, this is a game far better for looking at then actually playing. "

												just as i thought! never trust an indie game maker. they always write lousy code, they don't have the funds or funbase to test their games in various systems, and they are never around when you need support...betrayer betrayed me just on the 2nd map. it keeps crashing as soon as i step into some place called fort henry...so i'm betraying betrayer and deleting it from my hdd never to see it again...--So this was my first review about Betrayer. I tried to play it at my ex-laptop, and since I've upgraded to a new one, I said what the hell, why not give this another chance?It's good that I did. What I saw simply became one of my best experiences in horror gaming.Actually it is pretty simple: Search, fight, repeat in an Open World-ish map in 18th century new England. Nice touches of RPG genre, stealth, good weapon dynamics and good opponent AI etc etc...The catch is; it is all in a monochrome horror atmosphere! Which is good and matches the overall mood of the game.Tho the game does not bring much new stuff to the genre, I especially liked the stealth running in gusts, the eerie other world, the usage of sounds and noises, and the stealthy indians which can be spotted by the bird noise they make.In the end it is a decent game and I am converting my recommendation from No to Yes...

Atmosphere is good and environment is nicely done (though a bit minimalistic), game mechanic is well learnable and I think the game does a good job as an action adventure. I enjoyed the combat, searching for better weapons and treasures. The listening compass is good idea also.My only (very minor) reproach would be the map for there is no way to add a custom waypoint to it and follow it - it just would be nice but I can live and play well without it.

												A game about exploring, investigating, uncovering mysteries, with combat more or less as a side activity.This review basically complements or simply adds to the hundreds of other reviews already posted.The highlight of the game is the stories you uncover. Each wraith you meet can't remember what has happened or what is keeping them from resting in peace, and will at first only remember one thing that happened. For example one will only remember staring into the barrel of a gun, which will make you assume the wraith was murdered, until you uncover more clues and belongings which will help the wraith remember what happened and you will eventually realise that your assumptions of the events that took place are completely different from what actually happened. Your first impressions will never be correct. In fact, they will be far off. And this is what, to me, makes the game really shine.There is no true horror in the game. The game will feel creepy for the first hour or so but after that you will realise this is not a horror game. There is virtually no hand-holding or tutorial. There is a mysterious woman, also with amnesia, who has her own past she is trying to discover who will a few times direct your next move, which include assisting her in figuring out her own. The majority of the side stories also tie together to the main story line involving the said mysterious woman.The combat is challenging at times but revolves around switching between weapon types for either faster firing or more damage for different enemies, while dodging their attacks. Virtually no replay value however (unless you want to witness the ending again) as all investigations are recorded in a book so you can always read back at what the stories are, and there are no cinematics.For $20, you may be wishing there to be more content, otherwise when the game goes on sale it is definitely worth a buy. Lots to do for 100% completionists out there too!			"

												This game tries to focus more on looking artsy than actually telling a good whole story.There is no voice acting, but there are great atmospheric sounds to keep the player looking around, but after some time it gets boring and all you will do is just want to finish the quest and get to another and just want to be done with it as there is no real reward for doing anything.I haven't finished the game because of how confusing the game gets as it expects you to know what to do and where to go as it does not give any guides of what to do. Even though I have not completed the game, I watched the ending on Youtube to see if at least the ending is worth it, and it's not, all I can say is that this game is equivalent of a black dot on a white canvas made by an over deep thinking 'artist' which gives the dot an over-extended meaning.On the side of all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t which consists of bad story writing, stereotypical character design (woo skeletons - EDGY) and puke invoking contrast over time, the game is worth £2 which I got it for, enough entertainment for few hours just running around and trying to understand what the game is about as it does not even give a single detail about the protagonist like the name, gender or purpose of being on the ship which crashed.If you're going to buy this game anyway, then just prepare on reading this phrase A LOT - ""I remember..."".

												Story: 9/10      The story is fantastic. Sometimes a little hard to follow and it seems to repeat itself a little at times, but I still found the story so gripping that I didn't want to stop playing until I finished the first area. **EDIT: 3.2 hours was the time it took to clear the first and second area, I was going a little quick though.**Graphics: 8.5/10      The graphics are very good for such a low price game, but still have occasional issues. Certain things encountered appear blocky and rectangular, when they in fact should flow smoothly. I'm running on the highest graphic setting with a Radeon R9 290 GPU.Physics/Mechanics/Engine: 8/10... Actually, 9/10      The combat is my only complaint. One could be aimed right at the head of an enemy at relatively close range, and the projectile will act like you're aiming well above your target, or to the right/left. A point-blank headshot turns into a projectile sailing 3 feet above their head. Another downside, if one of your projectiles gets stuck higher up in a tree; don't bother jumping to try and grab it. You just end up looking like a cat chasing a laser pointer. That said, a cool feature is certain projectiles can ricochet off armor, and still be retrievable (if one can find them.) My favorite feature though, is the use of directional sounds/hearing. Very well implemented, instills a good sense of distance/direction unlike some other games.Pricing: 11/10      I bought the game on sale, curious at it's low price tag lowered even further by the sale. Looking deeper and reading other reviews, I decided to give the game a try. I'm glad I did, I feel as though by getting this on sale I practically stole it at $1.50 (or what ever the price of the sale was). I'd definitely have been happy if I still paid full price.Atmosphere: 10/10      Many ""horror"" games claim they're soooo scary. All those games have is jumpscares with no build up. This game is different! It holds a very creepy atmosphere, and nowhere feels safe. When I play, I'm constantly looking behind and listening to the various noises hostiles will make. To me, this is a true horror game, not just another jump-scare fest. Eyes also hold a strong sense of fear for me, so when one of the types of hostiles got so close to me I could see them, I got goosebumps. A game hasn't given me goosebumps like that in a long long time.TL/DR: Buy the game. If you like a horror game that can hold it's atmosphere and has a good story, you will be pleased.			"

												Short: Get it right now, or if you're not convinced, get the demo, then buy the game because it's 10 times bigger.Betrayer is an exploration game. It has fps elements, and it tries to do some horror here and there, but it's mostly about taking in the scenery and atmosphere while indulging in a few tidbits of story on the side. the mechanics are solid, and you won't get bored, probably finishing the game in 2 or 3 nights max. if you don't like running around alot, don't buy this game, because it's all you do; but by god is it done well.

												Its a great game, the graphics arent terrible, theres a good story, the gameplay is well done. I would highly reccomend this to almost everyone. It could have had a bit more done to it, like voiced dialogue, but even without that, this was a great game for $1.50 (I got it during a sale, so even better!)Sound effects are quite creepy.			"

												I owned this game for about 2 years before I finally sat down and really played it.  I really liked the story and piecing together all of the clues and stuff but the game itself is very repetitive.  By the end I was thanking the game for having areas with no totems to cleanse because it was such a chore.			"

												A wild game, with amazing sound work, great visuals (even if you play it in black and white - which I recommend) and a dark and original story.   While its not open-world, each map area allows you to explore to your heart's content.  It's even fun to just go out into the wilderness and listen to the sounds - they have done a great job.I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed a FP action/adventure with a dark disturbing story.

												Great Game. It's like a stealth, horror, roguelite with a nice story in it. I thought the gameplay was a tad bit repetitive with a lot of going back and forth, but it wasn't that bad. Combat is nice, you get this old school arsenal so planning while fighting is a must. Sound is amazing, from the sound of enemies to the listening of objectives, immensely good. The visual though, whether you choose to use the default or coloured, they're both strikingly beautiful and so vibrant.8/10			"

												This is a mystery horror done well!Betrayer was designed with combat, and it fits in flawlessly! Combat is a perfect complement to the style, setting, and story! This genre can often be combat free and I personally enjoy those games. However I always find that challenging combat makes the game far more enjoyable! The combat is so fun in Betrayer, that I actively engaged every enemy I found, on the hardest setting.Betrayer has some really unique art too! That is mostly with the use of colour ... or lack there of. There is a really creative use of mechanics that change what is essentially day and night (that's the spoiler free version). When the player initiates (except in one instance) the art, monsters, and story all change on the same map.I want to go on, but am afraid of spoiling the ending. The point is that this game is fantastic, truly unique, engaging, rewarding, and positively confusing. If you're looking for a short and complete game with a mystery that keeps you thinking a while after – then this is a good choice.			"

												If you are thinking of buying this game, just get it for the story and make sure you pick it up on sale.The stealth system is flawed.  The reason most stealth games work is they take place in enclosed areas.  Unlike Thief, you are in an open area and because of this, when you kill one enemy all of the surrounding enemies will hear and see you and you will be attacked.  After the second area, it is almost impossible to remain in stealth.  The stealth system became so tedious that I found myself putting the game on the easiest difficulty and running from point to point not caring if I had been seen.Combat becomes more tedious than fun.  The amount of hits required to take even the weakest enemies down (if you don't consistently get headshots) makes each encounter more annoying than fun. You will begin to roll your eyes every time you are forced into a fight due to the poor stealth system. And since there is no teather distance, the enemies will follow you around the entire map!Those are the main problems with this game.  It is a great story if you can force yourself to put up with the terrible stealth and combat mechanics, but I can't recommend this game if you are looking for good gameplay.			"

												I really enjoyed the first 9.7 hours I had in the game.Pros:*The game has a very nice aesthetic to it that can be customized to how you like it.*There are numerous side stories that you can do. I really liked doing these, and found them to be the better part of the game.*The game has a decent atmosphere.Cons:*There wsn't much music. I get that it might clash with some parts of the game, but the lack of music really holds the rest of the atmosphere back. even a bit more ambiance would help.*There isn't a huge variety of weapons. There's three types of bows counting the crossbow, and two kind of guns. I only used the bows in regular combat until I could get a gun, then I used the crossbow in any kind of stealth scenario. I feel that bows needed a good reason to be used. Sure around mid game you can get a really fast short bow, but by then the pistol you have will likely out damage it. Heck, by then I was able to oneshot many of the enemies with my weapons.*Enemies are pretty bland. There's eight enemies that I can think of. For the most part, enemies can fall into one of two or three groups. There is an enemy that made combat interesting on the first encounter, as it requires a specific way to damage it. Once you figure it out, though, they just become a nuisance. *Combat is pretty basic. aside from the two main types of weapons, you have bombs and tomahawks. I think I accidentally used either of the special items than I did on purpose.*The ending of the main story leaves a ton to be desired, honestly. The ending left me pretty confused. After watching other people play through the ending, I saw I'm not alone, and it's a case of too little information. This is a serious shame, as by this time I was really enjoying the story. I really wish we could get some sort of followup, because I REALLY want to know more.*Stuff just isn't explained. there's no lore behind any of the interesting bits. Like what is this dark world and why can I go into it? Why can I talk to ghosts? What are these ashen figures? What are these burning enemies? Why is there a bunch of conquistodors that appear to be possesed? what are these totems? What is this corruption stuff? What are these weird spidery things and spores? Who is the merchant guy and why have I never seen him? His letters talk to you the player, and suggest he stocks all the shops. Heck, What's the deal with the ending? So, looking at the list of pros and cons, there's obviously a ton more in the cons section. HOWEVER! This is not a bad game. I did really enjoy it. I even found the collectible hunting sort of fun. Do I recommend it? Sort of. I think it is a very interesting game, and it had a ton of potential, but the ending mixed with the lack of useful lore really held it back. So, If you want a game with some decent side stories, try and get Betrayer while it's on sale.			"

												Betrayer is sort of unique, but at the same time it's familiar. It's definitely a solid game. I've encountered few if any glitches or bugs. The combat is satisfying and there are a number of weapons and ways to take down your enemies. The environment is deeply immersive, and the story is interesting enough for you to care about it. I found myself exploring the island for no reason whatsoever, but that's not a bad thing. Recommended!			"

												Everyone else already wrote eloquent reviews about this game, so this one is for those that are on the fence about buying and are using reviews. This is a good game. Lots of mystery and exploring to discover the fate of a decimated colony. You can play in black and white or in color, so don't let that scare you. Gets slightly repetitive towards the end, but man, I found this game to be really enjoyable. I wouldn't really call it a horror game. There are a few jump-scares from time to time (especially if you're playing late at night and are intently listening for the distant shimmer of a treasure chest), but nothing too scary. I bought it while it was on sale which I think justifies the purchase. Worth close to $20, but I would wait until it's on sale. Seriously though, this game is a rarely great Indie game and definitely deserves a playthrough. Buy it or become a Betrayer to the gaming community (see what I did there?) P.S. If you do buy it, when you talk to the red maiden and she asks you if she needs to die, say yes (Literally no one else has and you could be the first to find out what happens)7.14323556 / 10    "

												I have to say... I bought Betrayer after Ghem's Review And i have to say two things A) Well done review by Ghem who actually made me want to buy it and B) I'm glad i bought this As this is Easily One of the best games i Have played in the last year or so.The thing thats really Great is that Betrayer Doesn't Use Many Jump-Scares, Unlike Slender who uses Jump Scares for Cheap Frights this game Makes you Scare or Jump Yourself... Example: I was still pretty fresh to the game just entered the first area and still not knowing much about the enemies. As i Took out a Lone Conquistador i Moved in to Loot the corpse as that happened A Gust of Wind Came by And i turned to see something Shiny, Instantly my Mind Thought that it was onther enemy so i had a mini-Heart attack and Ran. Only to Find out it was only a Piece of loot i failed to pick UpClocked in 9 or so Hours since buying it Yesterday and ive got it loaded ready to play When i Finish this... This game is a Visually Striking, Unique, Terryfiying, Beautiful and Immersive games And i Highly Recommend it. The Game looks just as good in colour than it does in Grey Scale, Only the Grey scale makes it that much more atmospheric.The only little Niggle/Flaw i Have with this game... No Voice acting... If this were to have voice acting i think it would greatly add to the immersion to the game			"

												This game is too good to write a long-winded review for someone to slog through just for me to tell that it's well-worth the price, so I'll keep it simple. The graphics are really nice, the setting is strange and interesting, and the gameplay is simple but varied and enjoyable. It's got stealth, exploration, item and equipment collecting, plenty of atmosphere, and a surprisingly innovative use of stereoscopic sound used to find quests and items. If you're looking for a first-person open-world game from an indie developer that looks great, performs great, plays great, sounds great and offers a unique setting and visual style, all you gotta do is give $20 to some dudes that know how to bring the goods, because this is a game that should give indie developers a good name. All that said, you can also play the demo just in case you're not entirely confident that it's worth the money for you, and you can support a good indie dev if you like what you get.			"

This monochrom-red graphic fits perfectly to the story (however colorizing the living world makes bigger contrast with the darkness world), the fight system is a little clumsy, and the investigations aren't hard at all, but the desire to reveal every (dark) secret is pinned me here. Even if we can't get all the answers in the end, I can recommend this to everyone who like mysteries.			"

To solve you must explore the area around various forts to find clues, treasure, lost souls and the like. You must avoid spirts by using a bow or musket or pistol. As well, there is an alternate reality mode that you activate by ringing a bell. This allows you to see and do some things that you can't in ordinary mode. Very atmospheric game.

												This game is just cool. The world is large enough that the amount of content you are looking for doesn't seem miles away, but the trip is perilous enough that you are on edge through most of the trip. I don't play horror games often, but when I do, they don't necessarily get to me. This game lets horror sit in the back, and kicks my seat when I just barely get too comfortable. At the time of writing I'm not even close to completing this, but I find the Wraiths stories compelling and tragic, I find the combat well paced and interesting, I find the enemies to be well varied and unnerving in ways that I can't adequately describe with words. I've never panicked so much at a new sound. This might sound silly, but if this game were to support VR I might just have to get involved with that. I haven't had an experience that let me feel so engrossed in what I was doing that I ended up immersed like this game has made me.			"

												A very unique experience, and very intreguing.  From the games eerie setting to its myserious vibe.  This game keeps you playing.  It has a very imersive feeling to it and a very interesting plot and story.  The game paces itself well constently adding new enemies, areas, weapons, and extensions to the plot.  It definantly has a more artistic feel to it as the game is in all Black and White except for the color Red.  Making enemies, blood, and loot give a dreadful feeling to the world.  The combat is fairly easy but increases gradually giving you time to buy or find new weapons and gear.  However the game is an open world game it has a bit of a linear feel to it as each area you acess you seem to be blocked by a cliff or rocks in most directions traveled for about 3-5 min.  And the linear feel to the quests (objectives) As you press the [x] button to listen for a noise and follow the sound of the noise to the next point of interest.But overall a decent game and worth the pay to experience.  Plus the whole Night and Day world change is interesting.Kryptik Rating 6/10			"

												Great first person exploration and paranormal murder mystery game set in the 'new world'.The game combines fighting, sneaking and exploration in a very well done way.The atmosphere is phenomenal, the way the foliage reacts to the wind is some of the best i've ever seen done in a game, on top of that, the gusts of wind rustling the foliage add a tactical advantage as enemies can't hear you run up to them.There's a large variety of weapons and lots of goodies and secrets to be found (although the latest patch makes hunting for them rather trivial as the devs added markers on the map that show all locations.)Enemy variation is good enough for the run of the game, which when going guns blazing (or bows blazing?) can take between 8 to 12 hours.Graphics are very well done (though i suggest to add some saturation and brightness and lower the contrast a bit, something the devs where kind enough to implement.)Overall, a very good game and I hope the developers haven't gone out of business, seeing the studio has been silent for quite a while.

Tip: if you get stuck check your notes to see what things still arn't checked off as having al the information for them, it will give you guidance on where to go.10/10!			"

												I've enjoyed Betrayer so far, having played quite a few hours to get a feel for the atmosphere, mechanics and enemies. I recommend it strongly if spotted on sale, and a warm recommendation at regular price especially if you are a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like myself. The game isn't hard to figure out or learn to play, though the introduction scene is short and is not comprehensive. I would have liked to be able to practice more sneaking and using the bow before moving into the game world proper, as this is the majority of the gameplay. Betrayer relies on text in scraps of notes or with NPCs to transmit the details of the world. If reading a sentence of exposition or a super-short paragraph of dialogue isn't your thing, you've been warned. I appreciate being able to piece together ghost stories by finding clues with the 'listen' mechanic. Finding treasure chests and other goodies while stumbling through the wilderness adds to the experience.As I said, sneaking and stealth kills are the majority of the game. How stealthy you are to the enemy is not communicated to the player besides simple simple video game common sense. Crouching and walking are near silent, walking is loud, running is right out. Being in shadows seems to help tremendously, though if you are within line of sight of an enemy looking in your direction you are likely to be found out regardless. Detection distance is irregular. Sometimes I'll be spotted across a flat field with little ground cover, sometimes I can get away with it. This isn't terrible, but it forces the player to be cautious, especially since it is easy to be overwhelmed.All out combat isn't preferable because the player is fragile. A group of enemies is deadly, and it is best to pick them off with stealthy arrow kills. (You deal more damage when the enemy has not detected you yet according to the tutorial.) When hard combat becomes necessary, it is difficult enough to survive that you learn quickly not to charge into any group of foes.Progression is measured in areas you move into, as well as what items are available in the shop (which also become available as you move to new maps). The weapons handle distinctly and feel great. Charms add passive bonuses to actions (musket reload speed, run speed, stealth, etc) and most everything you need can be found or purchased. Broken or shoddy versions of weapons can be found on enemies and sold for currency right in the field from the inventory screen. Ammunition is picked up from enemies or purchased from the shop. The game also allows you to conservatively retrieve arrows and other thrown weapons' ammunition from dead enemies. If you miss, sometimes I've been lucky enough to find the arrow in a tree, bush, or in the ground far behind the intended target. Ammo bought at the shop is cheap, but money is better spent on fancier versions of weapons to start, and this encouraged me to pick shots carefully.The intial black and white visuals are what I heard and saw first about Betrayer. While it was a nice introduction to the game and set the tone appropriately, I eventually turned up the color to saturate the natural environment. This also grew tiresome because the bright red of clues and enemies was easily lost in the woody greens and fields. I opted for a medium saturation, and the game ends up looking washed out enough to know that there was color, but still allowing the red signals to catch the eye and keep the bleak, lonely feeling of the game world. This setting becomes moot in the shadow version of the world, where everything becomes black and white anyway, so I don't feel like it changes too much of the experience.Sound, particularly listening to the environment, is extremely important in Betrayer. The primary 'listening' mechanic allows you to locate plot clues in the area by briefly adding markers to your compass HUD. The marks change width and brightness when your heading to the item is true, then fade out until you 'listen' again. It's an old idea, but I like the system because it is not as precise as a simple waypoint on your map and allows accidental exploration. Simply listening to ambient noise is incredibly helpful because item caches and enemies will make sounds at a distance as well. This gives the player the opportunity to explore, avoid, or maneuver around these opportunities. I appreciate that different enemies will make different noises. For example, I did not figure out until the umpteenth ambush that Naturals have a birdcall idling sound; I previously thought it was an ambient bird sound from the forest. Again, this is an old idea, but it fits well with the gameplay and setting, and is executed very well.Mystery, suspense, horror, paranormal activity, and good old-fashioned, New World mysticism are all wrapped into one tight package. Hours of fun were had combing the woods, listening tensely, and hunting Spaniards. I'd give it a solid 9.2/10, an A-, a 4.7 out of 5. Play it, especially if it goes on sale again.			"

												Very interesting game indeed. The story isn't exactly detailed as your traverse the beautiful forests but it adds to the mysterious nature of the game. Combat is fun, using bows is always a pleasure for me and sneaking around was simple and effective. Sound was awesome, with eerie tones and listening for whispers was haunting and engaging. Graphics were amazing, lush forests and great color saturation (if you changed the color from black and white to color). Enemies were engaging but overall were not very difficult, although I don't believe they were supposed to be. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who is willing to play something mysterious with engaging first person combat. It's not very long, coming in around 6 and a half hours or so, more if you spend time looking for ever single chest, scrap of paper, etc. Don't expect a lot out of the ending with this one but it adds to the mystery. Definitely wait for it to go on sale, I paid $4 for it and felt I got my money's worth. I would say $5 and under for this one. Have fun!			"

												If I had to describe this game in one word, I would say it was 'ambitious.' A black and white, open world, horror FPS set in the colonial era from a virgin studio? Most indies would rather churn out another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ puzzle/platformer. But does the execution live up to it's premise? Nope! Does it matter? Maybe.The stealth system is awful. Many of the later enemies have black and white color palettes, so you don't see them before they see you. Oh, and they can see you instantly from 50 yards away. There's a mechanic involving wind masking your sounds or something, but I never felt that it was worth the risk.And the game is plauged by a lack of variety. There are only five different weapon types, with varying qualities. There are only six or seven enemies. You can find equipment, but all it does is give you passive bonuses that are hardly even noticeable. Each zone in the game plays out the same way: find everything in the light world, find everything in the dark world, talk to ghosts and move on to the next zone. By the end of the game, you're sprinting from point A to point B just to finish the game. I haven't felt this kind of repetition since Assassin's Creed 1.Betrayer has a fairly solid engine. There's a myriad of graphics options and HUD options to choose from, which is always welcome from an indie dev. You can even skip the black and white aesthetic and play with color (recommended). That said, I did get stuck a couple times in the geometry, forcing me to kill my character and respawn.But if you can get past these shortcomings, the game is really interesting. The sound design is stellar. I can't think of any game that has such a robust audio department, much less one that is so integral to the mechanics of the game. When the story comes together it can be superb, but the story elements are all non-linear. Sometimes the story doesn't have the impact it should have because of this, even when dealing with incredibly grim topics like filicide.If you're a stickler for mechanics, I'd skip this title. 'Rough around the edges' doesn't even begin to describe my experience. However if you're more interested in atmosphere or story and you're not bothered by the broken stealth system, this game will entertain you for a few hours.			"

												Metacritic is waaaaay off on this one.  Unless blackpowder has just made a ton of improvements and optimizations since it was released (or the review sites couldn't figure out how to enable the color instead of playing in black and white the entire time) then I just don't understand the low score.Betrayer is awesome.  Huge, lush natural environments (some of the best graphics I've ever seen -- especially when the wind blows through all the bushes, grass and trees) with intelligent enemies (love the haunted Indians) that hide behind trees and crouch in bushes and hear your footsteps.  Solid story with depth in the gameplay.  Betrayer is a convincing, surreal world that I enjoyed losing myself in for the 12-14 hours I played it.In fact, the only complaint I have about the game is that there's only one save slot.  My power was knocked out on my first play-through after I was already 9 hours into the game and my save corrupted on the outage.  Maybe it was for the best, though, as I honed my skills enough the second time through so I was able to progress even more smoothly to the end.Ok, just one other complaint.  What were you thinking, blackpowder.. the game should default to color instead of black and white.  I don't know why anyone would want to play this beautiful game in black and white.  The color and lighting needs a little tweaking to get the right saturation, but once you do, wow, you have better looking natural environments than Skyrim does--and everything moves.  If you turn the draw distance up all the way then even the grass on that hill 1/4 mile ahead of you will lean when a gust of wind comes along.Bought it on a 9.99$ sale here, but it's well worth $29.99 or more.  Get it.			"

												When i first baught this game I was mostly thinking 'I hope this gives me a few hours of alright alright visuals with maybe some fun combat' but I must say I got much more than what I was hoping for.This game if far from perfect though that does not mean to say that its not very good, which it is, it just has an unpolished feeling about it. This unpolished feeling though adds as much as it takes away in a strange way with the bow for example feeling clumsy to fire, yet much more realistic, the muskets taking a bloody age to reload is annoying and unhelpful... But RIGHT. When it comes to how this game looks, I couldn't be happier with it, the black and white style just works well as well as a small amount of colour or very bright colours, It really depends on what you want the game to feel like and the level of detail if really rather good too. And the thing I like most it the games use of red just to make sure you know when you're looking at and for while still keeping the mystery of whet to do with it now that you have it.Though I feel the main selling point to this game for me is the fact I was able to just get lost in the game. The immersion levels of this game are really something special as it's so rarely done to this standard. Every sound leaves you franticly searching around for someone, even the breeze keeps me in the edge of my seat though that's nothing when it comes to the other world where it's everything I just said times a 100. The main negatives to this game are just little annoyances that just remind you it's a video game, such as the shop owner just not being there, or the vast drops in pace when you're not sure what to do for 10 - 15 mins.When it comes to you buying this game I really do recommend giving it a go, though maybe when it's on sale like me as I feel £15 may be a tad on the steep side. (I realise at the time of writing this I may not have played too many hours and so you may want to think of this as maybe more of a first impressions (Sorry, a very long one at that) Though i plan to play more and look very foward to do so.)Visuals: 9/10Gameplay: 8.5/10Immersion: 10/10Storyline: 6/10Detail: 8/10Overall: 8.5/10			"

												I'm gonna make this short and sweet, because the game is short and sweet! I finshed it in about 12 hours, and the time was well spent.  The storyline is good and well written, and the game strikes a good overall balace between action and clue-finding.  I would have liked to see the forests a little more populated with wildlife, but that's not a game-changer because they feel alive. The bottom line is that it was FUN!  This is a pretty good action/adventure game; I highly recommend it!  To the developers... sequel please!			"

												I loved this game. 1) Unique, eery ambiance. I can't stress this enough. This game has a immersive and dark atmosphere that is difficult to explain until you explore it. 2) The setting. Colonial Virginia would not be the first place I thought of for a horror/action game, but it works extremely well. 3) Haunting characters. You are confused, they are confused, no one knows what the hell happened, but it was all very bad. I enjoyed the slow reveal of the dark story line in this game. 4) Bows and muskets. Really fun weapons to play with. Muskets are very strong...but if you miss that first shot you might have problems. Didn't Love:1) Limited interaction with the Indians. They mostly serve as scenery and have little to say about the current hellish nightmare that has enveloped the land. 2) You might have to resort to google to advance certain aspects of the story.I highly recommend this game and I hope they make a sequel.

												This game is fun, great if you are looking for more exploration than FPS because the FPS is limited in both enemies and weapon choices.  It is not overly challenging which I think makes it a good niche game, very much a hybrid, for a larger audience than what just one of those types of games might draw in.It is enjoyable creepy fun but look for it on bundlestars or humblebundle at a discount if possible.  While you may get a bunch of hours in to make it worth $10, I am very happy I paid less. "

												This game is... different. In a good way. I started to play and was extremely pleasantly surprised at what I was faced with. (+) The atmosphere is beautiful, nevermind if you have color or black and white enabled. The playthrough is intriguing, with sidequests that just make you want to play more. The dark zones are invaluable to this game, they're beautiful, well made and enjoyable. The graphics are pretty good as well. The game has a toughness aspect to it that no matter if you're just playing easy or going all the way on hard mode, it's a challenge. The monsters are uniquely made, the ""story"" is great, considering it sucks you in and makes you want to keep playing. It has a slight terror aspect to it, but not overbearing in the least, which is good for those players who like the psychological thrill but not having to deal with jumpscares and such. Weapon mechanics are decently made as well.(-) I own a pretty good computer, but it still lags slightly on it, even with settings down.  Also, to really get into the story, you have to find notes. On the ground, on the trees, in the forts, etc. Sometimes, They're hard to find and you might miss some once in a while, which is a pity. Also, to those of you who use the ""hint"" button (tells you where your objective is) but can't seem to understand it, on the sides of your compass will pop up white boxes, and when you're pure glowing white, that means you're facing you're objective. If the left or right one is glowing (intead of both), turn towards that direction.11/10 would kill Spaniards again.			"

												Do not think of Betrayer as an Action game. Think of it as a Exploration/Mystery game with action elements. The combat is repetitive but fun, the game mechanics are interesting and entertaining, but it's such a trip to just wander through this game, and talk to these strange beings and hear their stories and explore their world. If you like games with narrative, games with exploration, games with atmosphere, and also know how to handle an action game, this one is exceptional. If you're looking for an action packed adventure, or on the other end don't like any action, this is not your cup of tea. I, however, think the reviews haven't been very fair. This is an extremely well made game that has a point of view and is well worth your time and money.Stupid name for a game tho.

												7.5/10Especially for that pricetag, it´s definitely worth a shot.The game is very neatly done.Though the story seems dull after some time of playing.First of all: There are many settings that allow you to adjust the game to your taste.I suppose the developers intented people to play this game in Black and White (while the colour red is the only colour that is always displayed... in colour - yeah sorry about that) BUT they have added the option to increase the colour saturation in this game.So people who dislike the black and white gameplay, can switch to coloured gameplay as well. +1 for that, even though I like it in B/W.Further, I recommend to tick the box where it says that you lose all of your loot when you die and that you have to pick it up before your next death, otherwise it will disappear forever.Might sound harsh and too difficult, but really isn´t. I died three times so far, and each time I was able to pick my loot back up with ease. It just adds to the games atmosphere.The enemies are... weird. And deadly.They usually carry bows, knives, pistols or muskets. (so far - I haven´t completed the whole game yet)If you see an enemy carrying a musket or knife, kill those guys first. It´s quite easy to dodge arrows of enemy archers.(If the guy with the knife manages to get close enough and stab you, you´re likely going to die. Because they don´t just stab you, but right after they stabbed you and drained about 45% of your HP, they will very quickly draw their pistol and shoot. And that shot will drain the rest of your HP)The game offers quite nice stealth/sneaking tactics. You can hide in bushes, as far as I understood, you also need to try to not stay in the wind as it carries the sound of your footsteps. So if you have an enemy in front of you and the wind is in your back, he is more likely to hear you.That is accompanied by a ton of vegetation that indicates the direction of the wind. So that´s pretty cool as well.Enemies receive increased damage as long as they didn´t see you. So that is quite helpful for players who prefer stealth, as well.Arrows can ricochet off of the enemies armor (luckily not all enemies have armor) so be sure to either hit the optics in their helmets (basically try to hit their eyes) or other unprotected body parts.The arrows have close to no dropoff, so most of the times you can just aim directly at their head.Last but not least, before I say something story-related:The developers left an email adress in the main menu where you can directly send feedback to them.That is pretty cool, in my opinion.+++ SPOILERS BELOW +++So at this point I want to point out some things in the story, that I have witnessed so far.One - the story seems very interesting at first, but becomes dull after your first sidequest and talking to the first main NPC.So there´s that mysterious woman in a red cape right after you leave the beach. And she disappears again after a few seconds. And then she later appears in an abandoned fort and when you talk to her, she says that she wasn´t that first woman in the red cape you saw, but that it was her sister.Okay.Further she tells you that she has no idea which enemies you are talking about, because she can´t see anybody besides you on the whole island.Okay.So why can´t I bring her with me and actually SHOW her the enemies I am talking about, because all she ever does is, stay in the stupid fort? It could have an actually logical story related reason, but that´s as far as I am right now.The sidequest I had so far, was basically a ghost that was missing his wife and son. And you are supposed to find out what happened to them.And here comes a really cool thing.In Fort Henry, you will find a bell. Upon activating the bell, you can switch into the other world. The black and white colours invert and the whole game suddenly becomes really scary. (Note I´m scared easily)The game further adds to the scary atmosphere, because you have to ""listen"" to be able to find quest relevant places in the darkness. And the listening involves hearing ghostly whispers and screams.-----There´s more to say about this game, but just go ahead and give it a shot. It´s not the best game, but it definitely isn´t bad. And for that pricetag, you don´t lose much, even if you dislike it.			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed this unusual game, despite a few flaws that became apparent along the way. I can't speak highly enough of the aesthetic - a black and white world peppered with red, incredible use of sound, and an atmosphere that gets creepier as the game and story progress. While some of the game mechanics do become repetitive, I found the story interesting enough to want to make it all the way to the end. The ""otherworld"" - an alternate version of the world filled with spirits and obscured by a thick grey fog - felt quite unique and added to the mystique. The sound of that bell is just incredible, and it's still ringing in my ears. There's a good progression of items and weapons over the course of the game, even if you have to work to find them, and I also found the level of enemy difficulty increased in proportion to the size of my arsenal - it never became too easy or too hard. I absolutely loved using the bow, and upgrading the weapons over time was very satisfying.On the more critical side, it is unfortunate that the shovel isn't available until later in the game, when one has already passed over many items that only it could dig up. Returning later with the shovel, I could hardly find any of those places without running aimlessly all over the maps again - though one is well rewarded for their diligence if they do so. When moving back and forth between areas, I frequently found myself facing the wrong direction and having to wait through two extra load screens. And the ""listen"" feature does get quite repetitive after a while, in time I ended up feeling like a supernatural courier with increasing lack of investment in the stories of the wraiths. I will say that I thought the story ended well, even if many questions are left unanswered and the overall ending was a bit bizarre. Room for a sequel? Unfortunately, a bug prevented me from finishing one of the final battles, so I had to watch the ending on YouTube as I really wanted to finish and wasn't willing to wait for a fix from the developers. It seems this game is still being developed and I came into it after many bugs had been fixed and improvements had been made, so I'm grateful for that at least, but I hope to see that last bug fixed soon so I can properly finish the game, and find the rest of the unique weapons and loot.I struggled a bit thinking of how to rate this game. Considering I found it uncommonly beautiful, clever, creepy and enjoyable to play, I want to give it a high score, and yet there are quite a few issues - including a bug that stopped me dead in my tracks at the very end of the game. I think a 7.5/10 is more than generous considering those issues, because despite them I still found myself quite obsessed with this game over the course of a few days. Happy to have snagged Betrayer during a Steam sale but I don't think full price is unreasonable for the roughly 11 hours of enjoyment I got out of it. I look forward to playing again down the road, perhaps with triple monitors finally set up. Recommended for all those who love mystery, horror, or just want to try something new. 7.5/10			"

You arrive at a recently abandoned settlement and begin to unravel the layers of corruption that the recently deceased left in their wake. There's no hand holding or direction except the ability to 'listen' to your environment which will lead you to clues if you face the correct direction.I definitely enjoyed it and was wrapped up in the story albeit briefly.

												This is a first person horror RPG with stunning, unique visuals. It's absolutely for the adventurous: You start off shipwrecked somewhere on the Virginian colony, with no sign as to why you've arrived. As the story progresses, the mood is much darker and ominous than when you first started off. There's a reaspm ""horror"" is listed as the first tag, for the longer you play the more creepy entities and situations become, thus making you more stealthy and slow. The quests, known as investigations, are mysterious and make you search throughout the map to complete them. Without giving spoilers, the ""perspectives"" persay are appealing to the mind, making you think a bit, while not being too complex to the point of boredom or frustration. For those who love to sit back, relax, and enjoy a great first person RPG game with longevity and patience, while maintaining eerie vigilance along the way, this is the perfect game. 10/10.			"

												Best played in the dark, with the lights off, although you will still be startled by angry Spaniards and wraiths in the daylight.  Some adjustment is needed for your eyes to become accustomed to a monochrome world.  If you find the initial settings invite the onset of a migraine, you can fine tune, color, contrast, and brightness settings live in game to dial in a more pleasing palette.  Given that you are in a monochrome world, colors, when they appear can be startling and attention grabbing, so keeping the color settings close to original helps to deliver the atmosphere intended to work in concert with the directional sound, which really brings the game to life (even though you are surrounded by the dead).   Immersive sound is used for more than just surrounding you with various bird songs, insects, wind, stomping feet, and rustling foliage.  Directing you towards objects of interest, is an friendly shimmering sound while pressing X will fill your head with cacophony of echoing whispers that synchronize in stereo as you point your ears in the direction of the closest objective.  Sound used in this way, is far more satisfying and intuitive for locating objectives than simply being directed by a HUD and map.  Since the sound is directional, it alerts you to the presence of enemies around you and will make you jump out of your chair when they suddenly appear.  Conversely, you can startle your enemies, by sprinting towards them during a strong wind, thwacking them in surprise with your tomahawk, blasting them in the face with a cloud of black powder and shot, or haphazardly toss a black powder bomb their way.  Not burdened by a useless pile of trinkets to sift and sell,  what is found turns intal into coin to use for ammo, weapons, and charms, or is recorded as a clue in your journal.  Weapons and ammo can also be found and turned instantly into coin, if you find them lacking.  Just enough arrows and lead shot are held in your inventory to freely use the period weapons without fear of running out.  Conversely, you do not have an endless supply of ammo to freely send an endless volley of arrows like some games.  Arrows can be retrieved from corpses and the ground, so you can resupply at a fort less often.  Muskets and pistols take a few seconds to load, which adds an old world authenticity and charm that is strangely enjoyable and maddening as you scramble to reload, while a Spaniard does the same, trying to murder you from across a field.  A perfect game to play in the fall of the year on all hallow's eve surrounded by pumpkins, candles, and candy bars.			"

												Not gonna lie, not recommending this game proved to be a hard decision.  I really wanted to like it, and even fooled myself to for a time, a somewhat refreshing look at a stealth-horror-investigation-shooter?  Here are the reasons that made this game was hard to downvote.-Amazing environment-Unique Story-Solid Gameplay-Very Fair PriceNow with a list like that, how could I damn such a game?  Well the combat did prove enjoyable though the enemy variety proved to be fairly bland, not the types or number, just how they had the same behavior and mode of attack.  That along with the give and take story that really demanded finishing.  Once you spend an hour or two in the game, you realize it is rather shallow and becomes a grinding Easter egg hunt, wrought with cheap scares to keep you on your toes until you are upgraded enough that you no longer care to be tactical or stealthy.  Then it’s fast traveling back and forth, as well as revisiting areas you’ve scoured already.  The dialogue proved dreadful as well as many systems that appear mostly hollow, like gifting your red friend things you’ve dug up like an obedient puppy and not much to show for regardless of if she accepts it or not.  The game isn’t spotless either as I have also found myself on more than one occasion being lodged into rocks and walls maneuvering with a borderline useless jump key.  Speaking of environments, I hope you like forests, because that is all you are going to get in this game.  So if you are into a cheap romp through the woods with a passible story where you collect junk kill skeletons and talk to ghosts for 5 hours, feel free go on ahead.  I just can’t, although I can safely say I gave the game the benefit of finishing it at least.			"

												Good for an indie title. But the game could benefit greatly from voiced dialogue. The premise has a lot of potentional that could be realized by a bigger budget.  However, as it exists it is not very engaging. The monsters aren't particularly frightening; the astmosphere isn't particularly chilling. For example, you are an 17th century English explorer and discover that the King's colony is a ghost town. Then you encounter a spirit. Then you enter an Otherworld, which seems to be similar to Silent Hill's Otherworld. There's a Maiden in Red who has amnesia. After seeing all this, you plod along as if it's Sunday at Nottingham. Meh.Edit: Having just looked up the plot, it does seem like an interesting story. But the lesson is no matter how interesting it is you must get there first. I'm not going to spoil the plot, but basically it is FEAR with muskets and bows, and instead of a fictional government agency you are an English explorer.As to what is scary, FEAR was scary when it came out. Most recently there is Layers of Fear. The latter doesn't involve any firearms and is basically a walking simulator, but when it comes to that crawling sensation, it's top-notch. Though there were definitely a few sequences in that game where I wished I had a knife or something. Sending a man unarmed into a haunted mansion is not cool.			"

												Overall, Betrayer has a few issues, but it is well worth playing through even so, and certainly worth its low price point.+Great theme and tone, the environment is nicely eerie and the enemies are legitimately frightening.+The game world is unique and the locations are memorable; I found myself beginning to recognize different interesting parts of the forest.+Nice selection of weapons with distinct advantages and disadvantages.+Interesting, well-written dialogue and story.+Just right in terms of difficulty, not too easy or difficult.+Adjusting the color saturation after your first playthrough makes the game feel completely different on subsequent plays, which is fun.-The stealth is is very hit-and-miss, which is especially problematic at the beginning of the game when you need to use it the most (i.e., before you start finding the more powerful weapons).-Using a gamepad makes some of the menus and map screen really difficult and unintuitive to use.  If, like me, you're a weirdo who likes using a controller for these kind of games, you'll quickly end up grabbing the mouse for using the maps at the very least. -There is at least one item that can be permanently missed out on if you don't choose the exact right dialogue options/use a walkthrough.  This probably isn't a huge issue for most people, but it irks me.-The ""thief"" enemies are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and catching them all is incredibly tedious.			"

												If you ever had that feeling that you were playing a scary game and you had that moment of fight or flight even though it's still a game is pretty much my experience of playing this game. First you go get your first weapon then your introduced to some mystery girl then you're not sure like everything else you encounter if you should trust her or not. Personally this game has kept me on my toes. Stealth is somewhat good, but its very useful when sniping, Combat feels great and you can adjust the game to give you even more of a challenge than what you had before or make it easy so you don't overwhelm yourself too much. Second the game visually is a little abstract. If you play it you can keep the black, white, red look to it how its intended or you can make this game colorful and see how bright and beautiful the world is. It's possible the developers did this for people are color blind or don't like how it looks. As for its way of making you feel like fight or flight every enemy I encountered I made crucial choice whether to go in charging guns blazing or keep it quiet and make yourself blend in the shadows as the enemies try to find where you are as you pick them off one by one in a nice safe corner. The AI for this game are questionable because they're either very intelligent or ignorant. For example, an enemy ran up to me with a knife then quickly pulled out a gun and shot me dead. As I was charging for him as well. As this happened I laughed because it happened so quick, but the next guy I fought he died just like I did. Ammo is not to be taken lightly every arrow, bolt, or bullet is a blessing when you get some. This game has alot of unexpected jump scares and travelling feels great. My only complaints or refutes for this game is although it's a great game things like mapping a quest and finding quest items are like finding a needle in a hay stack. It gives you where you are, but does not have a very good way of showing it if you're lost. While Ranged Combat is great, melee combat is a bit weak. There isn't any voice acting for characters so it's like much older rpg games I've played in the past so you'll just have to do what I do and be a voice actor for fun as the game takes you on adventure one quiet not like it. This game is not for the faint of heart and one that constantly needs direction for story progression because there is one you just have to bear the monsters you encounter and scary moments that await you. If I had to rate this game it gets a 8/10, but I found myself not playing too often, because for me it was probably because I'm afraid to go back on after what I encountered my last playthrough with friends, but I'm not spoiling anything.

												If I had to describe this game in one word, I would say it was 'ambitious.' A black and white, open world, horror FPS set in the colonial era from a virgin studio? Most indies would rather churn out another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ puzzle/platformer. But does the execution live up to it's premise? Nope! Does it matter? Maybe.The stealth system is awful. Many of the later enemies have black and white color palettes, so you don't see them before they see you. Oh, and they can see you instantly from 50 yards away. There's a mechanic involving wind masking your sounds or something, but I never felt that it was worth the risk.And the game is plauged by a lack of variety. There are only five different weapon types, with varying qualities. There are only six or seven enemies. You can find equipment, but all it does is give you passive bonuses that are hardly even noticeable. Each zone in the game plays out the same way: find everything in the light world, find everything in the dark world, talk to ghosts and move on to the next zone. By the end of the game, you're sprinting from point A to point B just to finish the game. I haven't felt this kind of repetition since Assassin's Creed 1.Betrayer has a fairly solid engine. There's a myriad of graphics options and HUD options to choose from, which is always welcome from an indie dev. You can even skip the black and white aesthetic and play with color (recommended). That said, I did get stuck a couple times in the geometry, forcing me to kill my character and respawn.But if you can get past these shortcomings, the game is really interesting. The sound design is stellar. I can't think of any game that has such a robust audio department, much less one that is so integral to the mechanics of the game. When the story comes together it can be superb, but the story elements are all non-linear. Sometimes the story doesn't have the impact it should have because of this, even when dealing with incredibly grim topics like filicide.If you're a stickler for mechanics, I'd skip this title. 'Rough around the edges' doesn't even begin to describe my experience. However if you're more interested in atmosphere or story and you're not bothered by the broken stealth system, this game will entertain you for a few hours.			"

												Metacritic is waaaaay off on this one.  Unless blackpowder has just made a ton of improvements and optimizations since it was released (or the review sites couldn't figure out how to enable the color instead of playing in black and white the entire time) then I just don't understand the low score.Betrayer is awesome.  Huge, lush natural environments (some of the best graphics I've ever seen -- especially when the wind blows through all the bushes, grass and trees) with intelligent enemies (love the haunted Indians) that hide behind trees and crouch in bushes and hear your footsteps.  Solid story with depth in the gameplay.  Betrayer is a convincing, surreal world that I enjoyed losing myself in for the 12-14 hours I played it.In fact, the only complaint I have about the game is that there's only one save slot.  My power was knocked out on my first play-through after I was already 9 hours into the game and my save corrupted on the outage.  Maybe it was for the best, though, as I honed my skills enough the second time through so I was able to progress even more smoothly to the end.Ok, just one other complaint.  What were you thinking, blackpowder.. the game should default to color instead of black and white.  I don't know why anyone would want to play this beautiful game in black and white.  The color and lighting needs a little tweaking to get the right saturation, but once you do, wow, you have better looking natural environments than Skyrim does--and everything moves.  If you turn the draw distance up all the way then even the grass on that hill 1/4 mile ahead of you will lean when a gust of wind comes along.Bought it on a 9.99$ sale here, but it's well worth $29.99 or more.  Get it.			"

												Please note this is an intial review, i havent put any serious hours into this yet and is merely what i have experienced so far.Harking back to the old days of gaming, this game gives you minimal assistance, introducing you to the basic controls it then kicks you off the boat and leaves you to it, no waypoints, no shiny arrows telling you what to do, just go sort your self out. Personally i enjoyed this, completing a quest or stumbling over an important item you get a genuine sense of achievement. The bad guys are quite cool and the ""other world"" you have to run around in is genuinley eerie. I wouldnt say this is an outlast or amnesia type scary but its a great atmosphere and the use of contrast actually adds to the feel of the game.TL;DR:Solid first person adventure game, good for people who want a challenge with lots of exploration and atmosphere, but if you want a run around no brainer you may want to give this a pass.

												Really interesting concept, although if you try and multitask like I do (e.g. game on one monitor, Netflix etc. on the other) it can be a bit of a challenge, since a part of the navigation is based off of sound. Sure you can try and use the blocks next to the compass, but it's infinitely easier to use the sound.Overall I like the game a lot. Plan on playing it quite a bit more, and definitely recommend it.

												When i first baught this game I was mostly thinking 'I hope this gives me a few hours of alright alright visuals with maybe some fun combat' but I must say I got much more than what I was hoping for.This game if far from perfect though that does not mean to say that its not very good, which it is, it just has an unpolished feeling about it. This unpolished feeling though adds as much as it takes away in a strange way with the bow for example feeling clumsy to fire, yet much more realistic, the muskets taking a bloody age to reload is annoying and unhelpful... But RIGHT. When it comes to how this game looks, I couldn't be happier with it, the black and white style just works well as well as a small amount of colour or very bright colours, It really depends on what you want the game to feel like and the level of detail if really rather good too. And the thing I like most it the games use of red just to make sure you know when you're looking at and for while still keeping the mystery of whet to do with it now that you have it.Though I feel the main selling point to this game for me is the fact I was able to just get lost in the game. The immersion levels of this game are really something special as it's so rarely done to this standard. Every sound leaves you franticly searching around for someone, even the breeze keeps me in the edge of my seat though that's nothing when it comes to the other world where it's everything I just said times a 100. The main negatives to this game are just little annoyances that just remind you it's a video game, such as the shop owner just not being there, or the vast drops in pace when you're not sure what to do for 10 - 15 mins.When it comes to you buying this game I really do recommend giving it a go, though maybe when it's on sale like me as I feel £15 may be a tad on the steep side. (I realise at the time of writing this I may not have played too many hours and so you may want to think of this as maybe more of a first impressions (Sorry, a very long one at that) Though i plan to play more and look very foward to do so.)Visuals: 9/10Gameplay: 8.5/10Immersion: 10/10Storyline: 6/10Detail: 8/10Overall: 8.5/10			"

This monochrom-red graphic fits perfectly to the story (however colorizing the living world makes bigger contrast with the darkness world), the fight system is a little clumsy, and the investigations aren't hard at all, but the desire to reveal every (dark) secret is pinned me here. Even if we can't get all the answers in the end, I can recommend this to everyone who like mysteries.			"

												Everyone else already wrote eloquent reviews about this game, so this one is for those that are on the fence about buying and are using reviews. This is a good game. Lots of mystery and exploring to discover the fate of a decimated colony. You can play in black and white or in color, so don't let that scare you. Gets slightly repetitive towards the end, but man, I found this game to be really enjoyable. I wouldn't really call it a horror game. There are a few jump-scares from time to time (especially if you're playing late at night and are intently listening for the distant shimmer of a treasure chest), but nothing too scary. I bought it while it was on sale which I think justifies the purchase. Worth close to $20, but I would wait until it's on sale. Seriously though, this game is a rarely great Indie game and definitely deserves a playthrough. Buy it or become a Betrayer to the gaming community (see what I did there?) P.S. If you do buy it, when you talk to the red maiden and she asks you if she needs to die, say yes (Literally no one else has and you could be the first to find out what happens)7.14323556 / 10    "

												Betrayer is a in the middle type of game. It has horror elements, action elements , rpg elements and so on . But the problem is that it does none of these quite well. The horror elements get grading after a while, the action elements (shooting with bows ect) are ok, but nothing extraordinary and the rpg elements are nothing short of a string of ""go get X to talk to Y "" . but when it all comes together it makes for an alright experience. In short sessions , the game is pretty good and at times legitamatly scary and fairly hard. If you can get this odd-gem on sale (lower than 10 dollars) I recomend to buy it and try it out , you might find a good experience.			"

												**EDITEDSummary: Explore colonial America and uncover mysteries behind strange going-ons.Type of game: Think Skyrim crossed with a murder mystery.Pros:- Great atmosphere.  Great use of sound as well. You really feel like you are in the place the game puts you in.- Good mechanics (shooting/sneaking/upgrades/etc)- Story is interestingCons:-- There is a map in the game but it in no way updates when you find things. It also doesnt let you make notes on it. This is my single biggest complaint.  There were multiple times I would uncover something I knew I would have to come back and see, but instead of the game making note of it or being able to write on the map myself, I just had to remember where it was. Which seems silly.-- Items of interest are highlighted red and twinkle. You also get some audio cues something is nearby. One issue with this is sometimes the coloration isnt strong enough to see what you need to find easily enough.Overall the game is really good. It has just a few issues that could be easy enough to make it better. But it is a good game worth your time. I would give it a 7.5 or so as it stands.			"

												Excellent game. Very unique. It's a supernatural murder mystery set in 17th centruy North America. To solve you must explore the area around various forts to find clues, treasure, lost souls and the like. You must avoid spirts by using a bow or musket or pistol. As well, there is an alternate reality mode that you activate by ringing a bell. This allows you to see and do some things that you can't in ordinary mode. Very atmospheric game. A tip: learn to us the listen key or button as it will help greatly in finding stuff.			"

												I have to say... I bought Betrayer after Ghem's Review And i have to say two things A) Well done review by Ghem who actually made me want to buy it and B) I'm glad i bought this As this is Easily One of the best games i Have played in the last year or so.The thing thats really Great is that Betrayer Doesn't Use Many Jump-Scares, Unlike Slender who uses Jump Scares for Cheap Frights this game Makes you Scare or Jump Yourself... Example: I was still pretty fresh to the game just entered the first area and still not knowing much about the enemies. As i Took out a Lone Conquistador i Moved in to Loot the corpse as that happened A Gust of Wind Came by And i turned to see something Shiny, Instantly my Mind Thought that it was onther enemy so i had a mini-Heart attack and Ran. Only to Find out it was only a Piece of loot i failed to pick UpClocked in 9 or so Hours since buying it Yesterday and ive got it loaded ready to play When i Finish this... This game is a Visually Striking, Unique, Terryfiying, Beautiful and Immersive games And i Highly Recommend it. The Game looks just as good in colour than it does in Grey Scale, Only the Grey scale makes it that much more atmospheric.The only little Niggle/Flaw i Have with this game... No Voice acting... If this were to have voice acting i think it would greatly add to the immersion to the game			"

												Betrayer is a bit 50/50 in my opinion.My laptop isn't powerful enough to run it at full pelt graphically, so I can't speak for that, but visually, even on minimum, the game impresses. With the saturation maxed out, the forests and forts look beautifully lush and almost serene, whilst somehow still harbouring an air of creepiness in their design. Overall, I'd say it's impressive to look at.The story had me captivated too. It's pretty dark and fairly gritty in places, with the story slowly filling up with more gruesome deaths the further along you go. The storytelling is nice too, and the language conveys the events during and previous in a good way. There were times where I felt my emotions highten in a way that made me crave answers and more knowledge about a particular person or family. The game delivers well with it's background and lore.The ending was truly unexpected too. Like, seriously, what? But it was well done and quite sudden, in a way that took me completely by surprise.However, amongst the game's good points, I did find errors. I found that even on the lowest difficulty, the enemies could be outrageously hard when given a moment's chance to gang up on you, which became even more frustrating when the character started to walk backwards and to the side by itself. This made aiming at things and not dying almost impossible during certain sections of the game, especially toward the end. I don't know how many have suffered this issue, but beware of it before buying in case it happens to you too. Lots of rage was had.I also found parts of the game to be really boring. There's tons of running back and forth, and even when there isn't, there's tons of fast-travelling back and forth instead. I love it when video games feature fast travel, because it allows me to explore more, make sure I've found collectibles etc, but when the story heavily rests on using the feature, it becomes boring and stale, especially between environments that, as pretty as they are, look immensely similar.All in all I enjoyed the game. A lot of it looked rather appealing, the controls are easy to get to grips with, the controller support is generally good and the story was genuinely rivetting from time to time. A bit glitchy here and there and a tad frustrating too, but I recommend playing this anyway. Probably for fans of FPS games in general. 6/10.			"

												Best played in the dark, with the lights off, although you will still be startled by angry Spaniards and wraiths in the daylight.  Some adjustment is needed for your eyes to become accustomed to a monochrome world.  If you find the initial settings invite the onset of a migraine, you can fine tune, color, contrast, and brightness settings live in game to dial in a more pleasing palette.  Given that you are in a monochrome world, colors, when they appear can be startling and attention grabbing, so keeping the color settings close to original helps to deliver the atmosphere intended to work in concert with the directional sound, which really brings the game to life (even though you are surrounded by the dead).   Immersive sound is used for more than just surrounding you with various bird songs, insects, wind, stomping feet, and rustling foliage.  Directing you towards objects of interest, is an friendly shimmering sound while pressing X will fill your head with cacophony of echoing whispers that synchronize in stereo as you point your ears in the direction of the closest objective.  Sound used in this way, is far more satisfying and intuitive for locating objectives than simply being directed by a HUD and map.  Since the sound is directional, it alerts you to the presence of enemies around you and will make you jump out of your chair when they suddenly appear.  Conversely, you can startle your enemies, by sprinting towards them during a strong wind, thwacking them in surprise with your tomahawk, blasting them in the face with a cloud of black powder and shot, or haphazardly toss a black powder bomb their way.  Not burdened by a useless pile of trinkets to sift and sell,  what is found turns intal into coin to use for ammo, weapons, and charms, or is recorded as a clue in your journal.  Weapons and ammo can also be found and turned instantly into coin, if you find them lacking.  Just enough arrows and lead shot are held in your inventory to freely use the period weapons without fear of running out.  Conversely, you do not have an endless supply of ammo to freely send an endless volley of arrows like some games.  Arrows can be retrieved from corpses and the ground, so you can resupply at a fort less often.  Muskets and pistols take a few seconds to load, which adds an old world authenticity and charm that is strangely enjoyable and maddening as you scramble to reload, while a Spaniard does the same, trying to murder you from across a field.  A perfect game to play in the fall of the year on all hallow's eve surrounded by pumpkins, candles, and candy bars.			"

												[Game mechanic spoilers ahead]I got this game in a humble bundle with some other games. It had been one i was looking out for, mostly just to see how it was and how the black and white scheme worked in practice.What I got was a far more in-depth and thought out game than I had thought. I didn't expect a currency system or an expansive story. I didn't expect the music-less and wildlife devoid world to be so immersive and creepy. But this game does just that. It's immersive, it's unnerving, and its unsettling. Definetly worth picking up.			"

												This game is a gem . i have only played about 14 hours and just cant seem too stop playing . the gunplay feels awesome and makes you feel like your really shooting a musket or old style pistol. the atmosphere is dark and dreary but in a keep you interest kinda way. the enemys are pretty cool although theres not many of them . you can sneak in or go all out either way plan your strategy. the story is also not bad it catches and keeps your attention throughout the game.  there is a bit of repetativeness towards the end but over all would play again.

												This is a first person shooter game where you use weapons from the colonist days of America.It's a ok game to play, the start is kinda scary but to be honest as you go on the shock will go away. This game is nice to controll but I would suggest to do it on a normal pc because a laptop is kinda laggy with this game. The black and white filter looks good but it is even pritty in colors. I would recommend keeping a bow with you since guns and muskets reload so slowly. The bombs are hard to use and the tomahowk is almost meele. Have fun playing this, btw you can continue to explore after completing it. If you buy it then enjoy it to its fullest. It does NOT have any replay value to be honest. It has 21 achievements, badges and trading cards. Have fun, enjoy and don't leave the beach :)			"

Complete ImmersionThe closest you can get to being in the Colonial New World. Evokes a very strong sense of its time-period and outpost strewn landscape.  Spooky but not terrifying.  Enemies include: animalistic conquistadors, blazing angry natives, and the skeletons of the deceased colonists.  Stealthy hit-and-run combat with historical weapons.  A well written mystery about a lost colony.  Outrageously low price for what you get.Personal recommendation: play with low colour saturation, but not completely black and white.			"

												Good little game at the right price ($5), and even better if you catch it on sale like I did (99 cents!).  This is a nice horror survival mystery game.  The graphics are unique, the soundtrack is eerie and compelling, the story is pretty good if you take the time to emerse yourself into it.  Overall a thumbs up!

												Awesome game. Some of the enemies have a cone of sight that's way too large and the 100% backtracking is a little bit too much and a little bit annoying. But, the combat is very satisfying, the artstyle is beautiful, the weapons are real fun and punishing- it's a colonial-era stealth game with a lot of nuances. Very unique, a little groan-worthy, but really fun.			"

												I'm not even sure how this game made me feel. It isn't like any other game I've played and it bring you in using very different techniques. You arrive at a recently abandoned settlement and begin to unravel the layers of corruption that the recently deceased left in their wake. There's no hand holding or direction except the ability to 'listen' to your environment which will lead you to clues if you face the correct direction.I definitely enjoyed it and was wrapped up in the story albeit briefly.

												This game is too good to write a long-winded review for someone to slog through just for me to tell that it's well-worth the price, so I'll keep it simple. The graphics are really nice, the setting is strange and interesting, and the gameplay is simple but varied and enjoyable. It's got stealth, exploration, item and equipment collecting, plenty of atmosphere, and a surprisingly innovative use of stereoscopic sound used to find quests and items. If you're looking for a first-person open-world game from an indie developer that looks great, performs great, plays great, sounds great and offers a unique setting and visual style, all you gotta do is give $20 to some dudes that know how to bring the goods, because this is a game that should give indie developers a good name. All that said, you can also play the demo just in case you're not entirely confident that it's worth the money for you, and you can support a good indie dev if you like what you get.			"

												Holy fantastical fishsticks does this game nail the spooky atmosphere. the first time in town was amazing, and the way the weapons work I believe is a MAJOR attributer to package as a whole. single shot weapons really add to the creepy feel making you worry about placing your shots well. The stories of the characters in the game really REALLY add a neat creepy factor, as does the random things you find out in the overworld. it's just really really well done, and if you like a scare that isn't simply a jumpscare, but comes from wandering around in perfect eere enviroments then this game is for you. my only problem (and it's a minor one) is using sound to find the next waypoint. the only reason i have a problem with this is because for me as a person with a hearing disorder it's sometimes next to impossible to pinpoint where it's coming from. despite this however I would rather them keep this system. it's innovative and only adds to the feel of the game.

												<h1>Betrayer</h1>... Well what is it? What will I get from it? and possibly the most important question of them all how much will it cost me, and is it worth my hard earned money? (for me yes)What is it... A PC game that will delight, astound and more than a few times have you jumping out of your knickers. .It's neither a FPS nor a RPG although there is plenty of your friendly Skeletons (blow them apart), Spaniard/Spanish soldiers with demonic eyes, spiders and weird floating beast's to kill. How about a FPEGA (first person exploration ghostly adventure game). Blackpowder regard it as a first person action adventure game (Indie). What-ever call this Indie Game it's well thought out and extremely pleasing to play.Once you clear the first map you're on your way to a rather pleasant and rather unique game (my opinion).Your playing field is forest, forts, Indian villages, settler cabins and more forest. You should not expect any-thing else, after all, the game is set around 1604 colonial America, and this is were settlers set up homes in them days (forest and farming land), and tried to live in peace with the local Indians.The expanse of forests is (what can I say) massive and very much like reality. The attention paid to the greenery. grass, trees, plants, worn pathways all tremendous detail... superb. Buildings, boulders, flags flying, forts very much what you would expect to see, if it was possible to time travel back to that era.The only gripes I have is the use of the sound director. When trying to find all the chests, which I did near the end of the game, could for me have had a greater range. It was like looking for a needle in a haystack at times, and voice over. These guys have still come up with the goods on limited funds. Me... I am a dedicated RPG fan known to sometimes play First Person Shooters, Action Adventures, MMO's and Multi-Player games. I found this game to be a refreshing change and will put these guys at the top of my list and keep my eyes open for their next release... May the force be with you			"

												Betrayer is a nice investigative adventure game that has some horror aspects and some aspects that can be similar to that of Skyrim's open world. I didn't mind the whole black and white color scheme but you can choose to give it color if you like. This game doesn't have any side quests but you'll never get lost during the story thanks to the ""Listen"" button you get that shows you pretty much where to go (I should note that you don't get this until the first town in the game so maybe not ""never"" lost). Below are some pros and cons I found about the game.Pros:-For once I enjoyed not having to farm enemies for better weapons that might just be 5 damage more or something like that. All weapons of the same name have the same stats so you can focus more on the story and if you want, hunting pages and chests.- Inventory space will never be a problem because you can ""scrap"" your items in your inventory at anytime and gain money. Now that's convenient-The gameplay for me was pretty smooth and incorporates drop when shooting arrows (not sure about guns because all I used was longbows.-Collectables such as pages, key items and also treasure chests that are near will actually make a high pitches noise so that was helpful. Now only if my keys did that.-There's also fast travel. Like, thank god. Seamless fast travel if you're moving around in the same map which is AWESOME.Cons:-Sometimes it will feel like there aren't really much enemies at all on the map.-The shades sometimes hit you with a melee attack before they get in your melee range.-Although it is listed as a horror game and I said it was, there wasn't really anything scary to me but this is just my personal opinion.-After you beat the story, there's not really much replay value. Only to get achievements.All in all, this was a great little indie game. However I don't think it's worth $20. I got in during the summer sale for like $5. If it was $5-$10 then go ahead and grab it!P.s. Tomahawks are OP.			"

												Big surprise. In every way. That's even rarer!The graphic style is quite unique. Monochromatic where only red comes to break this rule. Talking about it, nothing red is so without a good reason. An important point, ennemies, items... Everything red is important. It can be something that will want to kill you but it could aswell be a healing item, that very one you're needing so much.Whatever it is, you HAVE to go and take a look at it.Be swift then, stealthy. Cos you're not that strong! If that's an enemy you spotted from far and at the right moment it happens you'd miss that shot, you're never sure you'd have enough time for a second chance.Talking about shots, don't forget we are actually at the age of the conquests and the conquistadors disovering the USA.That means the gun you're actually aiming with is everything but NOT automatic!Miss the shot and you will have to reload it. Powder, the bullet, etc... Will you have the time?You're no berserker either, 2-3 big hits on the face and here you are back at the camp. And of course everyone had respawn just as you.Maybe this bow would be better no? Silent style! Love it.Hope you got a good ear aswell.For the dialogs? Damn, no. To hear what's happening around you. The cling of that dead spanish's armor, the call of that ghost begging for help.Ah, yes, I didn't mention it yet. You'll talk to deads. A lot. But we don't see ghosts everyday, right? So you'll have to find a way to slip to the other side. Playing between worlds and so. Funny, really. You'll see.So, enough!You got a sharp eye and a fine ear, you got your bow and that ridiculous piece of leather that give you +1 strenght, that's way more than what you'll need to discover what happend here.Go on, please. You won't regret.			"

PREMISE:Betrayer could best be described; and as others have already listed, a stealth based mystery game that relies on exploration as a means of driving the story forward. It takes place during the colinzation of the new world in 1604 by charters set out by both the Engilsh and Spanish Empires. You begin the game shipwrecked on the beach, further inland you run into the only ""living"" human you will to talk to the entire game; a Maiden in Red, she has no memeory of what happend to cause the various settlements you find throughout the game to be full of the Pompeii esque remains of the Colinists and why no one living seems to remain. Unraveling the secret past of the Maiden in Red and of the former Colonies as well as its inhabitants is up to you. MECHANICS / GAMEPLAY:The game does have combat; and while nothing too eather shattering, is more than adaquate for what the game sets out to do. The game gives you variuos choices weapons that all play distinctly different from eachother and have their own pros and cons. For instance the bows (silent, faster to fire) and black powder weapons (stronger, but load and long reload). The differences in the weapons do warrant some thought before rushing into fights when wandering the map, however during other times the games brings the enemies to you making it more a questions of what is able to ill the fastest.  You also get charms that buff your chracter as well as throwables in the form explosives and tomahawks. I really didn't use the latter much. The story is progressed forward by the players ability to ring a bell and transfer from the normal white washed world to a extremely dark ""spirit world"". Within the spirit world you will meet key wraiths, as well as secondary shadows of the former colonits whose spirits that are still bound to the world for one reason or another. It is here that you will you will unravel most of the mysteries of the New World Colonies.  From the first wraiths you encounter in any given area you will usually be given a short incomplete narrative. It is then up to you to  fill in the gaps using clues you find in the living world in order to refresh the wraiths memories and finish their stories. This is where I major give major cudos to who ever wrote the various stories of the wraiths you enounter in game. What might at beginning the  sound like a story of somone consoling  a perons who just lost their father slowly begins to warp with each new clue you uncover and present to the wraiths.This continues until  the story evolves into someone being murdered and another executed. By the conlcusion of each investigation the original phrase thrown out by the wraith will have usually taken on a whole new context and meaning. Writing of this nature is not always an easy feat, and is something I'd like to see more of in the video game realm. BREIF CONCLUSION:Would I recommend this game? Not necessarily to everyone, if you enjoy mystery, interesting writing, and something different, then yes this game is probably for you and you would like it. I bought the game on sale for 2.49, I really would have been content with what I got for 10 dollars.  As some of the negative reveiws can attest it won't appeal to everyone. My major gripe is that the game does get slightly repetative, new enemies are thrown in at later areas. These enemies are fairly interesting and have interesting mechanics, but their newsheen does fade rather quickly. There were about 6 or 7 different areas, and the game started to turn more into work by then end, but the story kept me going to see it through to the end. If I were to apply a number rating for those who care, I would give this game a very solid 7 maybe a shaky 8.MY TIPS TO ANYONE WHO BUYS:*You do get the shovel eventually. Yes you will have to backtack to dig up some of the things you find earlier in the game.*Stealth is slightly less useful in the spirit world, but still applicable. *Pick up everything you can in the map before entering the spirit world in any area, in my opinion this is the best way to get everything done in the quickest way possible.

												So, you're a dude who gets wrecked by the Spanish, then manhandled by the Spanish, then manhandled by Ghosts, burning Native Americans and skeletons. And it's wicked scary.Gameplay is akin to shooters, so if you're a fan, it's great. And the fact that you have to deal with the fact that it's weaponry from the 1600's is EXTRA GREAT.Setting is pretty awesome. Too little New World 1600's colonial horror is done nowadays. If you want a good movie to pair with this, Vallahala Rising and the Witch.Story is grisly, as to be expected with horror. Lots of burnings, rapes, witch huntings, murder and in general tomfollery for you to find out about. THE ENDING THOUGH WILL LEAVE YOU WITH A BAD TASTE IN YOUR MOUTH. So yes. Buy it. Play it.

												First things first, the game looks much better with color, that option, which I don't recall if it existed when I first got the game last year, made it more enjoyable. The game has an interesting idea, a first person survival horror adventure, though, regrettably, it fails at the survival horror part. There is nothing to fear, except random attacks from enemies, which after a time, you can learn where they spawn, so, it stops being a threat. Ghost stories are pretty interesting, but then again, they seem to be almost always the same, oh, I thought I was innocent, nah, I just killed him/her, whatever, they deserved it. Stealth, a joke, no need to use it, could have been implemented better. Enemies, always the same, some ranged attacks, then they charge into melee. The ending, dissatisfying to say the least.			"

												I highly recommend for players who are into unfolding mysteries and exploration! This game is not only about the battle, but also about going around putting the pieces together.Great story, good balancing of protagonist/enemies. The protagonist is not too overpowered to the point he is almost invincible. There will be times when you have to run away from battles to survive. I like the fact that you can't win them all. Exploring becomes awesome as it lets you view the scenery and slowly uncover the story.It is not only a highly visual game, but it also makes you rely on your hearing to survive.If you usually mix up right and left sides of your headphones, THIS is the game where you gotta get it right!Good luck!

												My first mistake was not to check that my system specks are barely there for this game... So this makes playing it frustratingly slow... While that's not exactly the game's faults some most of the rest of it is. However, note that I've played Portal, Portal 2, The Half Life 2 series, Bioshock and Biochock 2 on this old PC - So this old thing is capable of playing some beautifully rendered games. The whole look and feel and controls of Betrayer are kind of dated. For example dialog with characters is through point and click txt. Can't really save game progress and although there is autosave - when you get killed (often for a player like me) you return to the fort or whatever and start all over from quite a way back. After the 10th time of trying to get through the South Gate things start getting a little bit frustrating and boring.Overall, I regret buying this game			"

												Outstanding game that personally I regret not supporting at launch when it was at its full price. Only got it when it was a weekly deal...but you can't buy them all. Really interesting take on FPS, walking sim, and survival horror genres, with early 17th century weapons and challenging enemies. Can be tough if you want it, but the worst that happens is that you respawn at a safe place. Lots of interesting collectibles and investigations, and very well written and thought out. Plus the art style is cool, even if the environments are repetitive. Highly recommended, 8.5/10			"

												Awesome game, awesome ending.  The two biggest criticisms I've read (repetitiveness and the ending) didn't bother me at all.  All games are repetitive these days either with grinding or achievements.  As for the ending, for those who haven't been paying attention, it was absolutely appropriate for the game,   People who whine about the ending seem to expect that the only living female in the story ought to be their waifu and that they are playing a BIoware game where you can get something by gifting NPCs.  Nuh-uh.  This is game's genre is Horror/FPS, not some RPG.			"

												This is one of the most creative uses of third person atmosphere I've ever seen. The enemies are simple and the plot is linear, but there were plenty of moments that gave me goosebumps or made me jump. There is a dream-like quality to this game and I hope that there is a sequel.Try to imagine yourself as a colonist who sees shadows jumping out of every corner. What was that noise? Why is it so dark? Is that a ghost? Where are the other colonists? Are there indians hiding nearby? For someone who enjoys tales of colonial America, this one is a winner. "

												Yea, I can't recommend this game.Everyone else is right, the graphics, setting, progression and combat, those are all spot on. The detective feel at first is excellent, and the mysterious anxiety provoking music and sound are spot on. HOWEVER, this game is first and foremost a story driven game. Everything else takes a back seat. Mainly because combat is repetitive and uncommon, there's only a handful of things to do and collect, and the exploration is tied to the story. SO all that considered, we can't say this game is focused on any of those things. So it has to be the story? RIGHT?Well here's my issue, the story is really just your character getting washed ashore and making your way to the first settlement. After this point, the game is solely focused on collecting evidence and investigating murders, but none of them have anything to do with the end result, and they don't have any affect on the game. The things you're doing amount to zero. You read all the dialogue, talk to everyone you need to, and for what? I feel like there's no reason, until the end. I'm not going to ruin the end, but did anyone else have an issue with that? WHAT THE HELL!??? Really? All that and no explanation of what the heck just happened? I'm all for suspense in endings but having nothing to do with the story at all, and not adding to the story is just a bad call. This game is good except for the story, but sadly the story is what this game is all about. If they had just taken a few seconds to read the story they were making, they'd definitely be like, ""yea we have to change some stuff around, it makes no sense!""It's not a horrible game, but at under 7 hours to complete and 6 of those hours are you running back and forth between maps, I just can't recommend it.I do recommend it if it's on sale, or if you are looking for a really unique take on investigative gaming, especially if you're into this time period.

												It's hard to make something of this game. It'c climatic, the story is interesting, the ending quite nice. It's cheap, I've got it for 1 euro during a sale.But it's unfinished. It lacks voice-acting, which would be a nice addition. Combat is rather minimalistic and repetitive. The trade at the posts rather silly and unnecessary. It's basically a connect-the-dots game where instead of drawing a line between them, you run between set points until you've been everywhere. You don't have to use your brain at all, you don't need to read the story at all. Over all the game isn't very engaging.All the combat and running could be taken out as it's mostly a waste of time. But the game itself is interesting in a way. It's main problem is probably a low budget and the fact it's intended to be so small.			"

												I was going to write a list of ""Pros and Cons,"" but then I realized that although the pros were things done well, the cons were things the game didn't even try to do, because it wasn't about those things.  So, I re-wrote the list as ""Things This Game Is and Is Not About.""  ""Bottom Line"" at the top, for TL;DR purposes.Bottom Line:This is not a triple-A title, and it isn't trying to be.  It's trying to go in a different direction and do things that triple-A titles *don't* do, and specifically avoid doing the things they already do better.  If you like the ""Things This Game Is About,"" and are not bothered by a total lack of ""Things This Game Is Not About,"" then you will like this game, because it is VERY good at what it *is* about.  However, if you find the game ""too slow,"" ""boring,"" ""lacking weapon diversity,"" or ""not challenging enough,"" then this game is a poor match for you, because it is not about scratching those types of itches.Things This Game Is About:~ Spooky atmosphere.  Not frightening, shocking, or horrifying - just slightly spooky.  Something is... *off*.~ Exploration.  There are numerous ways to pick your way through the game, but turning on all the map markers and following the optimal path will be tremendously boring.  Instead, exercise a bit of self-control and wait to turn on those markers until you've found most of the stuff but aren't sure where those last two or three things are.~ Isolation.  This is a doomed colony, and you're there to sort out the wreckage, not interact with a cast of dozens of vibrant and interesting NPCs.~ Paying attention to what you hear (and how audible you are) more than what you see.  The devs wanted to create a game where aural cues are more important than visual ones, and while there are still visual cues for the hearing-impaired, the aural cues are far more important and reliable.~ Helping ghosts make peace with their deaths, which they can't remember, by figuring it out for them.  You may well piece together a story before the ghost does, but they might need some object or other trigger to be able to move on.  Just accept that this is how ghosts work - it's about their peace, not your understanding.~ Patiently planning your attacks.  More like Tenchu (the first one), where you can get in over your head if you fail to spot something, than like Shadow of Mordor, where you're *supposed* to overcome superior odds and adapt your plans on the fly.  Actually, it's even farther in the Tenchu direction than Tenchu is.Things This Game Is Not About:~ Broad weapon choices (would be period-inappropriate).~ Slaughtering your enemies in droves (would detract from the atmosphere).~ Fast-paced gameplay (would detract from the atmosphere).~ Being super-exciting, epic, or over-the-top in any way (would detract from... look, this is a very understated game).~ Magic spells, talent trees, mega bosses, epic weapons, phat lewtz, or pretty much anything that most triple-A titles go over-the-top on to try to stand out from their competitors.~ Puzzles.  The ""investigations"" you undertake, such as they are, are not intellectually demanding.  There are no puzzles in this game, no intuitive leaps to make; if you can just find the MacGuffins the ghosts are looking for, they'll fill in part of the colony's story for you and be able to move on themselves.  This is not a framework for a puzzle, it's a justification of the fetch-quest mechanic (the ghosts are stuck, therefore they can't go on their own errands).			"

The only con/ is the save puts you back at the main save points when you die so you'll have to go all the way back to the point you die at, but this is no big deal.

												Betrayer might be described as a colonial gothic first person shooter.  The player roams the forests defending self against enemies whilst looking for clues to solve a mystery.  The game mechanics and plot are simplistic but it can take a while to figure out what the game is about.It was necessary to search the discussion forum at several points to find out how to proceed.  The design doesn't make the player's objectives clear enough.  This results in too much running backwards and forwards looking for people, items and clues, which gets boring after a while.  A bit like being on an orienteering course.  Towards the end I was more or less following a walkthrough just to complete the game.Overall, playable but gets repetitious.  My interest in the colonial period was probably the major reason why I kept playing.			"

												This game is EXCACTLY my style, the contrast is amazing especially with the occasionall splash of red. It is one of the games that do black powder guns right, although one or two steps are left out. The whole thing is eerie an I love it, the enemies are pretty cool and the story is intriguing. Betrayer takes place in 17th century Virgina and the player begins on a beach, the only survivor from a shipwreck. Throughout your journey you are pursued by what seems like phantom conquistidors with shadowy faces with red glowing eyes. You'll like it if you're a fan of historical sorts of things or just games that are eerie/creepy.PROS:Good and unique art styleRealistic black powder loadingNIce creepy touchColor setting if you don't like the black/white feelAddition of mystery (like clues and information about people)CONS:Limited visibility in  the ""Bell Dimension""A bit too much roaming.Relies too much on cluesTo me, the pros far outweigh the cons.

												having completly perfectioned the game i have a few things to addressone of which is the ending but we will get to laterTLDR : 6.7/10betrayer is a game about messed up situations and you are there to find out what happened which take place in some place (britishs and indians are fighting)or in a more detailed way, some ghosts did stuff and they regret it, and you are trying to find out what has happenedand then later (near the end of the game) decide their fatebut deciding their fate has no effect on the outcome (as far as i know correct me if am wrong)in the beggining you start by finding this maiden in redafter a small chat you go on the quest to find out her name/personality because she forgot somehowthen you find this bell that sends you into this limbo realm placethe bell was never explained in the game by the way (again as far as i know)in the beggining it makes little to no sense why are you doing these things (talking to ghosts and finding out about things)and my playthroughs were shortthen they made more sense when i found out about the name of the maiden in red and thats where i got intrested and finished the game in 2 playthroughslater you find out that her sister is the one doing all these horrible things and thats because she suffered when she died in a tragic way by her own father because he found out shes pregnant by an indian (shes british by the way and so is her father) then in the after life she gets so angry, that she corrupts the land (put the land into limbo state)then her sister went looking for her and saw some horrible thingsshe tried to make her find peace, but failed and so has turned the corruption to the way how everyone died apparentlymaiden in red screwed up basicly, and when you find out and talk to her sister (after calming her down)she tells you shes bound to the maiden, so you go try to convince her to let go of her sisterand she leaves to go say goodbye to her sisterthis is where i really hated the gameso maiden leaves and after a small ambush you catchup with herand the area that her sister is in, is now no more in permanent limbo statethen she tells you to forgive her, followed up by her exploding into shadowand then you are sorrounded (sorry for my english) by wraiths, and putting the area in permanent limbo againsort of like that one slenderman game where it ends by slendermen circling around youand the credits roll, after the credits end you go back to her in fort hope and talk to herand she apologizes because she cant let go of her sisterthe absouloute stupidest ending possible, wasnt she wishing she finds peace a moment ago?everything started to make somewhat of sense when you find out the maiden's namethen they destroy it with a terrible endingthe terrible ending really reduced my like for this game by alot6.7/10though it remains a good game for people who like mystery and stuff			"

												==Spoiler Free==I highly recomend Betrayer, for the following reason: You can have a Bow.All In-jokes I have with my friends aside, I just spent ten hours playing Betraying, enjoying every minute of it. Could I have finished it faster? Probobly. Should I have? No, since I enjoyed exploring, trying new tactics, and just generally goofing around while playing it. Looking at the reviews of Betrayer on the popular gaming news sites would give someone the impression that Betrayer is an okay game at best, filled with repetative, boring moments at the end. IGN gave it a 5/10 because of that.I wholeheartedly disagree, for multiple reasons. +First off, IGN are the corprate ♥♥♥♥♥s who literally give every ♥♥♥♥♥♥ CoD game a '10/10, it was okay', and shill Mt. Dew and Doritos at every chance they can, so they can go ♥♥♥♥ off. +Secondly, there was not a single moment in the game that I didn't enjoy. I died a few times, sure, but I never got upset at it.+I've never felt my heart race while playing a video game before, but Betrayer did that for me. Crouching in the shadows, hearing the Loon calls of the savage Burned Men getting louder as they got closer and searched for me, I couldn't help but grow anxious, and when their calls turned to War-Whoops (well, louder, more agressive Bird Calls...) I felt a shivver run down my spine.+I've never felt such satisfaction with completing Side-Quests and hunting for Treasure, in any video game, but Betrayer made me feel very, very satisfied. Each time I found a chest filled with gold, or dug up a nice weapon (I'm looking at you, Trickster's Pistol!) I very very satisfied, and very happy.+The game, despite having map markers to show where Treasure/NPCs/Totems or whatever can be found, doesn't hold your hand and give you a big blot on your compas saying 'HERE IT IS, DON'T POKE AROUND AND LOOK, HERE IS THE ITEM!'. The thrill of discovery felt genuine, much like in The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, unlike The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion or The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, or any other first person game out there.+The sound quality of the game was great, I never once muted it out of annoyance+Unique stealth mechanics with the wind. Waiting for the wind to blow so I can dash out of cover and get up close to cut the throat of a Spaniard was very, very thrilling and fun. More games need to do this.+Sensible controls. The G key throws Tomahawks, the B key throws Grenades, the F key is for activating NPCs/Items, C causes you to croutch walk, and Left Shift causes you to sprint. WASD for movement... The people who made this obviously know what they are doing, and designed it well.+Fun Storyline. No spoilers, but the plot was awesome!+Realistic weaponry. Arrows have an arc to their flight, Crossbows are powerful enough to oneshot a man in heavy armor, and the blackpowder weaponry has realistic damage - A good pistol shot at close range to the torso would drop any man. Muskets aren't horiffically inacurate at close range as well, so that is nice.+Your Choices actually mater. Not spoiling anything, but they mater!Now, the issues I have with the game:-I wish the Maid in Red had a voice actress.-Uhh...All in all, Amazing game. 11/10, would (and will!) play again. Oh, and btw - IGN can go ♥♥♥♥ off and die. Every ♥♥♥♥♥♥ CoD game gets a ""10/10, it was okay I guess"" from the borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ivory Tower gaming 'Journalists' at IGN, but this game only gets a 5/10? Obviously those cucks over at IGN wanted Blackpowder to grease their palms with a little extra special crap, and I'm glad they didn't.			"

												This is a first person shooter game where you use weapons from the colonist days of America.It's a ok game to play, the start is kinda scary but to be honest as you go on the shock will go away. This game is nice to controll but I would suggest to do it on a normal pc because a laptop is kinda laggy with this game. The black and white filter looks good but it is even pritty in colors. I would recommend keeping a bow with you since guns and muskets reload so slowly. The bombs are hard to use and the tomahowk is almost meele. Have fun playing this, btw you can continue to explore after completing it. If you buy it then enjoy it to its fullest. It does NOT have any replay value to be honest. It has 21 achievements, badges and trading cards. Have fun, enjoy and don't leave the beach :)			"

												A descent game about helping ghosts find peace.It is presented in a black and white forest landscape with the color red used for enemies or points of interest.(You can change it to color if you want.)The weapons are divided in bows(x2), crossbows and flint lock(x2), the bows are fast, the rest have to be reloaded after every shot, there is also a melee attack as a last resort, but you will need charms to improve it.The first map (not the tutorial one), is the only one that has to be done in stealth, because you only have the worst weapons in the game and until you get the charm for melee damage you have less options. The second map starts spawning enemies that know where you are making stealth very difficult, but you should have better weapons and be far more active and aggressive, the hardest sections are the totem cleansing ones, because you run out of combat space fast, if you don't start prepared.The game is divided in two worlds the overworld with conquistadors and burned indians, and the world of the dead with skeletons and banshees. Sometimes spiders and spore traps in later levels. All enemies are competent and will provide a challenge, depending on who sees the other first.The story is based on early colonial times, you go around and find clues, then you ask the ghosts about the items and puzzle together what happened, in the end freeing their souls.

												This was such a refreshing title when I picked it up and started playing it.  Creepy autmosphere with black and white landscape.  It's almost straight out of a horror movie with shooter elements implemented into it.  Although the story of the whole game is a little confusing and the character you play just seems thrown into the middle of it all it's still nice to make progress through it and see what might happen next.  If you plan on 100% completing this game you'll be doing A LOT of saving and loading in order to get all the kills you need, but if you enjoyed the shooting as much as I did you almost feel like there isn't enough enemies in the whole game entirely.

												Great experience, especially for an Indie game at $5. It isn't perfect, but I would say it is better than some AAA titles I've played. Only real problem I had was enemies seeing me through hills/trees sometimes. Nice graphics, nice soundscape. Overall thumbs up!			"

												TL:DR Gameplay: simple, Graphics: quirky Story: It's goooood. Buy the gameIt comes across as a standard First person shooter in a lot of respects, namely melee feels weak sauce and you're only real weapons are ranged. At time of writing I haven't actually finished the game but I still recommend it but that's more for the story and the different take on things.The game is initially set in black and white (and red) but you can put colour in the game if you want. Personally I'm playing in the black and white (And red) because the effect is just so damned cool. I say black and white (and red) for the simple fact of thats what it is. Everything apart from items of interest, namely enemies, are in black and white. The enemies have a flash of red on them which helps them stick out. So far I've been in three seperate large areas which require exploring in two different states fighting spirits, skeletons and conquistadors. Each area has a story to unfold and various items to find to solve them with. The stories themselves unfold nicely and in the first at least sent a little shiver up my spine.The combat is stealth based if you can but you can hold your own in, for lack of a better word, firefight. The searching for goodies is a nice take on a compass where you use your ""ears"" and triangulate yourself towards the place/item/individual.Not wishing to give too much away despite this game being a few months old now I'll leave you to discover that one.All in all I'd recommend this game on the basis of that the company is trying something new and what they've created is both beautiful in design and implementation.

												If I had to sum this game up, it would be that the devs tried making a game that people would want to play, rather then making a game people would want to keep playing.This game has a unique look with a monochrome art style that uses red to show points of interest, and if that's not your thing you can switch to full colour or anything inbetween. The game also does very little hand holding as it gives you a few tips of how the game works at the beggining but after that the game expects you to explore and work out everything else by yourself which isnt exactly a bad thing as I enjoyed the game more for it simply letting me work out things on my own.The combat however is just awful, I liked the idea of using a bow to silently take out enemies and how you can use the wind to mask the noise you make but I found this was just a waste of time as enemies can spot you quite easily if your not crouching and the render distance for the red colouring that makes the enemies stand out is rather low. Enemies can only be silently killed so long as you hit them in the head with a bow or melee them, but if the arrow doesnt kill them every enemy for a few hundred miles round will know exacly where you are.The gameplay itself isnt all that bad as you explore the area looking for clues and chests but after the first hour or so you will quickly grow bored of it as you will find that you've experienced everything this game has to offer after about 20 minutes. Run to the marker on your map, collect treasue, kill enemies nearby rinse and repeat. The story is also lackluster with an ending that just left me wondering why the devs even bothered adding it in.Even after all these faults though I found myself enjoying the experience the whole way through even when I knew I was just repeating the same mundane steps the whole way through. If you give the game a chance I'm sure you will enjoy it even though it has many glaring issues.			"

												The combat in Betrayer is pretty fun, and when you first start the game the world feels mysterious and full of discoveries.However, you'll quickly get used to the environment (each new area is just more of the same) and how practically all the objectives are just scavenger hunts. The context can be interesting for some of the stuff you find, but after I'd picked up 20 notes and looked at 15 tombstones I felt like the game was just desperate to try and keep the world from feeling empty. The environment lost it's mystery and became very predictable.You can enter an alternate dimension type thing throughout the game, and while that does give the story more potential, I was hoping it would affect the gameplay and environment a lot more than it did.Maybe I'm just impatient and the game's setting and story really come together and hook you after the first couple hours, there is certainly potential, but the repetitive scavenger hunts and somewhat copy-pasted locations might keep me from ever getting that far.If you catch Betrayer on a good sale than I suppose it could be worth it, the first couple hours are fun. (Don't let my criticism ruin it for you)Just be aware that the game has weaknesses, and that causes some players to lose interest before long.			"

Complete ImmersionThe closest you can get to being in the Colonial New World. Evokes a very strong sense of its time-period and outpost strewn landscape.  Spooky but not terrifying.  Enemies include: animalistic conquistadors, blazing angry natives, and the skeletons of the deceased colonists.  Stealthy hit-and-run combat with historical weapons.  A well written mystery about a lost colony.  Outrageously low price for what you get.Personal recommendation: play with low colour saturation, but not completely black and white.			"

												A descent game about helping ghosts find peace.It is presented in a black and white forest landscape with the color red used for enemies or points of interest.(You can change it to color if you want.)The weapons are divided in bows(x2), crossbows and flint lock(x2), the bows are fast, the rest have to be reloaded after every shot, there is also a melee attack as a last resort, but you will need charms to improve it.The first map (not the tutorial one), is the only one that has to be done in stealth, because you only have the worst weapons in the game and until you get the charm for melee damage you have less options. The second map starts spawning enemies that know where you are making stealth very difficult, but you should have better weapons and be far more active and aggressive, the hardest sections are the totem cleansing ones, because you run out of combat space fast, if you don't start prepared.The game is divided in two worlds the overworld with conquistadors and burned indians, and the world of the dead with skeletons and banshees. Sometimes spiders and spore traps in later levels. All enemies are competent and will provide a challenge, depending on who sees the other first.The story is based on early colonial times, you go around and find clues, then you ask the ghosts about the items and puzzle together what happened, in the end freeing their souls.

												3 hours of trying to figure out if I'm the titular BetrayerThe Basics: 16th century First person mystery/explorationPrevious Time Spent: noneExpectation of learning Curve: low Why I bought this: I've read a decent number of reviews, and been told specifically to get into it by a close friend. Additionally, this seemed inspired by the lost Roanoke Colony, which seemed novelFirst Impressions: Betrayer has a striking look achieved by the use of monochrome and red. It also is a great game to play with the headphones on, and just get blown away by the sensory experience. You definitely feel transported to a different place. Wind blows around, moving the trees, and terrifying apparitions attack. There's a sense of danger and a great mystery hook.  My 3 Hours with the Game:You begin shipwrecked on the shores of the new world, wandering to a colony that has clearly failed. As mentioned previously, the use of color is great, and there's a very real sense of being in another time and place. There's great use of sound, such as rushing wind, and the combat is tense, frightening, and novel. Betrayer didn't need to be a first person shooter in order to accomplish the atmospheric storytelling,  but the combat wasn't unwelcome either. I hit some initial technical frustrations with the game, involving odd controls, but after a bit of internet digging, I was able to solve this. I appreciated the fact that in spite of being a game that leads you from waypoint to waypoint, I was able to actually get stuck in the plot early on, requiring some more sleuthing, and use of the listening power (which I had previously ignored). I spent most of my time seeking out clues, following them, talking to ghosts and uncovering tantalizing clues to the doom that fell over this colony, which seemed to have multiple factors, from the geopolitical to the fantastical.  My highlight:The first time I rang the bell in the first fort, and found myself in the night world, able to speak to ghosts and presented with more fantastical enemies. The sounds were effective and quite frightening, and the realization that I could go through and deal with the corruption that had begun blighting the land was heartening. (Plus, who doesn't want to fight skeletons under black skies with a slowly reloading musket?)My verdict: I'd strongly recommend giving this a shot(but maybe on a steam sale). The atmosphere is great, and the sense of danger inherent in fighting well armed monsters with a bow, musket or other 17th century weapon feels very real. There's a great frantic sense to reloading a musket while being charged by a squad of Spanish Soldiers (who seem like revenants or ghouls). Additionally, the story is fairly interesting, however I did get a bit of a sense of repetition after hitting hour 3, as much of the gameplay involves searching for waypoints on the map, clearing them, learning clues and talking to ghosts before preceding. -Jon			"

												Story: 9/10      The story is fantastic. Sometimes a little hard to follow and it seems to repeat itself a little at times, but I still found the story so gripping that I didn't want to stop playing until I finished the first area. **EDIT: 3.2 hours was the time it took to clear the first and second area, I was going a little quick though.**Graphics: 8.5/10      The graphics are very good for such a low price game, but still have occasional issues. Certain things encountered appear blocky and rectangular, when they in fact should flow smoothly. I'm running on the highest graphic setting with a Radeon R9 290 GPU.Physics/Mechanics/Engine: 8/10... Actually, 9/10      The combat is my only complaint. One could be aimed right at the head of an enemy at relatively close range, and the projectile will act like you're aiming well above your target, or to the right/left. A point-blank headshot turns into a projectile sailing 3 feet above their head. Another downside, if one of your projectiles gets stuck higher up in a tree; don't bother jumping to try and grab it. You just end up looking like a cat chasing a laser pointer. That said, a cool feature is certain projectiles can ricochet off armor, and still be retrievable (if one can find them.) My favorite feature though, is the use of directional sounds/hearing. Very well implemented, instills a good sense of distance/direction unlike some other games.Pricing: 11/10      I bought the game on sale, curious at it's low price tag lowered even further by the sale. Looking deeper and reading other reviews, I decided to give the game a try. I'm glad I did, I feel as though by getting this on sale I practically stole it at $1.50 (or what ever the price of the sale was). I'd definitely have been happy if I still paid full price.Atmosphere: 10/10      Many ""horror"" games claim they're soooo scary. All those games have is jumpscares with no build up. This game is different! It holds a very creepy atmosphere, and nowhere feels safe. When I play, I'm constantly looking behind and listening to the various noises hostiles will make. To me, this is a true horror game, not just another jump-scare fest. Eyes also hold a strong sense of fear for me, so when one of the types of hostiles got so close to me I could see them, I got goosebumps. A game hasn't given me goosebumps like that in a long long time.TL/DR: Buy the game. If you like a horror game that can hold it's atmosphere and has a good story, you will be pleased.			"

												I had absolutely no expectations, so this was a very pleasant surprise.The light and shadow effects were easy on the eye, and those eerie sounds echoing through the otherworldy forest, really gave the game a uniqe atmosphere.After completing the adventure, and turning on the color saturation, i was truly impressed. It was like roaming an entirely different world, and made me walk around the entire map again. Very decent looking. Weirdly, the game ran even smoother, after the switch.While browsing the forums/discussions, it was nice to see such an active and commited developer team, responding to player massages. Something i don't often see.The sneaking mechanic could have used a bit more polishing, and maybe a few less goofy/weird sound effects when hitting something, but overall this was a very good game.8.5/10			"

												Betrayer is an interesting game. I bought it a while ago and decided to get playing it rather than leave it languishing in my Library. I would absoloutley grab it while it's on sale, but it's still a steal at full price. I really think the developer is really underselling the game. I would make No Man's Sky 3.99 and make Betrayer cost whatever they're charging for it these days.It has it's flaws, but it's a really nice balance of being a creepy openworld FPS/mystery game, without being totally terrifying. The biggest flaw is repetitveness, but if you can see past that and want to find out the fates of the people that lived in the colony, then it can be overlooked. The other is a kind of rubbish melee combat system. Ranged weapons work great, but if enemies get to close, you basically only try to hit them with a knife and you can't block incoming attacks. Overall, I'd give the game a 7/10 so far			"

												[Update]Nomination for ""I thought this was cool before it won an award.""-------Betrayer is a fantastic game. It combines elements of horror, mystery, playing detective, and discovery in a 1604 colony establishing itself in Virginia, tied together with a strong narrative. While investigating disappearences and unearthing the fate of the colonists, the player travels across a gorgeously designed world. Think Miasmata style exploration, with the stealth of archery, or the braziness of muskets and pistol combat should the player choose.The engine runs very well, and looks stunning. The game features a black and white filter, the strength determined by the player, who can choose true greyscale or saturate the colours as vivid or dull as they choose. Certain elements of the world remain red regardless.The combat is very well done, the weapons are very responsive, and the archery behaves exceptionally well.Even just exploring the world makes this game the comfy simulator so many people desire.To top it all off, the writing builds a world of characters so vivid and varied that you'd be hard pressed to stop playing, lest you not know what happens/happened next.Absolutely recommend this game to anyone looking for a comfy experience, or a middle ages, colonial setting horror or mystery.

												Awesome game. Some of the enemies have a cone of sight that's way too large and the 100% backtracking is a little bit too much and a little bit annoying. But, the combat is very satisfying, the artstyle is beautiful, the weapons are real fun and punishing- it's a colonial-era stealth game with a lot of nuances. Very unique, a little groan-worthy, but really fun.			"

												This game tries to focus more on looking artsy than actually telling a good whole story.There is no voice acting, but there are great atmospheric sounds to keep the player looking around, but after some time it gets boring and all you will do is just want to finish the quest and get to another and just want to be done with it as there is no real reward for doing anything.I haven't finished the game because of how confusing the game gets as it expects you to know what to do and where to go as it does not give any guides of what to do. Even though I have not completed the game, I watched the ending on Youtube to see if at least the ending is worth it, and it's not, all I can say is that this game is equivalent of a black dot on a white canvas made by an over deep thinking 'artist' which gives the dot an over-extended meaning.On the side of all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t which consists of bad story writing, stereotypical character design (woo skeletons - EDGY) and puke invoking contrast over time, the game is worth £2 which I got it for, enough entertainment for few hours just running around and trying to understand what the game is about as it does not even give a single detail about the protagonist like the name, gender or purpose of being on the ship which crashed.If you're going to buy this game anyway, then just prepare on reading this phrase A LOT - ""I remember..."".

												First things first, the trailers don't do this game justice!It IS available in color, but you have to go into options and turn the color saturation up to 1.  While I understand the devs were going for a particular effect with the grey scale graphics, leaving it that way for all aspects of the game is likely turning people away.So, turn the color ON, and then the black/white/greyscale moments have that much greater effect.Good story, interesting side 'quests' and achievements.Good jump scares -  a few will make you come out of your skin, guaranteed.Worth $10 as it stands, worth $5 normal price all day long, and if it's on sale, what are you waiting for?You will die a LOT.  You will run a LOT.  One of the best horror games I've played in quite some time.			"

												Short: Get it right now, or if you're not convinced, get the demo, then buy the game because it's 10 times bigger.Betrayer is an exploration game. It has fps elements, and it tries to do some horror here and there, but it's mostly about taking in the scenery and atmosphere while indulging in a few tidbits of story on the side. the mechanics are solid, and you won't get bored, probably finishing the game in 2 or 3 nights max. if you don't like running around alot, don't buy this game, because it's all you do; but by god is it done well.

												Its a great game, the graphics arent terrible, theres a good story, the gameplay is well done. I would highly reccomend this to almost everyone. It could have had a bit more done to it, like voiced dialogue, but even without that, this was a great game for $1.50 (I got it during a sale, so even better!)Sound effects are quite creepy.			"

												Story: 9/10      The story is fantastic. Sometimes a little hard to follow and it seems to repeat itself a little at times, but I still found the story so gripping that I didn't want to stop playing until I finished the first area. **EDIT: 3.2 hours was the time it took to clear the first and second area, I was going a little quick though.**Graphics: 8.5/10      The graphics are very good for such a low price game, but still have occasional issues. Certain things encountered appear blocky and rectangular, when they in fact should flow smoothly. I'm running on the highest graphic setting with a Radeon R9 290 GPU.Physics/Mechanics/Engine: 8/10... Actually, 9/10      The combat is my only complaint. One could be aimed right at the head of an enemy at relatively close range, and the projectile will act like you're aiming well above your target, or to the right/left. A point-blank headshot turns into a projectile sailing 3 feet above their head. Another downside, if one of your projectiles gets stuck higher up in a tree; don't bother jumping to try and grab it. You just end up looking like a cat chasing a laser pointer. That said, a cool feature is certain projectiles can ricochet off armor, and still be retrievable (if one can find them.) My favorite feature though, is the use of directional sounds/hearing. Very well implemented, instills a good sense of distance/direction unlike some other games.Pricing: 11/10      I bought the game on sale, curious at it's low price tag lowered even further by the sale. Looking deeper and reading other reviews, I decided to give the game a try. I'm glad I did, I feel as though by getting this on sale I practically stole it at $1.50 (or what ever the price of the sale was). I'd definitely have been happy if I still paid full price.Atmosphere: 10/10      Many ""horror"" games claim they're soooo scary. All those games have is jumpscares with no build up. This game is different! It holds a very creepy atmosphere, and nowhere feels safe. When I play, I'm constantly looking behind and listening to the various noises hostiles will make. To me, this is a true horror game, not just another jump-scare fest. Eyes also hold a strong sense of fear for me, so when one of the types of hostiles got so close to me I could see them, I got goosebumps. A game hasn't given me goosebumps like that in a long long time.TL/DR: Buy the game. If you like a horror game that can hold it's atmosphere and has a good story, you will be pleased.			"

Complete ImmersionThe closest you can get to being in the Colonial New World. Evokes a very strong sense of its time-period and outpost strewn landscape.  Spooky but not terrifying.  Enemies include: animalistic conquistadors, blazing angry natives, and the skeletons of the deceased colonists.  Stealthy hit-and-run combat with historical weapons.  A well written mystery about a lost colony.  Outrageously low price for what you get.Personal recommendation: play with low colour saturation, but not completely black and white.			"

												I'm still pleasantly suprised at how much I enjoyed this under rated game ! I admit, I was apprehensive at first, but it's earned a definite top spot in my favorites list this year. In my opinion, it's the games simplicity that makes it so elegant and fun to play. Right from the unique graphics to it's well all around balanced story, combat and puzzle elements. And thanks to the developers insight, it's plenty challenging for even the most seasoned gamer ( enemies can actually se and hear you if your not cautious ). It just looks and plays wonderfully. I haven't a single complain and highly reccomend Betrayer as an outstanding diversion from the norm.			"

												Too bad there is no neutral option, so I had to choose to recommend it.This is a weird one. The game definitely got flaws, a lot of them. It's not very well fleshed out in general, to be honest. But it is very, very compelling where it's at its strongest.Betrayer is noticeably repetitive and doesn't have many engaging mechanics, and the ending is considered puzzling, cliffhanger or even lackluster by many. But its creepy, atmospheric setting, striking presentation(which you can fine-tune to your liking!) and brilliant sound design more than make up for its flaws. All exposition is provided via text, however, and there is little environmental storytelling. It tries to be an semi-open-world RPG, but to be honest it's much closer to a fetch-quest driven FPS with RPG elements.It's an atmosperic, immersive story of how flawed humans are. Overall, this game is kinda closer to its artsy-fartsy kin, rather than to mechanichally competent products. In my opinion, it's well worth the asking price, and if you're into this kind of janky creepiness - go ahead and try it.			"

												Nicely creepy. The audio (and lack thereof) keeps you on the edge of your seat. The visuals are excellent too. It's not a great game for binge playing since most of the tasks just involve walking to random spots in the wilderness, which gets repetitive, but playing for an hour at a time is satisfying.A complaint: there's only one save slot. I'd love to be able to go back and replay the intense final events in the game, but there's no in game way to save your game at a point you'd like to be able to come back to.			"

												  I would say Betrayer is a solid 7/10. The ending and poor character dynamics really bogging it down, while the gameplay and atmosphere arev very well done and give it the life the main characters lack.     This game was very, very good. The atmosphere was amazing, the gameplay challenging and investigations exiting. The story was also amazing, until the end when it jumped the shark hardcore, with a ""twist"" that M. Night Shyamalan would even find stupid. I'm not saying it ruins the game as it obviously doesn't, it ruins the story. I found myself, A: wondering how the F bigfoot got ent-draught and B: what just happened. There was no lead or preparation it was just a slap to the face, especially as i had gone out of my way to collect everybit of evidence about the island.  It also doesn't help the character interactions are succinct some times and terse other times, no real bonding or development happens between Mr. Silent and Ms. Red. They both by the end feel empty, the only characters that every really felt alive were the dead ones, the wraiths, as they had interesting stories and contrasting morals.   The gameplay, while at times repetetive was very enjoyable. It forced me, until i got the Hunters longbow, to avoid confict or fight in a fire and retreat/hide fashion. The end boss battle was very muchly so, having me fleeing like a mad dog from the deer spectres, trying to reload my musket, as my arrows were spent faster than the french fighting morale.   "

												Overall, Betrayer has a few issues, but it is well worth playing through even so, and certainly worth its low price point.+Great theme and tone, the environment is nicely eerie and the enemies are legitimately frightening.+The game world is unique and the locations are memorable; I found myself beginning to recognize different interesting parts of the forest.+Nice selection of weapons with distinct advantages and disadvantages.+Interesting, well-written dialogue and story.+Just right in terms of difficulty, not too easy or difficult.+Adjusting the color saturation after your first playthrough makes the game feel completely different on subsequent plays, which is fun.-The stealth is is very hit-and-miss, which is especially problematic at the beginning of the game when you need to use it the most (i.e., before you start finding the more powerful weapons).-Using a gamepad makes some of the menus and map screen really difficult and unintuitive to use.  If, like me, you're a weirdo who likes using a controller for these kind of games, you'll quickly end up grabbing the mouse for using the maps at the very least. -There is at least one item that can be permanently missed out on if you don't choose the exact right dialogue options/use a walkthrough.  This probably isn't a huge issue for most people, but it irks me.-The ""thief"" enemies are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and catching them all is incredibly tedious.			"

												The graphics are simply amazing, the greyscale style looks great, and if you don't want it in greyscale the saturation can be changed in options. The story is mostly told through the stories of ghosts, what the maiden in red tells you, and notes that you find. The game is open world, and while the world is split into maps, they're large maps with varied terrain, and there are treasure chests and buried treasure that gives a reason to explore, if the great scenery isn't enough. There's also fast travel.There are armored soldiers and stealthy natives patrolling the area, and stealth is a viable option if you don't want to run in guns blazing. The weapons are well designed and animated, with 2 flintlock guns, 2 bows, a crossbow, a tomahawk, and grenades, a nice break from the usual ""pistol, SMG, rifle, etc."". The guns, bows, and crossbows can be bought in different qualities, and there are unique weapons with even better stats hidden around the maps too.On each map there is a bell that moves you to a very atmospheric alternate dimension where you can talk to ghosts and try to solve some of the area's mysteries while fighting skeletons. There is a unique ""listen"" feature that helps you find clues, ghosts, and statues by making a sound near their location, which prevents the frustration of not being able to find the next clue.Overall, definately worth buying.

Took me at least an hour until I made any signifigant progress because of this.No voice acting, wish there was something. Game needed more sounds (There is NO MUSIC)Enemies sometimes act weird, easily spot youEnemies are hard to killWeapons hard to useEasy to get lostGame lags time to timeObjective based (Go here, Then go here)Overall, the game is worth it if you are a big historical geek, looking for something different, or it has a good sale. Not worth the full price, but I only paid around a dollar since I got this in a bundle. Worth a play though, game has some strong points most other games lack.7/10- Burning Man Approved "

												 Betrayer is one of the better horror games out there. You roam across large maps, fighting against wandering undead and piecing together both the history of a lost colony and what you need to do to making things right again. This might be my favorite thing here - you don't just work out the story, you also have to work out how you go about to make things happen. The writing is excellent, it looks gorgeous, and the gameplay is pretty unique. It's a bit obtuse, but by design; a hugely rewarding game if you decide to stick with it.			"

												Disturbing story, leaves you thinking... Violent stuff has happened and you must find out who did it (find artefacts and present them to related 'persons', no puzzle other than finding the stuff in the first place), and ultimately you must judge whether or not those people should be set free or left to torment on their deeds. Boils down to a binary choice, yes, but it made me think about stuff I probably wouldn't otherwise.Game-play is quite fun, actually, with you exploring several right sized locations for items and 'people' to talk about those items. The maps are populated with some enemies, that re spawn when die, and a nice mechanic is implemented to let you approach those enemies with some stealth. You also have perfect indication if you have been spotted or not, as well as noises that you learn to recognize that point to nearby enemies - which can be pretty hard to spot when not enraged and charging you. New enemies (with accompanying attack mechanics, mostly hit and run but with different flavours) are introduced at a right pace. At least one of them made me jump when they first showed up, which for me is quite hard to achieve in games where the character has some means to defend itself... You must also use a nice mechanic to switch to 'dark mode', which changes the enemies, the colour scheme turns dark, and severely limits your view range. The idea is to explore in light mode, mark up the spots (by hand or by cellphone photos, as the map has no marker functions) and then revisit some places when you have the equipment or on the right mode to progress in story. You also can ask for audio and visual cues to where you should go next, which will help you find the elements relevant to the story.Overall the game was a dark and tense experience but also a quite enjoyable exploration. You are not powerless or forced to do stealth, and although you are encouraged and should use it to at least dispatch the stronger enemies first in a surprise attack, charging up in the right zig-zag pattern might left you alive at the end. Still I recommend do not panic and remember an axe to the face is quite effective in discouraging those pesky charging foes.			"

												Betrayer is an interesting experience. It has a bold look to it, being only black and white with dashes of red seemed (to me) like a gimmick until I played the game. The developers give you the choice of playing it black and white, or with a variety of levels of colour, varying from off-white all the way to realistic. Despite the choice I still played in almost black and white, it was design move that works heavily in favour of the story. Throughout the game you will encounter peoples tormented souls, and you will figure out what happened to make them all ghostly. The stories are usually mundane and it feels almost pointless to do it except for curiosities sake. However, once you approach the end of the game all these peoples stories will come together to affect what will happen. You will have choices to make, and I found it surprising how invested I was in what I was doing. The gameplay is very crisp, a solid stealth system that does not hold your hand. If you are not behind cover or in the shadows, and you see an enemy, chances are he will see you as well. You have bows and guns, bows have a higher chance of deflecting off armor but are silent, guns hit hard but are noisy and draw huge aggro. There is also melee and some other weapons but you get the idea.There is no music, but you will want headphones. You're only indication for what you have to do next is to listen. If you press X you will hear some noises, and you will need to know where they are coming from to find them. Also the game sounds beautiful. Exactly like the outdoors. It's got crows and everything.Gameplay:   7/10Story:   7/10			"

												This game is a lot of fun. I'd say play it with the colour settings down most of the way so the surroundings are essentially black and white with monsters/baddies being the only oddity for colour. The detail in the sound and the mechanics surrounding wind are really cool to play with, and the availability for ""losing items on death"" to make the game more difficult is definitely a plus for those interested. The game is super atmospheric and a lot of fun, definitely worth the $5 price tag.			"

												A wild game, with amazing sound work, great visuals (even if you play it in black and white - which I recommend) and a dark and original story.   While its not open-world, each map area allows you to explore to your heart's content.  It's even fun to just go out into the wilderness and listen to the sounds - they have done a great job.I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed a FP action/adventure with a dark disturbing story.

I really liked the story and piecing together all of the clues and stuff but the game itself is very repetitive.

												This is one of the more unusual games that I have ever played. Not your average detective story, this game has the silent protagonist scurrying around a sixteenth-century colonial outpost, trying to solve the mystery/riddle which surrounds the only other living character, the Maiden in Red. From the first moment that you enter the spirit world by ringing the cacophonous bell, to your first encounter with the games\' memorable enemies, it is clear that this game will stick with you. Demonic conquistadors who are \""more beast than man\"", Indians who are aflame in death, spiders as large as a shipping container, and Vesuvius-victim-type ash figures who screech like cats and flail their limbs at the player, are all certain to unsettle, if not frighten outright. When the player finally reaches the forbidden wilderness to the west, deep in the forest, the secret of what is driving the supernatural forces at work is truly horrifying. Lastly, the final plot twist is without a doubt one of the most shocking and unexpected ones I have ever come across in a game.  That one came completely out of left field, as they say. Combat was tolerable, but when the story/atmosphere is this good, who cares?10/10			"

I'm playing through again, and the gameplay is just as rewarding.The enemies never come in mass numbers (8-12 at the most), so fighting can be a little sparse and is usually more stealthy.  The controls are really smooth, with minor confusion when trying to navigate the menu without using the mouse. Overall 8/10.			"

												The combat in Betrayer is pretty fun, and when you first start the game the world feels mysterious and full of discoveries.However, you'll quickly get used to the environment (each new area is just more of the same) and how practically all the objectives are just scavenger hunts. The context can be interesting for some of the stuff you find, but after I'd picked up 20 notes and looked at 15 tombstones I felt like the game was just desperate to try and keep the world from feeling empty. The environment lost it's mystery and became very predictable.You can enter an alternate dimension type thing throughout the game, and while that does give the story more potential, I was hoping it would affect the gameplay and environment a lot more than it did.Maybe I'm just impatient and the game's setting and story really come together and hook you after the first couple hours, there is certainly potential, but the repetitive scavenger hunts and somewhat copy-pasted locations might keep me from ever getting that far.If you catch Betrayer on a good sale than I suppose it could be worth it, the first couple hours are fun. (Don't let my criticism ruin it for you)Just be aware that the game has weaknesses, and that causes some players to lose interest before long.			"

												I started Betrayer on a whim (and to pick up the trading cards), and three days later....  There's a definite Silent Hill vibe, although a more aggressive kind of creepy. I very much enjoyed the black&white color scheme; to me it seemed to make things easier to see, not more difficult. The mapping was well done, if a little deus ex machina (everything has a marker, which reduced aimless exploration but seemed a bit unlikely) - for gameplay purposes it was definitely a help.The dialogue is unpolished and lacks characterization (everybody pretty much talks in the same textual monotone), but for the most part that felt acceptable in the context of a ghost story. You don't expect ghosts to be scintillating conversationalists. Enemies were never incredibly difficult, but the archaic weapons added a layer of awkwardness that was fun to work with - running backwards while trying desperately to get your musket reloaded because you ran out of arrows, being pursued by creepy burning ash-men or snarling men in armor with glowing red eyes gave the game its own kind of character.Pleasantly surprised. Definitely worth playing if you're a horror-stealth fan.			"

												I really did enjoy playing this game. It is an alternate historical/supernatural game that plays out in monochrome with interests highlighted in red, or you could have the option of color, but I prefer the monochrome. Adds an ethereal and lifeless feel to the atmosphere that already starts off feeling ghostly and displaced. I feel that is is very exploratory in that you search for clues, tie together pieces of information and have to solve mysteries all while defending yourself against unknown entitites turned dark and twisted. There really have been no know glitches I encountered but that is just from my experience of playing.The end was also enjoyable as the end ""Boss"" did not make anyone rage-quit or feel overdone. Everything in my opinion was seemless and flowed nicely. NOTE: This is my personal opinion and thoughts of the game, not an overall view if the game for general audience. As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research.			"

												A compelling tale of discovery, ghosts, regret and, naturally, betrayal.You travel around a section of woodland near the coast of the New World with no real understanding of who you are or what you must do, meeting variuos trapped spirits along the way. Each wraith you encounter has its own unique baskstory, which normally ties into the stories of the other wraiths in the area. There is areally chilling overarching plotline which retains a couple of eerily ambiguous elements and it only picks up speed as you go through the game.This is a superb short game (you could grind it out in a week easily, and I fully suggest you do so) but not without content. True, there could be a bit more variation in the maps/objectives, but that's really not what this game is about; rather it is something to play slowly and contemplatively, exploring every tree stump and rock face and traversing every inch of the woodland on the hunt for clues. It somehow avoids being boring despite being really much of the same for the duration.The graphics are great and run wonderfully, the sound design is EXCELLENT and is one of the few games I can think of where sound was actually an aspect which jumped out at me, and the gameplay is simplistic and smooth. Loot and weapons are fairly standard, but you do find some interesting variations on the same weapons as you get later in the game. There are multiple incarnations of each weapon type, getting progressively stronger as the game progresses.At the start of the game you feel so weak, only being able to take on a couple of enemies at once at a push, stealth really is the preference for early game. Towards the end, however, it is possible to find weapons capable of taking down a skeleton in one hit, even the floating skulls are no match for you near the end, but combat is not the focus of the game and you never feel overpowered.My favourite aspect of Betrayer is the level of customisation the game gives you. you can choose to play the game in black and white or colour, with variable saturation, as well as having control over the enemy difficulty at any point in the game. The best part of customisation, however, is the map, which you can set to display the locations of various goals, or, as I prefer, not. It is useful to be able to turn these settings on after the plot draws to a close for completionists out there, just so you can polish off the few chests you might have missed.One downside is that it also seems to highlight chests/objectives you have previously attained in the map, although this only happens once you return to an area you have previously visited. I also noticed that, at one point in the game, it decided to invert the stereo; so what should have been in my right ear was suddenly in my left visa vera, which was incredibly disorientating in game which utilises sound to direct you to the wraiths. However the fix was easy, as I just swapped my headphones round.Apart from these two very minor greivances, Betrayer is a great game from such a small developer and at a great price. I fully recommend it to anyone looking for an atmospheric daytime-horror game. Theres something in this game which is certainly creepier and more harrowing than any xenomorph jumping through the air vents. Its more subtle than that. Buy this game.			"

												Best thing I've played in a long while.  FPS, RPG, mystery, puzzle, it has elements of all these in a beautiful setting.  The background sounds and music add immeasurably to the game, for me anyway.  When that 'heartbeat' sound kicks in when enemies spot you never fails to give me a bit of a rush.   Very refreshing change, the way health, upgrades and combat is handled.   Branching dialogue with NPCs', should make for replay value as I imagine the responses have some effect on outcome.Graphics are very nice, with many options available.  Controls are completely open for setting to your personal preferences.Indie games of this caliber should make the big outfits look at their work,  highly recommended.			"

												3 hours of trying to figure out if I'm the titular BetrayerThe Basics: 16th century First person mystery/explorationPrevious Time Spent: noneExpectation of learning Curve: low Why I bought this: I've read a decent number of reviews, and been told specifically to get into it by a close friend. Additionally, this seemed inspired by the lost Roanoke Colony, which seemed novelFirst Impressions: Betrayer has a striking look achieved by the use of monochrome and red. It also is a great game to play with the headphones on, and just get blown away by the sensory experience. You definitely feel transported to a different place. Wind blows around, moving the trees, and terrifying apparitions attack. There's a sense of danger and a great mystery hook.  My 3 Hours with the Game:You begin shipwrecked on the shores of the new world, wandering to a colony that has clearly failed. As mentioned previously, the use of color is great, and there's a very real sense of being in another time and place. There's great use of sound, such as rushing wind, and the combat is tense, frightening, and novel. Betrayer didn't need to be a first person shooter in order to accomplish the atmospheric storytelling,  but the combat wasn't unwelcome either. I hit some initial technical frustrations with the game, involving odd controls, but after a bit of internet digging, I was able to solve this. I appreciated the fact that in spite of being a game that leads you from waypoint to waypoint, I was able to actually get stuck in the plot early on, requiring some more sleuthing, and use of the listening power (which I had previously ignored). I spent most of my time seeking out clues, following them, talking to ghosts and uncovering tantalizing clues to the doom that fell over this colony, which seemed to have multiple factors, from the geopolitical to the fantastical.  My highlight:The first time I rang the bell in the first fort, and found myself in the night world, able to speak to ghosts and presented with more fantastical enemies. The sounds were effective and quite frightening, and the realization that I could go through and deal with the corruption that had begun blighting the land was heartening. (Plus, who doesn't want to fight skeletons under black skies with a slowly reloading musket?)My verdict: I'd strongly recommend giving this a shot(but maybe on a steam sale). The atmosphere is great, and the sense of danger inherent in fighting well armed monsters with a bow, musket or other 17th century weapon feels very real. There's a great frantic sense to reloading a musket while being charged by a squad of Spanish Soldiers (who seem like revenants or ghouls). Additionally, the story is fairly interesting, however I did get a bit of a sense of repetition after hitting hour 3, as much of the gameplay involves searching for waypoints on the map, clearing them, learning clues and talking to ghosts before preceding. -Jon			"

												If I had to sum this game up, it would be that the devs tried making a game that people would want to play, rather then making a game people would want to keep playing.This game has a unique look with a monochrome art style that uses red to show points of interest, and if that's not your thing you can switch to full colour or anything inbetween. The game also does very little hand holding as it gives you a few tips of how the game works at the beggining but after that the game expects you to explore and work out everything else by yourself which isnt exactly a bad thing as I enjoyed the game more for it simply letting me work out things on my own.The combat however is just awful, I liked the idea of using a bow to silently take out enemies and how you can use the wind to mask the noise you make but I found this was just a waste of time as enemies can spot you quite easily if your not crouching and the render distance for the red colouring that makes the enemies stand out is rather low. Enemies can only be silently killed so long as you hit them in the head with a bow or melee them, but if the arrow doesnt kill them every enemy for a few hundred miles round will know exacly where you are.The gameplay itself isnt all that bad as you explore the area looking for clues and chests but after the first hour or so you will quickly grow bored of it as you will find that you've experienced everything this game has to offer after about 20 minutes. Run to the marker on your map, collect treasue, kill enemies nearby rinse and repeat. The story is also lackluster with an ending that just left me wondering why the devs even bothered adding it in.Even after all these faults though I found myself enjoying the experience the whole way through even when I knew I was just repeating the same mundane steps the whole way through. If you give the game a chance I'm sure you will enjoy it even though it has many glaring issues.			"

												TL:DR Gameplay: simple, Graphics: quirky Story: It's goooood. Buy the gameIt comes across as a standard First person shooter in a lot of respects, namely melee feels weak sauce and you're only real weapons are ranged. At time of writing I haven't actually finished the game but I still recommend it but that's more for the story and the different take on things.The game is initially set in black and white (and red) but you can put colour in the game if you want. Personally I'm playing in the black and white (And red) because the effect is just so damned cool. I say black and white (and red) for the simple fact of thats what it is. Everything apart from items of interest, namely enemies, are in black and white. The enemies have a flash of red on them which helps them stick out. So far I've been in three seperate large areas which require exploring in two different states fighting spirits, skeletons and conquistadors. Each area has a story to unfold and various items to find to solve them with. The stories themselves unfold nicely and in the first at least sent a little shiver up my spine.The combat is stealth based if you can but you can hold your own in, for lack of a better word, firefight. The searching for goodies is a nice take on a compass where you use your ""ears"" and triangulate yourself towards the place/item/individual.Not wishing to give too much away despite this game being a few months old now I'll leave you to discover that one.All in all I'd recommend this game on the basis of that the company is trying something new and what they've created is both beautiful in design and implementation.

												Not gonna lie, not recommending this game proved to be a hard decision.  I really wanted to like it, and even fooled myself to for a time, a somewhat refreshing look at a stealth-horror-investigation-shooter?  Here are the reasons that made this game was hard to downvote.-Amazing environment-Unique Story-Solid Gameplay-Very Fair PriceNow with a list like that, how could I damn such a game?  Well the combat did prove enjoyable though the enemy variety proved to be fairly bland, not the types or number, just how they had the same behavior and mode of attack.  That along with the give and take story that really demanded finishing.  Once you spend an hour or two in the game, you realize it is rather shallow and becomes a grinding Easter egg hunt, wrought with cheap scares to keep you on your toes until you are upgraded enough that you no longer care to be tactical or stealthy.  Then it’s fast traveling back and forth, as well as revisiting areas you’ve scoured already.  The dialogue proved dreadful as well as many systems that appear mostly hollow, like gifting your red friend things you’ve dug up like an obedient puppy and not much to show for regardless of if she accepts it or not.  The game isn’t spotless either as I have also found myself on more than one occasion being lodged into rocks and walls maneuvering with a borderline useless jump key.  Speaking of environments, I hope you like forests, because that is all you are going to get in this game.  So if you are into a cheap romp through the woods with a passible story where you collect junk kill skeletons and talk to ghosts for 5 hours, feel free go on ahead.  I just can’t, although I can safely say I gave the game the benefit of finishing it at least.			"

												Good for an indie title. But the game could benefit greatly from voiced dialogue. The premise has a lot of potentional that could be realized by a bigger budget.  However, as it exists it is not very engaging. The monsters aren't particularly frightening; the astmosphere isn't particularly chilling. For example, you are an 17th century English explorer and discover that the King's colony is a ghost town. Then you encounter a spirit. Then you enter an Otherworld, which seems to be similar to Silent Hill's Otherworld. There's a Maiden in Red who has amnesia. After seeing all this, you plod along as if it's Sunday at Nottingham. Meh.Edit: Having just looked up the plot, it does seem like an interesting story. But the lesson is no matter how interesting it is you must get there first. I'm not going to spoil the plot, but basically it is FEAR with muskets and bows, and instead of a fictional government agency you are an English explorer.As to what is scary, FEAR was scary when it came out. Most recently there is Layers of Fear. The latter doesn't involve any firearms and is basically a walking simulator, but when it comes to that crawling sensation, it's top-notch. Though there were definitely a few sequences in that game where I wished I had a knife or something. Sending a man unarmed into a haunted mansion is not cool.			"

I like when videogames take me on a journey, rather than plopping me into the middle of a storyline and expect me to figure it out with seemingly no indication of setting on why i am a role in this story, its very alienating. Its a very nice concept and the atmoshere is great. I would recommend this to someone who is looking for a vague storyline with creepy overtones and enemies that hunt you down with no hesitation.

												This is a bit of a tough one seeing as I know some won't enjoy this style of game. Betrayer is a mystery solving, partially open world adventure game with FPS and horror elements. It takes place in the early 1600's right after the North American New World begins to be settled by European Powers.To start off, those looking for an all action FPS single-player game may be disappointed to find the action here is a lot slower then you may like because of authenticity to the era. Combat makes up roughly ~40% of the game, solving mysteries and the main story makes up another ~40% and the final ~20% goes to free-roaming adventure, finding chests, places to dig, etc...The games high points are the environment and atmosphere are which both unique in usage and awesome for keeping true to the time period. The story progression is smooth and interesting (provided you read the text) and the difficulty in combat ramps up fairly as new enemies and weapons are introduced. Though some find the game to be repetitive, each area had enough to explore and complete to keep me occupied and remain interested throughout. Overall, I recommend this game for those seeking a unique experience filled with murder and mystery.Optional: If you are an achievement hunter most of the achievements are easy enough to be done without the use of guides (as long as you pick up everything and complete the whole story) although you will certainly need a 2nd play-through to grind enough enemies for the killing achievements (I farmed the Fort Hope conquistador part for kills but there are other spots too).

												So, you're a dude who gets wrecked by the Spanish, then manhandled by the Spanish, then manhandled by Ghosts, burning Native Americans and skeletons. And it's wicked scary.Gameplay is akin to shooters, so if you're a fan, it's great. And the fact that you have to deal with the fact that it's weaponry from the 1600's is EXTRA GREAT.Setting is pretty awesome. Too little New World 1600's colonial horror is done nowadays. If you want a good movie to pair with this, Vallahala Rising and the Witch.Story is grisly, as to be expected with horror. Lots of burnings, rapes, witch huntings, murder and in general tomfollery for you to find out about. THE ENDING THOUGH WILL LEAVE YOU WITH A BAD TASTE IN YOUR MOUTH. So yes. Buy it. Play it. Enjoy headshooting floating skull/fly swarm demons. Those are the best.			"

												An amazing game that immerses you into a world where the only color is red.Just kidding, you can change it to full color anytime in the options. Very fun and easy to learn, it has a survival feel. Just, when you ring the bell, you realise this is a scary mother ♥♥♥♥ing game. And yeah, beautiful at the same time.			"

												Just good... not very good.I would still recommend it for its unique features, timeline and atmosphere.But the lack voice acting (none), NPC (one... alive) and wild life makes it empty.Every objectives can be highlighted on the map which makes your exploration near zero.It would have been nice to be attracted by something unusual on the map, then find a clue... by yourself.If you don't use the map, you'll need 100 hours to finish the game.In terms of myth, devs, when you talk about death and ghosts, you have to go under the ground but here again, no indoors, no underground, no caves...I'm curious to see your next game.

												Awesome game. Some of the enemies have a cone of sight that's way too large and the 100% backtracking is a little bit too much and a little bit annoying. But, the combat is very satisfying, the artstyle is beautiful, the weapons are real fun and punishing- it's a colonial-era stealth game with a lot of nuances. Very unique, a little groan-worthy, but really fun.			"

												Good little game at the right price ($5), and even better if you catch it on sale like I did (99 cents!).  This is a nice horror survival mystery game.  The graphics are unique, the soundtrack is eerie and compelling, the story is pretty good if you take the time to emerse yourself into it.  Overall a thumbs up!

												StoryYou strand with a ship on some Island during the times of colonisation, but something is wrong with the Spanish soldiers stationed there and all the inhabitants are dead. The only friendly person is the maid in red, who cannot remember her past and in some mysterious dark side of the world, skeletons and ghosts are haunting the Island. Can you escape the Island? The story is mostly told by Ghosts and Notes, though nobody in the game is voiced, meaning that you will have to read a lot. Though the story seems very deep and is, I did not really follow it, because of the reading close until the end and do not feel like I missed anything between start to finish. GameplayIn first person you run around and try to progress while fighting the mysterious creatures. You have a weapon arsenal of bows, crossbows, pistols, rifles and Tomahawks, which all have their advantages and disadvantages; though the tomahawk is in my opinion not balanced and the best (one shots nearly everything). Whenever you find a bell in the area you can use it to enter the dark world where there are different enemies, but also ghosts of the dead that might be able to give you important information. Sadly, you can simply use your listening ability to hear where the next objective is. This makes thinking unnecessary and you might just run from a to b like a dummy just to do the same thing in the next stage of the game again.GraphicsThe graphics make this game so unique. The world around you is only black, white, black and red which give the game such a sad or depressed filter. At first I thought it was great, but after several hours you do not want to be in that world doing the same stuff over and over.It really is a good game and I sometimes did enjoy playing it, but the repetitive gameplay and the sad world can bring you down. I personally did not enjoy it most of the time, but I can understand the people that do. At some point I only continued so that the game would be over sooner, so If someone says he wants the game and thinks it is cool, buy it, 5€ is no big deal, especially during sales, but I thought so as well at first, so do not have to high expectations, because I at the end cannot recommend it for the fun I had playing it.

												I would really like to like this game, however, i can't.Let me pick apart the gameplay featured and the problems associated with it.Stealth is atrocious and flat and more or less always ends in you pulling all surrounding enemys and then having top perform a action shooter like dance with weapons that arent meant for this at all. It doesn't help that apparently the worse bows have to seem a spread (?, that is not how bows work) that make hitting enemys stealthily in the head a russian roulette.Shootinghas no impact, although it should be different with the weapons choosen by the designers. But together with the laserfocused and telepathic AI, what is most likely suppossed to invoke combat like that from the movie The Patriot instead becomes a disgracefull jump and run.Exploration and Storyis empty. The world is empty and barren and you have to explore everything twice because you also need to do it in the shadow- or otherworld. The Story is rather intriguing, however since you have to scour the world twice with the above mentioned problems come to bare and make trying to unravel the story a chore.Would i recommend it.Not really, especially if you can grab Skyrim wich makes all these things above far better. Yeees, i know, it is an indiegame thing however at the end of the day you have to compare and especialy Skyrim and to the current prize you can get it, especially during sales, offers far more and in better quality.And that is before modding.However, i would argue if you are still interested youn wont really loose anything by that prize or even when it is at sale.

												Overall, Betrayer has a few issues, but it is well worth playing through even so, and certainly worth its low price point.+Great theme and tone, the environment is nicely eerie and the enemies are legitimately frightening.+The game world is unique and the locations are memorable; I found myself beginning to recognize different interesting parts of the forest.+Nice selection of weapons with distinct advantages and disadvantages.+Interesting, well-written dialogue and story.+Just right in terms of difficulty, not too easy or difficult.+Adjusting the color saturation after your first playthrough makes the game feel completely different on subsequent plays, which is fun.-The stealth is is very hit-and-miss, which is especially problematic at the beginning of the game when you need to use it the most (i.e., before you start finding the more powerful weapons).-Using a gamepad makes some of the menus and map screen really difficult and unintuitive to use.  If, like me, you're a weirdo who likes using a controller for these kind of games, you'll quickly end up grabbing the mouse for using the maps at the very least. -There is at least one item that can be permanently missed out on if you don't choose the exact right dialogue options/use a walkthrough.  This probably isn't a huge issue for most people, but it irks me.-The ""thief"" enemies are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and catching them all is incredibly tedious.			"

												I personally did not like this game for the sake of its vagueness and no clear direction in the story. I like when videogames take me on a journey, rather than plopping me into the middle of a storyline and expect me to figure it out with seemingly no indication of setting on why i am a role in this story, its very alienating. Its a very nice concept and the atmoshere is great. I would recommend this to someone who is looking for a vague storyline with creepy overtones and enemies that hunt you down with no hesitation. It just wasn't my cup of tea.			"

												Relatively short, Betrayer is still quite an experience. In a setup not that often explored in the FPS genre (colonial era in the US, with a very horrific tone), it is one of these games that knows how to build and maintain an atmosphere, especially when you play it the way they encourage you to do, which is in black & white & red. The absence of color (save for the red) makes it difficult to find your marks, and keeps your constantly on your guard, in a very unsettling environment.I can only recommend this game if you're looking for a different experience, something uncommon.

												1/31/2017 UPDATE : After almost two years of ignoring this game i decided to give it a try again and it looks like they fixed most all of the bugs ! the game is now playable and i am really enjoying it so far !I am sorry to say that this game is just too much trouble for what it's worth. Even at the low price of 4.99 its just too much trouble for me to have to constantly re-install, re-run, and find all the files that constantly seem to be ""missing"" crashes are annoying as well especially when i am emerced in the game and it suddenly freezes. I have had these issues on not one, not two, but THREE seprate computers now all with Specs that can run the game. I am sorry to say that i requested a refund. I expect more from a legendary studio Like black powder concidering they are comprised of people who have worked on other notable PC classics. I think I could have really enjoyed this game and was willing to put down the cash but frequent crashes and re-installs just don't make it worth my time to fix and fiddle with every little component when all i want to do is enjoy the emersive story and enviornment. I could'nt even get past getting my Bow before the game crashes and that is a shame.  I treid everything the community and multiple disscussion boards had to offer to fix my problems with no luck. Here's a tip for Black Powder,If you wan't a consumer to buy you're product you should make sure it works. People dont want to buy a broken product.I am sadly requesting a refund. and I might just Torrent the game instead when it is in a more stable and playable state.I would have loved to back this project but again, I spent more time trying to get it to run than i did actually playing what was an enjoyable game.:(			"

												Good atmosphere, interesting use of colour and lack of colour.  There is a colour saturation slider, you can play in black and white with greys and red as your only ""colour"", or anything between that and full, bright and vibrant colours.Unique day/night cycle.  I can't say more, you just have to trust me on this one.Lots of stories unfold during the game.  Again, I can't say more without risk of ruining it.Fights are often challenging, even later in the game when gear has been improved.  Some surprises pop up now and again.  The game's set back when black powder weapons were getting a bit better, but armour was still in use as were bows and crossbows.  Your melee weapon never changes, but you can use several kinds of bows, firearms and crossbows.  Most use different ammo, so it's worth mixing and matching so you can maximize your ammunition.Stealth - it works.  Use it.  Or not, but be ready for a mob of enemies if you start a fight in the wrong place.  Woe to those who are unprepared.  The wind can mask your movement, and crouching keeps you low and quiet.The combat's not perfect, but it's fairly good.  Score a good long-range headshot with a bow on a nasty opponent and drop him without giving away your position, if the shot hits true and does enough damage.  It may not - there's a ricochet mechainc, as in certain weapons have a chance to bounce off anything that has armour.  Some weapons bounce a lot, some never.  You've got lots of options for weapons, and trinkets that boost your health, speed, reload speed, stealth, and a few other things but you're limited to 3 equipped so you have to tailor them to your play style.  No levels, or stats, but improved gear makes a big difference.Guns make noise.  Expect enemies to come running if they're fairly close when you fire.  Enemies can alert other enemies, too... so if you don't finish them off fast anyone in earshot might come running to their aid.Anyway, just for the atmosphere this one's worth it.  A pretty solid 8/10.  Get this one on sale, or not, and you might be glad you did.*** EDIT ***Just finished it, the sound is what sticks with me the most.  The sound is such a huge part of the game.  Turn it up and really listen.On a small down side - too much running around near the end.  Turns into a walking simulator with a few fights thrown in.  Okay, more than a few.  But they're mostly too easy at this stage.  If the game was much longer, I'd have likely lost interest due to all the walking and re-visiting locations.  I think they got the length of the game about right given the content and story.Weapon balance - maybe needs some tweaking as to when you find the unique weapons, and maybe there are a few too many of them.  It feels like you're using junk for about the first half, but once you start finding the good weapons the combat gets way, way easier.  I'd like to see the items rebalanced a bit, and doled out at a different pace - a bit slower and spread out a bit more.  I found a very powerful weapon way too early and it really made one-one-one fights a joke from that point on.  One shot every time execpt for the large Conquistadors and the toughest Skulls.It felt like your character gets just a bit too good near the end, even the bigger fights near the end feel like they aren't very tough - and I only threw explosives once but I didn't need to.  I guess it's because of the healing mechanic - you can drink all four shots quickly and they work instantly.  You still have to be somewhat careful, but the early to mid-game was more challenging.  I guess I'm saying it could use a bit of a re-balance, but only a little.  It's not bad enough that it *needs* to be changed, it simply could be and I think it would make the game even better.Worth every cent, though.  Thanks Steam Sales. :)			"

												An absolutely incredible experience. If you enjoy horror and/or survival FPS games, then this title is certainly for you!The ""bell world"" completely gives me the creeps, but in a good way. The conquistadores actually pose somewhat of a challenge in groups of many.The stealth elements of the game are working flawlessly and the crossbow makes for an amazing stealthy weapon (killed an army of 5 conquistadores with it and none of them batted an eye in the meantime).This unique game gets a 10/10 from me.

												I paid 99 cents for this game, and for that sale price it is utterly amazing. This game is certainly worth the five dollar full price tag. The landscape is beautiful, particularly in color, and the enemies are unique and excellently programmed. On the hardest difficulty setting the enemies are very alert and will relentlessly pursue you once they see you with an intelligence that is rare for most games. The story is presented in an interesting way and the setting is very immersive. Though I have yet to beat the game at the time of writing this, in the hour and a half that I've played I feel that I've already gotten more than my money's worth.			"

												It's got a really unique visual style, uncommon setting and respectable sound design for a game I bought for 1$ It actually manages to build a convincing atmosphere for the first segment or so. It's a nice testament to being able to have an artistic edge while still very much being a traditional game instead of some walking simulator.That being said, I got it for 1$, so don't go in expecting something that will keep you gripped. The combat loses it's lustre pretty quickly and you quickly wind up wandering around aimlessly looking for something to do- you don't need to handhold the player per say but on an open island as big and frankly kinda empty as this, it honestly would have benefitted from a bit more of a linear design.6/10 it's one fricking dollar, tiny price to pay to explore a unique, if not flawed, indie piece.

												This is a spooky game where you have to unravel a mystery at the coast of America round 1600. The game is mostly investigating and a bit shooting. Highly recommended due to the fantastic atmosphere. Be aware that the game is standard in black and white which adds to the atmosphere though you can turn the colors on.			"

												Pretty good for the price, somewhere between a looter-shooter and a ""proper"" RPG. Story is pretty compelling, if somewhat unoriginal.			"

												Got this on a steam sale, best dollar I've ever spent in my life.  Beats many $60 games by a longshot.  This actually has a story, challenging while also being fair, and it actually feels like a real mystery.			"

												I had fun playing this game, especially once I learned the mechanics.I recommend you to play it without using the map, or at least hide all clues, chests, etc from the map. Just use X to listen and explore. It is fun... and spooky. At least in the beginning can be quite spooky.			"

												I find "" Betrayer"" a very unique game in it's own right with the black & white concept & how the game  is loosely based around  story around  the Roanoke Colony incident with a paranormal theme with it's story to tell in the game's open world. However, despite the game being unique, it becomes very boring early- Mid way through and here's why.Open World- Despite being based around North Carolina's Roanoke Colony the game lacks Wildlife, Beasts, and the monsters in the game are very view. Some the areas in the open world looks very much the same and the dark world( when you ring the bell) is very bland and holds true to the ""darkness"" theme. Enemies, living wildlife & undead wildlife is lacking un both worlds. Also with being an open world, you collect many items which are pretty much the same and non rewarding at all. Enemies,Combat, & Stealth. The game claims to be a stealth which it at first yet when you get weapons espcially the crossbow, it's pretty much easy, fighting large groups on the hardest difficulty is laughable as I could simply kite and drunken man dance ( A-D spam). The only enemies that hold any challnges are of course the Native Americans yet they're too easy to kill. The rest of the enemies are simply a joke.Collecting Everything- Provides no benefits what so ever beside achievements and a few stronger weapons. Plus, the collection process was mostly the same for everything. Run here, collect this, no puzzles, very few monster ambushes, nothing too special!Weapons, Items, and the shop- Was the most bland shop I ever laid eyes on in any video game. the lack of items to buy and how bland the items themselves were, was... blah!I only recommend this game due it being unique despite it's flaw and having it's own interesting yet not engaging story to tell. This game to me is like reading an interesting book and all it's good for is one simple read to remember the story and be done with it.			"
