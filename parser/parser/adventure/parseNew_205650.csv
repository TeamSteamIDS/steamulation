AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: The Testament of Sherlock Holmes Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: Adventure; Point & Click; Puzzle; Detective; Casual My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 10-18 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Casual gamers REVIEWThe Testament of Sherlock Holmes is a very pleasantly surprising puzzle game, with a high standard of quality and a humorous undertone.  Any fans of the puzzler-adventure genre should easily find this game enjoyable. Once you start playing you will likely find yourself engrossed by the experience.It has a much thicker, richer story aspect than many other puzzler-adventure games out there. I was truly entertained by the narrative throughout my entire playthrough. The interesting plot goes a long way to elevate this game above the standard. Furthermore, I thought the graphics were nice and the voice acting was solid, which reinforces the high quality of the writing. The end result is a very enjoyable game with an excellent presentation.This inherent quality in the writing, atmosphere, and overall presentation results in a game which feels much more true to the Sherlock Holmes brand than the other couple of games I have played that were franchised the intellectual property.  The others feel like standard adventure games with the words ""Sherlock Holmes"" on the title. This game, to me, really felt like what I believe a Sherlock Holmes game should feel like. The puzzles were very challenging and quite fun; though to be honest I lost patience and had to seek assistance once or twice because of how tricky some of them were. Some of the puzzles are doubly complicated because the objective of the puzzle isn’t always made clear. So first you have to figure out what you are trying to do, and then you have to actually do it. This does add an extra layer of challenge, but it also can be a bit jarring.And lastly, something I thought was a pretty cool feature is the fact that you can choose to move around in 1st or 3rd person, or play in classic point-and-click adventure style. Having this freedom sounds trivial, but it is really nice to be able to tailor the style on a whim as you play through the campaign.In summary, The Testament of Sherlock Holmes is a pretty sweet ride. It should appeal to both fans of the game genre and fans of the Sherlock Holmes IP. Give it some consideration if it sounds up your alley.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

Short reviewGraphics & sound are good, especially for an adventure game where you usually don't expect much. ""Hunt the pixel"" is mostly avoided, though you may have to seek around a bit sometimes. There's brilliant moments where you actually feel like Sherlock Holmes when you're deducting the true circumstances of a crime, but those are outnumbered by dodgy moments where you're confronted with unconnected puzzles that really have no reason to be there. Fortunately all such puzzles are skippable, so you won't get frustrated. The story is interesting enough to motivate and feels like classic Holmes, with a twist at the end that may not be everyone's cup of tea but is certainly original.Snap this up when it's on sale, especially if you're a Holmes fan. It feels slightly overpriced at full ($20 at the time of writing).Long reviewThe Testament of Sherlock Holmes is the latest installment (as of writing) in a series that I haven't played. No knowledge of events in the previous games is required, fortunately; there's some allusions but you don't need to know anything about them to play this one. Your very first investigation serves as a tutorial on the controls, and you can simply go from there. This game does not rely on you carefully scanning every inch of the screen with your mouse until you've found the hotspot; you don't have to do more than get close enough and you will get clear indications of what can be investigated. At the same time, this is not so obvious that it takes all the fun out of exploring, and sometimes you do have to backtrack carefully to see what you've missed.For an adventure game in particular, the graphics are good. You won't fall out of your chair in amazement, but character models and environments are all well done and fit the atmosphere of the story. The soundtrack does its job, in that you hardly notice it's there, except for one notably bad case of it playing with an intensity that the situation doesn't warrant -- things only start to happen in that location later, yet the soundtrack is ominous and frantic right from the start. The voice acting for both Holmes and Watson is excellent and the characters come across just right. The other characters are mostly believable, with two notable exceptions: one character who is required to pass for another with a British accent has a painfully obvious faux German accent that shouldn't have fooled anyone, and the actor voicing the main villain sounds like he's taking his cues from cartoons, with the only thing missing being an evil laugh. Both of these break immersion quite badly and mess up what is otherwise fine voice acting.Enough about the window dressing, let's get to the gameplay. Here we get to both the game's best and worst parts. As in all adventure games, you walk around, gathering information and objects, and occasionally apply one object to another. Especially commendable in this regard is that when you do have to combine objects, this makes sense and is easy to do (like combining pieces of rope to make a longer piece of rope) -- sounds obvious, but there are many adventure games where you have to combine unlikely objects in bizarre ways to solve puzzles in the most roundabout way possible. You won't find such puzzles here -- whenever you need to overcome obstacles by combining objects it feels perfectly natural.Unfortunately, what you will find are puzzles that are generic brain teasers (like matching colored balls in some interesting sense or rotating tiles) that have no believable connection to the story and are just there to make you stop and solve them. To the game's great credit, all of these puzzles are skippable after some time has passed, because it would feel really frustrating to *have* to solve them if you didn't want to, or couldn't. Some can be solved by trial and error, some are impossible to do that way, but almost all of them feel like they don't belong in the game and they don't fit in with the narrative. Apparently everybody in Victorian England used intricate locks that can nevertheless be opened without outside help to safeguard their valuables, instead of, you know, keys. The lowest point for me was a series of puzzles in an elementary school that really break immersion by their sheer contrivedness and lack of justification for solving them at all (rather than simply forcing the issue). Elementary, dear player? Hardly.If those were the only puzzles, I couldn't really recommend this game, but it redeems itself with the deduction puzzles. The game's best moments come when you actually get to feel like you're solving crime like the great detective himself, carefully observing for clues and piecing them together in a logical whole using ""deduction boards"", where you choose from several logical (and less logical) alternatives until both the clues and your deductions line up. Solving these puzzles with a minimum of guessing rewards you with the feeling that you're Holmes himself, coming to seemingly impossible conclusions by eliminating the actually impossible. Even the ""chemical analysis"" puzzles, which are not really about deduction but about memorizing colored blobs, tie in with the overall atmosphere of crime-solving. The game could have elevated itself considerably if it had more of this and less of the arbitrary puzzles -- in fact, if they ever make another installment, I'd strongly recommend that they only do these deduction puzzles and no more of the mechanical ones. As it is, there are only three or four in the game, with the regular puzzles padding out most of the playtime.The story is the other selling point of the game. The flavor is excellent, and when it works, it's worthy of anything Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has written, with both the mundane and slightly fantastical/unbelievable elements mixed together in a familiar way. The characterization is fine -- Holmes has his dry quips and stoic determination, while Watson is there to reign in his friend's unique brand of callousness where it's warranted, without coming off as a dunce (a common sin in other adaptations). There's nothing original here (except for the end, which we'll get to in a bit) and you've seen most of these elements before in other Holmes stories, but it's all well put together, with the exposition scene where Holmes recaps what's really happened for Watson before the final showdown being especially memorable. It doesn't quite exceed its source material, but it's a valiant effort nonetheless.There's a twist at the end that might leave opinions divided on whether it's of benefit to the story (or whether it should be there at all), but I liked it. After all, this is only one of many stories told of Holmes, and if you don't like what this one's selling, you can always ignore it, but I thought it was a charming idea that I hadn't seen before. Not everything is wrapped up in a neat little bow and there are one or two spots that I'd consider plot holes, but I found myself intrigued and entertained. Overall the level is more ""penny dreadful"" than Shakespeare, but then, that fits the Victorian era nicely.Bottom line: this is a strong recommendation if you're a fan of Sherlock Holmes as he appears in the Doyle stories. If you're just an adventure game aficionado in general, be warned that this contains some pure puzzles which have little or nothing to do with adventuring, and the remainder is probably not going to challenge you a lot. In either case, at the $20 that is its current asking price it's probably slightly disappointing, but this would be a good one to pick up on a sale.			"

												Great adventure game! Maybe the best in the series. It has some minor flaws like no lip-sync,poor optimization in the sewers and awkard controls but the story, puzzles and overall gameplay compensate for them. I managed to finish it in 12 hours but with some help at the harder puzzles. It's a game that every adventure enthusiast should play.			"

												I have never read a Sherlock Holmes novel, so I can't really tell you if this game sticks close to its source material.  Fortunately the only thing you need to know before playing is that Mr. Holmes is some kind of old timey super detective (And i'm pretty sure we have all deduced at least that much by now).This game was actually a lot of fun.  My favorite part was the ""deduction tables"", where you use the gathered clues to put two and two together and you try to solve the crime.  The puzzles were also fun for the most part.  I say for the most part, because there are a couple that made me smash the keyboard over my head once or twice.  Seriously, If you are a masochist like me, who doesnt like to use walkthru's, you will find some of the puzzles super difficult.  But hey, that's also part of the fun.I found the story to be very well written.  The twist that comes near the end was unexpected and really made me want to finish the game to see how it all plays out.			"

												I just finished this game and have to say overall it is at least tied for my favorite SH game, the other being vs Jack the Ripper. It may just be my favorite. The graphics are an improvement over most of the SH games  and overall the voice acting is very good.  I loved most of the puzzles as well, it was a good mix this time, unlike Nemesis which mostly had math puzzles. The story was very good and kept me guessing as to what was actually going on.  The scenes in the game were all very good, each location had a good feel and there were no tedious travels with having to go back and forth between several places in a single scene (Nemesis got very tedious). I managed to get all the achievements as well, in 22 hours of play time (of which 6 hrs were probably idle/afk time for me. If you like mystery games this one is highly recommended!			"

												I'll get straight to the point:The story is AMAZING! A very complex and well written one that makes you want to know every detail and spend a lot of time to pull things together to find the truth behing the dark side of sherlock holmes himself.The Puzzles are fantastic! They will challenge your logic and test you IQ! :PThe only problem lies in the gameplay. or better say, in the controls which is a little annoying but you'll get used to it as you progress through the game.The Testament of Sherlock Holmes is A unique game in the adventure genre and if you are a fan of this famous detective, then you should try it for SURE.

												This game was quite disappointing. Despite being a detective game, there is very little actual investigations - the game turns into a simple point and click adventure game pretty quickly. While that is done quite well, and the puzzles themselves are quite good, albeit quite standard for the most part, the narrative structure of a Sherlock Holmes novel just fits terribly. As a game, you expect to be able to influence events as you come across them, not have Sherlock Holmes solve them behind the scenes and present the results afterwards - when you PLAY as him. As a player, I would have liked to be the one to logically think up the clever plots and put them in motion, not switch to Watson and be forced to ignore evidence available to let the plot move along. As a mystery game, this fails spectacularly... which is surprising considering that this game is quite well made - with the exception of some of the worst animations I've seen in a long time.			"

												There are perhaps more flaws to this game than it can get away with. However, the areas in which it excels are the most important aspects of a puzzle game such as this, so I'm inclined to give this a thumbs up overall. Bear in mind though, that this game is probably not everyone's cup of tea, depending on how sensitive you are to annoying details and minor flaws.Pros:- The plot is surprising and genuinely intriguing, and keeps you wanting to find out where your next clue leads you.- The puzzles are sufficiently varied and well-made, and not too easy to solve.- The atmosphere fits the game and the story perfectly, including some very good voice-work.Cons:- While the plot is great, it also contains quite a few loose ends and logical shortcomings. Some of the deductions of Mr. Holmes are so far-fetched you've got to wonder if he's high.- Some of the puzzles are overly difficult, and most of them has only rudimentary instructions which are of very little help as to what you're actually supposed to do.- The gameplay is as linear as it gets, and consequently the game has absolutely zero replay-value.- Animations and lip-sync are far below par. There is also weirdly little visual difference between gameplay and cinematics, which makes you wonder why they bothered.- Considering the low-level graphics and effects, the game still manages to take up nearly 10 GB of space.- Running is only marginally faster than walking, which makes some sections fairly tedious.5/10			"

												This is a must have if you really like puzzle games with decent graphic as well. The puzzles in this game are actually hard to solve and I found myself get stuck for a long time in some of them and when I succeded it felt great! They have really captured Sherlock holmes personality as well as Watsons and that makes the game very believable though the only thing that disturbs me a bit is the story itself. I didn't like the story or should I say investigation that much because it didn't blow me away when I figured out what was really going on and that is what investigations Sherlock Holmes is involved in normally does to you, it blows you away with the ""Ahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.."". So with that said it could have a more interesting story but I haft to mention that I actually wanted to know what was going on like the detective I was in the game so I guess the story was interesting enough to wanna figure out. I really recommend this game if you want to have a real challenge and feel proud when playing, that is what you will feel when you solve every puzzle. Good luck!/Sow			"

												Nice enough adventure game that can be played in first person, with good gamepad controls if one desires a Big Picture couch game. Nothing genre-shattering but entertaining enough that I felt like finishing it and wasn't bored at any point. Graphics-wise it's nice enough, maybe the lack of lipsync and mostly dull voice acting were the only annoyances. Puzzles weren't too nasty since I ended consulting help only with one of them. The hotspot-spotting ""sixth sense"" ability mostly eliminates pixel hunting situations. The plot was more than just a whodunit and Holmes was suitably rude, it felt like it had taken influences from the BBC modern version.			"

												I really enjoyed playing this game. It's intriguing; the story is good, and keeps you hooked 'til the end, wandering what's about to happen. + Graphics: the characters and enviornement are detailed, beautifuly executed and has managed to capture London in its late 1800. The stunning visuals accompanied by a really good sountrack make you feel like the ""real"" Sherlock Holmes. + Gameplay: I just loved the game's mechanics. You can easily switch from the classical point and click game to a third or first person adventrue without any issues. Just depends on how you like to play this one. The puzzles are fun, and logical; the quest for clues search is great; the best feature of the game is the Deduction Board system that makes you understand the motiv of the crime, its consequences and motives behind it. + Story: What starts with a simple necklase theft soon turns into a dramatic, somehow gruesome story. I loved this really dark themed tale from the beginning 'til the end. I also enjoyed the dialogues spiced with some British dark humor.Bottom line: Expect a surprising story, challenging, yet fun puzzle games, and wrap your head around the case to fill in the deduction board.

												This would be a great Sherlock Holmes game if it actually tried to be a Sherlock Holmes game.What I mean is, it starts off really well, and has two investigations that are very interesting, and very much in the vein of what I expect a Sherlock Holmes game to be. You explore a crime scene, noticing very little details about it, and piece them together in a 'deduction board,' an invention of a game which serves to gamify Holmes' famous deductive reasoning. It does a pretty good job of it, too! I also really liked the ONE scene where you analyze evidence you gathered in the crime scene, as there were quite a few clever minigames that I had fun going through.The problem being, basically the entire game after that, save for two further, and much smaller, investigations, is literally just a mediocre puzzle adventure game, with a bunch of stupid 'find item -> use item' puzzles, and with far more puzzle boxes than I think should have existed in the late 19th Century? Normally, I wouldn't mind this...but I don't play a game in the Sherlock Holmes universe to go through puzzles that could be in ANY game. I play a Sherlock Holmes game so I can BE Sherlock Holmes, exploring crime scenes and solving them in a way only he could. And you don't even have the excuse there's so little you can do with that, because just look at all the cases in the public domain stories. There's SO many ways to adapt and expand them without ever resorting to stupid puzzle♥♥♥♥♥♥that even Sierra was doing back in the 80s.That being said, I do like the voice work of Holmes and Watson, especially Holmes. And the environments are pretty well done, especially for a lower-budget game like this. I wish the engine was a little better, as controlling Holmes and Watson felt like trying to drive a drunken tank at times, but it didn't hamper my experience of the game too much. Though, there WAS a bit too much backtracking, and, yeah, the scene with the dog was completely pointless.As for the story...it started out pretty well, and then went to♥♥♥♥♥♥at the end. Minor spoilers from here on out.So Moriarty's in the game, because apparently you just have to use Moriarty as much as you can, despite there being perfectly fine villains in the mythos. I understand this is part of a series, and he would be suited for 'Holmes' darkest case yet,' but he basically just shows up at the end with little fanfare, and he's just this utterly-generic 'evil for the sake of evil' villain, not at all the criminal mastermind and equal to Holmes he should be. What buildup there is was fine, but his appearance was completely underwhelming.Not to mention, the final twist at the very end, once Moriarty's dealt with. I actually would have REALLY liked that, and thought it would be a great way to take Holmes as a character...except it's literally JUST introduced seconds before the credits roll. We're given no development, no buildup, it's just a way to cheaply garner audience sympathy right at the very end. It almost comes across as a deus-ex-machina, if it had ANY bearing on the plot. Moriarty doesn't even mention it until he's [SPOILERS] and uses it as his motivation in basically two words.I would have loved it if we kept meeting Moriarty as the game went on, and he kept hinting about it, and he kept saying he had a reason for his crimes this time around, and it kept us in the dark and serves as a primary motivation to his character, rather than he's just doing it because he's evil.This game could have used much better writing in general. For being called one of the best Sherlock Holmes games up to now, it's surprisingly amateurish. I just can't give it a recommendation, even though it has just enough of the Holmesian spirit to get me wanting more. If you want to buy it, buy it in a sale when it's 75% off, because I don't think it's worth much more than $5-10.I really hope the next game, Crime and Punishment, will actually satisfy me. I DO have The Awakening, so maybe that will, too.			"

												Being a fan of the TV show 'Sherlock', I had to play this game. This is my first Sherlock Holmes game and I was pleasantly surprised. The Testament of Sherlock Holmes is a point-and-click adventure game where you play as Sherlock (and Watson) trying to resolve the murder of a Reverend in his own church. I won't say more about the story since the main reason of playing this game is to discover that.The gameplay is faily simple. Where you can interact, there is either a magnifying glass to look at some items or a hand to show that you can take the item or that you can interact with it. That's it. Most of the time, you'll have to look through everything to be sure that you didn't miss any important clue. The rooms are small enough so it's really easy to find everything.Also, as a detective, there is a deduction board. You'll have to discover every clues to see statements about them. With these facts, it's up to you to choose between 3 answers which one is the right one about what happened in this case. There are multiple questions to be answered and you won't know if you're right until you have all the right answers. It can be hard but if you pay attention to the story, it will be fairly easy. There is also a lot of puzzles in this game. Some are logic and really easy once you understand how they work but some of the puzzles that does NOT involve any deduction/logic can be really hard and frustrating for some people. There is a skip buttons after some minutes so don't worry !One of the problem in this game is that it's too linear for a detective game. There is no real choice to be made and even if you choose to go to a location instead of another, you'll end up going to both places without any change.The story is really interesting and there are a lot of twists (I found it similar to the TV show and it's a good thing). The problem (because it's a videogame !) is that Sherock is not as funny as Cumberbatch's Sherlock (but it's understandable since there is no actor involved). In conclusion, if you like point-and-click games, you'll like this one. It will definitely entertain you for hours ! (I finished the game in about 7-8 hours)			"

												Minor technical issues aside, this game was amazing. While I haven't played any of the other Sherlock games yet, so I don't have a benchmark to compare it to, I very much enjoyed the storyline and multiple mind-blowing plot twists, the varied puzzles and leaps of deduction, voice acting and the various personalities of the characters, and the occasional moments of poignancy, introspection and humour.Progression was occasionally blocked because it wasn't obvious there was something up in a tree to click on or that you could ascend a stage using boxes, and I'd wander around for an hour being puzzled, but otherwise it was smooth and flowed well.Also, creepy kids!

												I think the 73 Metascore this time is right, TToSH is a good adventure game but I don't think good enough to reach a full 8 mark. Why? Because opposed to nice graphics and well built environments, some interesting gameplay ideas, three different control interfaces and a lengthy story, the player has to deal with rather inexpressive characters, subpar voice acting and animations, some logical puzzles put there only to extend longevity, a pair of little nasty bugs and an unreal and intricate but never clear story that leaves you powerless and confused even when Sherlock expresses his ingeniuos deductions/intentions.I always loved adventure games, The Case of the Serrated Scalpel from the Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes series back in 1992 is still one of my favorite exponents of the genre, and I think Frogwares are on the right track to build a worthy successor to that perfect mix of realism and atmosphere. Crimes and Punishments is out at the end of the month and I feel good vibrations about it!Recommended to adventure and Sherlock fans, and maybe also to newcomers who would like a not too difficult game to begin their journey from the best game of this developer's prodution.

												I just started playing, but I wanted to write this. I may edit it or replace this later on.Things I love about this game so far:* This is Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, not Robert Downey Jr.'s action hero Sherlock Holmes.* You have to actually use your brain and deduce from your facts. Puzzles tend to be logical.* There are several references to former Sherlock Holmes cases, not only from earlier games, but from the books.* I know action-driven players could get massively bored, but it is just my kind of game.Things I am neutral about:* Perhaps less videos and more little mind games would have been nicer, but it's cool anyways.Things I hate about this game:* When I use the ""point-and-click"" mode, it is not so easy to move around and cover the whole area,  but when I use the ""first-person"" mode, the movements of the ""camera"" get me so dizzy that I end up nauseated after a few minutes. It reminds me of the old Doom game for PC from the early 90's (graphics are way better, though).* Watson, get the F#@k out of my way! LOL (Not the first Sherlock Holmes game where Watson has the annoying habit of standing right in front of Sherlock as you try to walk).			"

This game is mostly about finding clues, looking for items, completing puzzles and talking to other characters.  It's not a point and click game but does have some essence of it.  You can control Sherlock and walk around environments.  Finding clues is easy but the puzzles will really make you think.  If you intend on playing this game fast have a walkthrough on standby.  The game nudges you through a lot of it but the puzzles and how to use items is trial and error.  But what do you expect from a Sherlock game?  It's real fun and I recommend it.  The storyline and cut scenes really kept me interested.  It's like playing a story!Pros:Easy gameplayStorylineVoice actingChallengeGraphics were better than expectedNot boringEasy to complete all achievementsCons:Some challenges or tasks was tough enough to need a walkthrough.  This was a personal matter because I was rushing.			"

												Starts of good but very quickly declines, in terms of story, gameplay, characters.Majority of the puzzles aren't so much as 'logic' puzzles as they are... toy puzzles. Boxes with incredibly silly locks like colour code systems, as if everyone in London protects their belongings with products from Fisher Price.This makes it feel less like a detective game with logical deducations, and more like a series of dull uninspired IQ tests.Many characters feel straight up cartoony and stupid. Apparently Watson can't tell the difference between a London accent and a very thick German accent. The rest just seem stupid, probably on purpose to make Holmes seem all the more brilliant by comparison.Overall, very poor experience. You could do a lot better for this kind of game.			"

The Testament Of Sherlock Holmes			* 8/10This is one of the latest chapters of Frogware's Sherlock Franchise and if I have to describe it briefly with a word or a concept that would be ""Experience"". Experience doesn't mean perfection but seeing how they started (the mistery of the mummy) and all the other titles they went through you can see how all the titles evolved, improved and changed chapter by chapter with good news and new mistakes. Even though The testament of Sherlock Holmes isn't perfect I really consider it a great improvement, a big leap into a new generation of the Sherlock Franchise.The Testament of Sherlock Holmes is a point and click adventure with third person view. Gameplay uses pretty much the usual mechanics, you can observe, use or pickup items according to the icon it displays when you get on it with your cursor, and besides the usual combination of items there are riddles and puzzles and some of the are tough and random. when you're done with the clues of the current section you will be prompted to complete a deduction scheme, where you will link concepts and clues together with deductions (which YOU must choose between a choice of three possibilities). From this point of view this chapter doesn't represent anything particularily new, but it's mostly a very refined and polished verion of what has been already done in the previous chapter, Sherlock Vs The Ripper. The real innovation and leap forward to a new level is represented by three factors, Story, graphics and soundtrack.The story begins with a small section used to explain the gameplay in which Sherlock will quickly solve a case of a stolen necklace. Later they will learn from newspapers that Sherlock is being accused of returning a false necklace. And from here the story is a succession of facts and situations that will lead to a dangerous degeneration of his good name. And I won't say no more because this is a great story with plot twists which represent its best parts.Graphics is a great improvement considering the previous chapters and their remasters. It doesn't surprise much the fact that they employed the Unreal Engine 3 and even though you can't say the result is a true miracle of beauty you can undoubtely see that the results are great and various locations filled with many contour details and even though some animations can be a bit rigid, some situations can be a little buggy and few areas here and there are simply clipped to prevent exploring useless zones, now you see a new type of approach for the narration as it has been paid more attention to camera settings with focus and effects, new expressive animations (even though they're the same ones often repeating they're still new).This chapter's soundtrack is completely new and it's a magnificent set of orchestral pieces that will pleasently accompany you during all your investigations and will also set a more pressing atmosphere when there will be some tense situations. Unfortunately I believe there are few tracks as I heard the same tracks in more situations and sections. I still love them, but I believe a few tracks more could have avoided this feeling.A small note to praise some gameplay sections, especially the ones with Toby (Sherlock's Hound... Yes, you control him... XD) and the ones with Watson, because you will usually need his small help a few times, but there will be entire sections with Watson alone and I've been waiting for this as Watson is not just a mere doctor incapable of any deduction but he really has some skills and in this chapter he will prove that more than once and I'm very glad about this. And one last praise for the credits... Yes the credits. It doesn't make any sense, I know, but I just love that art because the it reminds me a lot about Casinò Royale openings...+++PROs+++ STORY. Clearly the best point of this chapter is the story, very intense, degenerating and involving, but I can't say much because it deserves not to be spoilt. GRAPHICS & ART. A very big leap to the next level thanks to a very good use of the Unreal Engine 3, lots of neat details in various and coloured ambiences, great cutscenes with camera settings and focus effects, new good expressive animations. SOUNDTRACK. A sweet and great score with beautiful orchestral tracks that will pleasently accompany the gameplay with proper tones in the different situations. GAMEPLAY. A very well refined gameplay, based on the previous titles but more polished and accurate. Great and interesting puzzles and riddles and original nice sections with Toby and Watson.---CONs--- MUSIC & ANIMATIONS VARIETY. I personally believe that a few animations and music tracks could have improved the experience because during the game you will notice that songs tend to repeat in various secions and characters move in the same way during speeches. RESTART THE GAME TO APPLY THE SETTINGS. And still nowadays I am forced to restart the game to apply the video settings. Kind of unexpected... "

I bought it on sale, for about 4,99. It's worth even spending 19,99 on it. Fantastic gameplay and amazing puzzels, that actually needs little brain to solve. I recomend this highly too anybody who likes a story oriented puzzle game. 10/10			"

												This game looks and feels solid. It can be frustrating at times when you cant connect the dots but the if you take too long on a puzzle it will give you the choice of skipping it because... you suck. And the game will let you know when you are correct which sounds like cheating but you will be thanking God at times for that little saving grace.The voice acting is also solid but none of the words matches the characters mouth movements.

												This was the best Sherlock Holmes game that I have played so far (Silver Earring, Awakened, Jack the Ripper, Hound of the Baskervilles, Persian Carpet & Mystery of the Mummy), made better for me by the fact that there was an option to skip puzzles, which I haven't experienced so far. Much as I don't like to skip them, sometimes I get so frustrated with puzzles that I don't understand, that it spoils the game for me. There are only 2 reasons why I give this game 9.8 out of 10 instead of 10. One is that I find when I am Sherlock Holmes, Dr Watson always gets in the way by standing directly in front of him. You have to negotiate around him otherwise you keep speaking to him inadvertently. His constant 'what should we do now, Holmes?' is a litte irritating. The other negative is that frequently when you are just walking around the message box showing how to make the character run pops up - if I wanted to make him run, I would! This, I think, is just a little glitch.Overall, story excellent, graphics excellent, game play excellent and I can't wait to play the next one which will be Nemesis.			"

												Casual, easy-medium, point and click, adventure story with puzzles.Very pretty graphics and sound, both ageing well. Nice mix of locations all with good attention to detail. Great story, predictable if you are familiar with Holmes stories, although I was still surprised at one moment and puzzled at another.Follow the clues, interview, collect clues and tools, analyse the evidence, and complete a few puzzles. All of these points are story driven in a linear fashion, but this is fairly well hidden in the faux open world/choice. It appears difficult to fail as correct choices are made obvious. Some of the puzzles were a little tricky, I liked them the most but they can be skipped if you are not going for 100%. My favourite part was taking control of a third character. Recommend not for your 'crayon eaters' but for your more mature still 'spelling rude words on calculators', there is blood and guts, violence and drugs.			"

												Fantastic approach to Sherlock Holmes. Quasi AAA point 'n' click I guess? Kind of a silly frame though (kids unearthing stuff in his house and reading's Watson writings) but, hey, it works. The models are a bit on the uncanny valley side but the puzzles aren't too brutal and it's a great option when you are sick of button mashers and permanent set pieces and QTEs. One to sit back, relax and enjoy. Have a walkthrough at hand if you are not planning to think with the puzzles though!Hope they keep the line and do another game like this, not necessarily Sherlock Holmes. Some noir stuff wouldn't hurt.			"

												TL:DR A point and click crime game that I found surprisingly enjoyable even if its a bit rough around the edgesFull Version:The Testament of Sherock Holmes is a point and click crime adventure. The story begins with Holmes and his sidekick Dr.Watson investigating a murder which soon turns out to be part of a wider plot. I went into this game not really knowing what to expect and ended up pleasantly surprised. Its a pretty good game even though it lacks a bit of polish. The story is pretty good, Sherlock Holmes and Watson are both likeable and the game has pretty good puzzles and investigation. Theres a lot of ""use this item with this thing"" but rather than having ridiculous item combinations , like a lot of other point and click games, this one is quite good for having logical solutions. Even when I picked up an item and first thought ""what the hell will I do with this?"", with more investigation the solution nearly always became clear with a bit of logical thought. It keeps the game flowing nicely without any frustrating sections.There are minor problems like an annoying camera, occasional difficulty moving Holmes around and for some reason interacting with an object would sometimes cause Holmes to walk a few metres away before reacting. Luckily theres no issue bad enough to ruin the game.Good points:- The game has a great story and it kept me involved enough to want to find out what happens next- Good puzzles and solutions that rarely are frustrating or ridiculousBad points:- The game has a few minor bugs and glitches like annoying camera angles and the occasional glitch when interacting with something but nothing major-Some of the voice acting for the minor characters is terrible			"

												What a game!I am a great Sherlock Holmes fan, and this game certainly delivers, to hardcore fans and to a person new to the Sherlock Holmes books, movies and games.The game puts you right in the deep end with some explaining, it turns into a great adventure and you actually start to feel that you are investigating a dark case with the great detecive himself.Occassianly the game does nothing to help you in puzzles and you may find yourself consulting the internet, as I did a few times.The game delivers well, the costumes and detail is excellent but I get some audio sync issues.The Testament of Sherlock Holmes is the perfect game for old and new fans alike. I high recommend it and many hours of fun are expected.8.5/10			"

												Frogwares knows how to make a good adventure game.  That they do it with Sherlock Holmes is awesome.  I like how the puzzles aren't mind numbing and nonsensicle but can actually be solved by mere mortals.  The music kind of reminded me of the composer for that game Gray Matter, both of which were memorable. Great voice acting too.  Could use some optimization work but, whateves put the money in animation and other things I'm fine with that :D  Great Game!9/10			"

												The story begins with a case about stolen necklace. Sherlock holmes and his partner, Dr. Watson success to find and return it to the owner. But in the next day, Sherlock Holmes finds his reputation tarnished in the newspaper by a journalist because the necklace is claimed as fake necklace. Leaving that mystery unsolved, in the next case investigation, Dr. Watson finds that Sherlock Holmes behaviors are strange such as reckless and intimidates witnesses. What happens to Sherlock Holmes? Play this game!Sometimes, you'll find humorous dialogues between Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. The graphic is good. The gameplay is point-and-click action but you can switch to third-person or first-person view. Many puzzles in here either you can solve it or skip it if you want to enjoy the story only. If you're confused finding something, you can use Sixth Sense ability for both characters. When you lack of clue or item to solve something, Sherlock Holmes or Dr. Watson will say it. That makes you realize that you miss an item or a clue solve it. This maybe makes you feel the game is easy, unchallenging or maybe help you out for you who easy to miss something.Last but not least. Do you expecting a slow-mo fight like Robert Downey Jr. did in his movie as Sherlock Holmes?Unfortunately, there isn't any of it.			"

												Playing this game was a fun, but also sometimes boring experience. The PRO:-great story, mystery and plot twist-interesting puzzles-captivating story telling from Dr. Watson's points of view-really enjoyed the ending scene. i rarely look at credits, but this time, it kind of had a mysterious, old london darkish vibeThe CON:-annoying movement mechanism. you just bump around in every room/yard pressing SPACE to look for clues.-somewhat poor graphics, but still, for a game on sale, i can't complain.-not much of an open world. you just have a single path to follow to finish. no decisions, no consequences. -children at the beginning look just awful. when i saw them first, i almost regreted buying the game.-you don't feel like solving a mystery, you just click where the devs want you to. no much option thereOverall, i enjoyed this game as it was quite an interesting and mysterious story. It really kept me going and pondering as to what happens next and how does it all unfold. I hope there will be a sequel with more options and better graphics. If you see this game on sale and enjoy puzzle games, grab it, otherwise keep looking (doesn't look up for the full price)! awesome time passer and mind exercise.			"

												The Testament of Sherlock Holmes is a very fine point-and-click adventure. The game is put together well and the puzzles are sometimes deceptively tricky. The graphics and the user interface are both quite good and the dramatic story is extremely engaging and surprising.The character models are a little stiff and the voice acting for Sherlock Holmes comes off like a doorknob, lacking any type of morals or empathy toward anything or anyone with the sole purpose to admire his own intellect. The game can also feel a little dumbed down at times when Holmes or Watson verbally state exactly what needs to be done.All-in-all, one of the better detective type adventures I have played.			"

After completing the game, I was so exited from the game that I went and searched for more similar games. I got all games available from the Sherlock Holmes series. I even googled the history of these games to follow the right order.Anyway, the point is - this game is really amazing. Beatifull storyline makes your wonder what will  happen next - even when you away from the pc. Its just gets you. You want to play it. You want to know more. With the combination of gameplay and storyline - playing this game is like watching a 3-D movie. You know how they say in cinemas? Don't just watch a movie, be part of it. Well this game does exactly that. Your are part of it when you play. You can't let it go after you get into it. Just amazing, amazing and again, amazing story line. The more you play it, the more you will want to finish it. Simply to know how it all ends.			"

												Reasonably competent game, but with deductions and science that really just don’t make any sense, this game hardly reflects the genius that was Sherlock Holmes. Instead, what you have here is a rather dumb point and click game in which you try the random combinations until one works. Having said that, it is fairly good fun to play, with some interesting puzzles that are not too difficult, and sometimes there are actual deductions! Recommended? Well, considering it’s in the Humble weekly, this week, then yes, sure, why not!			"

												Never really got into the point and click style adventures, but for Holmes I thought I could make an exception. The puzzles can be challenging, but it just makes it all the more satisfying when you finally stumble upon the solution. Decent story which did eventually tie together at the end and pretty graphics. Overall I rather enjoyed myself. A few gripes, the mini games don't explain themselves and you will waste time and patience trying to guess at what they want you to do. Very annoying once you realize you get an achivement only if you complete them all. Also, there were times where I couldn't figure out what the game wanted me to do. I couldn't leave an area until I found some crucial bit of evidence, but was given no indication what it might be. More than once it seemed like I just needed to have the character acknowlege something, even if it didn't seem the least bit relevant. Still enjoyed the game and picked up a few of the others in the series.			"

It's always hard to find a good ""mystery"" game that isn't just a seek-and-find snoozefest, and I enjoyed this game immensely!Controls can be a little frustrating sometimes, but the game is really more about the plot and the investigation than anything else, so it wasn't a huge issue by any means.Get it on sale, because as fun as it is, it just isn't worth $20 - it didn't last very long and there isn't a lot of replay value. Don't let the ""~20 hrs on record"" fool you - most of that is from when I accidently left the game running overnight. You're looking at around 10-13 hours of gameplay, depending on how thorough you are in each map.			"

												The Testament of Sherlock Holmes tells an interesting story, mixed with a bunch of intuitive puzzles and a few clever characters. However, for every upside there's a huge downside, and it's hard to look away from the game's tendency to be both extremely slow-paced and amazingly rigid in the way you actually play. What's worse: The game includes plenty of infuriatingly complicated puzzles, the kinds you need a guide to figure out, lest you're a fan of crazy amounts of trial and error. You'd be better of skipping straight to the far superior sequel, Crimes & Punishments.			"

												Uggh... I love Sherlock Holmes. I have read the stories over and over since I was a kid. I've watched the old Basil Rathbone films, and the British Sherlock and American Elementary. Enjoyed all of these adaptations, as each has something unique to offer. So of course I was super excited to play a game based on the famous detective. Then I read the reviews. And got less excited. Waited for it to go on sale, thought I'd try it out despite the criticisms. But I should have listened. Full disclosure: I haven't finished the game yet. Not sure if I ever will, because I'm already sick of it. The Bad:Oh my god the dialogue animations. It's so awful, it completely distracts you from what the character is saying. The opening cutscene with the little kids is the worst; it's almost a joke. It doesn't help that the children look like terrifying soul-less ventriloquist dummies. Looking for clues doesn't really feel like looking for clues. It feels like wandering around until your cursor turns into a magnifying glass. Which is exactly what it is. No brain activity required. Sherlock doesn't really feel like Sherlock. I think this was deliberate on the part of the game creators; this is supposed to be a darker, less heroic version of the detective. I see what they were trying to do, but it just felt so... wrong. The environments are very closed, and you can only travel along a very linear path, even though it looks like you should be able to walk everywhere. It really takes you out of the game. The Good: Puzzles are sometimes fun. The deduction board is a good idea. These were the only moments during the game when I actually felt like I was solving a mystery. But there are no consequences if you get it wrong; just keep clicking until you get it right. Environments are kind of pretty. Not mind-blowing, but ok.			"

												This is the first modern Sherlock Holmes game that I've played; my last outing was an old point-and-click on my family's old 386 when I was about 13.  Being that I hadn't played any of the new games yet, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I'm a fan of Holmes from the books and later the new series, and I wasn't sure how the game would capture the right atmosphere.I'm pleased to say that, in my opinion at least, they knocked it out of the park.  Settings were extremely evocative of the time period.  I thought especially that the slums of Whitechapel were very well done graphically and atmospherically.  If a game can make me say ""oh my god why can't I help these poor people"" and actually make me distressed about it, I call it a win.  Good immersion, I'd say.Fans of the books will appreciate some easter egg references to past adventures, plus the fun of taking Toby for a spin once again (with some added skills he didn't have in the book; I think he was smarter than Watson in this one...)The puzzles had that perfect balance of challenging without making me tear clumps of my hair out.  The very few times I consulted a walkthrough was in situations where I knew I'd forgotten to pick something up earlier and didn't want to have backtrack too far for it.  It was unnecessary for the puzzles themselves, which took me a lot of thinking but no random rage-quits over it. :DI will mention there is some ""digital"" gore due to a couple of rather grisly murder scenes, in case that matters to you.  I cringed a little bit at doing a post-mortem exam, but the sequence was mercifully short.  I'm naturally squeamish and it really wasn't enough to bother me much.  Just wanting to throw that out there for anyone who wants to know!Overall, an excellent experience and one that was so entertaining I'll probably go back and play it again at a later date, which isn't a treatment I give to too many games.  I'd pay the full $19.99 cost without flinching, knowing how much I enjoyed myself, but if the cost is bothersome, wait for a sale.  Either way, pick it up and give it a play when you can!			"

												This game is AWESOME for anyone who enjoys a good puzzle game and/or loves Sherlock Holmes. I had my doubts before I bought it, because I was afraid that it wouldn't be so good or mentaly challenging enough, but I was proven wrong. You constantly have to use your mind to solve puzzles with logic and deduction. I also love the fact that you can easily change perspective from first person to third person depending on what's most suitable at the moment. If you aren't so good at first person shooter-games and want to use your logic and deduction skills then this will probably suit you perfectly, but I think pretty much anyone who enjoys puzzlegames will find this entertaining.PROS- Challenging riddles and puzzles- Beautiful and detailed setting- Ability to change perspectives- Good Sherlock Holmes-feeling- AMAZING twists, especially at the endCONS- Slightly repetitious from time to time- Many details to remember, sometimes a bit too much			"

												An engrossing storyline punctuated by some fantastic moments and some genuinely good plot twists. The characters are engaging, the voice acting is excellent (though the lip syncing is a little off).Puzzles were about right in terms of difficulty. I did have to use a walkthrough for a difficult puzzle but on the whole solving the puzzles was incredibly satisfying.Graphics and sound do a good job of portraying the setting. The controls are a tad imprecise compared to other games which allow first person control – though this does not take away from the enjoyment of the game in a major way.I bought it on sale so value-wise for £3 I got a quality 16 hours of gameplay! Can’t argue with that!			"

												Conveys the Sherlock Holmes I know and love from the books and short stories, in a way most other visual media won't do.  The puzzles are brilliant.  Very difficult to guess correctly; you certainly have to think about it.  Watson is funny but very like the Watson I'm familiar with from the books.  He's slightly slower to cop on here but that's fine.The game design is nearly flawless.  Just a couple of glaring UV seams not worth mentioning (would you look at that, I've mentioned them) but no-thing else to complain about there.  Some slightly overused NPC models but it's an indie game so you expect that sort of thing.  Really good attention paid to Victorian English culture, accents, clothing, architecture, &c.  Though a couple of articles of clothing, if I'm to be overly fastidious, are American and not British.  You won't notice.  Only me.The story is perfect.  The acting is mostly perfect.  A couple of less believable actors but most of it's great.I will complain about the controls.  It doesn't matter much because you don't really need fast response time in this game, but in third person some stuff is annoying because it takes far longer than you'd expect, and this is fixed by going into first person view.Overall, great game, great story, great puzzles, great Holmes, great Victorian London.  Very impressed by the puzzles.			"

												Good Point&Click 3D Adventure game.Typical Point & Click Adventure game but, in a real 3D environment. You can manage your characters in third or first person and, the story needs you to change the character to accomplish certain ""simultaneus"" tasks.Story is good enough, with some good  twists . Interesting. Captives your attention.There are some easy puzzles but, some are really challenging but, at least, all them are logical.Game lenght is ok. Not so short as most of Adventure games.Graphics are a tad odd and animations a bit robotics (characters' movements).Game system is good and easy to learn but, hotspots are somewhat difficult to focus with the Xbox 360 gamepad.Overall, good game.

												A very good and a unfortunately overlooked game. Fun and challenging puzzles mixed with nice story and fun voiceacting. And fear none, you can skip the puzzles after trying for a while if you wish. Only minus can be given to some weird animations and the overall point and click style of the games progression. But should you love point and clicks with modern twist, adventures, good story and the license intrests you, this is definately worth chceking out.  Don't let the metascore fool you.			"

												Another excellent Sherlock Holmes game. Graphics are pretty good and the voice acting is as good as ever.Excellent story and puzzles accompany this as well. Some puzzles are as Sherlock says, ""Simplicity itself"". Others will drive you nuts. I looked for help to solve 2 puzzles and one of them there was no clue to help you at that time. I eventually figured it out, but it took me about an hour and a half, but was totally worth it.Great game. Great fun. Great challenge.			"

												The game continues to refine the formula familiar from the previous Frogwares Sherlock Holmes titles. Despite everyone's inexplicable fondness for weird puzzle locks, it also stands out in the puzzles by and large being sensible -- in contrast for example to Nemesis, where most of them seemed very forced and out of place. The game doesn't fear to get grisly, either, bringing back the unforgivingly realistic graphics of The Awakened in murder investigations, in contrast to the cartoonish diagrams of Sherlock Holmes vs. Jack the Ripper. The deduction board is back and has been further refined, so that it's very rarely one has to resort to guessing, butMany of the weaknesses from the previous games are also present: Budget constraints are evident in every aspect of the game, and it's far from being as polished as the AAA titles of the day. The controls are still suite clunky, the voice-acting leaves MUCH to be desired, and the game crashed on me a few times. All in all, however, it's likely the best game in the series so far, so if you liked the others, you'll like this one, too. Having played the previous games is also recommended, as the stories thereof are heavily referenced, and you may have some difficulty following the narrative otherwise.			"

												To be frank, one of the best games I've played in a long while.This may be due to my growing fascination with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's masterpiece of Sherlock Holmes, but I found this game to be riveting until the very end. It's not often that I find something that I am actually saddened by its ending. The story was magnificent, and the gameplay was not bad either. As a game this is a point and click adventure that you can also play in first person (as the third person option I found to be frankly useless). It's a damn good one at that. This contains some of the more frustrating puzzles I've seen in a game, yet it managed to actually keep me engaged in figuring them out instead of just angering me until I quit. I admit that I have not beaten this without a walkthrough, although I felt bad for using it when I needed it. This game makes you use your brain. The game itself was also made quite nicely, the animation not perfect, but voice acting and immersion were fairly great, at least to me.In short, magnificent puzzle game with wonderful story, Sherlock being one of my favorites. I simply cannot wait for Sherlock Holmes: Crime and Punishments to be released.			"

												This game is fantastic. If you are going to play a Sherlock Holmes game, I would suggest you start with this one, not because of any story or gameplay reasons but because it's very well presented. The 3rd person behind the shoulders view and the way the menus look makes it feel like a modern adventure game. The older games still have the look and feel of ""classic"" point and click adventure games.The story gets a bit absurd at times but I feel like the TV-show ""Sherlock"" groomed me for this. Sometimes it felt like there should've been an extra cutscene there or another bit of dialogue to explain stuff more but overall, I'm very statisfied with this game. I appreciated the campiness.			"

												Good stuff:*Gameplay that doesn't put you in the 'where do I go'' situations as much. The game cleverly helps you to the right directions, without making it too straight forward easy.*Puzzles is at a perfect level of challenge.None of them taking more than 45 minutes to solve.*Music is as soothing as usual, in a Sherlock game.*Graphics are really sharp, with good lightning.*Story pull some surprising twists.Bad stuff experienced (as feedback):*Recurring bugs when in puzzle view.The interactivity decides to freeze half the time when entering a puzzle view.Sometimes being fixed by spamming the ''reset'' icon and exiting the puzzleview, but in some cases forcing you to instead reboot the game.*The feature in the menu, of being able to select between playing Holmes orWatson, comes out highly unnecessary, as it is almost never avaliable through the game.*Dr. Watson is an expert at always standing right behind you, when playingHolmes and feel like backing up, blocking your path doing so.But maybe it was intended like that? :DConclusion:Excellent game!

												I do say, this interactive moving picture was thoroughly enjoyable and positively delightful. I observed quite a number of gentlemen noteing that the ""graphics"" were somewhat crude and dated, but this was not the case. I beileve these gentlemen were exaggerating and some of these unfavorable reviews are unjust and uncalled for. Pure blasphemy, and utterly disgraceful.All joking aside, This was a very cool game. The first game I played was Crimes & Punishments on PS3, and I loved that game. This one felt just like that one. Yes the graphics where a little worse than that game, but not enough to shy away from this game, I thought the graphics were fine. If you are a fan of C&P, definitely check this one out.Don't know about the other games in this series, but Crimes & Punishments and this game really captured the essence of the Sherlock Holmes books. (I've read them all, and they are my favorite books. I know reading isn't all that popular, but I HIGHLY recommend those books as well).			"

												In two words: mind-numbingLacking any real challenges, TSH makes *everything* a challenge. Nothing is too trivial, or too futile. Watson, bring me a book. Watson, bring me an article. Even going somewhere is a ""challenge"" as you have to wander the streets to find a building.Edit: lots and lots of pixel-hunting throughout the game :( Edit: Finished the game. In conclusion: too many minigames that have nothing to do with the story or characters. Just tons of generic minigames, like chess riddles. The deduction mechanism is good, but unfortunately, too few of those.Pros:* Decent ""deduction"" mechanism with which Holmes is deciphering clues.* Graphic is okAll in all, unless you are a die-hard-Sherlock-Holmes enthusiast (or you don't mind tons of generic minigames/riddles), I don't recommend it.Frogware did put a lot of effort into the writing of the story, so it is a shame.

												This was the first game I ever played on steam. I'm a casual gamer, and not great at button mashing. I've always been a fan of Sherlock and I enjoy games with rich storylines. Because I am so bad with buttons I used to watch friends and family play games just so I could get the stories and solve puzzles. I'm happy to say if you're like me and maybe suck at first person shooters, or have terrible reaction time, Sherlock is the kind of game you'll enjoy! Point and click with some walking around. Really basic and easy, BUT not boring. Great story, fun tasks, cool puzzles, great characters, and great voice acting. I really enjoyed the twist ending.			"

												Frogwares has been doing Sherlock Holmes games for more than ten years. You'd think they'd gotten pretty good at it, but judging by The Testament of Sherlock Holmes, they've just gotten sloppy. The engine is getting visibly long in the tooth, and the mystery you're solving this time does some very un-Holmesian leaps of logic and plausibilty towards the end.The production values are just plain mediocre all around. While some of the puzzles are fun, there is an alaming number of inventory puzzles requiring you to combine various ropes and ladders into longer ropes and ladders. At its worst, the gameplay just devolves into a hotspot hunt, a variation of the dreaded pixel hunt. Not recommended unless you're either a hardcore Holmes fan, or a hardcore adventure game fan.			"

												Real fans of classic point and click adventure games will be ashamed to have played this. The core mechanics of finding and analyzing clues are grossly linear. And as far as I can tell, much of the story is filled out by Holmes' sporadic arbitrary narratives, which relate only vaguely to the clues you've gathered. It makes you feel like you just have to go pick up a prescribed number of rocks before Holmes divulges impossibly-omniscient information on the case. While this may or may not be in the style of traditional Sherlock Holmes, it is not in any way satisfying as a plot progression mechanic in a game.Also the few puzzle-based asides are entirely self-contained and have little or nothing to do with the story or any details you may have observed. On top of that the movement, much like the GUI, is clunky and annoying, in all 3 of the view modes, and makes you feel like you have nubs for hands.The ""deduction board"" is a fairly smart mechanic, but is ruined by the fact that it's closely tied to whether or not you simply clicked on certain pre-determined clue hotspots. It would be infinitely more challenging if you were allowed to simply examine the various scenes and fill out the deduction board yourself, instead of it breaking everything down to meaningless and often absurd multiple choice statements.TL:DR; Far too linear and simplistic for a veteran adventure gamer, but much too tedious and clunky for casual gaming.

												I've enjoyed every installment of this series, but Testament is probably my favorite one so far (played The Awakened, Mystery of the Mummy, Silver Earing, Nemesis, and vs Jack The Ripper). I really enjoyed the darker turn that this game took over the others (even Holmes vs Jack the Ripper, imo). The game isn't without its faults, to be sure, but it gets so many things right that what is wrong can be tolerated. The story was very well done, the puzzles weren't overly difficult (I think there were only two or three that I absolutely could not figure out on my own), and the graphics for this title are greatly improved over previous titles in this series. As for the issues I think need working out, for one, there are a few clues which can be dificult to find. Also, being an adventure title, it does fall into the problem of inventory based puzzles, which again are not normally difficult to solve, but there a few which require item combinations (which is done in the inventory menu) that might not be intuitive. Also, and this is kind of overly nitpicky, but whatever, I wasn't a huge fan of the vest Holmes wore the entire game. All in all, I would say, if you're a Holmes fan, and like puzzles and in general like adventure titles, I would absolutely pick this game up, especially if it's on sale.			"

												-Minor Spoiler Warning- Though I do love a good (murder) mystery, The Testament of Sherlock Holmes, after a long while of playing, felt somewhat dumbed down--as if the mystery at hand wasn't good enough, we've had these moments where we, as Watson, must question Mr. Holmes' credibility. To his credit, and do mind the spoilers, Mr. Holmes puts on a hell of a charade which he, for some poorly written reason, chose not to explain to his partner Watson, raising all these needless questions and complications for the sake of...drama in mystery, I guess? Aside from that, the puzzle-solving is as fun as ever, the dialogue can be enjoyable at times, and the mystery might just entertain you. It's another one of those, one-time games, where you play it once and let it sit there and fester for the rest of time--of course, unless you want the two different karma-related achievements. Do be warned though, the ending is a little...weird, in my opinion.			"

												I am going to give it a thumbs up but there are some things in this game that make me lean to a thumbs down.* The game is interesting to play.* The story line can be quite gripping at times and a few twists and turns make you want to keep playign.* Some good achievements to watch out for (I mean you have to work for a few not all of them are just earned by playing the game).* Voice acting is done well.* Graphics are not bad quite a few games seem to be like this lately.* Some of the puzzels were really fun trying to figure them out and trying different approaches to make them work I would to play some of these puzzels again and will look for other games that might have something like them.But * The children are annoying and act really odd just making noises.* There is no real influence in the story its all set out you don't get to choose where things go.* Quite a few of the puzzels just seem to be like a childs game there is not alot of thinking required just try a a couple of different approaches.* Very disappointed with the main bad guy he is made out to be so much better in the main stories.Basically a point and click game where you just need to find all the parts to move on.There is thinking involved but not as much as expected in a game with Sherlock Holmes in the name.I do think it is worth a quick play (when the game is on cheap tho - I got this during summer sale).It is fun working out the main clues on the deduction boards but sadly there are not many and one of them bugged for me so I had to return to an older save and it worked that time (only bug I saw during the entire game).

												I am going to give it a thumbs up but there are some things in this game that make me lean to a thumbs down.* The game is interesting to play.* The story line can be quite gripping at times and a few twists and turns make you want to keep playign.* Some good achievements to watch out for (I mean you have to work for a few not all of them are just earned by playing the game).* Voice acting is done well.* Graphics are not bad quite a few games seem to be like this lately.* Some of the puzzels were really fun trying to figure them out and trying different approaches to make them work I would to play some of these puzzels again and will look for other games that might have something like them.But * The children are annoying and act really odd just making noises.* There is no real influence in the story its all set out you don't get to choose where things go.* Quite a few of the puzzels just seem to be like a childs game there is not alot of thinking required just try a a couple of different approaches.* Very disappointed with the main bad guy he is made out to be so much better in the main stories.Basically a point and click game where you just need to find all the parts to move on.There is thinking involved but not as much as expected in a game with Sherlock Holmes in the name.I do think it is worth a quick play (when the game is on cheap tho - I got this during summer sale).It is fun working out the main clues on the deduction boards but sadly there are not many and one of them bugged for me so I had to return to an older save and it worked that time (only bug I saw during the entire game).

												The game is a lovely example of old-school quests. You have the opportunity to control both Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, but not only - you can also control their lovely hound in one of the challenges. The game, unlike many, has a number of puzzles - some are extremely easy, others can be solved by pure luck, while a third group is just a plain pain to solve!Keep in mind that you can change between three types of point of view - 1st person, 3rd person directly behind or the classic 3rd person where the mouse click controls your character's movements. The third one is the last wher you can use controls similar to those in The Longest Journey and Syberia. Other are typical WASD-key controlled. (Keyboard, don't know about this game's compatibility with gamepads, sorry)The story features a number of teists and turns and, although not as realistic as the Holmes vs Lupin title, it is still quite a diverse game when it comes to locations. Not to mention the kids who are actually out story-tellers. Honestly, I hated them at first, but when I reached the end, I found that they were in the story for a reason. A little nudge for those who feel the games they play.If you enjoy old-scool adventure games, then take this quest and beat it, my fellow casual gamer!			"

												I really enjoyed this game, even if I found it a bit short. The story is engaging and the puzzles varied and challenging. If I have any complaint, it would be to say there wasn't really any clear direction given for a number of the puzzles. I found myself looking to the internet on a couple of occassions when I had no clue what I was supposed to do with a puzzle (and I'm too stubborn to click the ""skip"" button that pops up when you take too long with one).  The characters were well done, with good voice acting, though it could be jarring to see the lips moving not quite in sync.  I also noted how, when presented with a locked door, Watson would say ""Locked"" in a frustrated tone, while Sherlock would calmly muse, ""Closed."" There are a lot of lovely details to note and I appreciated the ability to choose my POV. All in all, this is a good puzzle/point & click  game,			"

												I just love Sherlock Holmes series by Frogware. I think it really matches my tasete.They have produced several Sherlock Holmes games by now but each one of them is somewhat unique and different from each other, still, they keep this uneasy eerie feeling, which I love.I am into adventure games and have played so many of them so I'm really cool with not having so called ""instructions"" on how to solve or crack the safe. That's part of playing a detective, I mean. who is going to leave ""how to"" crack a safe anyway? So, if you are into shooting or battle games, these types of game might not suite you. You will need to figure out what it is and how it works on your own. That's a fun part of these games!			"

												An atmospheric Sherlock Holmes game with a good story. The 3D characters look nice but are somewhat robotic, including the protagonists. The voice acting is generally good, although Holmes and Watson's exchanges can be weird; Watson especially brings to mind an alien trying to figure out the correct reply, at times.The puzzles are hit and miss, but all the coffee break style minigames can be skipped if wanted. The larger problem is that there's a fair amount of item hunting, in areas where it's unclear what you're even trying to achieve. There's a deduction board which you must fill with clues and then use the power of deduction to make the right conclusions. This was one of the best parts of the previous Frogwares titles, and it's nice to see it's still present.From a technical standpoint the game is fairly solid. The graphics and sound are both very good and the game runs well. The control scheme is simple and doesn't get in the way. I do wish Frogwares learned to program proper mouse controls, though - the 1st person mouse control is even worse than in their previous 3D Sherlock titles. There's an annoying dead zone in the vertical axis in addition to the general floatiness, which is not caused by vertical sync or low frame rate. At least the vertical axis can be reversed.The Testament should also get a prize for the weirdest intro video in a long time, in which a trio of really weird looking children find a book in an attic. It's a complete mess. One of the kids looks like a ventriloquist's doll and they all behave like they're from a fever dream.Still, it's a very good game and definitely worth playing.			"

												This game is a boon for everyone who likes to be mentally challenged by puzzles. The puzzles in this game has cost me quite some time to solve and it was pleasing to find a logical answer everytime.However, keep in mind I'm new to this kind of games, there are some downsides. I'm a sucker for a good story and having read the collection of Sherlock Holmes books of Doyle himself, I found the story overdone. Sherlock Holmes is ofcourse known for revealing his cards at the end, so the plottwists were something which was unsuprising and I didn't mind it. The kids throughout the story though was a waste of time in my opinion. They were graphically of lower quality, got me out of the story everytime and didn't fit in Sherlock's character.  Second, some clues and items were hard to find. The game has a help mechanism, but when used often, you get a badge. So that felt like a punishment. Gamers will have to ignore  that badge and keep using Sherlock's senses anyway. There is a precise order of doing certain things, which can't be done otherwise. There is a puzzle with Greek letters, which can be found in books, on internet or the player can know them already by heart, however, Sherlock still needs to find a list with the letters.Lastly, the way Sherlock and Watson are moved around. There are three ways: first person, third person and a room/area overview. None of those really felt natural and easy. There is one absolute reason to buy (or get it with Crimes and Punishments, like I did): the puzzles. As said before, they are challenging, but all beatable. After five minutes (+/-) you get the option to let Sherlock solve it, so you can't get stuck. I recommend to try and solve them all, since that's the thrill!			"

												A fun puzzle game, interspersed with elements of point-&-click adventuring. The voice acting is pretty good & the game captures the ambience of Victorian very well. My favourite element is the crime scene investigation, identifying clues & building these into a series of deductions from which conclusions can be formed. The story is somewhat 'gappy', having some very deep & interesting elements, such as the crime scene arenas, with weaker elements where gaps in the narrative are filled in by lengthy exposition conversations. I felt the ending to be rather weak & an unsatisfying close to an otherwise gripping game.This is an entertaining buy if you like logic puzzles, sleuthing & exploring the seedier sides of Victorian London.

												If you like sherlock holmes or detective novels then this is for you. You make your own deductions from a choice of 3 posibilities sometimes 4 after you've found the evidence which is not too hard but then i've only done 2 sets of deductions so far so it may get harder. the deductions do genuinely take logic to work out so if your expecting not too think you'll be dissappointed But don't over think things either.Overall i'm enjoying this game Sherlock is as rude as ever and Watson is as Watsonesque as he is in the books.

												Intriguing game, but not without flaws.I just love investigation games where you have to find clues and then deduce to figure out what really happened, and you definitely expect that from a Sherlock Holmes game. In that department it doesn't fail to deliver, except that I wish there was more of it. The story of the game is fairly interesting too, quite dark and a bit out there. Actually I feel it is a bit too far out there at times.You can choose to play from a 3rd person perspective or 1st person. Because of the somewhat clunky controls and movement I ended up playing it in 1st person to not become too frustrated. You alternate between controlling Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson through the story and even Toby the dog. Especially Toby here felt out of place and especially clunky and odd. Not only did that part feel unrealistic to the point of ridiculousness, but for he most part it did not even make any sense. I do not want to spoil too many details, but let's just say don't get caught up in where the tracks lead you. Half the time they didn't even show up. At least not until you'd been going back and forth several times. It is good to see that a developer is trying something new and original, but this was not a success in my eyes.What really stands out in this game, in my opinion, is the voice acting. They were just really really good. I don't know if it is because the British language just seems more dramatic and sincere or what it is, but everyone felt very believable.There's a good mix of search and find, puzzles, mini-games and exploration. I found the deduction boards to be creative and fun and the puzzle boxes to be less so. Either way I enjoyed the game as a whole and would easily recommend it to anyone enjoying these types of games.I rate the game 7/10Happy Gaming!			"

												The Testament Of Shrlock Homes is a hybrid point and click 3d exploration game.  Theres a lot of work that has gone into this, with numerous backgrounds and environments, costumes, 3d level constructions, some nice facial animations (that are occasionally totally out of sync with the speech), some questionable voice acting and some mind testing puzzles.From a story perspective, this game is rather faithful to the Sherlock Holmes books, and theres been some obvious research done into the character, his relationships and the world he inhabits.  Theres also some obvious  problems with the game that mar an otherwise enjoyable 3D explorer. The story is fairly good.  It does take some liberties with the historic Holmes and brings back the baddest bad guy ever, but overall, it stays faithful to the period.  That said, there are some points when it breaks down and you have to take a leap of faith with the character to continue playing.  I didnt like that sometimes, plot devices were revealed bythe narration and cut scenes before they had happened in the game, but its not a terribly unforgivable problem.The puzzle solving is where this game excels.  some of the quests require lateral thinking and some interesting approaches to solve.  some however require you to go through a monotonous sqeuence of events.  They are less enjoyable, but thankfully are few and far between.Ive seen elsewhere comments about ""ugliest children ever!"" and that aspect of the game could have been much better.  Some of the events you have to follow make no sense at all.  theres a massive twist in the game that you expect from Sherlock Holmes, but it makes no attempt to explain why, how or what its playing at.The multi character system is a great idea, allowing you to be in two places at once, and its a good way to link up character arcs in game, but sometimes its overused.The entire last act of the game is, frankly, boring.  the first 2 thirds of the game work rather well and were far more enjoyable.  Some puzzles require you to find a specirfic item, and those are REALLY annyoing particularly because the location of some of the items make no sense.  in the same breath however, some of the interactions with third person characters  is innovative, although some of them are so diaposable, you forget about them.  I consider that a problem of the character developlment, and some interesting characters never re-occur, leaving you let down a their underuse.All in all, this is a solid adventure, but it wont win any awards, which is unfortunate.  Id like to see one of these tackled with a proper development budget, better voice acting and some streamlined quests, but if youre a fan of the genre or sherlock holmes, you'll probably find something in this game to satisfy you.  give it a go!  its mega cheap in the Steam Sale!

												+Good story. If you just want to lean back, enjoy the story and get immersed, this is perfect.+The voice acting is great and catches the character of Watson/Holmes perfectly.+If you get stuck on a puzzle, you can skip it after a while, and if you get stuck in an investigation you can pretty much always talk to Watson and he will give you something to go on.+You can switch between 3rd, 1st person view and P&C-style view.+Graphics may not be outstanding, but they're good, clean and atmospheric.-Really bad animations, even considering it is a 2012 release.-There is no storyflow, narration is wierd overall, but not bad.-Some puzzles are designed badly.If you like P&Cs, good stories and Sherlock Holmes, this game is great and would definitely recommend it.

The epic ending of the game really does a 360 and giving his character development a complete home run.Took me 15 hours to finish the game (without using guides)			"

												I just finished The Testament of Sherlock Holmes and can definitely recommend it.It was a good game with an intersting case to solve. I was a little surprised by the gameplay, as it was not only point-and-click, but also WASD walking around (if you choose that kind of view). I enjoyed this a lot, as it made playing Holmes, Watson and Toby (!) more real.At times the controls weren't very precise or it took a while until WASD reacted accordingly to my input. The point-and-click mechanisms did function very good for most of the game. Sometimes it was a little difficult to hit the exact spot.There were plenty of riddles which were all good fun. Sometimes they were a little hard at first, as you get often no explanation what you need to do. But then, you are a detective and your reason of existence if to solve mysteries.You don't need to know much about the Holmes-universe, but if you do, you'll be in for a treat. As you will be confronted several times with random Holmes-universe trivia :)			"

												A wonder and frustrating puzzle - The Testament of Sherlock Holmes provides hours of gameplay that ease you into the role of consulting detective. Set as a rememberance by three small children, you go about London, solving crimes that, at first, seem non-related. With point and click clues, deduction boards and the creating of new items from what you've found, there's always something to discover! That is, if you don't quit after getting caught in the cutscenes. Often long and unneeded, they cut into an otherwise seemless gameplay. Perhaps replace them with requiring more action from the player would work. Need a place to hide? Don't cutscene, go find one!Perhaps the greatest challenge personally, were some of the ""boss"" puzzles. Often, they come with little or vague instruction and no hint to guide you in the right path. Some are easier than others but if you're not Holmes yourself, perhaps have a hint page pulled up online. (That way, you still get the satisfaction of 'having done it mostly myself'.) All in all, a pleasing game with graphics you grow fond of and an ending that tugs at the heart. The credits are displayed in a style that would suit better at the beginning of the game for they were quite well done. Instead of so many cutscenes, use this work as chapters? Either way, if you're a Holmes fan or love mind aching puzzles, here's a good game to spend some time with.			"

But if you look for more investigation-focused adventure like Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments, I suggest you look elsewhere.This game has quite nice graphic, but the music often does not match the situation Holmes and Watson are in, therefore ruining the atmosphere. And the part where Holmes has to look for a missing laundry in the garden totally turned me off.

												8/10 I really enjoyed this game. Yes, it is a little dated, and the controls can be a little frustrating at times, but that comes with it being an older game. The length and puzzles were great, and I really enjoyed the deductive reasoning boards. Everything was well done, and the storyline made sense throughout. There were a few times that I had to consult a guide/walkthrough online, because it wasn't incredibly intuitive, but for those who enjoy difficult encryption challenges then those puzzles will be no problem for you. I would definitely recommend this game to any mystery fan, not just fans of the Sherlock Holmes genre. TIP: Many have complained that there aren't enough saves throughout the game. You can save anytime by pressing the ESC button and clicking the save option. By the way, this product is actually rated by ESRB, and is aimed towards adults. I wouldn't recommend it for children. For some reason Steam didn't include the rating on the site. MATURE: Blood and Gore, Intense Violence, Use of Drugs			"

												For storyline and pacing, this is by far the best Sherlock Holmes game yet.  The puzzles are all so much on the easy side as to be perfunctory, however.  Also a lot of them are repeated from previous Frogware titles.  One nice thing about this one is it does incorporate some of the other Frogware Sherlock Holmes plots in its plot, though it is not necessary to have played them, except, perhaps the Awakened.  Jack the Ripper and Arsene Lupin are both heavily referred to as well, though less important.  I would highly recommend it, but I hope for more difficult puzzles in future, especially given that skipping them has now become an option.			"

THE TESTAMENT OF SHERLOCK HOLMESThe best in the long series of Sherlock Holmes adventure games.Rating 6/10The best of the series for some time, surpases both Arsène Lupin and Ripper in terms of quality. Voice acting is probably the biggest improvement although it comes with the drawback of having terrible lip sync. It plays out like previous Sherlock Holmes games but with a slight imbalance between logic and deduction puzzles. There are far too many logic based puzzles that revolve around opening locks on doors, chests and boxes that have complicated puzzle mechanisms. The majority of these puzzles are fairly easy to figure out but there are three particularly hard puzzles one of which pops at at tne at the very beginning. Thankfully you are able to skip these three puzzles if you spend too long failing at them.The deduction puzzles work much the same way as they do in Ripper, pieceing toegether the clues that you gather on a deduction board. It's a nice method of explaning the story in an interactive puzzle, the problem is that there are only three deduction boards in the game. It needed more.So if you like adventure games with puzzle elements then this is one of the better examples, it's by no means great but the series has taken a leap in quality.			"

But this one has a more mature tone to it.Good at full price, and great if you can pick it up on sale. "

												This is a great adventure game, take on the role of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, the story and dialogue is excellent, truly epic crime solving, challenging puzzles and ridiculous safe locks. Some of these ""puzzles"" you truly have to take on the role of sherlock and CSI the hell out of everything and piece it all together using logical deductions. Some of the unique safe locks you must unlock have all the clues to do it, but you really have to use your head, some are mathematical :p. At least there is a ""skip"" option if you find a puzzle challenge too difficult. Only major complaint, yet I'm glad they have the option are 3 separate camera views, 3rd person is good for running around London, but extremely sluggish, point and click mode sucks as it doesn't now show certain areas where a clue might be, and the best option is 1st person view, as it will let you look at every single corner of a room, but also somewhat sluggish.

												I give it a 6.A decent 1st person point & click adventure with some nice puzzles. Nothing overly devilish, a few things a bit obtuse, but overall satisfying.  It was nice enough I'll pick up the rest of the series.  The downside is that a complete playthrough was 12 hours, tops.  I'd put it in the $10-15 range.			"

												I've played all the modern Frogwares Sherlock games, and Testament is... this is a bad game. It's just a bad game.Investigations are poor, with absolutely ludicrous pixel hunting. The sixth sense ability is supposed to assist you in locating interactive hotspots, but it only seems to work if an object is in a direct line of vision, which means if an object is obscured on your screen, it won't show up, leading you to do the ALWAYS FUN GAMEPLAY MECHANIC of running around a room in circles trying to find the one item necessary to trigger the next cutscene.You do a lot of pointless stuff in this game, that is supposed to reflect poorly on Holmes' credibility, but feels instead like story padding. Whitechapel feels practically like running errands. Back and forth and back and forth. In the prison, back and forth and back and forth. Backtracking is nothing new to adventure games but because every area of the game is its own chapter, you're not backtracking to other locations, you're backtracking within the same location, which just adds to the tedium. The story wants you to take itself seriously but yikes. (SPOILERS!) Why are there saturday morning cartoon scenes in an attic with hilarious looking 3d models during this game about vicious murders? Why is Watson fooled by the warden's sudden RIDICULOUS FORCED GERMAN ACCENT? Since when did Moriarty become Kefka from Final Fantasy 6?  There are times when the story in this game felt sillier than the Cthulhu game, but at least the Cthulhu game knew it was camp! There's always been ridiculous elements to Sherlock Holmes cases, but this game wants you to believe it's the darkest and grimest game yet-- but it's so goofy!!Maybe the engine just doesn't hold up anymore. Or maybe Sherlock Holmes needs to shed the current construct of puzzles and busywork. Perhaps a game more along the lines of Walking Dead/Gone Home but with a detective/invstigation slant? All I know is the gameplay of Testament is flat out bad and the story doesn't save it, and I enjoyed it far less than Awakened, Nemesis, and Jack the Ripper.			"

												After uninstalling and reinstalling this game multiple times, I still cannot get past the first cutscene, in which the game freezes. I searched steam support for an answer and found multiple threads in which the developer recommended that users downgrade their Nvidia Drivers in order to play the game. This looks like a good game, but until I get appropriate driver support, I will not recommend this game to anyone.			"

												Other than a short go at Sherlock Holmes vs. Jack The Ripper (42 minutes according to Steam), this is my first experience with the new series of Sherlock Holmes games, and - my memory might elude me - even ""new school"" point and click adventures in general. Let me add that the genre of point and click adventure / puzzle games is one I have built a love-hate relationship with over the years. For every game with a gripping storyline, great characters, and mostly logical and fun puzzles, there seem to be three (possibly up to n-1) that send you on a pixel-for-pixel hunt for items and constantly obstruct your progress in the most obscure way possible.That being said, I have used a guide for parts of this game. Maybe I could have done it without, but sometimes, after searching the same 3 places over and over again for that one item or observation that allows you to progress, you're faced with the choice of using a guide or uninstalling the game, and I kinda wanted to finish it after all.The game looks decent, but it doesn't feel great. You have the choice between first person, 3rd person, and point-and-click mode, all of which feel a bit clunky at times. The voice acting didn't strike me neither as great, nor terrible - it works. People seem to think that this game is very gritty, mature and dark (compared to what exactly?). There's the occasional graphic scene, but all in all it's pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a Sherlock Holmes game. At least it's pretty much what I had expected, I guess. The story didn't have me jump up from my chair in regular intervals (or at all for that matter), but it's enough to keep you going.As suggested earlier, The Testament of Sherlock Holmes isn't free of typical adventure game moments. Now, I'm certainly not a genius, but I'm not a complete knucklehead, either. At least not all the time. Sometimes I just got stuck. I don't remember how often exactly, but it will probably happen to you. Or maybe it won't and I'm just really bad at this. Anyway, a hint system other than the ""6th Sense"" - that didn't really do anything useful for me when I used it - would've helped here.So, would I recommend buying this game?The answer is a clear ""it depends"". Do you enjoy this sort of game and can you live with the inherent quirks and issues of the genre? Do you have a large sum of money at your disposal or can you get the game on sale for no more than 5-8 bucks (or both)? If you can answer both questions with yes, then sure, go for it. There are worse ways of spending a couple of hours (there are also better ways, but aren't there always?).			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine The Testament of Sherlock Holmes is a game developed by Frogwares and published by Focus Home InteractiveThe Testament of Sherlock Holmes is a very pleasantly surprising puzzle game, with a high standard of quality and a humorous undertone. Any fans of the puzzler-adventure genre should easily find this game enjoyable. Once you start playing you will likely find yourself engrossed by the experienceIt has a much thicker, richer story aspect than many other puzzler-adventure games out there. I was truly entertained by the narrative throughout my entire playthrough. The interesting plot goes a long way to elevate this game above the standard. Furthermore, I thought the graphics were nice and the voice acting was solid, which reinforces the high quality of the writing. The end result is a very enjoyable game with an excellent presentationThis inherent quality in the writing, atmosphere, and overall presentation results in a game which feels much more true to the Sherlock Holmes brand than the other couple of games I have played that were franchised the intellectual property. The others feel like standard adventure games with the words ""Sherlock Holmes"" on the title. This game, to me, really felt like what I believe a Sherlock Holmes game should feel likeThe puzzles were very challenging and quite fun; though to be honest I lost patience and had to seek assistance once or twice because of how tricky some of them were. Some of the puzzles are doubly complicated because the objective of the puzzle isn’t always made clear. So first you have to figure out what you are trying to do, and then you have to actually do it. This does add an extra layer of challenge, but it also can be a bit jarringAnd lastly, something I thought was a pretty cool feature is the fact that you can choose to move around in 1st or 3rd person, or play in classic point-and-click adventure style. Having this freedom sounds trivial, but it is really nice to be able to tailor the style on a whim as you play through the campaignIn summary, The Testament of Sherlock Holmes is a pretty sweet ride. It should appeal to both fans of the game genre and fans of the Sherlock Holmes novels or films (like me!). Give it some consideration if it sounds up your alley RECOMMENDED :)  "

												The Testament of Sherlock Holmes could've easily been the best game in the series. The graphics have been dramatically improved, there's an added third person camera option for that one person who played LA Noire and wanted all of his mytery games to make sure the camera was as far away from the evidence as possible, and the story starts out really interesting, bring up the idea that Sherlock Holmes may not be the legendary detective that Watson writes about in the novels. But right at the end it suddenly decides to get really stupid, and does something that was acceptable as a cute little easter egg in one of the previous games but doesn't really work as a main plot element, and then at the end it tags on a happy ending in the absolute worst possible way that I could ever imagine. The only thing saving the ending is the fact that the next game, Crimes and Punishments, turned out to be the real best in the series and abandoned all thoughts of the ending of this game. I'd still recommend playing it for the sake of the early parts of the game, but I can't recommend actually buying it individually; it's only worth playing if you get it in the Collection.			"

												*HEAVY SPOILERS HEREIN, CAVEAT LECTOR*The more I play these Sherlock Holmes games released by FrogWares, the more I see a decline in their execution. Elsewhere I have read a review that criticized the franchise for its emphasis on the macabre, but some of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories did the same, although his main appeal was in how they captured the zeitgeist of the Victorian age, in the clash of science and superstition (""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" is probably the more famous case), the importance of propriety (""The Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist""), the attraction for the exotic and the imperial (""The Sign of the Four"", ""The Adventure of the Speckled Band""). These are not primarily famous for their plot ingenuity -- in this respect, Conan Doyle's masterpiece is probably ""Silver Blaze"", which is thoroughly rational but mundane -- but for having cemented the view we have of the mores of late Victorian England. The people at Frogwares seem to be aware of that, but that does not mean they are respectful of the franchise. The Holmesian stuff is just atmospheric detail on a typical puzzle game, and I think the most telling indication of it is the dichotomy (see also The Awakened, Nemesis and Jack the Ripper) between the log-in/option screen and the puzzles, and the game world itself. While they seem to pay a great deal of attention to the game world (even though they get sloppy at times by reusing the same period illustrations over and over again, some of it mirrored). they seem to pick the default sans serif font for menu options without having second thoughts about it. Which not only makes the game look cheaper than it is (remember how The Awakened did not even have the game's name on the main menu?), but betrays that it is, beneath the Sherlockian veneer, a puzzle game. Which means that anything goes.In this game, for example, we get bombs made with radios, never mind that this is set in Old Vicky's England, where the closest equivalent one had to radio networks was broadcast by telephone, and where Signor Marconi was still experimenting with wireless telegraphy. Yet this game would have us believe that not only could radio parts be available to your average Russian (what else?) anarchists, but that the bombs in question could be remotely activated by a gigantic antenna. And there is the problem of the plot, if indeed there is one. A bishop asks SH to come and see him. Bishop is killed after hours of torture for a reason unknown. SH learns of a visit by bishop's nephew the previous day, who vanished. SH traces one of the assassins to Whitechapel (thereby enabling the reuse of valuable artwork from Jack the Ripper), but finds that the man has been killed by his accomplices, who are arrested in an opium den. SH finds that a rare poison has been used, *therefore* a certain famous poisoner has to be involved (because there can only be one famous poisoner at a time), even though said poisoner was currently detained at Her Majesty's pleasure, which means of course that SH has to facilitate his escape. Meanwhile a yellow reporter was writing derogatory articles about SH for which he benefited from inside information, which SH traces to a judge (out of the three sitting on the bench throughout the British Isles, if the puzzle is to be believed). SH burglarizes said judge's house, finds out the trove of information the judge keeps about him. Just after Holmes and Watson leave, the judge gets home just in time for the place to blow up.SH, believing he is about to be blamed for the explosion, goes into hiding. Watson finds him at one of his other addresses. SH and Watson go to an old mill where Russian anarchists hang out. Scotland Yard soon intervenes. SH shoots the inspector. When later cornered at 221B, SH kills himself in front of Watson.  Now, I don't know exactly how someone can fake shooting himself in the head (with all the gore that follows) within two metres of a man whose letters M.D. after his name are supposed to stand for something other than Mostly Decorative, but Watson believes it, goes strolling down sewers because that's where you're supposed to go for contemplation, I suppose, and discovers not only that SH is still alive, but that Moriarty is behind all the events in question, which involve feeding poisoned soup to beggars so that they will go crazy and foment a rebellion to install a relative of dear old Vicky on the throne, with the help of the master poisoner and Russian anarchists who have planted bombs around London. It's like if you took all the organizations mentioned in JFK conspiracy theories and made them work together.This game is a magnificent exercise in ""when things can't be explained, don't try, and hope nobody notices"". What information exactly did the bishop have? We don't know. Why was his nephew hiding out in a steel foundry to avoid discovery, and by whom? Don't know. How could the poisoner have contributed to the plan from his cell when he was not even provided with writing materials? Don't know. The game ushers us from one location to another without ever bothering to tie any of the loose ends, except for the occasional passing mention in dialogue.Overall, there has always been something disappointing about Frogwares' Holmes franchise. As an atmospheric exercise, ""Sherlock Holmes versus Jack the Ripper"" was better, but I find it questionable to use historical murders as the background for a video game. (That game did not even bother to rely on one of the numerous existing theories about that particular series of crimes, like the one, deep into conspiracy territory, that had to do with the Duke of Clarence's dalliance with harlots, which at least would have justified why Holmes solved the crime but that nobody ever heard a thing about it, and naturally it's been done before - see the film ""Murder by Decree"".) As a crime-solving game, it never gets intricate enough; it never attempts to be more than just another puzzle game. (They sure had fancy safes in the Victorian era.) Part of my disappointment with this game is really with the franchise's stubborn refusal to be more than it is, but here it fails as a game even if I just based my assessment on the story alone.			"

												I should start saying that this one belongs to the adventure category, and it's of the same spirit as the old-school, 2D poin-n-click games. It seems necessary to point that out, because, apparently, some reviewers let the 3D graphics fool them, and forgot about this fact. As a matter of fact, no other adventure could really beat this one in graphics or atmosphere, but it's still an adventure game; not an action game, not a RPG. And it's great at that. Anyone who feels the need of a change in pace, and want to slow down a little bit, and imerse themselves in a fantastic world of decadence, misteries and violent, apparently unsolvable crimes, can always count with the cold-blooded, logically-minded Mr. Holmes, and the loyal and righteous Dr. Watson as their guides. The characters are inarguably great on this one. Sherlock Holmes is clearly at his best, but Dr. Watson really awes the player for his distinction: a completely independent and complex character on his own. Their voices match perfectly and are totally convincing. Actually, the whole soundtrack is perfectly adequate to the game as a whole. Really good adventure, indeed. But, to be honest, there are some drawbacks also. The player will be every now and then distracted by the likes of bad lip sincronization, the somewhat awkward character movimentation, clunky gameplay, lots of invisible walls, and lack of animations when using objects. Also, the puzzles are not too much of a challenge for experienced puzzle solvers, no more than two or three of them would hold an adept back for more then ten minutes. On the other hand, they are so well crafted and fun to solve, that one can not help but feel well rewarded when the problem is solved. Anyway, if there are drawbacks, none of them could prevent the player from getting addicted to the appealing atmosphere and charming characters. ""It's simplicity itself"": just get it right now.

												I'm a fan of Sherlock Holmes, be it in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's books, the odd film, or in games.I'm also a fan of Frogwares' interpretation of the material, and their writing in their prolonged game series. The Testament of Sherlock Holmes, to me, feels like the culmination of numerous steps that were tread before - the writing remains excellent, and only improves. The puzzles all have their place, and aren't too easy or too hard. The deduction phases are an excellent evolution of what was used in the past.And all this blends together into a cinematic, if gory, adventure game that weaves its plot in a most excellent manner.Well done. Truly well done.			"

												Well, it's difficult to begin. The Testament of Sherlock Holmes is one of those games that lacks in an area, and excels in another. Although the controls are very easy and can switch between three unique types of view (Point and Click, First Person and Third Person), the puzzles have often infruiating me and the lack of clear direction in many cases was a really bad. but the story was amazing, at one point the story made me drop my jaw literally, and I was well aware I was doing it, the shocking twist was.. unexpected.. not to mention that even though I couldn't wait to get this over with, the ending was even more surprising, because.. you'd never really expect it.Overall, I feel that this game is worth buying, but be prepared with a walkthrough, just in case you get stuck and are about to ragequit.

												I had no idea what to expect from this game since I rarely play adventure games at all. Usually I enjoy the more fast paced games, but I decided to give this a go and I was not disappointed. The game offers tons of puzzles, clues and a well written story that leaves you sleepless at night. The dialoges were compelling, and the general content off the game was vast.The game is, however, not perfect. The controls were really stale and the entire character coordination in the game felt stiff. There was no lip sync and, to be honest, I was a bit surprised that this game was released as late as 2012, since the graphics was more of a 2008-2010 caliber. Nevertheless the game was enjoyable, beautiful and well written. A metascore of 73/100 is not too far off, but a bit cheap and I would rather say this game is closer to 80/100.			"

The player will be every now and then distracted by the likes of bad lip sincronization, the somewhat awkward character movimentation, clunky gameplay, lots of invisible walls, and lack of animations when using objects. Also, the puzzles are not too much of a challenge for experienced puzzle solvers, no more than two or three of them would hold an adept back for more then ten minutes. On the other hand, they are so well crafted and fun to solve, that one can not help but feel well rewarded when the problem is solved. Anyway, if there are drawbacks, none of them could prevent the player from getting addicted to the appealing atmosphere and charming characters. ""It's simplicity itself"": just get it right now.

												I'm a fan of Sherlock Holmes, be it in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's books, the odd film, or in games.I'm also a fan of Frogwares' interpretation of the material, and their writing in their prolonged game series. The Testament of Sherlock Holmes, to me, feels like the culmination of numerous steps that were tread before - the writing remains excellent, and only improves. The puzzles all have their place, and aren't too easy or too hard. The deduction phases are an excellent evolution of what was used in the past.And all this blends together into a cinematic, if gory, adventure game that weaves its plot in a most excellent manner.Well done. Truly well done.			"

												Well, it's difficult to begin. The Testament of Sherlock Holmes is one of those games that lacks in an area, and excels in another. Although the controls are very easy and can switch between three unique types of view (Point and Click, First Person and Third Person), the puzzles have often infruiating me and the lack of clear direction in many cases was a really bad. but the story was amazing, at one point the story made me drop my jaw literally, and I was well aware I was doing it, the shocking twist was.. unexpected.. not to mention that even though I couldn't wait to get this over with, the ending was even more surprising, because.. you'd never really expect it.Overall, I feel that this game is worth buying, but be prepared with a walkthrough, just in case you get stuck and are about to ragequit.

												Let's cut to the chase.Game is fantastic. Puzzles are great, often difficult. Which is great because if you've been around this world long enough to have some knowledge and experience, you should solve them after investing some time. :) Kids will struggle, especially on that math problem :)Graphic is great, story is fascinating, level design is stunning, gameplay is ok, no problems with running the game. Anyone who says different should have never stoped playing Super Mario Bros. One small detail they could have been better. Increase number of NPC models to more than 4. When you walk the street you continuasly meet people that look exactle the same.If you buy it on discount as I did. Then you made great purchase. Good for both of us!Score: 9,5/10			"

												Be the great detective, use his skills of deduction to gather clues to solve the crime and find the answer behind the mysteries of 19th century London.This is a first and third person adventure game where you control Sherlock Holmes - and sometimes Dr. Watson - as you unravel the mysteries that present themselves to you.Lateral thing is very much key here as some of the puzzles can be quite challenging, and can really tax your brain but it's still a lot of fun.

SummaryA decent enough adventure game and a treat for fans of Sherlock Holmes.ReviewI won't say this is the best adventure game I've ever played, but I enjoyed it for what it was worth.  The fact that I'm a big fan of Sherlock Holmes did help me look past some of the game's rougher spots, but I'm not sure someone else would be so forgiving.  The overall narrative, suffice it to say, is no match for the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle originals, but it's enough to hold the game together, which is really the most you can expect from a video game story.I called this an adventure game, but I think ""puzzle game"" might be a more fitting description.  Who knew the denizens of Victorian London were so fond of locking their secrets behind intricate logic puzzles?  You will encounter around two-dozen puzzles throughout the course of completing the game, and while I didn't find the puzzles particularly difficult once I understood them, the rules and operations of the puzzles were sometimes vague, so it wasn't always obvious to me what I was supposed to do, or if it was obvious, it wasn't obvious exactly how I was supposed to go about doing it.  I suppose that's part of the gameplay experience, figuring out exactly what the puzzle is and how to solve it, but there were times I honestly wasn't sure if this was intentional or simply poor game design.  No matter, walk throughs are easy enough to find on the internet these days if you need a prod in the right direction; alternatively, the game does present the option to simply skip a puzzle if you're well and truly stumped, but what self-respecting gamer would choose that route?There are also the more traditional adventure game puzzles that have you exploring your environment for clues, picking up everything you possibly can, and occasionally combining various objects in your inventory so you can proceed.  Thankfully, the game has a ""Sixth Sense"" feature where you press the spacebar to momentarily have points of interest highlighted for you which eliminates the frustrating pixel hunt.The presentation is a somewhat mixed bag.  The environments and character models are generally oustanding with great attention to detail and lots of atmospheric touches that really make Victorian London come to life.  The overall character animations are good for the most part, but the lipsynching is atrocious with the characters frequently flapping their lips for a few seconds after delivering their lines, which I found distracting, and the voice acting is average at best.  I never really took to Watson's melodramatic delivery where every line is spoken with an awkward urgency, and Holmes speaks in a drone, sounding almost bored at times, as if the whole business of crime solving no longer interested him.  Curiously, the bit players you encounter throughout the game are often better acted and sound more convincing then the stars of the show.The game controls well enough with a mouse and keyboard, although the mouse movements felt somewhat sluggish even with the sensitivity turned up to maximum in the settings. I played mostly from the third-person perspective which gives you a good view of your surroundings, and while a traditional adventure game perspective is offered, I found the controls too awkward (although people with a gamepad seem to have good success playing from this perspective).  I'd like to pass on a couple of tips on controlling the game since I'm not sure if it's mentioned in the manual: 1) you can use the mouse wheel to quickly scroll through individual items in your inventory; this is a lot faster and more convenient than opening your inventory screen, although you still have to open it if you want to combine one object with another; 2) if you have a bunch of hotspots clustered together, you can click the left-mouse button to highlight one and then use the WASD keys to cycle through them until you've highlighted the one you want; click the left-mouse button a second time to activate it; otherwise it's just way too fiddly to try and maneuver your character into the right position.I realize this review might seem overly critical, but none of the criticisms I've noted are fatal, and I did spend an enjoyable 14-hours completing this game.  With the noted exceptions, the puzzles are clever and fun to solve, and I have to say again that I found the art design to be terrific making each area a joy to explore, particularly when I came across obscure references to the original Conan Doyle stories.  If you're a fan of adventrue games, and especially Sherlock Holmes, and you think you could look past the weaknesses I've noted, then I would recommend this game.			"

Evidently a good game, my dear Watson.The Testament of Sherlock Holmes, a game I'd never heard of before. The fact that is was 75% off and was recommended by some steam users made me buy it. I never would have expected that it would be one of the best games I've played i the past few months.The story is pretty obviuos and sometimes predictable, and the ending was, in my opinion, a bit ridiculous. the graphics are pretty okay, considering this is not a triple A title. The animations are sometimes a bit dodgy and funny looking, and the lack of lip sync is also pretty funny if you start to notice it. But these are not the points that make or break a game for me. No, for me it's all about gameplay, and boy did this game do that right.The searching for clues is sometimes really straight forward, but many times you will be really surprised by where you'll have to look or what you'll have to do to find that one little clue or object you desperately need. And when you do find it, you WILL feel satisfied. The only little downside to this is a little lack of freedom. For example when you already know what needs do be done next, the game forces you to find that one last clue before you can go any further in the story, even of you already know the solution.The puzzles are awesome and sometimes you really have to think about them (hardest one took me half an hour of scribbling possible solutions on pieces of paper at my desk).The dialogue is brilliant, and despite the above named lack of lip sync, the facial expressions are rather good. You can really tell how someone feels by looking at them. The witty remarks of Sherlock Holmes are really entertaining and overall the crime solving duo has been really well represented in the game.Conclusion: I can't wait untill the next game from this company and give it a solid 8.5/10			"

												I didn't finish the game because it annoyed me too much.For the first mystery you have to find all the clues and once you do Holmes explains how they all connect. Basically all you have to do is search for clickable spots. Boring!In the second mystery you're presented to the ""Deduction Board"" in which your findings are noted and you are supposed to figure how all things connect by yourself. This part is more rewarding. But you're also presented to a puzzle in which you have to move a chess piece though a chessboard  (it has to land on every single one of the 25 spots of the chessboard and not land on the same spot more than once) . Though it's easily solved by trial and error and taking notes not to try the same solution multiple times, it's tedious.And then come more puzzles... Just when I was about to give the game up there came another Deduction Board to make me feel rewarded again!And more puzzles...And then again Holmes shows off his skills while all I had to do was find clickable spots.And then I'm off to another exciting (not!) hunt for more clickable spots with no clue as to what I'm supposed to find. I find mostly everything very quickly... but then walk around aimlessly for around 30 minutes until I finally find the last clickable spot, which grants me access to more... puzzles!!!Then the game told me I was supposed to control a dog. I assumed that I was supposed to go on another hunt for more clickable spots and that later Holmes would make sense of everything I found, so that was it for me! I gave up!So, if you're into solving puzzles and finding clickable spots, this game is for you!If you're into mystery solving you're better off reading a book. Since I now despise everything related to Holmes, I'd recommend Agatha Christie's novels.			"

												This game is fairly slow paced, which doesn't appear to take a long time to complete. Most of it seems to be a story line. Additionally, the game doesn't always reveal how puzzles work or some capabilities you have. Unfortunately, I had to use a guide to get the ball rolling on a few things. I'd say the game is quite challenging because of the lack of some instructions. Also, it doesn't seem like one needs to do anything special for the achievements either. It seems like achievements just come along with the successive completion of the story.For the price of $4.99, I was really excited to buy it. It isn't too bad, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it. It would depend on your game preferences. Good story, but I'm just completing it for the achievement hunter in me now.			"

												This game like any adventure game is extreamly tedius. When I got this game I was hoping to really have to use my head to solve mysteries and puzzle. Instead the game hands you the answers to the mysteries and the puzzle are so obvious that it's not even worth attempting. The first puzzle for example is lock picking and you must bend the pick in the correct shape. But it literally shows you the correct shape at the top of the screen and it takes no effort for you to shape the pick. So how is that a puzzle?And after that it's just a regular adventure game. Find all the things in the room and rub them up against everything else in the hopes that it'll do something. Unfortinitly the story isn't entertaining enough to keep me ineterested.			"

												(played up till day 3 ingame)positive+ Deduction board is great!+ Sherlock holmes! Adequately portrayed.+ graphics are ok+ compelling story so farnegative- Lots of user interaction design errors & hitches. e.g. Trying to select an object by standing close to it is almost impossible. - Puzzles are uninspired and have erratic difficulty curves. They are usually a form of 'open the box'. Can be skipped, but should have had hints as to their intent or solution. (e.g. first puzzle is the 'queen problem' in chess. It was original when the 7th guest did it in the 90's, but after the sheer number of games that did the same..not so much).- a great deal of the art budget is wasted on characters that don't add to immersion OR the story. (e.g. whitechapel area)- the game cheats a bit on the story: you might hear back about stuff that happened 'while you were not watching', without giving out any clues to it (e.g. prison scene).- the game may force you to do incredibly stupid things (like give a certain person the object he desires), without even acknowledging / lampshading the fact that it's out of character. (same location)- most or all characters are charicatures or stereotypes. Protagonists don't undergo any form of change or seem fazed by anything they face.- the game has not been playtested very thoroughly. There are blatent errors in continuity, such as suddenly knowing the name of 'the killers', after deducting where one of them works.- the game makes weird assumptions about the world (e.g. that a rope used to lower coffins into graves would be frayed only on one side AND that this is the only place you'd expect a rope frayed on only one side to be found).- some characters (especially heads, like the children from the intro), suffer tremendously from the uncanny valley syndrome. (Bad voice acting added in the mix there make these kids horrific to watch :X). A few more polygons would have helped.- Totally unneccesery part of the game were you play as sleuth hound. Moving and reacting to situations in a totally unrealistic manner. The level design is horrible, especially at the end, where 5 'sponteous ladders' are found (boxes and sacks stacked 4 or 5 meters in just so a way that a creature without legs to speak of can walk up it) and bring you to terminator2-look-a-like iron smelter, with an iron grate walkway with added twists and turns, hanging just a few meters above a sea of molten metal. I can't even begin to explain on how many levels this is wrong :X			"

												Underneath the bugs, low quality animations, and mixed quality puzzles, there's a neat comic book volume length Holmes story here.I took a long break between starting and finishing the game, but from memory the puzzles were all over the place. Some of them seemed pointless, like ""Why did you take me to this 2D screen just for me to click and drag 1 item?"" Some of them were just so so. Some of them were maddeningly difficult and the only solution is guessing (I looked up a guide for the disguise puzzle and the guide writer also complained the only way he knew how to solve it is to guess). But lastly, some of the puzzles were really cool. I liked the 2D colored marble moving puzzle a lot. The puzzle above the haunted house maze is one of the coolest 3D puzzles I've seen in a game like this.Overall I would have recommended this game if it wasn't for one thing: crashes to desktop during saving on the final level. During the game I think I crashed once during saving until I got to the last level. I think there is something about the graphics on this level that causes you to crash to desktop 50% - 75% of the time during saving. I looked this up on steam and other people have had the problem too. One thing that helped them and seemed to help me was playing in windowed mode. Another thing that seemed to help was saving while staring at the ground or a wall instead of looking out towards any scenery. I ended up doing most of the puzzles on the last level 2 to 5 times. I have to admit I got mad, but I felt so close to the end that I soldiered through it. It ended up taking probably at least an extra 2 hours to keep repeating the last level.			"

												The Testament Of Sherlock Holmes is an excellent adventure game with some neat and devious puzzles thrown in. The puzzles range from very easy to headbanging against the wall but once you figured it out it's feels very rewarding. The story is also one of the best in years. If you like adventure games and a good mystery this game is simply a must play! 8.5/10			"

It makes you think a bit, which is a nice change from all of the brainless ""blow up as many monsters as possible in the next 30 second...ready, set, GO!"" type of games.

I became addicted to the Sherlock series with the case of the rose tattoo, Brilliant I was hooked and this latest episode has not let me down.  The music is not repetative and is very mood catching. The voice acting perfect, puzzels not to dificult but enough to keep you thinking. The graphics are beautiful and spent a lot of time imersed in the details. The storyline as usual was highly engageing i struggled to put this game down to go and eat.  Only one little complaint, Watson continually kept getting in my way and was forever stating what do we do now Holmes. Overall I will not hesitate in playing again.			"

												Everything looks quite nice, especially the setting. For the most part I have no problem with the graphics, a touch old-fashioned though they may be.  The poor lip-syncing and the harrowingly dead eyes of everyone except perhaps Holmes, however, are annoying. Not to mention those pictures of the judges, which were just embarrassing...The plot is interesting and suitably grim, although there were some parts which made little sense. The frame story, I'm sorry to say, I didn't care for at all. The dialogue is interesting, occasionally even quite funny, and there isn't an excess of pointless blather. Holmes' witty retorts deserve a mention of their own, and I quite liked his voice-actor. I also liked the fact that you get to play several characters, not just him. However, there were instances where I wish I had been given freer hands to interrogate people and arrive at conclusions.The puzzles aren't patronisingly easy, nor nerve-wrackingly difficult. Nor are they repetitive. There were a couple which I chose to skip after three or four tries simply because they didn't exactly fall within my field of expertise. Some might find the lack of instructions a nuisance, but I didn't mind.All in all, I quite enjoyed it, even if occasionally I did get frustrated. 7/10+ You actually get to do some deducing.+ The sixth sense is a wonderful aid when you feel like you have reached an impasse.- Oh, Watson, won't you get out of my way!- There are only so many faces in London, apparently. I wish the creators would have been more inventive so that at least all the characters somewhat relevant to the plot would have their own unique faces.- There were one or two factual errors.			"

												Great point and click adventure puzzle. One of the best story lines and mysteries that I have played. The game is gorgeous and fun to play but sometimes frustrating with obscure objects needed which is typical for point and click but what makes it annoying is the required order to pick up thing to activate items.  This makes it so you pretty much need a walkthrough unless you want to spend countless hours looking for that one item to click on.  Reccomend playing with walkthrough. Grab it on sale. One point of advice look up the blackmail achvement. It is easilly missable and have to replay whole game to get it.			"

												This was a solid little puzzle game.  Good voice-acting (especially in Holmes's case) and a fairly cool and menacing storyline keep the player engaged in the puzzles and clue-finding expeditions.The only thing that keeps this game from being grand is that all the interesting twists and turns don't necessarily add up to a breath-taking ending. It's still pretty good, just maybe not as satisfying as you'd expect it to be given how well the game teases out some of the bizarre clues along the way.			"

As a Sherlock fan I am deaply disappointed and I really tried to enjoy this game but it was just too horrible. And I am just saying, what in the name of god was that ending all about?! It felt like it came completly out of nowhere! If you want a game with bad voice acting and a stupid story go and play Dracula Origin. Atleast that game is entertaining and has great pussles. I do not usually write reviews and certainly not bad ones but for something that people claims to be good this is just simply dreadful and super disappointing.

												A really good game, the best I've played in the Sherlock Holmes series. I loved the deductive gameplay. It also has a great mood to it - I finished it more than a year ago and I still fondly remember how atmospheric the various locations were (especially the Whitechapel slum).Though I'd put a warning here for potential players for some really gory scenes.

												First of all lets say I have finished this game - but mostly for gamers duty. Game starts quite strongly in one room from which necklage was stolen. It serves as tutorial - and also first problems are visible. Watsons introduction speech is explicit and boring same time - yet it feels, that mystery was prepared for you. Even with solution. Most of the problems/solutions in the game feels that way. There is no fluid in solving, all must be mechanichaly fulfilled to the last point that designer desired. In the end there are also some pixelhunting problems.There are many small details broking game feeling. Writing is sometimes explicite, sometimes left so many empty spaces, just for cheap help in story tension. Voice acting is good for most of the time, but when you talking to historical telephone, voice in it is perfectly clear and loud. Animation arent good and all...Still, there are some moments, when games shines. Graphic isnt good in the technical point of view, but a admire details and mood in every scenery. Puzzles may not be natural in common sense (defusing bomb with bulb flickin? Really?), but they have nice logic. First person perspective is great (it is awesome to see world from Sherlocks eyes).Still I can not recommend this game with clear mind. It has so many problem and there are so many better detective / adventures.			"

												Boring. Leave no exploration to the player, displays shining clues - there is no challenge here. Focuses too much on storytelling - you are better of buying the BBC series of Sherlock Holmes on DVD. I liked the ""fit the clues"" minigame though, but that also got old.

												The puzzles were okay.  The voice acting, narrative style, and graphics were pretty dismal.  It was disappointing that many liberties were taken with the animations and such during the game (for example, sawing down a ladder is replaced with you basically just touching it and it disappearing while a saw sound plays in the background). I finished it, but I was really glad when I realized I didn't have to play it any more.			"

The painfully cliche puzzles, the stilted animations, the times where you went to find a walkthrough only to learn that no, there was absolutely no way you were going to get that one?Yep. I stopped playing when I came across a dice-throwing puzzle, to which it was literally the luck of the dice. You win when the game decides you get to.			"

												If you want to rip your brain out through your nose as you try to decipher the puzzles, with no instructions whatsoever sure, go ahead. Prepare to spend half an hour trying to work out what is being asked of you and then repeatedly bashing your head against the wall as you realise how simple it was. If only they had given you some BLOODY INSTRUCTIONS.I spent this game with one monitor on the game, and the other showing a walkthrough. Add to that the poor animation of the characters. Yes, I know, it is an old game but surely it doesn't take much to synchronize the mouth movements with the terrible voice actors (yes, I'm looking at Watson.)Now I am either real stupid in which case I'll go sit myself on the step and think about my life choices, or you HAVE to be Sherlock Holmes to complete this game solo.

												Unbearably boring and nonsense. The sound is very bad and the writers didn't really care it looks like to me, or maybe they were to stupid to understand that modern terminology and English has changed in quite a few ways. Its like watching a movie about the American Revolution and everybody is either talking in Southern Accents or in Modern Britich accents. It can only be entertaining to people to stupid to know or to ignorant to care. First case is a grand example of everything wrong with this type of writing. Ridiculous drivel from a really low budget game. Visuals and audio are awful enough. They have the same voice actor as the Templar game as Sherlock.It is♥♥♥♥♥♥ You just walk around clicking until you get something right and the actual mystery solving is so boring that you might aswell be playing a virtual novel on rails.Puzzles are horrible. Especially if you don't have innate knowledge of what they rely on like the game of Chess, or they are just so poorly telegraphed you waste a stupid amount of time figuring out what your doing.			"

												Complete croc and♥♥♥♥♥♥ The characters aside from the main ones were brutally modeled. And despite being a dialogue heavy game, no one seems to have any decent lip syncing. Not to mention the voice acting itself. While the actors sound the part, none of them can give a proper performance using the attrocious dialogue written. It sounds like the writers simply copied sir conan doyle's writing pattern and expected it to translate to voice. Not to mention the fact that they clearly don't know how to properly write this kind of stuff. Watson sounds like an imbecile gawking in awe of the ""great"" sherlock, who did nothing but walk around and look at the crime scene, and while yes that's what he does in the the rest of the stuff, there was to presentation of what sherlock actually does, which is observe. Instead we get Sherlock wandering around a room clicking on anything with a magnefying glass and then when he has to reveal the big secret? a Monkey did it. ooh, spoilers, sorry for ruining the tutorial for you. Sorry, but they are writing sherlock as a detective novel when the books were never detective novels they were adventure novels ABOUT a detective. there's a big difference.			"

												Pretty decent investigative adventure (point and click) game.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the original Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  It too me about 14 hours to complete.Although the story is dark and not for children, it largely feels like something a modern Sir AC Doyle would write (which I thought was good).  At times, its tone can be off-putting, but once you reach the final act, it moves along quite well.  The end left me with an unresolved question though...The visuals are particularly good with rich textures and high-quality models of people and late-19th century London.  The lip-sync algorithm is rather poor for parts of the game.  Any facial effects on the kids from the intro scene look bad.Character control is clunky when turning in small quarters.  In open areas, it's just fine.The game's puzzles range from a couple quite simple ones to some which are complex.  When stuck in an environment puzzle, make sure to check if you can combine items in your inventory as well as checking the local area for items you may have missed.			"

												Like most games of this era, this is needlessly Darker&Edgier, has better graphics and sucks at everything else:- Sherlock is completely unrecognizable. Instead of a borderline autistic nerd with perfectly good intentions, Holmes comes off as a dubious sociopath in the vein of James Bond (well beyond what the plot requires).- The game holds your hand way too much (I guess they wanted to market it to millenials or something).- As in some previous installments, the themes are also non-Sherlockian and more Broken Sword-ish.- The ending is rushed and impossible to reconcile with the persona Holmes has displayed to that point.- Really the only good part about this game is Watson, who, though whinier than usual, does get to finally be useful and play through his strengths (medicine, background as soldier).

												I started off by playing ""Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishment""; which I enjoyed immensely. As I moved backwards in time to ""The Testament of Sherlock Holmes"", I actually found it even better. The puzzles are harder and it is substantially more engaging to follow the same story all the way through. To a lesser extent do you get to know what Sherlock is up to all the time and you cannot really go wrong - as you actually can in ""Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishment"" (a great feature of the game). You will be stuck until you figure it out, in other words, but that's alright.			"

												Every once in a while I think to myself, ""I want to play a game where I get to solve a mystery,"" and then I splurge on a game and am soon reminded that I detest those type of games because they're inevitably point-and-click games, which is possibly my least favorite video game genre. This is a point-and-click game, but the first person view made it bearable for me. Some of the puzzles were good, others weren't so great, and I unabashedly followed guides for some. I was really intrigued by the story for a portion of the game, but eventually I came to the conclusion that it really didn't make that much sense.Overall, it more or less helped me feel like a detective, and it was an enjoyable experience for the most part, so I'm giving it a thumbs up.

												Meh.Pros:The story was, in it's entirety, quite good.... very similar to the Reichenbach Fall. I was dubious about how this game would be playable at all, because the charm of Sherlock Holmes is that his mind functions completely differently from a normal human being. Putting yourself in his place kinda defeats the purpose of Sherlock because his one awesome trait is gutted. They did a good job of allowing the player to experience the workings of his mind as an outsider.Cons:There were points in this game where I felt myself actually falling asleep. My playtime isn't anything close to 25 hours, there were a couple occasions where I found myself closing my eyes and just went to bed without closing the game. Also, even when you save your game, it takes you back to the start of the level, which means it makes more sense to just leave the game running in the background instead of quitting because you'll lose a good chunk of your progress. This game is similar to the Telltage Games where it's basically a point and click adventure. Everything is very linear, there's no real gameplay beyond a few really simple logic puzzles and clicking around on things. The voice acting is very, very, VERY wooden. The UI is pretty terrible. The maps are very static.... With rare exception, nothing movies, nobody interacts with the environment, and the vast majority of those exceptions are during cutscenes. I was shocked that such a small game took something like 9gb to install. I think we're advanced enough that we could have a dynamic room to actually pick around and gather clues instead of a very-static room. It felt almostl ike 7th guest, which I played 20 years ago. You'd think we would have moved on past that.There's no replay value unless you want to speedrun it, and then you must be really bored.Also, during the final credits, it plays a new song and does these really aweesome Guy Ritchie stylized credits. It makes you wonder ""Why the hell did they put so much creativity and effort into the credits when the game is bad enough that very few people actually bother getting to them? Why did I have to listen to the same 1 or 2 songs when they had this pretty awesome song just waiting for the rare times that someone gets to the credits?2/5			"

												The Testament of Sherlock Holmes is actually an altogether engaging and, well, FUN experience. I haven't played any of the other Sherlock Holmes games, but after over 30 hours and after getting all of the achievements, I think I still have enough experience to say that it's definitely worth a playthrough. Maybe it's not so much worth the $40, but it's definitely worth $20 or so. I actually received mine as a gift due to some extra credit being offered for a college class, it being near my birthday, and it going on sale around the same time, so I am quite pleased with it! A solid 4/5 from me. Watson could have used some more time to shine toward the beginning, but the ending of the game makes the whole trip worth it-- even the occasional ridiculous puzzle!			"

I would recomend this game to you if you are a fan of puzzle games and sherlock holmes, but be prepared to be annoyed with your caracter movement and a few bugs during the gameplay. Another problem is that it took me two days to make the game run, it simply wasn't working after downloading it from steam. on foruns you can find many people that have the same problem and no patch is released to fix it.

												Meh. Not too bad I guess. The story is somewhat interesting. Finding objects and clues is pretty fun. But it has many flaws. The lipsincing is very off. You are given no clue whatsoever to what you're supposed to be doing or what you're looking for. Basically you're pixelhunting constantly and you must find every single thing otherwise you cannot progress. Even if you know what you're supposed to be doing. Some puzzels can be pretty hard. Good thing you get a skip option after a while. I still liked it in the end. Not everyone might enjoy it however. 6/10			"

												Still trying to get through the game, but while it has it's moments, it is so mundane and tedious. The story would be passable, if it had some element of gameplay, But there is ABSOLUTELY no game involved. You don't have choices to make, you can't leave one room to get to another until you uncover all the clues, in the correct order, and there is no possible way to get them wrong. Some of the puzzles are boarder line impossible, well, not really, but they take a long time to figure out. But again, you can't fail, and you can just skip them. For the story, there is no way to die, no way to get caught, no way to fail, no way to move on to a different objective until the one your on is done. There are no choices to make, no deviation from a very linear story. Even in the conversations where it looks like you have options, you don't, it just rotates through the options until you get to the correct one.There is one fairly funny point, where as watson, you're talking to this landlady, and the conversation goes""I'm a medical doctor and I'm here to see a patient who is losing his teeth, it's highly contagious""she replies ""leave, or you'll be one losing your teeth""so he says ""I'm with the department of health to inspect the neighborhood for (something, I forget)""and she says ""something something, get out of here""so he says ""I'm a painter, here to paint your portrait""So far, three times I've been wandering around trying to figure out why I can't move forward in the story, and looked in my inventory to see I have three peices of rope, but haven't combined all 3 to make a longer rope, or I have a bottle of water and a dry cloth, but the quest needs a damp cloth... or that you have the wrong item highlighted in the corner of the screen, so while you need to cut something, it's not the knife, it's the clippers, or that you need to pick up the pipe to hit the glass, but you inspected the pipe before inspecting the note, so you didn't pick it up, and after reading the note, you have to go back and inspect the pipe again, this time picking it up, even though nothing in the note had anything to do with the pipe, it just wasn't in the required, pre-determined order.Luckily, half way into the game, after about 3 hours of mindlessly clicking on every blue (luckily they turn green after you've finished the sequence in the correct order, but also turn from blue to green and back to blue if done out of order when you unlock the sequence you should have done them in, which gets frustrating) and an hour or two of puzzles (there's really only about 6 in total, one of them, the roman numeral box, can be done correctly, but not the ""correct"" correct way, which was also frustrating) they have about a 20 minute cutscene to recap what actually happened in the story up to that point. Which is pretty much necessary, because you're so mindbent on mindless clicking and backtracking (if that's possible never leaving the same place, more just walking in circles to the same objects over and over) that you have no idea how all the broken fragments of the story are supposed to fit together. I completely forgot who the guy I was following was in the third act of the first scene.Even in what I assume to be the final act, which is a stealth mission, sort of, you can't get caught. You can run into view of the guard, and you just get turned around to look for the blue icon you haven't finished. By this point, they've even given up explaining why you're looking for them or how they work, you just run along the edges of the room until you see a blue icon, then rotate through the 3-4 things in your inventory until one of them works.The achievements in this game even get annoying. Since you can't do anything outside of the pre-determined linear story mode, you finish the last blue icon, and you get the achievement for that area... but there is still no way to not get the achievement.Anyways, the game is good enough for a time waster, and has some good puzzles, but just realize there is absolutely ZERO game in this game. The story is fine, it's pretty bland, but for a sherlock holmes story, it goes exactly how you would imagine. Sadly, you have absolutely no contribution to this story, no matter what you do, how hard you try to succeed or intentionally fail, you just can't. You either do things exactly how they were programmed and go on to the next chapter, or you stand there, and wait, until you do things how they are programmed and move on to the next chapter.			"

												Spoilers Ahead.     First of all, I just want to thank Frogwares for making this game. I for one am I Sherlock Holmes fan, and have played most of Frogware's titles. The thing about their previous games within my experience are, they tend to glitch out at the point where I'm not able to proceed and finish the game. The Silver Earrings. I got stuck in the master's office. The Awakened. Watson wasn't able to follow up in order for the cutscene. Jack the Ripper. It didn't allow me to interact with clues without pulling me into the inspection of A. Chapman. This is the 2nd title I've finish from Frogwares. The 1st being Sherlock Holmes vs. Nemesis (Arsen Lupin). What I'd like to point out about Frogwares is that within their storylines, they tend to blow things out of proportion and pulling straws out of the blue in order to progress. In this game, they've managed to do the same thing with very nice and touching plot twists.     The gameplay portion of it surely improved a lot from the previous games. The interface is beautiful, along with the enhanced graphics and such. From its predecessors, it was from an omniscience point of view. First-person was then added in the series, finally third-person. It gave their gamers a versatile choice. Allowing to use mouse only, keyboard only, and mouse and keyboard. It's an improved feature, but some of the time you'll have to switch between the views in order to interact with some of the clues. I did enjoy the 360 angle inspection feature, truely great idea. All in all, they certainly evolved this series from a point-and-click adventure to something similar to L.A. Noire, another great title. The only thing you really need a guide for are the puzzles, anything else is self-explained and you just need to explore and interact more.     Moving along with the storyline. Now with this game's story, it's not neccesary for playing some of the older games; however, it'll be somewhat helpful to understand just a bit. The story just slowly let's the gamers view that Sherlock does some questionable things. Slowly tarnishing his name and reputation, also making some of the gamers not liking him. The authors surely did a great job doing so, in order for some plot twists. Then there's the whole taking things out of proportion. First scene shows of three toddlers, and how they're connected to Sherlock and John. Moving on with the story it appears to be that they're grand children of Sherlock and John. How Sherlock, one of the greatest minds can also become the greatest criminal, ruined his reputation by handling the rich with a fake heirloom, rigging a bomb to murder a judge, and murdering an inspector. Here comes the first great plot twist as it was Moriarty whom set to frame Sherlock. Graspped from the straws, because in the previous games (The Awakned) Moriarty has lost his mind and was in an asylum. Though it did eliminated the possibility of him being behind all of it. Then it was grasping straws by pulling in the Prince by teaming him with Moriarity. Second great plot tiwst was that Moriarty has been hiding a child of his own all this time. After his last breathe, he told only Sherlock is worthy of teaching her. Sherlock moved by it raised the child from child to adult. From a beautiful young woman, to a married woman. The girl then birthed a child, a young girl. The girl from the first scene. This was a great scene, as it showed Sherlock didn't turn away from one of his most ignored subject. Love.			"

												This is the worst of point and clicks I have played. It is also the worst Sherlock Holmes example I have seen. Ever. (Non parody, that is.) The puzzles are poorly explained, and the story feels like a detective comedey, rather than a Sherlock Holmes story of science and philosophy. In most puzzle games, I fail to see obvious answers. This game is so complicated that I am literaly forced to use a walkthrough constantly. Some puzzles I can see logicly, others (chemical test) I can not. I looked for a walkthrough that could explian it, and didn't find one. The thing about Sherlock is that the important science is EXPLAINED! How do we tell that the man is tall? The distance between foot prints. How does it help? The height of a human is determined by the length of his legs, yes? Well the longer the legs, the longer the strides. See? Simple in the end. That's the essance of Holmes, that it's all simple in the end. Over the course of reading every single book, I should know that it's possible to pause time and find all the details on a person and find out what they're up to. After Sherlock explains the science in the books, you said, ""... ooooooooooooooooooh. Duh, It was there the whole time!"" Same with the Robert Downey Jr. movies. The new BBC Sherlock show gives a very similar feeling, but you get to see Sherlocks way of seeing things. He translates shapes of scratches and the dampness of things immediatly with what in the end is right. What about this games puzzles? Pishaw. Portal gave a better Sherlock Holmes ""I really missed that?"" kind of feeling then this game. My feelings were either ""Finaly, the skip button."" or ""Is that the puzzle? Why didn't it tell me what I was supposed to be finding?"" The game is as subtle as the knife, as complicated as the clockwork robots, and as boring as a special needs school full of mutes to Bill Nye. As a student. Also, what the hell is going on here? I don't know the story. Bad thing.			"

												Right off the bat I can say that The Testament of Sherlock Holmes is my favorite P&C from frogware with the master detective.Pros: - many a great puzzle and a skip option if you get really stuck - a dense murder mystery with few but good twists thrown inbetween - lovely sets, nice little details - goodish graphics - I love the voice acting - deduction board for casesCons: - animation is still stiff and borderline silly - looong loading times Verdict:The Testament of Sherlock Holmes is an above average 3D point and click adventure.You get to control Holmes, and on occasion Dr Watson, through a great story that covers a lot of ground.From the lowliest slums to the high society, you will be dragged through many well designed set pieces on your hunt.Fans of both Sherlock Holmes and P&C should give this a serious consideration (given that you survive the creepy intro)			"

												I highly recommend this game to any Sherlock Holmes fans! The story is very interesting, and some of the puzzles are surprisingly challenging. At first the way they frame the story with some little kids reading Watson's journal around 50 years later is annoying, but it gets pretty cute later on. And there's one part where you get to play as a dog.			"

												A truely marvelous game! The storyline is very well written and the puzzles you have to solve are very well created! The different characters have quite a bit of depth behind them. The dialogue in this game is pretty good, in contrast to the lip-syncing which is very bad (or not present).Visually the graphics aren't all that, in my opinion some of the textures used where not propperly mapped (The front of Sherlock's hat for example, or the cemetery trees) and some of the normal maps used where a bit strong (for example: the whitechapel wall, surrounding the church). The game however really places you in 19th century london and you'll continuesly will find yourself driven to see what happens next!The ending left me with a few questions, which I will not spoil here. I would have liked to see these answers questioned, which is a small letdown. I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes a game where you actually have to think in order to solve the different puzzles (there is also a skip-function for each puzzle, however one would not get an achievement by using this shortcut).Pros:-Well written storyline-Great atmosphere-Clever puzzlesCons:-Sometimes you will find yourself stuck, because you missed one tiny detail-Poor lip-syncing-The graphics are not that greatRating: 7.5/10""What should we do next Holmes?""

												I like this game, but the genre isn't for everyone. It could be called ""Mensa's Revenge"". Every stage of the game has at least one mind bending puzzle. So far I have solved 15 of them, and I am only on the third case. The metascore rating is 73, but I would give it a solid 80. I've read reviews of other Holmes games that say that the voice acting is not good, but the Holmes and Wastson characters here are very good. If you love puzzles and sleuthing, this is the game for you. If you love non-stop action, this game would disappoint you. One tip: You CAN click a button for ""hints"" on how to proceed, but don't do that because you lose points for not being able to solve the problem yourself. All in all, this is a very polished production. If you are up for a mental challenge, this is the game for you.			"

												Although this game presents an original story not based on Doyle's very own, it's all been very well done. The story is engaging and I found myself wanting to know what happens next..! It's not too difficult and as pixel hunty as most adventure game, but it presents itself with a great story, strong voice acting and lovely visuals.

												In twenty years of PC gaming, this is one of the best adventure games I've ever played.  So many reviews begin that way, but there isn't any other way to put it.  The Testament of Sherlock Holmes had not only the many hours of gameplay I was looking for, in actually double what I expected, but engaging puzzles, the ability to switch characters (we even get to be Toby for a part of the playthrough!) a terrific storyline weaving past and present, and emotional tugs at my heart I hardly expected in a Holmes & Watson adventure.  I happened to get this on sale and can't believe the bargain in entertainment I received, but would still highly recommend it at full price.   If you love first person adventure, mystery, Sherlock Holmes, and well-crafted storylines with beautiful, rich scenes, this is the game for you.			"

												My first SH game.  The only other SH game in my inventory is Crime and Punishment.  Looking forward to it after this one.  Some nice puzzles.  A few of the puzzles relied more on trial and error than actual logic but enjoyable for the most part.  My only negative comment is that there were a few spots where I found myself running back and forth looking for the one little clickable that I missed (even with spamming Sixth Sense).  Scenes were nice.  Really enjoyed the deduction board and wish it had been utilized more.. felt like the game started with heavy use of the deduction board but then just stopped using it entirely around 40% of the way through.All in all, 7/10			"

												""SImplicity Itself""This is the phrase used by Holmes upon solving many puzzles in the game, but the actual puzzles themselves are far from it. As a primarily point and click puzzle solving game, the puzzles start off fairly easy, but by the end are some of the most diabolical I've seen in a game. This is not a game for those easily frustrated by difficult and vague puzzles. However, if you can handle the brain strain, or cop out and skip the puzzles altogether, you will find a story that is gripping until the very end. There were many times where I was genuinly excited to see where the story would turn next, and how the next twist would come into play. Even though i was personally getting tired of the puzzles near the end, the brilliant story of this game kept me hooked until the very end.			"

												The Testament of Sherlock Holmes is a good compromise between old-style adevnture games and new-era 3D adventure games with richer stories and cutscenes. It's also better than its sequel which emphasizes too much on the new-era style.The variety of the puzzles is enjoyable and almost everyone is decently implemented. The good thing is that every puzzle is integrated in the scenario and not here just for the purpose or making your brain working (I do not like point and click games like Myst). The difficulty is also not too high and not too low, decently made overall even if the difficulty does not improve over time.The gameplay is really good if you play on first person mode, OK at third person. I chose the last option because I like viewing my character but sometimes I switched to FP mode because of the limitations of the TP mode. In fact, it's harder to target a location sometimes while in TP mode. Still, it's not horrible to play, just a bit harder. I played it with both gamepad and mouse/keybord and I prefer the first option even if I'm an old PC player.The graphics are OK technically speaking and retranscribe well the londonish atmosphere. English voices (which were impossible to pair with french subtitles - which was not a problem because I understand english - even with the developpers tips for steam version) are really well made, especially Holmes voice which retranscribes well the personality of the character.The narrative part is nice even if some events seem far-fetched like what we can see in spectacular american movies. I enjoyed the whole plot and the narrative which is really above the pack for this type of games (without the sacrifice of the gameplay like in telltale games). The whole story is well critten and I admit I doubted about Holmes loyalty. Maybe the last chapter in the amusement park was a bit disappointing but still good.Finally, this game is really solid. I recommend it strongly to people who enjoy a good mix between narrative and old-style puzzles. Sherlock Holmes games are really the best adventure games series nowadays  even if the last episode orientation is disturbing.			"

												An interesting and fun take on an Adventure style game. Taking the role as Sherlock Holmes you are Investigating the Disappearance of a precious necklace, which soon leads Sherlock and Dr. Watson down a path of corruption, death, murder and betrayal.The gameplay is that of the detective style which Sherlock Holmes is, essentially like Batman but without the suit, the gadgets, self defence abilities and the money.It goes by 3 separate angles for the camera, ranging rom point and click 3rd person, to controing the movement and camera with 3rd person, to first person.You are given the ablility to control more than just Sherlock, but the variety in what they can do is not too much.The puzzles are numerous and can be incredibly challenging, ill admit to having to look up a few, but for the most part they can be fun puzzles if not confusing at times.The story is very good, quite captivating at times, and length wise is laid out pretty good.All in all if your looking for a run and gun action shoot em up, or even a Robert Downey Jr. esque Sherlock Holmes this isn't it, this is a thought provoing, time taking detective game which is fun if your a fan of Sherlock Holmes or even Detective puzzle style games.

												The puzzles in this game surpass any modern puzzle game I've ever played, bar none, yes, even ""Braid.""  I'm playing this game on hard; but, talk about stupid hard!  I'm sure others could be quicker (but I'm no slouch) and it's taking me 10-15 mins to figure out how to solve each puzzle, before actually starting to solve the actual puzzle.  I almost gave up on three of them, because, I didn't know whether or not I was even on the right track (and I'm still only in the second chapter).   Games like this don't come around often --  very rarely will a  game frustrate me to the point of considering cheating with a strategy guide or youtube video.

												The Testament of Sherlock Holmes is actually an altogether engaging and, well, FUN experience. I haven't played any of the other Sherlock Holmes games, but after over 30 hours and after getting all of the achievements, I think I still have enough experience to say that it's definitely worth a playthrough. Maybe it's not so much worth the $40, but it's definitely worth $20 or so. I actually received mine as a gift due to some extra credit being offered for a college class, it being near my birthday, and it going on sale around the same time, so I am quite pleased with it! A solid 4/5 from me. Watson could have used some more time to shine toward the beginning, but the ending of the game makes the whole trip worth it-- even the occasional ridiculous puzzle!			"

												I am a big fan of the Sherlock Holmes games. I love the character, I love the mysteries, I love the atmosphere, and I love the pixel-hunting. There, I said it! Now that I've gotten that back, let me tell you what I think of the Testement of Sherlock Holmes.First, the good things. 1. As usual, the atmosphere is spot on. And I could swear that the dialogue is written by Conan Doyle himself. It genuinely feels like a Sherlock Holmes adventure. 2. The investigation is really well done. Whenever you need to search a body for marks or a room for clues, it feels like L. A. Noire. 3. The tension in the first half of the game is really thrilling. The sense that Sherlock Holmes may be insane, or not who he says he is is gripping and kept me playing to try and decipher why exactly Sherlock Holmes was being so edgy and confrontation. There is no greater conflict in a Sherlock Holmes adventure than questioning the legitimacy of your hero.Now, let's talk about what' bad. 1. Puzzles. Puzzles, Puzzles, Puzzles, Puzzles, Puzzles! Way too many puzzles, and most of them are stupid, complicated, and have no explanation of mechanics, objective, or context. I am grateful that the game includes a ""skip puzzle"" button, but it's a bad sign when it needs to be included. 2. Adventure-game inventory management. In the early game, the investigation of murders was so strong in gameplay, that it was a shock when I started to have to search for random objects with no idea why I needed them or how they were supposed to be used. Most of the rest of the game is classic combine this with that and use it on that. This wouldn't be a problem, if it was simply transitions between one mystery to another. But instead it makes up the majority of gameplay, and doesn't do it particularly well. 3. The ending is completely non-sequitor and the prologue with awkwardly animated and voice-acted children is really poorly handled, it almost felt like a completely different story spliced into one about Sherlock Holmes struggling with an insidious threat to his integrity. 4. I hesitate to mention this, because I am a strong believer that poor graphics, animation, voice acting, etc. can be compensated for by compelling gamplay. And Bullfrog has come a long way since Sherlock Holmes: the Awakened in terms of animation and cinematics, but it still looks pretty amateur, and it would go a long way for their franchise if they worked on animation and cinematic timing.So ultimately, I recommend this game for its strong beginning and great tension. But regret that it missed its mark in a lot of technical respects.			"

												Actually very well done, though sometimes a little buggy and jumpy. The puzzles were pretty clever, as to be expected of a Sherlock Holmes game. The story was a bit lackluster and underdramatic, and the voice acting was a little shoddy, with actors putting a little bit too much overemphasis on some of their characters lines. One of the ""great reveals"" at the end was pretty predictable, at least to anyone has has any two-sense of Sherlock Holmes fiction, and a lot of the story scenes used in the game were mashups of different Holmes stories.  It fits the theme of the older Sherlock Holmes stories however, something people forget about due to the two shows that place Sherlock's tales in a more modern setting. The game contains many references to Sherlock's more famous previous adventures as well, which served as a plus and a great homage to the character's legacy.  The game allowed a great choice of being played in third-person, first-person or even point and click, which is what most games of this genre usually end up being. It was a delight to play in first-person view and search the areas for clues, as if you were the great Holmes himself. Also, playing that random scene as the dog in first person view was a good chuckle.   The game adds the use of a ""Deduction Board"" where you use clues found in the area to piece together the facts of the case. It was a marvelous idea, definitely one of the better features of the game, though I wish it could have been used more than the three times it is in the game.   Overall I think the game is a worthy buy, especially to fans of the mystery/adventure genre. Pick it up, I had good fun with it.  Additionally, the visuals and music during the ending credits sequence were and absolute marvel to watch, if only they had put something similar in the beginning of the game, allowing it to open with such an impact.

												This is one of the best adventures games I've ever played.  The story was deep and immersive with unpredictable twists and turns.  Too many games lead down the same take it or leave it, predictable path but this game grips you and doesn't let go until the very last, moving cut scene.  This is the first Sherlock Holmes game I've played and I'm so pleased I chose this one as I can't see any others matching or surpassing this one.One of the highlights for me was the way the games AI populated the Victorian world with an array of believable and authentic looking people, whether they be poverty stricken waifs and strays or high society.  I love just looking out the windows of their Baker Street room and watching the world pass by!There's just one niggle that spoiled the gameplay at times and that was the AI controlling Watson.  When you're controlling Holmes, and Watson isn't off completing his own mission, Watson has this urge to get right up close to Holmes which often impedes Holmes' movement.  After a while you start to anticipate this behaviour and you go round him before he corners you.  It's an annoyance but overall didn't spoil the game and there are plenty of locations where they explore separately and hence this isn't an issue.Pros:*Character Driven Storyline*Rich, Detailed Locations*Excellent Voice Acting*Cinematic Cut Scenes*Perfect Soundtrack*Thought Provoking Puzzles*20+ Hours GameplayCons:*AI - Character MovementIf you enjoy adventure games you'd be a fool not to play this one!

Another problem is that it took me two days to make the game run, it simply wasn't working after downloading it from steam. on foruns you can find many people that have the same problem and no patch is released to fix it.

												Meh. Not too bad I guess. The story is somewhat interesting. Finding objects and clues is pretty fun. But it has many flaws. The lipsincing is very off. You are given no clue whatsoever to what you're supposed to be doing or what you're looking for. Basically you're pixelhunting constantly and you must find every single thing otherwise you cannot progress. Even if you know what you're supposed to be doing. Some puzzels can be pretty hard. Good thing you get a skip option after a while. I still liked it in the end. Not everyone might enjoy it however. 6/10			"

												é um bom jogo de investigação. Não é SENSACIONAL como o LA Noire, mas é um bom jogo. (O problema de quando vc joga um jogo sensacional de investigação como LA Noire é que vc fica muito exigente com os outros).Da pra se divertir algumas horas... o único problema deste jogo é que ele se limita a vc encontrar as pistas. A decifração delas o próprio Holmes fará automaticamente (pelo menos foi assim na 1ª missão que fiz).Diferentemente do LA NOire. Lá vc consegue as pistas e VOCÊ decifra o crime.. Isso q é o legal....			"

												This game is one of the best I have played. Graphics are amazing, lots of puzzles to solve, locks to open and clues to find. There is great variations in locations visited and with every new scene giving you a exciting feel of what you will discover. I found the puzzles a little tricky at times, but that is what makes it a challenge to play. So if you dont like challenges then this wouldn't be a game for you. Dr Watson is at it again with his spooky ""in your face"" appearance but he is a wonderful contribute to this game and without him it would not be the same. The story its self and the mystery in it to solve, is very clever with lots of unexpected occurances. It has a beautiful ending with a very clear message.			"

												Despite being a rather good looking game, I found there was nothing new in it. The puzzles were barely rebranded versions of a dozen other puzzle games and there was little, other than the fact I'd bought it already, to keep me interested in playing.The 'hint system' is awkward and in most cases useless, there's a lot of going round in circles as you have to inspect the same item more than once with little more than a word to direct you to it. Being that the game lacks a progress tracker, or 'quest log' it's very easy to lose track of where you're supposed to go, doubly so if you get bored of the overly dramatic dialog and skip it.I took the time to finish this game and it frustrated me in all the wrong ways. I definitely wouldn't replay this (although I did miss out on a couple of achievements...) and probably won't play any prequals or sequals.			"

												This game is a GREAT game. There's a fair whack of puzzles, numbers, visuals and item placement. Sometimes it can be a little unclear what instructions are trying to tell you, but you have the option to skip THOSE TERRIBLE MATHS PUZZLES so it's all all right by my book. The cutscenes were a puzzler; if you're running the game at max, the cutscenes are actually of a worse quality so it's like watching a video playback. There's also some new voice acting talent now, which sounds of a higher audio quality (I still love you, old Sherlock Holmes actor). Seems like they're going for more of a Jeremy Brett then Basil Rathbone, which I am a-okay with. Lord but it was a memory guzzler, though. My computer struggled on the autosaved in a way it hasn't since Assassin's Creed: Black Flag. I haven't played SH:C&P but I'm hoping this's been tweaked and autosave has a single file rather then a new one every time. The plot was ace, too- sometimes in a puzzle adventure you'll find yourself knowing the answer to a puzzle and having to take the long way round even though you know the answer, and that only happened a couple of times. I REALLY ENJOYED BEING A DOGTECTIVE.[/spoilers]Get this game. I got it for £5 but man I am considering getting the new one at full price because of how great this one was. "

This game is for people who enjoy the story telling aspect of games rather than the actual game play. Much like the tags describe, this game is completely point and click. There are very few moments where there felt any actual ""danger"" or feeling of potential failure in the game. It is very easy and something recommended for the casual gamer.			"

												One of the better mystery games! Pros: + Good voice acting+ Interesting characters and storyline + Puzzles that won`t make you want to rip your hair out+ Smooth gameplay - no lag (at least for me)+ Good enviroment details (gives a real 1898 London feeling)+ Different settings - You are not always in the same area ALL the time, you basically run around London for a  ton of different reasons.+ Not repetitive - Held my attention+ Lots of twits and turns Cons:- The dialogues could be quite long at times - But, if you are very immersed in it, you will enjoy the dialogues because they are to the point -  never confusing or redundant -  and they explain the plot/mystery well. Who you play as: Sherlock Holmes, Watson, and (at one point) their Basset Hound named Toby.Overall, I liked it - and I would recommend it to any fan of Mystery or Adventure.			"

												Das Videospiel ist fantastisch! Wait why did I go German? Nvm.The game has a pretty awkward mechanics. When I started, I had to force myself to get used to the controling and movement of the character. It almost turned me off immediately. You can switch from third-person view to first and vice versa anytime. First person view makes the best control. But alas, I got used to it and it gets comfortable the further you go. While the mechanics aren't something to cheer about, the game itself provides an excellent and well made story followed by amazing puzzles to be solved. Help yourself and be the detective for once and not go through any walkthrough or guides. The puzzles aren't straightforward and can be really tough but the satisfaction everytime you solve them on your own, fantastisch!This game should set a benchmark for more awesome Sherlock Holmes games to come.

												This is quite superb. All these games are a bunch of fun, and not really hard, and not really well-written (in bits), but for some reason keep hold of being fun throughout. Most of the puzzles are either impossibly vague or painfully easy. Much of the game is also very much, just a hidden object puzzle. I'm not really selling this, but it really is worth a punt. Great small team made a great game here. Also check out the awesome end-credits - not really spoliers -

												Do you love BBC's Sherlock? Or maybe Robert Downey as Holmes? I have a feeling this game is not for you. It should be remembered that this game was created before the badass versions of Sherlock thus you may not find this version interesting. However as an enthusiast of the original tales I found this absolutely brilliant, the story seemed to fit the atmosphere I was reading in the books of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, it was satisfyring and it was thrilling. Sherlock and Watson truly had the impression of the times in which they were written, voice actors were quite good. As for the gameplay, some things were not that satisfying. Puzzle clues sometimes were unclear and made the impression of a different answer leaving you stuck (Don't fret! There's a skip button!) face posing was sometimes off, some characters I wish had better voice acting, and the limits of walking and running locations sometimes make me wish I could go to that area or this but well this is an old game so all these were quite forgivable. Bottomline: $20 indeed seems overpriced for me but things always go on SALE SALE SALE! If you enjoyed the Sherlock Holmes originals you'd probably enjoy this, if you enjoyed the movies ONLY you might not.  Yet this is just an opinion and it would still be up to you to decide. Willing to join Sherlock and Watson unlock secrets of 1898 London? THIS IS YOUR INVESTIGATION			"

												In twenty years of PC gaming, this is one of the best adventure games I've ever played.  So many reviews begin that way, but there isn't any other way to put it.  The Testament of Sherlock Holmes had not only the many hours of gameplay I was looking for, in actually double what I expected, but engaging puzzles, the ability to switch characters (we even get to be Toby for a part of the playthrough!) a terrific storyline weaving past and present, and emotional tugs at my heart I hardly expected in a Holmes & Watson adventure.  I happened to get this on sale and can't believe the bargain in entertainment I received, but would still highly recommend it at full price.   If you love first person adventure, mystery, Sherlock Holmes, and well-crafted storylines with beautiful, rich scenes, this is the game for you.			"

												This is the worst of point and clicks I have played. It is also the worst Sherlock Holmes example I have seen. Ever. (Non parody, that is.) The puzzles are poorly explained, and the story feels like a detective comedey, rather than a Sherlock Holmes story of science and philosophy. In most puzzle games, I fail to see obvious answers. This game is so complicated that I am literaly forced to use a walkthrough constantly. Some puzzles I can see logicly, others (chemical test) I can not. I looked for a walkthrough that could explian it, and didn't find one. The thing about Sherlock is that the important science is EXPLAINED! How do we tell that the man is tall? The distance between foot prints. How does it help? The height of a human is determined by the length of his legs, yes? Well the longer the legs, the longer the strides. See? Simple in the end. That's the essance of Holmes, that it's all simple in the end. Over the course of reading every single book, I should know that it's possible to pause time and find all the details on a person and find out what they're up to. After Sherlock explains the science in the books, you said, ""... ooooooooooooooooooh. Duh, It was there the whole time!"" Same with the Robert Downey Jr. movies. The new BBC Sherlock show gives a very similar feeling, but you get to see Sherlocks way of seeing things. He translates shapes of scratches and the dampness of things immediatly with what in the end is right. What about this games puzzles? Pishaw. Portal gave a better Sherlock Holmes ""I really missed that?"" kind of feeling then this game. My feelings were either ""Finaly, the skip button."" or ""Is that the puzzle? Why didn't it tell me what I was supposed to be finding?"" The game is as subtle as the knife, as complicated as the clockwork robots, and as boring as a special needs school full of mutes to Bill Nye. As a student. Also, what the hell is going on here? I don't know the story. Bad thing.			"

												This game has some a somewhat unique interface. It takes some getting used to to navigate your character (there are three different modes to control and move your character throughout the game). Once you found your favorite playstyle the game just gets very addictive to play, the puzzles are nice and sometimes can drive you crazy (well some logic puzzles do). I can recommend this game to anyone who likes mysteries and is fond of solving logic puzzles.			"

												This is the worst of point and clicks I have played. It is also the worst Sherlock Holmes example I have seen. Ever. (Non parody, that is.) The puzzles are poorly explained, and the story feels like a detective comedey, rather than a Sherlock Holmes story of science and philosophy. In most puzzle games, I fail to see obvious answers. This game is so complicated that I am literaly forced to use a walkthrough constantly. Some puzzles I can see logicly, others (chemical test) I can not. I looked for a walkthrough that could explian it, and didn't find one. The thing about Sherlock is that the important science is EXPLAINED! How do we tell that the man is tall? The distance between foot prints. How does it help? The height of a human is determined by the length of his legs, yes? Well the longer the legs, the longer the strides. See? Simple in the end. That's the essance of Holmes, that it's all simple in the end. Over the course of reading every single book, I should know that it's possible to pause time and find all the details on a person and find out what they're up to. After Sherlock explains the science in the books, you said, ""... ooooooooooooooooooh. Duh, It was there the whole time!"" Same with the Robert Downey Jr. movies. The new BBC Sherlock show gives a very similar feeling, but you get to see Sherlocks way of seeing things. He translates shapes of scratches and the dampness of things immediatly with what in the end is right. What about this games puzzles? Pishaw. Portal gave a better Sherlock Holmes ""I really missed that?"" kind of feeling then this game. My feelings were either ""Finaly, the skip button."" or ""Is that the puzzle? Why didn't it tell me what I was supposed to be finding?"" The game is as subtle as the knife, as complicated as the clockwork robots, and as boring as a special needs school full of mutes to Bill Nye. As a student. Also, what the hell is going on here? I don't know the story. Bad thing.			"

												Didn't play much got bored, alot of conclusions within the deduction part of the game feel abitrary and holmes doesn't give any witty reasoning to your choices being either bad or good other than a simple ""thats not it"" or ""yup"". Casing the scene you pretty much click on all the things. Most decisions you make when trying to solve a case are 3 choice multiple choice and if your wrong it tells you, and once you pick the right one it doesn't even reward you with an explanation as to why that's the correct. The game explains things terribly, mass effect style diaogue selectors that seem to have no impact at all, and it is easy to skip dialogue when clicking on diffrent things. Mabye it picks up later on, but was bored to tears.			"

												Note: Don't pay attention to my played time, as the game is only ~12 hours long.The Testament of Sherlock Holmes starts off very, very poorly. Thankfully, the game quickly improves and turns into a fairly interesting Sherlock Holmes mystery which is very reminiscent of some of the original tales. Just please, skip the painful cutscenes with the creepy attic children.Keep in mind that while there are a few ""deduction boards"" and puzzles that require deduction, that this is primarily a fairly traditional adventure game. Expect lots of running around, trying to find the random items that the game has decided you should be able to pick up, and then the using of those items (sometimes after some combining) on various locations. Also present are a fair number of (mostly) generic ""toy"" puzzles, some of which you've probably seen before if you've played any Professor Layton/mobile puzzle games. Think (very basic) chess-themed puzzles, unraveling a bunch of ""tangled"" ropes, or determining which person is in which position (based on a set of hints).While the game is far from perfect, and there are definitely some awkward moments within, it's overall a fairly enjoyable mystery-themed adventure game.

												I am a huge fan of the novels and short stories, and previous PC titles such as The Serrated Scalpel and The Case of the Rose Tattoo, but I cannot recommend this. The writing is clumsy and the dialogue moves from acceptable to laughable. Some textures look fine, while others look decades old. The lighting is poor, the lip-syncing is terrible, and the locations feel like movie sets rather Victorian London. There are only 3-4 deduction board sequences and their questions are either ridiculously easy or you are not provided with enough information (for example, the information you are given to solve it matches several of the possible answers). There is no penalty for guessing wrong, so you just answer the easy ones and guess on the others until they're correct. Most of the puzzles in the game are combination puzzles. It is absolutely laughable how many people in 19th Century London owned puzzle lock boxes, I think 1 in 2 NPCs in this game have one. The game begins to take the♥♥♥♥♥♥when a door in the sewers has a puzzle lock. There are also some very silly padding sequences, like when you are given control of Toby the bloodhound. It is often condescending, provides an insulting portrayal of Holmes and Watson, and is just generally a very poor game. I should have stayed away from these 3D Holmes games after the first two were so bad. I miss the old Mythos Software series.			"

												""SImplicity Itself""This is the phrase used by Holmes upon solving many puzzles in the game, but the actual puzzles themselves are far from it. As a primarily point and click puzzle solving game, the puzzles start off fairly easy, but by the end are some of the most diabolical I've seen in a game. This is not a game for those easily frustrated by difficult and vague puzzles. However, if you can handle the brain strain, or cop out and skip the puzzles altogether, you will find a story that is gripping until the very end. There were many times where I was genuinly excited to see where the story would turn next, and how the next twist would come into play. Even though i was personally getting tired of the puzzles near the end, the brilliant story of this game kept me hooked until the very end.			"

												Really enjoyed playing this game. It was the first SH game I played and I didn't really know what to expect - which is why I played it together with boyfriend in case the game got too jump-scary. Luckily it was nothing like that and I fell in love with the game superfast and now I want to play more from the same series. Puzzles and storyline were interesting and the only minus I would give to the game is how the movement controls on the gamepad were a bit awkward at times. The high point of the game was definitely when you got to be a dog. A DOG!! Oh this game <3			"

And they have always been lacking in terms of controls. They are mindbogglingly stupid. Too many glitches make the game annoying. They take away from solving puzzles which in most cases are pretty good and difficult.

I might try and obtain the remaining 5 achievements at some point in the distant future when I feel like playing through it again.All in all, it was fun for a few hours, I wish it had been longer and had a better ending, I didn't mind the controls too much even though they were a little strange but I was able to play through the game despite that.

												In twenty years of PC gaming, this is one of the best adventure games I've ever played.  So many reviews begin that way, but there isn't any other way to put it.  The Testament of Sherlock Holmes had not only the many hours of gameplay I was looking for, in actually double what I expected, but engaging puzzles, the ability to switch characters (we even get to be Toby for a part of the playthrough!) a terrific storyline weaving past and present, and emotional tugs at my heart I hardly expected in a Holmes & Watson adventure.  I happened to get this on sale and can't believe the bargain in entertainment I received, but would still highly recommend it at full price.   If you love first person adventure, mystery, Sherlock Holmes, and well-crafted storylines with beautiful, rich scenes, this is the game for you.			"

												I don't usually review, but I'm so angry at this game I feel the burning need to share it with other people. Mind, it's entierly possible I'm just an idiot and can't interpret the interface, but I played the Testament of Sherlock Holmes from the same game developper and had no problems at all. This, however, is a hot mess!First, to whoever thought quick time events would be a great addition to this type of game, please go take a long walk off a short pier. Puzzle games based on observation and slow deductions are not a good mix with quick time events, especially unanounced and very poorly intigrated ones where the prompt is easily missed.Second, the autosave function is horrific. There doesn't seem to be an option to manually save, and I have yet to see where/what the ""autosaving"" cue is, and so have no way of knowing when my game saves, and when it is safe for me to close and go do something else. Extremely stressful, especially when dealing with a slow puzzle game. I don't what to have to spend 15 minutes looking at the same clues again! Third, and this is what finally made me quit in disgust and uninstall, I was trying to put together the clues in the deduction portion and ""A"" + ""B"" did not work, but ""B"" + ""A"" worked. No, sorry, I'm not going to fiddle around with who knows how many posibilities just to get that sort of fiddly nonsense done.			"

The one down side is that at times you have to be in the exact position to click on an object, a little too close or too far (even though you know it's the right object) and the blue icon does not show up.  As far as the Sherlock Holmes side of things, the story is quite nice and puts in many things from across the Sherlock Holmes stories.  Overall this is a very good game.			"

The enviroments are well detailed and a lot of fun to explore. Bad points, some of the gameplay feels a little too wooden, like your on rails and you can sweep an aera finding nothing, just to discover you had to speak to someone before picking up an item, this can lead to confusion and ultimatly frustration but this is ofset by the strengths or great story and puzzles.

												The game grabs you into the world of Sir A C. Doyle matermind detective Sherlock Holmes in a very well manner way. The story is very gripping and the puzzles are fun. The game start like a very promising adventure game. Well performed voice acting, excellent and varied environment and exciting investigation set the tone. The graphics may not be upto date for many, and the controls are stiff and sometimes difficult to deal with. Nevertheless, it had its charm, and I wanted to see what happened next as the investigation revealed a web of different threads that had a connection I should get discover. The way Sherlock portrayed on fidelity, and it fits well in this context. He is the type who does not care about what others think, because he knows he is  always right. His counterpart , Dr. Watson, is also well poytrayted, and the dialogue between them entertains.To resolve matters using ""Deduction board"" I thought that was an interesting way to do it. Here I got really used the brain, and it gave a great sense of achievement when I understood the context. Unfortunately there were not enough of these, in my opinion. I would like to see that they made a few more varieties of these, and fewer of mini games that were too difficult gradually. If they had evened it out so that it was more different  methods for solving problems and more options to solve a case,I would be impressed. Yet overall a very decent adeventure game			"

												To the gameplay: Many (aswell common) puzzles that are sometimes very challenging. Switching between Thrid Person, First Person or BirdEye allows you to play the games in your favourit way. Its anything else but repeating - sometimes you have to analyse liquids, sometimes you have to cut open people and the conclusion board is a diam!To the Story: Sherlock Holmes has no moral such in threating people to get what he wants. Same as in the books the character is shown as brutal, egocentric but also smart and well-known. Watson is his moral-companion. Many reference to the books aswell as realy nice settings!...fkn loving it!  "

												Being an avid fan of Sherlock Holmes games, I have to say this had the most compelling story so far. Although its predecessors were also very intriguing, their plots twists and endings were somewhat obvious, because most gamers were very familiar with stories of Arsene Lupin, Jack the Ripper and Lovecraft. This one kept me interested and guessing throughout the game and I was pleasantly surprised with the ending. Some small details may put you off in the beginning but rest assured that all will be very neatly explained towards the end a la Sherlock Holmes fashion. It is very nicely paced also and character driven instead of the usual murder mystery thriller style, which works very well with the theme and feels fresh.Apart from the story, the gameplay is easy to get used to but you can still see the console port forced in there when you look at the user interfaces.  A point&click camera angle can be used to bypass this effect but the menus remain the same of course. Looking at the mechanics involved (besides the puzzles), one thing that really fascinates me is that almost every Sherlock Holmes game tries to invent some new gameplay element. Don't get me wrong I don't mind designers experimenting with the gameplay but I expect the see the good ones becoming permanent mechanics in the series. For example, the Ripper murder scene investigation method is gone now, which is a pity. There seems to be a dialogue wheel present in the game which serves no purpose whatsoever. Deduction board is still fun and there is a very good puzzle element involved with it. But sadly the game does not use it very often, for reasons unknown to this reviewer. Inventory puzzles are not annoying contrary to the rest of the genre. But pixel hunting nightmares strike once or twice during the game (I encourage gamers to consult a walkthough at these points because they're not worth wasting time over, you should just get on with the story instead). The game would have been a better one without them sure but none of these gets in our way of enjoying the story and marveling at Sherlock’s wit and prowess. Putting aside all these bumps, the game plays well and is long enough to satisfy the average user (15 hours).  Board puzzles are nicely done and interact with the world in a sensible way (as far as these sort of games go).  Watson and Sherlock’s dialogues are smart and funny as always and the delivery is very good, though the pace is a bit off; you get too long pauses between some lines that were obviously meant to be interrupting each other. You are still being provided with lots of documents and papers throughout the game (which is nice), some of which you need to read and understand in order to solve puzzles. Locations look very nice but they aren’t many but the Baker St. flat is there as always. Familiar faces pop up once in a while if you know who’s who. The murders are very gruesome and creative. The game is not very difficult also so in a way it feels like a smooth ride if you can overlook stuff mentioned above. So all in all, Testament of S. Holmes is good follow up to his predecessors and if you’re a fan of the previous games, you should definitely get it. If you like point&click adventures, the story is enough reason to pick this one up. But if you’re new to the genre, don’t start here. Pros: very good story, well designed puzzles, true to its source material, familiar voice acting, long gameplay, Cons: UI looks very old, locations are sparse, some near misses with gameplay mechanicsVerdict: 4/5			"

												This is the worst of point and clicks I have played. It is also the worst Sherlock Holmes example I have seen. Ever. (Non parody, that is.) The puzzles are poorly explained, and the story feels like a detective comedey, rather than a Sherlock Holmes story of science and philosophy. In most puzzle games, I fail to see obvious answers. This game is so complicated that I am literaly forced to use a walkthrough constantly. Some puzzles I can see logicly, others (chemical test) I can not. I looked for a walkthrough that could explian it, and didn't find one. The thing about Sherlock is that the important science is EXPLAINED! How do we tell that the man is tall? The distance between foot prints. How does it help? The height of a human is determined by the length of his legs, yes? Well the longer the legs, the longer the strides. See? Simple in the end. That's the essance of Holmes, that it's all simple in the end. Over the course of reading every single book, I should know that it's possible to pause time and find all the details on a person and find out what they're up to. After Sherlock explains the science in the books, you said, ""... ooooooooooooooooooh. Duh, It was there the whole time!"" Same with the Robert Downey Jr. movies. The new BBC Sherlock show gives a very similar feeling, but you get to see Sherlocks way of seeing things. He translates shapes of scratches and the dampness of things immediatly with what in the end is right. What about this games puzzles? Pishaw. Portal gave a better Sherlock Holmes ""I really missed that?"" kind of feeling then this game. My feelings were either ""Finaly, the skip button."" or ""Is that the puzzle? Why didn't it tell me what I was supposed to be finding?"" The game is as subtle as the knife, as complicated as the clockwork robots, and as boring as a special needs school full of mutes to Bill Nye. As a student. Also, what the hell is going on here? I don't know the story. Bad thing.			"

												Got it cheap during some sale.One of the few games (can count on one hand) that I actually played through. Just take your time and continue the next day if it gets boring or frustrating. Also quick googleing for some places helps a lot (e.g item location, puzzle hint).I suggest keeping caps lock on to keep the characters in run-mode, though turning, opening doors and some other animations are still slow.It's a bit funny how sentences are cut off in dialogue, because there will be a pause before the other one actually starts interrupting the talking of the other character.

(O problema de quando vc joga um jogo sensacional de investigação como LA Noire é que vc fica muito exigente com os outros).Da pra se divertir algumas horas... o único problema deste jogo é que ele se limita a vc encontrar as pistas. A decifração delas o próprio Holmes fará automaticamente (pelo menos foi assim na 1ª missão que fiz).Diferentemente do LA NOire. Lá vc consegue as pistas e VOCÊ decifra o crime..

												I have mixed feelings about this title...was it bad? no, definitely not...was it good? ... hmm...ok, I liked the story, although a bit too far fetched and somehow clumsy in places, it definitely had the right ingredients and a few well placed plot twists to keep me interested throughout the game... I also liked the puzzles - none of them were impossible to pass and at least some were actually pretty amusing :) ... though in particular, I found the recurring ""lockpick"" puzzle unnecessary - as simple as it was, I found it more of a nuisance than a pleasant deviation from the storytelling... I couldn't help comparing that to an excellently designed lockpick puzzle from ""Still Life"" and even the purely manual lockpicking from the new ""Fallout"" games was more believable than that in TTOSH... I didn't like the ""chemistry"" puzzles too much either...what I liked most, I think, apart, of course, from the more sophisticated locking mechanisms on various containers as mentioned above, were the deduction puzzles. even though you could theoretically solve them by randomly ticking options, they still actually made you think about how to connect all pieces together...the graphics was pleasant, nothing too fancy but nothing particularly bad either - still looking pretty good though maybe not very sophisticated given its 2012 release date... I liked it...what I didn't like then .... the linearity... yeah, I know, it's neither the first not the last point-and-click that does that but there were a few moments where being very artificially bound to the one location you're in at the moment was particularly jarring...the whole ""story read by the creepily-modelled kids in the attic"" arc - what purpose did that serve?...the glitches (the game crashed on me more than a couple of times in just less than 20 hours of gameplay and, in one place, almost blocking me from playing further), the simplistic inventory-based puzzles, the place where you played _a_ _dog_ ...all in all, yeah, as I said, I did enjoy this game, it did have a few nice moments and amusing puzzles... but would I recommend it? no, not really .... I don't know... maybe I set my expectations too high but I just simply don't feel it's up to the hopes other recommendations here suggested... and given its price, and provided you haven't already played it, I really think another sleuth-themed title - the ""LA Noire"" is a much better bargain ... (of course, that's a pretty different kind of beast)			"

												While I find this game can become a little repetative over time, the storyline was interesting and I would be interested in seeing more of the series to see where the story goes. This game is for people who enjoy the story telling aspect of games rather than the actual game play. Much like the tags describe, this game is completely point and click. There are very few moments where there felt any actual ""danger"" or feeling of potential failure in the game. It is very easy and something recommended for the casual gamer.			"

												I purposley put off the last 15 minutes of gameplay for a week because I didn't want the game to end. The storyline is rich and well written. The puzzles are not crazy hard, but not so easy as to spoil the game for you. The controls are pretty easy, the only downfall is sometimes Watson gets in the way so you have to run around him to reposition yourself, adding a punch Watson feature while clearly not necessary, would be handy and amusing,   This is my first game of the Sherlock Holmes Series and just the beginning of a collection.

But there was one issue with this game, that led to me quitting after playing only 30min.

Sometimes we are put a litlle to much on tracks as you will need to discover everything before you can leave the place, but on the other hand it removes the endless traveling to places you've seen 50 times... and because of this you skip the boring parts where you search hours for that missed pixel that in some cases want to give up games...

												Still trying to get through the game, but while it has it's moments, it is so mundane and tedious. The story would be passable, if it had some element of gameplay, But there is ABSOLUTELY no game involved. You don't have choices to make, you can't leave one room to get to another until you uncover all the clues, in the correct order, and there is no possible way to get them wrong. Some of the puzzles are boarder line impossible, well, not really, but they take a long time to figure out. But again, you can't fail, and you can just skip them. For the story, there is no way to die, no way to get caught, no way to fail, no way to move on to a different objective until the one your on is done. There are no choices to make, no deviation from a very linear story. Even in the conversations where it looks like you have options, you don't, it just rotates through the options until you get to the correct one.There is one fairly funny point, where as watson, you're talking to this landlady, and the conversation goes""I'm a medical doctor and I'm here to see a patient who is losing his teeth, it's highly contagious""she replies ""leave, or you'll be one losing your teeth""so he says ""I'm with the department of health to inspect the neighborhood for (something, I forget)""and she says ""something something, get out of here""so he says ""I'm a painter, here to paint your portrait""So far, three times I've been wandering around trying to figure out why I can't move forward in the story, and looked in my inventory to see I have three peices of rope, but haven't combined all 3 to make a longer rope, or I have a bottle of water and a dry cloth, but the quest needs a damp cloth... or that you have the wrong item highlighted in the corner of the screen, so while you need to cut something, it's not the knife, it's the clippers, or that you need to pick up the pipe to hit the glass, but you inspected the pipe before inspecting the note, so you didn't pick it up, and after reading the note, you have to go back and inspect the pipe again, this time picking it up, even though nothing in the note had anything to do with the pipe, it just wasn't in the required, pre-determined order.Luckily, half way into the game, after about 3 hours of mindlessly clicking on every blue (luckily they turn green after you've finished the sequence in the correct order, but also turn from blue to green and back to blue if done out of order when you unlock the sequence you should have done them in, which gets frustrating) and an hour or two of puzzles (there's really only about 6 in total, one of them, the roman numeral box, can be done correctly, but not the ""correct"" correct way, which was also frustrating) they have about a 20 minute cutscene to recap what actually happened in the story up to that point. Which is pretty much necessary, because you're so mindbent on mindless clicking and backtracking (if that's possible never leaving the same place, more just walking in circles to the same objects over and over) that you have no idea how all the broken fragments of the story are supposed to fit together. I completely forgot who the guy I was following was in the third act of the first scene.Even in what I assume to be the final act, which is a stealth mission, sort of, you can't get caught. You can run into view of the guard, and you just get turned around to look for the blue icon you haven't finished. By this point, they've even given up explaining why you're looking for them or how they work, you just run along the edges of the room until you see a blue icon, then rotate through the 3-4 things in your inventory until one of them works.The achievements in this game even get annoying. Since you can't do anything outside of the pre-determined linear story mode, you finish the last blue icon, and you get the achievement for that area... but there is still no way to not get the achievement.Anyways, the game is good enough for a time waster, and has some good puzzles, but just realize there is absolutely ZERO game in this game. The story is fine, it's pretty bland, but for a sherlock holmes story, it goes exactly how you would imagine. Sadly, you have absolutely no contribution to this story, no matter what you do, how hard you try to succeed or intentionally fail, you just can't. You either do things exactly how they were programmed and go on to the next chapter, or you stand there, and wait, until you do things how they are programmed and move on to the next chapter.			"

												The game grabs you into the world of Sir A C. Doyle matermind detective Sherlock Holmes in a very well manner way. The story is very gripping and the puzzles are fun. The game start like a very promising adventure game. Well performed voice acting, excellent and varied environment and exciting investigation set the tone. The graphics may not be upto date for many, and the controls are stiff and sometimes difficult to deal with. Nevertheless, it had its charm, and I wanted to see what happened next as the investigation revealed a web of different threads that had a connection I should get discover. The way Sherlock portrayed on fidelity, and it fits well in this context. He is the type who does not care about what others think, because he knows he is  always right. His counterpart , Dr. Watson, is also well poytrayted, and the dialogue between them entertains.To resolve matters using ""Deduction board"" I thought that was an interesting way to do it. Here I got really used the brain, and it gave a great sense of achievement when I understood the context. Unfortunately there were not enough of these, in my opinion. I would like to see that they made a few more varieties of these, and fewer of mini games that were too difficult gradually. If they had evened it out so that it was more different  methods for solving problems and more options to solve a case,I would be impressed. Yet overall a very decent adeventure game			"

												I would recommend this game. I really enjoyed it because of the story and the beautiful graphics and the puzzles can at times can be pretty challenging, so far I've only had to cheat at 1 puzzle (the animal cards, it was crazy hard). I'm more of a person who enjoys reading dialog in games (over skipping it and getting straight to the game), so if you are also like that then this is for you. If you are one who likes straight action without much thought this isn't the game for you.Overall I would play this through again because there is so much to take in, it is worth the money :]Pros:-Graphics are pretty snazzy-You can play as Sherlock and Watson at times (even Toby!)-Puzzles get progressively harder (which is nice)-The areas you explore are pretty stimulating-Voice acting was executed very well-If you can't solve a puzzle you can skip it but you risk not getting acheivementsCons:-Some items you have to find can be tough espeically in darker/night time scenes even with brightness up all the way-Sometimes I was left not knowing what to do (rarely happened but frusturating when it does happen)-After SOMETHING happens near the end there is soooo much dialog (even for me). It is for explaining things but it was just too much.-Gameplay is kinda of hard if you don't have a mouse because you need it to look around everywhere and you can't run properly if you are using a laptop trackpad.

												""SImplicity Itself""This is the phrase used by Holmes upon solving many puzzles in the game, but the actual puzzles themselves are far from it. As a primarily point and click puzzle solving game, the puzzles start off fairly easy, but by the end are some of the most diabolical I've seen in a game. This is not a game for those easily frustrated by difficult and vague puzzles. However, if you can handle the brain strain, or cop out and skip the puzzles altogether, you will find a story that is gripping until the very end. There were many times where I was genuinly excited to see where the story would turn next, and how the next twist would come into play. Even though i was personally getting tired of the puzzles near the end, the brilliant story of this game kept me hooked until the very end.			"

												I will admit, this game is quite the puzzle. Not in-game, mind you. Just trying to get it to work is a mystery! I have been having an issue that it seems a lot of of players are having, the Blue Screen after the very first cutscene. My computer is well above standards for the game, and it seems the root of the issue is from nVidia drivers. Because I am fully up to date with my drivers, I still have the Blue Screen. Because of this, I highly recommend not purchasing the game. I'm a giant Sherlock Holmes fan and had great expectations for this game. This made me quickly think otherwise, and I'm very disappointed.			"

												I want to recommend this game but there are just too many things that come in the way of a good review. I love the Sherlock Holmes games, I have played all of them till now. And they have always been lacking in terms of controls. They are mindbogglingly stupid. Too many glitches make the game annoying. They take away from solving puzzles which in most cases are pretty good and difficult. But, this is the last Sherlock Holmes game I will play until they improve the controls and remove the glitches.			"

												My first SH game.  The only other SH game in my inventory is Crime and Punishment.  Looking forward to it after this one.  Some nice puzzles.  A few of the puzzles relied more on trial and error than actual logic but enjoyable for the most part.  My only negative comment is that there were a few spots where I found myself running back and forth looking for the one little clickable that I missed (even with spamming Sixth Sense).  Scenes were nice.  Really enjoyed the deduction board and wish it had been utilized more.. felt like the game started with heavy use of the deduction board but then just stopped using it entirely around 40% of the way through.All in all, 7/10			"

												The Testament of Sherlock Holmes is a good compromise between old-style adevnture games and new-era 3D adventure games with richer stories and cutscenes. It's also better than its sequel which emphasizes too much on the new-era style.The variety of the puzzles is enjoyable and almost everyone is decently implemented. The good thing is that every puzzle is integrated in the scenario and not here just for the purpose or making your brain working (I do not like point and click games like Myst). The difficulty is also not too high and not too low, decently made overall even if the difficulty does not improve over time.The gameplay is really good if you play on first person mode, OK at third person. I chose the last option because I like viewing my character but sometimes I switched to FP mode because of the limitations of the TP mode. In fact, it's harder to target a location sometimes while in TP mode. Still, it's not horrible to play, just a bit harder. I played it with both gamepad and mouse/keybord and I prefer the first option even if I'm an old PC player.The graphics are OK technically speaking and retranscribe well the londonish atmosphere. English voices (which were impossible to pair with french subtitles - which was not a problem because I understand english - even with the developpers tips for steam version) are really well made, especially Holmes voice which retranscribes well the personality of the character.The narrative part is nice even if some events seem far-fetched like what we can see in spectacular american movies. I enjoyed the whole plot and the narrative which is really above the pack for this type of games (without the sacrifice of the gameplay like in telltale games). The whole story is well critten and I admit I doubted about Holmes loyalty. Maybe the last chapter in the amusement park was a bit disappointing but still good.Finally, this game is really solid. I recommend it strongly to people who enjoy a good mix between narrative and old-style puzzles. Sherlock Holmes games are really the best adventure games series nowadays  even if the last episode orientation is disturbing.			"

												Very enjoyable and rather difficult.  The puzzles are worth spending time on, but perhaps a bit too difficult if you are just looking for a pleasant way to waste a few hours with the wife.  Nothing struck me as a terrible leap of logic, and there were several points where my reaction was ""They better not end it like this.""  Recommended.			"

												Mediocre adventure game with very little actual sleuthing. After 4 hours of disjointed logic, pixel hunting, and excruciating mini-puzzle games, I gave up on it.I was hoping for a stimulating, Holmes-style mystery to solve. Instead, it was just me hunting down clues and the game character connecting the dots. I didn't feel like Sherlock at all. I felt like his errand boy.Holmes would frequently explain how he figured something out *after* we reached the conclusion. Meanwhile, I was confused as hell as to why I was doing any of it. I had little to do with solving the mysteries. The dialogue was mostly in cutscenes. There is occasionally a ""dialogue wheel"" that tries to act like you have control of the character's conversation, but there are no actual choices to make. It was kind of obsurd. The only real brainwork is in the mini-puzzles, which seem like they're designed more for tedium than to flex your mind, and have absolutely nothing to do with the story or theme.It just wasn't worth my time. There isn't enough meat to sink your teeth into. It's more like a cash machine aimed at casual gamers than a serious adventure game.			"

												Classic click and point puzzle solving with an interesting variety of puzzles and challenges. As is often the case with poibt and click games the dialogue is often lengthy and I find my self skipping through it and still being able to follow the story just fine. The storyline is also enjoyable and having an iconic character like Sherlock Holmes to interact with the flawless setting is pretty cool			"

												In my opinion, this is the best game in the Sherlock Holmes series.  I have played the previous two - SH vs Jack the Ripper is very good, Awakened was not.  And I have watch playthrough of the two newer games.  To me, Testament has the best story, most balanced use of Holmes and Watson, and plenty of sloothing.  I highly recomment The Testament of Sherlock Holmes to all adventure game fans!			"

												It's pretty bad overall.  The puzzles are often not logical (rather with minigames substituted), the story isn't compelling and the cutscenes are just awful at times.  I was hoping for an investigative game because I'm a fan of the origional stories, but I find this just tedious and end up just using a walkthrough quite often because I can't be bothered.  I also don't know why some of the other reviews say it looks nice, because it certainly doesn't.  The screencaps they show are way better than the game itself and the animation is abysmal.  I was very disapointed.			"

												I would recommend this game. I really enjoyed it because of the story and the beautiful graphics and the puzzles can at times can be pretty challenging, so far I've only had to cheat at 1 puzzle (the animal cards, it was crazy hard). I'm more of a person who enjoys reading dialog in games (over skipping it and getting straight to the game), so if you are also like that then this is for you. If you are one who likes straight action without much thought this isn't the game for you.Overall I would play this through again because there is so much to take in, it is worth the money :]Pros:-Graphics are pretty snazzy-You can play as Sherlock and Watson at times (even Toby!)-Puzzles get progressively harder (which is nice)-The areas you explore are pretty stimulating-Voice acting was executed very well-If you can't solve a puzzle you can skip it but you risk not getting acheivementsCons:-Some items you have to find can be tough espeically in darker/night time scenes even with brightness up all the way-Sometimes I was left not knowing what to do (rarely happened but frusturating when it does happen)-After SOMETHING happens near the end there is soooo much dialog (even for me). It is for explaining things but it was just too much.-Gameplay is kinda of hard if you don't have a mouse because you need it to look around everywhere and you can't run properly if you are using a laptop trackpad.

												A true puzzle-solving game masterpiece.  It's quite obvious this game is mimicked after the one true Sherlock Holmes - the late Jeremy Brett.  The game stays true to the actual tv series from the 1980-1990's.This game reminds me of the Sierra games of old, like Space Quest and King's Quest.			"

												The Testament of Sherlock Holmes is a hard game to nail down as to whether it is good or bad. So I'll give it the patented ""Zacryl: Meh+"".There are many moments, particularly in the first 2 acts of the game, where the opportunities to explore a (for a 2012 Indie title) incredibly beautifully-rendered Victorian London are a real treat. And trapsing around 221B Baker Street and looking at all the fun nods to the original stories is a pleasure... for a few minutes. Then the clunky mechanics and occasionally asenine puzzle-solving makes it feel less like a game about Sherlock Holmes, and more like having Sherlock Holmes' name slapped onto a rather dull point-and-click adventure.The voice acting is pretty good, though Watson (whom you hear more of in this game than anyone) was a bit too whiny and nasaly to want to listen to for 10 hours. In all, if you're a big Sherlock Holmes fan like myself, it's definitely worth buying when it goes on sale. The game is wonderful when it pays homage to the original stories and keeps to the established canon. But when things start going off the rails story-wise toward the end, or when the puzzles start just being puzzles for puzzles' sake rather than real mysteries to be solved, it becomes a bit of a chore to muscle through.TL;DR? 6.5/10, Good graphics, decent voices, good fanservice, but clunky and story gets dumb at the end.

												It's really a good Sherlock game. I cannot say it's the best because of the existence of ""Jack the Ripper"". Compared to ""the awaken"",  the quality of video is definitely much better. To be add on , the investigation and item finding system is much more easier. The hint is always obvious enough to avoid you stuck around a place. The honor system is also a shining feature of this game. But it still has the common defect of Sherlock games: unexpectly crash while saving. Keep your mind on saving it all the time!			"
