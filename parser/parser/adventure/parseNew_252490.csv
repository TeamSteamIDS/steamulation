								I love this game, I built a house around a guys house and made him my prisoner, I fed him cans of tuna and cooked chicken when it was available, and some times I would drop in spare logs of wood(when they were available). The best part. he talks to me, keeps telling me his clans going to raid my structure and save him.. I simply respond with .” It puts the lotion on its skin, or it gets the hose again” and by hose I mean I dump charcoal on him.-Great game hope the servers come up soon, I think my pet may need to eat.-Maniken			"

								After around an hour and a half of bad spawns, scarce resources, and short-lived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the map, I ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust. I had initially spotted him pretty far away, but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped. Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and, upon the realization that neither of us were hostile, we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non-aggression that can exist in Rust). I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal, and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith. After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging, we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear. We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders, and a lot of them. I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets, though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it. I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across. A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow. I had been running with my hatchet out, so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction, attempting to scare him away. When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones. The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined. Just as we were moving on to the next boulder, I heard the gunfire start. I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend, and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me. It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp, as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking. I typed into the chat, thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines. He simply wrote ""Sorry guys :D"" This is the single problem that I have with games like this. Why does it have to be ""shoot-on-sight?"" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us. Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area. But of course, he comes around, sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game, and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets. Then, to add even more of an insult, he adds an apology at the end, as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting, half-naked, unprepared players. All in all, though, I do see a lot of potential in this game, and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while. I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game. People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience.			"

								So I started playing 'Rust' at 4pm yesterday.Within 3 minutes of my first time playing, a bear ate me. Then I watched two other players club each other to death with large stones, while completely naked,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥(penii?) dangling in the wind. Having managed to slay a small pig, I fashioned some clothes to cover my genitals, then went exploring.Ate some uncooked meat and threw up all over the place. Made a small fire to cook the rest of my meat. Fashioned a bow and arrow out of some wood I collected, also a shirt and a pair of boots. Went about fashioning a small shelter out of some random crap laying around so I wouldn't have to sleep outdoors. I could have chosen from one of the many, many, ramshackle structures dotting the landscape. But those may or may not belong to/contain other players. Who may or may not be armed or clothed. I just wanted to peacefully live alone, so I stuck to the wilderness.I slipped off a cliff and broke both my legs. I shouted out to anyone who would listen, asking what to do to fix my broken legs, I didn't understand the game and I needed help. A naked man came over, typed '??? i help' in response to my pleas, then bashed my head in with a rock and presumably looted my corpse.Then I starved to death when I forgot to eat. Out of desperation I butchered a wolf that attacked me instead of running away, but didnt have time to cook so I ate raw meat again. Nope. Instead of just starving to death, I vomited, then starved to death.Its now 7:25 am and many adventures later, I've decided to sleep in a small shack I made myself in the mountains. Don't dare risk making a fire, someone might see it at night and kill me for the tin of baked beans I got off a zombie I found wandering around a town that gave me radiation poisoning. Oh yeah, I'll probably die slowly because of the radiation, but thats a problem for later-me.In a tiny hut on a mountain with my sleeping bag and meager belongings after 12 hours of playing straight, I can probably safely say I'm enjoying this game.

Day 1I seem to have woken up on a mysterious island, I don't remember much. All I have is a rock.. I'm scared.There seems to be no sign of other humans. I do not have any food or shelter yet, however, I was able to obtain a few logs by hitting a tree with this rock multiple times.. What a mysterious island.Day 2I have found a chicken, some more wood, and a few stones, I was able to conceive an amateur, handmade axe, it only took a few seconds to make, so I was able to kill the chicken too. I have also gathered a fairly large pile of wood, I might be able to build a makeshift shelter, but for now...Tonight I feast.Day 3Today is the day, I will finally build a shelter, I can feel the warmth of a warm bed and fire already. I haven't felt this good since I was a child, playing with my toys, I remember one toy more than most, it was called a ""Steam"", ahh, the good ol' days.I will be home soon. I promise.Day 4I'm sorry.I have killed a man.It all happened so fast, he was holding a gun, I was debating on making peace with him, but he seemed the brutal sort.And all of his gear, it was... Enticing.He must have had a family, but I am becoming selfish it seems, I don't care about the man that I have killed.All that I can think of is one thing, not my family, not his family...But tonight I feast.Day 5I've come across a small, abandoned town, there seems to be a lot of loot within the area.The only problem is that I obtain a heavy dose of radiation if I go into the barriers.I have a choice: Obtain what's necessary to survive and die from radiation, or live on how I am now.. In poverty.I think I'll live.Just for a while longer.Day 6I saw a man today, outside of my cabin, he was naked and he had a rock.. He seemed to have been yelling incomprehensible jibberish, he must be insane.. I remember when I was like that.I still am in a way.Day 7I don't know what to do.The man that I saw yesterday came into my cabin while I was asleep, he held a rock to my head and struck..My life flashed before my eyes, stupid reflex, I grabbed my journal.Remember when I said that I was coming home? Sadly my dear, you'll have to meet me in heaven.I am bleeding out. I am in god's hands now.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~""HEY ROBERT, I FOUND SOME D0UCHE'S DIARY!""""HAHA, WHAT AN IDIOT! I BET HE TASTES GOOD THOUGH, TONIGHT WE FEAST!""

├Professors Review┤Game Pros• Clean menu• Players can host their own servers off their computers for free, or pay to have it hosted on a local server• Intricate base building system• Hunting/Gathering • Day/Night Cycle• Weather System• Moddable• Frequent updates and Dev blogs• Procedural generated world• Gives you a sense of paranoia• Generated Biomes (Desert, Snow, Grass)Game Cons• Game tends to lag/rubber-band if too many people are connected to the server• Uses a lot of RAM• KoS (Really depends on the person, but what do you expect?)• VoIP needs work (Causes a second or two of lag after letting go of the VoIP key)• Framerate/Crashing issues on AMD cards (Mainly on the R9 290)• Runs on the Unity engine (Making it not the best for optomization, but the dev team is managing)• Animals don't follow rules of physics. (They will run up walls if they feel like it)Controversial Features• Sleeper servers (Even when you log off you are still in-game, and able to be killed. Pretty much forces you put in time to build a stable base before leaving the server. Or risk being killed.Relateable Games• H1Z1• The Forest • DayZConclusionRust can be a very fun survivial game, especially with friends. I put ""DayZ"" as a relateable game, but let me assure you they are two different games and should never be compared, other than them having a survival aspect. Rust can sometimes feel very slow pace on the official servers, so If you want to quickly build and join in on the action, id suggest a modded server with faster crafting and gathering. Overall, if you have the money, i'd suggest looking into buying this game. It is currently in Alpha, so really look into it before purchasing. Score60/100(If you found this review helpful, consider giving it a thumbs up!) "

								I met a man who helped me with my adventures. Here is my story.- I met a man who helped me when I started my adventures in this beautiful island. He helped me out since I was a newbie, he fed me chicken that came from a cow, sheltered me in a wooden house that I couldn't escape from and he protected me from the wolves I tried to pet. Once I finally understood the game, he released me into the wild, I took a few steps into the open and BOOM I got shot in the back by him. I respawned at camp and beat him up with a rock, took his stuff and ran off happily ever after.10/10 MUST BUYEDIT: The man has captured me once again, but this time, my knowledge has advanced. I entered his fortress willingly, but little did he know, I was an evil mastermind. He took me as one of his ""crew members"". Along with 2 other people, we journeyed and raided other buildings. But slowly I stole gear from their base and soon, equipped with full kevlar and a bolt action rifle, destroyed their sleeping bags and once again killed them all. I ran away while holding the V key (in game chat) and played the TROLOLOLOL song. I ran off into the sun set and went offline to write this update.			"

								***EDIT:7/30/2016***   Needed to add a edit in here because there have been some developments you guys should know about. The Facepunch team have given developer powers too popular youtubers. the youtuber in this case is Rhinocrunch. He can go on any server official or modded and do whatever he pleases. Ban people, noclip through walls etc. When this was discovered many reddit posts were made exposing it, but then Helk (dev) made a post saying anyone talking about it would be REMOVED from reddit WTF! How many other people have dev powers? The Devs finally admitted to this on Reddit. Sad day for Rust indeed, also Garry has officially stepped down and Helk is in charge now, but he cant take the heat, as in recent post. If you have any doubts about this info, just google or search reddit, it's all there unfortunately.......After a long rough 3 years with Rust i can no longer recommend nor play this game. When this game first released in 2013 it was the pinnacle of gaming, never before were there game mechanics to kill a person while he was offline and steal all his♥♥♥♥♥♥(raid). It was a rush i had never experienced and kept coming back for moreEven tho the graphics were subpar, but no one cared, why? Because the gameplay was amazing. Crafting PVP, raiding, surving were all a blast.....until they decided to rebuild the game from scratch on a new graphics engine (Unity)At first it was very welcomed, we got better graphics, new content, new guns, raiding tools, all was great. In May-July of 2015 was the peak of this game. It was the most fun i have ever had gaming (30+ years)So what happened you ask?? The Devs started to ignore the community and do what they feel is ""improving the game"". which led to bugs galore, no more optimization, nerfing of every aspect, guns, raiding, etc. The A.I. (animals) have been broken for YEARS. Bears will clip through your base and kill you instantly. Same with going through rocks, the ground, you could be out farming up materials for an hour, and out of nowhere, a bear clips through the ground and kills you......People complain and whine a lot but also people suggest wonderful ideas on reddit which are either ignored or the Devs themselves literally ridicule and make fun of people.But the final nail in the coffin was the ""New XP"" update which totally ruined the game. Before this update you could get on rust and within a few hours have a decent base, some guns, and you are preparing to raid. Now with this ""New"" update, you will have to literally play 60+ hours before you experience any fun. Everything is locked behind xp now, so you literally have to grind XP like a asian MMO.Half of the player count has left rust, it is not in the top 10 steam games anymore and this is the REASON why. When people give great ideas about how to balance this, they are ridiculed and made fun of by the devs themselves. Garry (Owner/Creator of Rust) has made his money, he does not care about this game anymore. They have sold 4 million+ copies of Rust and they (Facepunch) are already working on other games. This is becoming a common practice in Early Access. Get people hyped for basically a hypothetical game, make about 10-20% of said game, get paid millions, then abandon it and move on to the next cash cow. Dont belive me? Google any of these games StarForge, Warz, Dayz, H1Z1, The Dead Linger, Towns,The Stomping Lands. Less than 25% of games make it out of Early Access.TL;DR   Save your money, this game was once great but the Devs themselves have killed this game and dont care about it anymore, they do not listen to their fanbase/community,half the player base have left and more everyday quit rust. The devs are paid, dont give them any more money, save it for a REAL game that is already published. You have been warned.Update EDIT 8/22/16   It seems the Devs are constantly working/spending time/resources on things no one cares about. So many cool concepts: Hidden bases, vehicles, setting players on fire, the new rad boar we never got, Robot sentrys, i could go on and on....There is actually a reddit post that was made today about all the concept, animations etc that are basically finished but not in game. The list is staggering but you know whats worse? A Dev replied, no words, just a picture of a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥made from rocks shooting water......These guys (Devs) are obviously children, and take nothing seriously. If you don't believe me go to rust reddit and check yourself. Sad days.Look at this reddit post, it will make you a sad pandahttps://www.reddit.com/r/playrust/comments/4yw1no/why_are_so_many_things_made_but_never_implemented/

								The issue I have with the game, is by far, its community.PROS:-Intense survival experience, you are a mortal in a dangerous world- Initially cold, hunger and thirst are real threats.- The graphics can be very pretty, if you can run them.- Sounds are nice, gun shots ring out and pierce the still air.- Building is interesting and fun.- exploration is interesting and the blueprint system is pretty fun.CONS:- The community tends to be absolute garbage *Expanded at the bottom*- Servers tend to be immediatly taken over by massive constuctions, and sometimes clans immediatly dominate.- Resources become scarce pretty damn quickly- Animals run up sheer cliffs and can be quite glitchy- No costomizability *this is very minor*- KOS; COD style.-Optimization, my decent rig constantly overheats if I don't put my fans into hyperdrive; manually.NOW TO EXPLAIN: The community is simply cancer. If you are neaked and a geared trooper sees you, you can almost bet that he is going to shoot you for no reason. The excuse is; this is PVP, and that you ar a potential danger, or even ""Just like in real life""      Well here is the issue, KOS is not very real life, BUT the game is silent, it is dead when you move around. The only thing to break the silence is gunshots, some screeming from what is usually a poor helpless naked that has just barely managed to get his 2.5k wood to start his shack. Even when he makes his shack, instead of negotiating forming an alliance, this player is eliminated, his base raided for little to no resources and as such he has to start all over and the raider gets the thrill of raiding an offline 2 by 2 shack. This is all due to a KOS mentality that is so far from survival mentality that it is in reality COD mentality. The game runs like this:1) Spawn, get materials build a small base2) get blueprints and start gettign ready to wreck some♥♥♥♥♥♥br>3) establish dominance in your area4) Once dominance is established with your little posse build a massive unraidable castle5) dominate the area and consume all resources, killing anyone you see for the fun of it, because you are now bored. 6) Make four excuses : ""Git Gud"" , ""Become like us"" , ""Everyone is a threat, therefore I can KOS because I feel like it"" , ""Man salty nakeds"" I once managed to get a small group going, immediatly a small but well armed clan emerged from their base and began hunting nakeds, just because. We had just managed to make a bow for one of us, when they emerged from the trees and just sprayed into us, killing all 5, and screaming through their mics that we suck and to ""git Gud"". This behaviour has slowly but surely been spreading throughout the entire community because it is the best way to play. Kill everyone, steal their resources, build yourself. It's also pointless. It makes the game a ghost town. Not but one year ago the servers were full of new players. Now the servers I usually play on barely peak over 1/2 the population, most of those being either clans or KOS' ers.      It is sad to see such a great game go to waste because of the community, the only break from this is RP servers and PVE servers. RP servers maintain that PVP aspect, but give it a nice twist where KOS is rerely an option as each side has quite a lot to loose and tensions get higher than ever, whereas with KOS its usually just a naked dropping dead every so often. Sometimes clans will clash and then everything looks great. But those occurences are rare.      The community needs to change if the game is going to ever survive, and in fact, thrive. I would suggest implementing a system like unturned has. You cannot hide weapons in your quickbar, either you have a tool to quick draw or a weapon, and then everyone can see how well armed you are, as well as add some strategic depth to the game. Also make nature more intense, make the PVE aspect even more challanging, its apparently post nuclear time, some strange♥♥♥♥♥♥ought to be walking around. It would add a nice threat to well geared players and well give nakeds a nicer start as they are suddenly not the primary target for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles. There also needs to be benefits to living a peaceful life, and benefits to living a violent one, and each needs its downsides. Right now violence is the only solution, pitifully so. Your chances of going out and finding a place to survive peacefully is nigh impossible. Especially when these massive bases make their rise. The only person rading such a base is another person with a similar base, and even then they will probably fail, and require a clan.      The game needs to change, and minor changes are needed. But as it stands I would not recommend the game. An amazing idea ruined by a terribly toxic community. Maybe ill come back to it next year. But for now, ill try and develope my own game, and see if I can fix these issues myself. -->DISCLAIMER: This review is old, and as such does not reflect the game in its current state. I have been notified that apparently substantial changes have been made to the game. These changes might have fixed a lot of the issues that were inherent ot Rust, especially community based ones. But I myself am unable to confirm this as University and studies are taking up more and more of my time and as such i am unable to actually recheck any of my above statements.			"

								What i'm about to do give my review/experience in my days in RUST. NOTE that I have 1500 hours put into this game on my main account plus a few more on this account so im a long time rust player. Now on to my story and experience.MONTH 1-2There i was in the open field trying to figure out how to craft and make stuff. First shack I built I thought I was safe, no I was just a prey for players. They tore my shack down and told me if I wanted a room. Without clear thinking i said yes and soon after they trapped me in there house and I was made a slave. I joined another server and with a minutes I made myself a pipe-shotgun wooo!!!. As I went to farm i noticed 3 guys loaded with gear and heavy artillery. I thought this was a caveman game with no high tech weaponry, nope i was wrong when they shot that bullet in my face. Though i loved everything this game had going. A week passes and I find a hidden somewhat made base and without thinking again make my room right on top and start farming and making new things. Next day I wake up to find 2 guys building on top of the base I made and we have a short stare until they said they are sorry. They thought the base was abandoned. As I return from my farming routine I find a player stealing my stuff from the bottom part which I was going to use. His name was lunch  I took it to shoot him right away, but he shuts the door and managed to stay safe. We soon talked it out and made an agreement not to shoot each other. I trusted him and that was the start of a new friendship.MONTH 2-3My roomates on top dissapeared out of nowhere and in the end it was me and lunch. We did what any rust player does survive and find new things to make. Then we found a player named tanaka. He was a fellow rust player and could make bolt rifles so we made a deal to offer a trade. after the trade me and lunch were thinking, shoot...kill... I chose not to shoot him. The three of us form an alliance and go out hunting for people and yes its the most fun satisfying thing in RUST and I hate it. Everything was perfect until we encountered them. A hacker out of nowhere aimbotted us and from then on we were careful to go outside with valuable stuff because you never know when they will decide to aimbot you. That didn't stop me and lunch until a hacker found our base one day. Turned out he was a little boy and wanted our codes to our house. We said no and he aimbotted us and destroyed everything we had and took so long farming for. That is when we decided to go to a community server as we said bye to the rust players and tanaka.MONTH 3-4Nothing much to say but we just enjoyed our new rust community hacker free or so we thought. Even though there are admin there is a 50% chance that there is a hacker hiding his hacks or clipping inside houses when admin is gone. It was a fun time as me and lunch made new friends and enemies. Though as time went on less players showed up and thats when my good friend lunch left the game RUST. There i was alone but couldn't leave this damn game as i loved it so much. Yes i went back to the official servers and once started from scratch, or so i thought....MONTH 4-9There i spawned i saw the one person i remembered, the one I didn't shoot, the one me and lunch hunted with. Tanaka{Robin}. He offered me a bed and my own room and we chatted for awhile and thus i told him about lunch . Days went to weeks and weeks went to months and slowly me and robin were building more bases and trusting each other with our items. We decided to spend all our wood on at the hanger and thus in a few weeks the batcave was born. During these times i also gained reputation good and bad. Most loved me and I made more friends who would later help me with my enemies. Those that were my enemies called me nothing but a low hacker hiding my hacks. My other sort of rival to own lands was a clan named RST and a few encounters i had with them i shot without any say. Then came another man who i would get to know more as the days went one. His name was doc baby ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I didn't really talk to him that much but enjoyed his say when a plane dropped an airdrop. ZE PLANE ZE PLANE. Me and robin didn't see him that much as he was in the other side of the map but he was an enjoyment. Everything was normal each day in RUST. Nakeds players, friends, hackers and more. FYI Doc refers the nakeds as hobos. Even later I slowly made friends with RST and respected them. REP(incinerator,pie,maddy). Then the horrible day came as me and robin encountered the servers first wipe.Month 9-11My love for Rust didn't make me leave,which i hate. NO, instead i went to another server and Rst was nice enough to lend me a small room. Heck i even saw doc and his ZE PLANE ZE PLANE. Robin was with me but made a different base and in that short time EA3 was back and everybody returned. Though not everybody I once knew were there as some of my friends and allies left Rust. It wasn't long until Yes even Robin left right when the server came back up. You will be missed. Thus it was me and my rock. Though there i was addicted to this damn game playing and playing. The batcave was rebuilt,hackers were doubling and players started to vanish because of hackers. there i went solo for a while then one day Doc visited my base and introduced my to Mr ROtten. We went out to kill hobos and later i gave them a guest room. I enjoyed their company and they are one main reason why i stayed in rust more. From friendly player i was turned into an asshat, No we turned to ZE Asshats. I trusted even more and gave them the codes to my entire batcave and so came the chapter of me and the asshats. Then out of nowhere it came again, dam servers.MONTH 11-PRESENTNew server new fresh start and new players. Me Doc and Rotten made a T tower and do what we do best which is snipe hobos. Its been a year and few months now and i'm slowly players are coming back though i'm not sure ill stay here any longer. I've been raided,c4ed, no clipped, befriended, Shot etc.. I have raided, killed, c4ed, and have done it all. I know every trick that rust has and still could possibly learn more things. RUST is a game that shows how you feel about players and what you are willing to do to survive. Rust has one main story and that is your story. I love this and and hate it at the same time. I will never forget how many friends i have made and friends that have left me. who knows i might have an encounter  with them again. This is my Story and history in RUST. I hope you will give this game a chance as developers are even making a new RUST. Thankyou and remember the name of the game is RUST not TRUST(sometimes).Yar.... "

								I woke up in the grass, my head hurting and my body cold. I was naked.I ran around, looking for a fellow survivor. After an hour, I saw him. I yelled at him as loud as I could, and he turned around. We greeted each other, and agreed to work together.After a few days, we'd built a house, and had enough supplies to last a week. We had weapons, food and water. Life was good.One day, on our daily raid, we spotted someone. He was naked, and ran towards us. He greeted us, we greeted him back, and he and I started a conversation. Suddenly, my friend pulls me back and whispers to me. He said we should kill him. Survival of the fittest.I looked back at the innocent man and gave him my pickaxe and told him to leave. My friend sighed, and gave him some clothes. He thanked us, and left. The next day, he appears again, to say thanks, and that he has a gang as well, so that we could join him. We kindly refused. He sounded a bit agitated, but he said no problem, and left.Later that night, I hear footsteps outside our house. My friend was fast asleep, so I grabbed my homemade shotgun and looked outside.It was the man. The man who we gave a pickaxe to. He was inspecting our house with someone else, but quickly left after he saw a bear running towards him.The next morning, I woke up my friend and told him what happened. He told me I shouldn't have trusted him, and that war is coming.I was raiding an old town, when suddenly on top of a hill in the distance, I saw him. Although this time, he had his gang. There were a lot of them. About 10-20. My friend noticed this as well, and told me to get inside. We got inside, and it was quiet for about an hour. My friend and I go outside, and see them waiting.They said that they were friendly, but we didn't trust them. My friend and I got out our shotguns and told them to leave. They didn't listen. Then the war began.They got out guns and shot at us, firing at all directions. My friend got hit, and yelled at me to get inside and lock the door. My friend barely got inside, but when he did, it was already to late- they were inside.Luckily, we had a panic room for this kind of situation. It had an iron door, which could only be broken down by C4. We rushed down there as the scavengers began to search our house.After a few minutes, they'd discovered we were in the panic room, so they began swinging at it with the pickaxe I gave them. It didn't work. When suddenly, I heard a boom. They had C4.My friend and I discussed what we should do. We agreed that when we get taken hostage, we run like hell.They eventually got in, took all of our gear, and we were naked again. They were about to execute us when suddenly, my friend got up and began to run. He ran as fast as the wind would take him. They missed every shot they took at him, so I decided I had nothing to lose, so I ran as well. It was pitch black outside. I felt around and felt a bush, so I hid in there. In the distance, I could see torches everywhere. My friend saved my life, but the enemy was searching for him. There was nothing I could do, so I ran off, and began my new life.To this day, I don't know what my friend is doing. Dead or alive, he's a hero. The enemy army got raided by an even stronger group, and me?I'm surviving.Stories like this make Rust such a good game. It truly is an experience. I highly recommend this game. Although the glitches are a bit annoying, you get used to it.9/10			"

								This will be one hell of a game.With all the upcoming new contents and features, it'll sure be a masterpiece.Highly recommend for people who are searching for a survival game in the wilderness.You have a good friend or maybe 2-3 who would like this too? Ask them to enjoy it with you! Together, it's much more fun.The first 2 ingame days maybe a pain, but with friends you can easily build things up.If you are more the ""solo survivalist"", no problem! Search for a hidden place, maybe behind some big or small mountains where its unlikely that someone in the next days will come.Build your little shelter for the first ingame week and begin to harvest wood to begin to build you dream survival house.Let's go hunting! First for animals, then for humans.Better don't run up the streets the first week without a gun.Things can change very fast.A sunny wood harvest day can easily be a struggle when doing so.But check it out yourself! Résumé: Rust is an absolute blast when it comes to a survival game!			"

								I've had Rust for a week at the time of writing this review / guide. I have 50hrs at this point.What follows is a review of the various stages of your rust play-through, from wipe to wipe.In the beginning:- You are given a randomly generated character, and spawn naked and afraid. I am a black male, finally I can use BBC in my online rust dating profile.*If you can't handle this point, do not pass begin, do not collect 200 wood, GTFO. - You have a rock and a torch, they are used to bash trees, animals, rocks and hordes of preteen nakeds that chase, and kill you for no reason. Be careful! Trust no squeakers! And if you come across someone who doesn't kill you right away...BE CAREFUL! They are cunning and probably have a deeper, more mature psychopathic nature. - Once you gather enough wood for spears, stuck a few naked preteens to death, and move your way up the food chain, you'll need a place to stash your goodies. Location is very important, you will need access to basic resources like fresh water, stone and wood, but also isolated enough to not attract the older, more geared players that will level your base and put you in the middle of their circle jerk while chanting ""whats good ma dude"" to completion before killing you...Then picking you up saying ""sorry brah, my bad, sorry man, want to join us?"" IT'S A TRAP! They will kill you after 5 seconds whether you respond or not.- Now after getting your♥♥♥♥♥♥pushed into the dirt a couple of times, or in my case, an impressive BBC (A couple times being an understatement) you will establish a little 2 x 2 house that's quite isolated, some food in the chest, a nice pickaxe, hatchet and a roaring furnace. You might even be so lucky as to have a friendly neighbor. Well done, you have made it further than you would have for about 10 hrs of your initial gameplay. Don't let this discourage you from getting the game though! Or do, you salty noob. The Middle:- Now that you've ticked off two to three of Maslow's tiers it's time to have some fun.- You will need to grow your arsenal and this can be done in a few ways depending on your skill set:a) Do you like exploring and avoiding danger? Night time rad town runs might be for you!b) Do you like adrenaline rushes and close calls with death? Killing geared players on their rad town runs might be for you!c) Do you enjoy asserting your dominance over others, puffing up your own ego over those that clearly are helpless against it? Raiding the nakeds might be for you! *use of the ""What's good ma dude?"" slogan is optional.d) Are you a PVP god and enjoy using the terms ""Get Rekt"" and ""360 no scope""? Raiding other big boy clans might be for you! *A YouTube channel to upload tutorials on how to 1 v 5 is optional.- Expect to get raided! No matter how isolated you are, how strong you think you are or how many slaves you've forced into hard labor on your hemp farm, there will come a time when you get raided. If you are lucky, your base could hold them off for long enough while you and your human shield of slaves fight them off, with all your cleverly placed traps, your double stacked foundations and your triple stacked walls. In most cases, however, you will get a rather efficient, high pressured♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that will usually take place when you are out shopping IRL.- The aftermath of a raid: Once you come back to an empty house, you will go through the five stages of loss. Namely denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. The only part we will discuss is acceptance, provided you didn't destroy your PC in stage 2. There are really only 4 options after a raid, and that again is dependent on your skill set:Type a) players: Pick up your sleeping bag, if you still have it, and jog on. Type b) players: Learn the weak spots of your base, rebuild, and hope your online next time they come so that you can defend yourself.Type c) players: Find a naked, take over their base and relocate. It is very important that you wait for the poor naked to come back to the base and beg for some of their gear back, make sure you only reply with ""Why so salty"" before giving some gear back, and then proceeding to kill them.Type d) players: This is what stirs your coffee! Call your boi's and start recording! It's time to make a counter raid video!-The end:Regardless of the server you choose, one thing is certain. All maps will eventually wipe. All your hard work, all the times you've laughed, you've cried, it all gets wiped like the blackboard of your maths class. What was it all for? What did you learn? Was it worth it? Will I ever use that knowledge in the future?In short. No.There is only a brief moment in time when you will be on top, or at the bottom, depending on your preference.One thing is for certain though, whatever you choose, it feels GOOOOOOOOD.I can best sum it up as a heroin rush, followed by addiction and hatred for yourself and your life choices.If you're gonna buy Rust because of this review, and you didn't type TLDR, then welcome!

								Found a man sleeping peacefully in a field. I watched him as he dreamt wondering what thoughts were dancing through his head. Was he flying through the night sky amongst the stars? Or was he in agony over whatever decisions he had made up until this point, tortured in his mind by images of wild animals dying in terror? I think to myself perhaps he is just waiting for the sweet release from this mortal coil. With my trusty rock I enhance his sleep into one eternal. Rest in peace stranger.         Oh sweet he had some food.A year later I have become food. Enjoy the Soylent Green. I hope you choke on it.			"

								456 Hours of Rust at this time. Here comes my review on the game in it's current state: Rust is an amazing game, one of, if not the best survival games on Steam right now. But the thing that drives everyone, literally ♥♥♥♥ing everyone away from it, is it's community. The community in Rust is quite possible the most toxic and unfair group of people you will ever lay your eyes upon and you might truly think they all deserve to die, they might. On modded servers where you don't have to farm for an hour before you're able to even think of getting a base, still, it's nigh impossible to play without a group of 4 people or more because you will be demolished by every squeaker who gets a waterpipe regardless of skill.Now on vanilla servers....where the gather rate is NORMAL....there comes to issue of a broken keyboard/monitor etc. you will be out alone for a VERY long time and the second you run into one person with better things than you, you have to start over ALL. OVER. AGAIN. It's very repetitive unless you have a group of your closest friends to play with you so you don't get destroyed. On the decent side, again, Rust is a very amazing game without the community, with great building systems, radtowns to find loot, and an amazing world to explore. But once more, stay away from this game until the community grows up and finally finishes 3rd grade, or you have a group of friends to enjoy the game with you.			"

								Found someone's house and knocked on the door with no weapons drawn as I only had a rock, torch, and a spear.The occupant opens the door and listens to me ask for food in exchange for wood.He murders me with a sword.I swear revenge.I begin preparations. I searched barrels, boxes, crates, anything that could give me the tools I needed to avenge myself.And it came to me.A gracious barrel with a curious object.A flamethrower.I found just enough materials to repeair it and fuel it.I made a few spears and found a grenade.I found his house (again).I waited until dawn to see if he would leave to forage the nearby ruins of an airfield.He left.With the door open.The first mistake.I began burning the wooden foundations with my fury and watched as it burned.I entered the house after the first flames died down.Bedrolls and beds in the open (respawn points).I destroy them with my own sword.I set the house aflame from within and watch.It is the most beautiful sight my eyes will ever behold.The owner returns.The house is in shambles.He fires a shell from his pipe shotgun.He fails to kill me.I throw my spear straight into his face.He goes down.""How does it feel to have your house burned down by the hands that you wronged?""I strike the final blow.13/10, would burn someone's house down in revengence again.
