												I really, REALLY wanted to love Beatbuddy. Games that incorporate music into their gameplay are kind of my thing, and to the game's credit it does start out VERY strong. The first half hour or so is incredibly fun and inventive as you experience how the game layers beats on top of each other to create the main song of the level, and discovering each new creature and how it interacts with the soundtrack and Beatbuddy gameplay wise is incredibly novel. Sadly the gameplay fails to stay fresh for very long, relying on the same bounce pad and reflector tile gameplay for the majority of the game, which is pretty disappointing for a game that's only 3 hours long. The first thing you'll notice are how floaty the controls feel. The game (appears) to be set underwater, so that point can be somewhat forgiven, but if you're playing with a keyboard and mouse the poor controls are really put front and center. The majority of the game is based upon interacting with your environment, using keys in locks, hitting things to the beat, etc. However this quickly becomes INFURIATING when Beatbuddy simply refuses to pick up an object or swim a certain direction, ESPECIALLY in time sensitive situations. I can count on one hand the times during my playthrough that Beatbuddy picked up or placed an object where I wanted to the first time without having to click the mouse repeatedly. Another totally bizarre control issue is that Beatbuddy will occasionally just stop listening to your commands altogether and swim in completely random directions, sometimes coinciding with your mouse being over the foreground art but sometimes due to nothing at all. All this leads to a very obnoxious gameplay experience at best, and a potentially maddening one at worst. Eventually you get used to it (about 30 minutes before the end, unfortunately) but when the game throws handfuls of enemies at you at once and you're being helplessly knocked around while the game ignores mouse input, or given a time sensitive puzzle and Beatbuddy flat out REFUSES to pick up an essential piece of the puzzle in a timely manner, you can't help but feel let down. Thankfully Beatbuddy is forgiven some of its gameplay missteps with a very charming art style, which is a 3D character model on top of very beautiful layered 2D art, although for a musically driven game the soundtrack is surprisingly mediocre, save for a few standouts. While the first level is designed extremely well in regards to introducing not only the layers of song throughout the level in a gradual and fun way, but also the creatures of the world and how they interact with you and the song, that detail seems to go out the window past the first few levels. The soundtrack becomes just the backdrop as the game progresses instead of a major gameplay element, with a few exceptions of course. The fact that the game forgoes a lot of these fun ways to introduce the song of the level compounded with the hit or miss controls and the fact that you see most of what the gameplay has to offer very early on makes the Beatbuddy segments seem like filler until you get to the next vehicle sequence, which is when you get to hear the level's song in its entirety (or as much as they were allowed to play, as the ""level's song in its entirety"" actually only ever ends up being maybe a 15 second loop of a chunk of the chorus). It began to feel like I was just chugging through the same old bounce pad, reflector tile and collect the gems sequences as Beatbuddy until I got to play the next vehicle segment, which turned out to be the game I ACTUALLY wanted to play.As for the story, it serves its purpose. For a 3 hour game it does its job. The characters are all very likeable and cute, too. Their designs are pretty unique and fit the world well, and they all speak in their own style of beatbox which is pretty endearing. The game has some decent humor in the way of your companion, Clef, dismissing the very clearly falling apart vehicle you both ride in and the Prince character doing some very tongue-in-cheek villain things. Slight spoiler alert here, but the ending seems to happen all at once and with very little fanfare which is very disappointing. For a big, boisterous music game I was expecting a large boss battle with some rousing music, but the ending really comes out of nowhere and happens very quietly. For a short little music game like this I suppose it's fine, I was just hoping for more.Even with all that being said, there's still something about Beatbuddy. I'd be totally lying if I said a few of the songs weren't still stuck in my head, and I beat it in one sitting and didn't want to stop, which is saying a lot nowadays. Maybe it was because I wanted to see what the next level was going to look like, or what new mechanic they would introduce, or maybe I just wanted to hear what the next song would be. Unfortunately with the gameplay flaws and short gametime Beatbuddy comes off as less of a good videogame and more of a really enjoyable interactive music video. If that's fine to you, by all means pick up this game. If you're really pining for a new music game, pick up this game. For everyone else I'd say maybe avoid this one. Pick up some of the greats (Audiosurf, Beat Hazard, etc.) or maybe get it on sale.			"

												Get this on sale, watch a ""let's play"", perhaps buy the soundtrack - Beatbuddy excels at everything it does, except the ""game"" part.Beatbuddy offers great visual design, richly drawn assets and fluid animations.Beatbuddy offers an exceptional soundtrack that will certainly keep you listening.Beatbuddy has apparently been painstakingly patched by dedicated developers.Beatbuddy, however, is broken by design, at least gameplay-wise.The game seems to attempt to relate its gameplay formula to rhythmic cues and boy does everything seem really nice, in theory, until you actually start to move around. The issue is very simple, and very hard to fix for a complete game.Automatic actions happen between set intervals, following the beat of the song - but your movements don't. This is partially fixed by the vehicular sections, that set your movements to the beat, although not responding reliably to input.Dashes, punches and other actions happen in their own time and generate offsetting audible feedback, making controls feel even less responsive than they already are. This becomes clear since the start of the game, as soon as color-changing bubbles and spiked crabs appear.Obstacles clear their paths within the song's rhythmic call, as you dash through 0.3 seconds later causing annoying dissonance.Crabs swing to the beat, as you punch them as fast as you can click, ignoring any sort of timing or planning there could ever be.Vehicle dashes are timed to the second beat! Except holding the button does the same thing, while attempting to click on-beat results in failed half-dashes.Jellyfishes move to the beat! Move along with them in synchronicity so you can survive! Except they move less per beat than you do, forcing you to either ignore the song or smash your face every sixth beat.The issues pile up as new elements are added, it seems.Playing only with visual cues might actually be more helpful than attempting to follow the song.

												Beatbuddy... The title suggests this game is all about music and in a way it is, but don't expect something like Bit.Trip Runner, Symphony or Audiosurf here. Beatbuddy is an action adventure where your enemies produce the sounds resulting in a track for each of the six levels. The levels themselves are big and should take you around 30-45 minutes to finish. So completing the game will take you about 5-6 hours. I can tell you that that's more than enough because Beatbuddy just doesn't have enough variety to keep things interesting for much longer than that. True, it introduces new puzzles and enemies in every level that you play, like so many other games really, but for Beatbuddy is just isn't enough. Plus, the fact that I experienced 2 game breaking bugs made me realize that Beatbuddy is a good game, but nothing groundbreaking. I can understand that a game has bugs, as long as they don't break the game but for a game that's 2D and somewhat linear it's unforgiving. Especially if it's such a short experience.On the other hand; the levels are well made and have beautiful art so it's not all bad.My advice to you: grab it when it's on sale.[Rating: 65/100]			"

												In theory, this game should be a perfect match for me: 2D handpainted graphics and an electronic soundtrack. But if you look at the awards Beatbuddy has won, one thing's apparent. They are all for audio, not a single one is for gameplay.As such, the actual game isn't very fun. When swimming ""on foot"", half the time you're going through tight spaces, which gets tiring very quickly. The controls have a laggy feel, since you are supposed to be under water. They should in reality be much tighter for this kind of game.It gets even worse when you're in the vehicle. Suddenly you jump synchronized to the beat and have to press the button every 2/4th to get a little boost. This isn't very fun either. Trying to move synchronized with huge bubbles that are slower than you is really a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥If you want to play a fun platformer with musical elements, you NEED to check out Sound Shapes on PSN, which does control much better, even sounds better and is so beautiful, it made me cry!

												Tedious gameplay.  90% of each stage is the same type of puzzle, the other 10% is collecting collectables.  Boring.The music is too reliant on loops in order to turn a 50 second clip into the only thing you will hear for 30 minutes.			"

												Music in this game is astoundingly good. Sadly, the level design is uninspired and the puzzles are repetitive. The checkpoint system doesn't work super well, leading to many broken event triggers.Made it to chapter 4 before encountering a checkpoint bug that stuck me in one area of a level, and no further progress was possible.

												Music loving gamers--both hardcore and casual--will likely be happier with games like Audiosurf, Beat Hazard, and Symphony. It is an excellent addition to your library if you like a very casual slow paced puzzler or if you have kids. I got this game thinking it was more music driven ""crazy arcade adventure"" than it really is. The music is more of an ambiance thing than the driving force it is presented as. Don't purchase this for the music or the platforming (of which there is none). I would consider this more of a puzzle game than anything else.			"

												I can't recommend this game at full price.  Fun for the first couple levels, then gets tedious and repetitive.  Several level breaking bugs on the last couple levels of the game that require complete restarts, buggy controls (using xobx 360), final game breaking bug that doesn't fix even with restart on last level keeping me from being able to complete the story.  The soundtrack is good, along with the level backgrounds, and overall aesthetic but I found myself just trying to finish for the sake of finishing rather than because I was having fun.  Couple this with the numerous bugs I ran into and I can't justify $10.  Pick it up for $2-$3 or less to have a little fun.  Other than that save your money.  Mediocre at best.  3/5			"

												I HATE having to give this game such a bad review, cause i loved playing it up to a certain point. I got to the Organ Level and everything was great, suddenly the game started glitching. It's a music/beat based game and yet some of the wildlife that are supposed to move in time with the music, weren't moving, which means i couldn't use them. I have restarted and reloaded the game over and over and yet this keeps happening. I believe that i have played it to a point where it is unbeatable. If anyone knows any way around these glitches, please let me know as i would LOVE to finish this game, but as it stands now...i must advise against purchasing this product.			"

												Aquaria: the Musical!More words? Okay. It's a puzzle game about finding your way through labrynth-style caverns and dealing with various timing based boundaries as well as some enemies. It's not a bad game by any stretch but within the first hour you will have a very good idea as to whether it is ""your jam"". The artwork is absolutely sublime but the gameplay is excessively repetitive and the controls can be quite unwieldy at times. The vehicle sections are particularly obnoxious but are thankfully beaten by force alone.I would not buy this game on it's own. If it's in a bundle or extremely cheap on sale and it sounds appealing then you should give it a shot. It's a short and unique game: with even a little bit of patience you can probably finish it in about four hours and not feel robbed.			"

												Yes, the game looks in real life exactly like it does on the screenshots: vivid, colorful, brisk, dynamic. Still, there is no gameplay, at all. It feels somehow... shallow and empty. The first hour is rather boring without any challanges and only thing you do is travelling from one spot to another, avoiding not all that dungerous hazards. The second level brings some difficulty, but it's more irritating than challenging.  And yep, the rythm has nothing to do with the main gameplay: it's possible to play at least first hour without sound at all.			"

												I would really like to recommend Beatbuddy, but I just can't... at least, not fully. While it's got a lot going for it, I just can't get past how buggy it is. Although I did manage to complete it, it wasn't without some serious issues. Several times I got stuck in various ways that prevented further progress - sometimes it was a matter of a game event not triggering properly, and sometimes it was due to going some way the game wasn't expecting me to (apparently). I also encountered issues where the controls would just stop working for no reason. Restoring to the last checkpoint sometimes fixes the issue, but this is rarely the case. Most times, there is no choice but to start the level (or entire chapter) from scratch. Do you know how annoying it is to have 30-40 minutes of progress wiped out, have to start over again, and hope you don’t make the same game-breaking mistake again (whatever it was)? Let me tell you - it's really f%@*&g annoying. I ended up having to do that multiple times. And would you believe, as a final bug-ridden cherry on top, the very end of the game also glitched out on me as well? Well, believe it. So on top of all the other frustration I experienced just getting through the game, I didn’t even get to see the full conclusion of the story. Now, putting all of that aside, what’s actually good about Beatbuddy? Quite a bit, actually. The hand-drawn layered 2D graphics look great, the controls are responsive, the puzzles are generally well-designed, and the music is decent. And that’s a good thing, because the music plays a large part in the gameplay - the environment works in time with the beat of the music, requiring specific timing to pass obstacles or solve puzzles. The first couple of hours are great, as the basic mechanics are introduced. Unfortunately, it starts to lose its luster a little bit after that, as most of the subsequent puzzles are pretty much variations on things you’ve already done several times. So you might start to get tired of it after a while (or maybe I was just burned out from having to replay several areas). I would estimate the overall playtime to be somewhere around 4-6 hours.Overall, the game is not bad, and I enjoyed it while it was working properly. The frustration from all of the technical issues I had just ended up being too much for me to give it a full recommendation. If you enjoy action/puzzle sidescrollers, music-themed games, and/or games with pretty 2D artwork, it’s definitely worth a look. Just be aware of the potential issues. I suppose it could very well be possible that you'd encounter no glitches at all… but I doubt it (several posts in the Steam forums seem to corroborate my experience). At the very least, don’t buy it at full price unless the developers hire more QA people and/or release a patch that fixes the game-breaking issues.			"

A shame games cannot be reviewed just for their art.[/i]Beatbuddy is a 2D exploration game with the whole game universe based on Music. The presentation is really creative, and the art original. The worlds are varied (with the exception of enemies only two in the entire game...) the Musc is very enjoyable and the fact that it builds up as you explore further gives a really gratifying feeling.However while the artsy part of the game is great, the ""Game"" part really doesn't keep up.For starters the narator has a tendency to mimic DJ scratching when he speaks. While it is a very interesting idea the result of it are cutscenes that are painfully long because of him, delaying any sense of conclusion at each and every sentence. Thank god they appear only rarely in the game.The whole game is underwater which makes it impossible to have granular control. You'll often find yourself restarting mutiple times parts where very precise tasks are required to be done in very little time. Furthermore as you don't gain short invulnerability when hit and enemies love to push you around when they hit you will find yourself being bounced about to your inevitable death. This happenning quite often it is one of the main reason while you will start cursing the game for not being forgiving.Level design is not very well thought out either, you will often find yourself trying to find out why you can't go there, if you are actually supposed to be there and stuck because you went somewhere you weren't supposed to be.All these issues lead to a hot mess of frustration and anger, powerless against a game that punishes you for being to curious.And it really is a shame that the actual gameplay is the worst part of the game, leaving what otherwise would've been a enjoyable experiment.Even though BeatBuddy has the looks of a fun rythm/exploration game, it's faulty game mechanics and ill conceived levels put an swift end to any enjoyable experience. Therefore I cannot recommend this game.			"

												After only playing 1 hour of this game, im absolutely HOOKED!!! This is easily one of the greatest puzzle/platformers ive played in a long long time. There was a few others i had played and was amazed by, but this here completely blows them out of the water. Im a bit of an audiophile, so im not sure if that makes me a bit biased towards this game with its music theme and everything, but either way, im done. It has me, and its not going to let go. The way the controls and the actions you take just blend seamlessly with the music is so great. I was sitting here bobbin my head the whole time i was playing, and the tunes are great. Kinda hypnotizing really. If you ever want to distract me and steal my wallet just turn this on and hand me a controller.so, i HIGHLY reccomend this game, i give it a 10/10 with ease. And im not one to do such a thing after only playing an hour. BUY IT!			"

												The music is very tiring on the ears. When you're outside of the submarine, the music is disjointed, the music is made by the enemies usally to the beat of the music. Snare crabs, bass flowers, etc. When in the submarine, the music sounds pretty good as all the sounds are put together however it's on such a short loop that you'll tire of it quickly. The game moving to the soundtrack was a cool concept but it's execution leaves me wishing that it did more with the actual music.The objective of the game is to solve puzzles and get from one point to another on a 2D plane. The puzzles are boring. They are fairly simple and are pretty much the entire game. The stages are extremely long, about 30 minutes  a piece with the same 3 minute track on repeat. Unfortunatly I cannot recommend this game at 14.99. A fair price is 3.99 or lower.			"

They just become part of the challenge and I feel you can master them without being too irritated about it. The pure fun and enjoyment of simple but groovy gameplay is all worth it though and the puzzles do progress the further you go. I've been playing this game with my projector on a 100 inch scale and the visuals and detail in the art are mind-blowing. At times it's like an lsd-trip.This game was completely worth it for me.

Beatbuddy : Tale of the Guardians.Beatbuddy : Tale of the guardians is an unremarkable game. A game where the soundtrack seems to be the only saving grace.  Usually, I like games like beatbuddy where there are some good puzzles, an interesting character, a good premise, tight controls and then a fabulous soundtrack to accompany it. But Beatbuddy tries to carry the whole title on the soundtrack. GameplayYou play as Beatbuddy, who awakes from his sleep and then embarks on a quest to save his own immortality and his companions. You move to the sound of the beats that are present in an underwater world. The controls “feel” clunky even though they are not. As beatbuddy moves underwater, you can sense a slow movement scheme where you want to move him faster. The puzzles in the title are fairly easy and present little challenge.  The game is also very repetitive in nature.VisualsBeatbuddy : Tale of the guardians features hand painted levels which are gorgeous to look at. Though there isn’t much variety in the environment so after sometime, they begin to look stale. In the start though, it is a joy to transverse through these levels. The level design is pretty decent but not excellent. Overall, in visuals Beatbuddy looks good without having much variety.SoundtrackSoundtrack is the meat of the Beatbuddy: Tale of the guardians. The music kicks in depending on the mood and never lets go. As I said, you can’t carry a game on the soundtrack itself, so as you play Beatbuddy further, your only focus remains on the soundtrack which then ruins the mood itself. Even then, the soundtrack in Beatbuddy is excellent to say the least.The VerdictBeatbuddy is a wholly unremarkable game. Repetitive, Bland, Uninteresting are a  few words that can be used to describe it. I couldn’t bring myself to finish the game, as it felt so tedious to play through it. But if you want to give Beatbuddy; Tale of the guardians a try, wait for a sale as paying full price for this game will disappoint you to say the least.This review is brought to you by Steamified.

												A good break from the holiday deluge with an indie title from time to time reminds me that small teams can put out some surprising gems in the flooded console and PC market. I'm talking about those titles that fill up the lower end of the Steam Sales, and they show up as coupons that you get but you wonder what the game is, and whether or not you should commit to it despite the lower cost of entry. Beatbuddy is one such example of those games. It's not perfect, and could use a little more polish, but it's a solid idea for a first outing by the team at Threaks.Beatbuddy stars it's titular character who has awoken from slumber and must save his friends from the nefarious prince of Symphonia. It's not a terribly deep story, but it does give you the sense of purpose necessary to proceed through the game. It's a bit of a short adventure, clocking it at just under six hours to get through your first time. Whether you'll go back or not depends on the amount of collectibles you found during your experience and how much you care to see the inner workings of Beatbuddy's development. The extras that are unlocked are a lot of storyboards telling about how Beatbuddy came in to being, and how Threaks has spent the past four years trying to get this game off the ground. Let it be known that game development is never an easy task.The biggest star of Beatbuddy though is its excellent soundtrack that contains some choice tunes from Austin Wintory, Europa Deep, Parov Stelar, Sabrepulse, Curtis Newton, and La Rochelle Band. Each stage features a song by these artists and serves as the backbone to the experience of Beatbuddy, and it's interesting to see how the guys at Threaks managed to break down elements of each song and make them part of the gameplay. The only negative here is that the stages tend to be thirty to forty minutes long, and while the tracks themselves are good and are broken up really well, there is still that same sense of music droning on, and if you happen to get stuck during a particular puzzle, it starts to get a little grating.At its core, Beatbuddy is a puzzle-adventure game with musical elements that make timing on some puzzles a much bigger factor than you'd normally expect. The rather gentle tutorial stage gets you in the swing of things, showing you how each stage's musical elements come in to play. Like snare crabs that when knocked out cause the surrounding slugs to retract, opening a path forward. But the hook here is how the creatures and puzzle elements all move in time with the music, and knocking out the crabs will cut that part of the musical track out, but you'll be given audio cues along with visual ones to let you know that they're about to come back and potentially impede your progress once again. Once the tutorial is complete, more puzzle elements come in to play that require you to deftly maneuver Beatbuddy through some tight situations and eventually some light combat comes in to play. It never gets to the point of being overly challenging, although there are a few times where some of the ricochet puzzles seem to be a bit too clever for their own good and require a little too much precision from the player, making them seem overly difficult.This game also has a fair share of bugs that can wipe out the progress you've made on a particular level. I ran in to one instance where I died against some enemies and when I respawned and defeated them, the puzzle elements that they blocked did not become available. And since this was tied to the auto-save, I had to restart the entire level. This wouldn't be a problem if the levels weren't so long. These aren't rampant bugs, but it pays to be very careful when playing through, and thankfully Threaks has been issuing updates to address some of these, so it's quite possible that this may be resolved by the time you're reading this review.This game is certainly pleasant to look at, thanks to its wonderfully colorful aesthetic. The animation of Beatbuddy and his friends is also rather impressive, even though they don't move around a whole lot, their idle animations show a lot of love went into making each of them feel unique. And hearing their speaking as beatboxing to the music is also a clever addition. The hand-drawn backgrounds have an element of Rayman to them, though they can get a little repetitive if you stop and stare for too long.I don't really talk about controls much, but I have to say, play this game with a gamepad, or even a keyboard, because the mouse controls make a lot of the timing puzzles difficult to deal with. I spent a majority of my time playing with a mouse, and found it to be a bit detrimental to the experience, especially after I switched to a gamepad. The keyboard option is there as well, though the devs don't recommend using it.The music is a big draw for the game, and while the levels could have benefited from a bit of fat trimming, they complement the music nicely. For a first effort, the guys at Threaks have certainly gotten off on the right foot. Hopefully they'll have more titles in the future that combine their excellent audio work with their well-crafted visuals.Highly Recommended "

												Beatbuddy is a cool game. It is not very difficult as long as you keep to the beat. The level design is cute and the main character evolves with some new abilities to keep floating to its goal. The music is also entertaining and is definitely a big part in the game.			"

												On paper this game is amazing: a game set to the beat of music that is interactive, with different elements of the game contributing to the song? That sounds aweseome!But in reality, the execution of this game is terrible at best. The music is great, the art style is amazing with 2D back and foregrounds mixed with 3D characters. The main feature that lets this game is exactly that, the game. The gameplay is sloppy and poorly executed, often you will find you must send input at an odd off-beat to the music, not exactly off-beat, but at a completely different timing. The levels within the game begin to become overly repetitive and mostly the music is never fully playing, with the small loops of songs only having one or two 'instruments' playing at any one time. This sort of dissociation with the environment creates a very unsatisfying experience, ending mostly in failure to complete a level in good time or simply a rage-quit.Conclusively this is a great game, save for the gameplay elements.

												The soundtrack is amazing. Its one of the better ones Ive found in a rhythm game, and I like how they incorporated it into the actual gameplay and environment. I liked having to time my hits to break through bubbles or to break those flower things in the later levels. I can see how some people might get irritated with it though because the game is set underwater, and you have a bit of lag/delay. It isnt too bad to get used to though.Graphics were pretty nice too. I loved the animations, especially the idle ones. The environment was a little same-y after awhile (lot of recoloring it seemed like), but still gorgeous. Controls (especially vehicle ones) werent my favorite, but luckily they dont stick you in the bubble car very often. Trying to actually time the speed boost in the vehicle was a bit irritating, but holding the right click seemed to do it automatically, so I cant complain too much. The puzzles themselves werent too bad. None of them were overly complicated or frustrating, but some did get a little repetitive in the earlier levels. Still pretty enjoyable though.The story is one of the weaker parts of the game. It isnt the strongest story out there, and the characters arent very memorable. Personally, I think the gameplay more than makes up for the weak story though.Its different, which is nice to see with so many puzzle platformers out there. The controls take getting used to, but once you do it plays very well. The audio is beyond relaxing and the environments are gorgeous. Id highly recommend it, especially if you catch it on sale or in a bundle somewhere.			"

												Nothing particularly bad about this, just completely not notable in any way in my opinion. Felt very run of the mill. It's not awful or bad even, it's just a way to pass a few hours I guess. But there are more or less objectively better ways to do that (like I'm sorry, I understand that it's opinion but I really think that if you're a person that's been playing video games for any semi-significant length of time at all, you will think this is very generic--I think that's a fairly reasonable assumption to make). The game just doesn't feel like it has any identity or reason for existence beyond ""another indie 2D platformer/puzzle game in a sea of indie 2D platformer/puzzle games"".Its underwater so you're not tethered to the ground in the 2D space. Has some strong music (I mean it's called Beatbuddy and it's sorta music-themed in concept so the music is fairly varied and not bad). 6 Levels, about 40-60m each. Really not challenging at all, even near the end as the difficulty ramped up, everything was fairly easy. Honestly, any difficulty or annoyance came almost entirely from the annoyingly floaty controls (I used mouse option, there are ""Keyboard"" and ""Gamepad""  options as well. It's never bad enough to hinder progress though, as the difficulty isn't high at all as mentioned for it to become a massive headache. The ""puzzles"" are all very on-rails, you don't have to think, it's just sorta ""pull lever, push crate"" (figuratively). A lot of repeating puzzle pieces just thrown together in different ways throughout the game, more pieces as you go further.The game seems to be into this idea that the beat of the music tracks in each of its level is synchronized to various environmental elements and mechanics of its puzzles, and while this might be technically true (i.e., an object you can interact with that serves as like a bounce-pad is pulsating to the beat), in practice I never found myself actually concerned with using that to help me *play the game*, which it sort of advertises as a selling point, but also via it's early tutorial. This might be somewhat subjective, as maybe other people would use that more as a play tool, but I found it far easier to just ignore all that and use visual cues as in any other game (i.e. if there are like spikes that drop and raise, even if they ""cycle"" with the song, it's easier to just watch the spikes and then time your passage...).Graphics are uh, fine. Somewhat pretty , levels look repetitive (similar art assets I mean) but they all sort of have a cartoony stylization. Really nothing eye-popping, definitely far from the most beautiful 2D game I've seen, recently or otherwise. Look at some screenshots to judge of course.I encountered a bug in Level 5 , where upon going through a door and the camera starting to zoom out on the environment after a certain puzzle, the client crashed literally every time (Unity engine error). Was not a 1-time thing, always hapspened as I moved the character through this point. After looking around and finding no solution, I verified game cache and that seemed to work. Notably, the game hitched and stuttered , but didn't crash at that point still. Also , the game has no v-sync option, v-sync force doesn't work via Nvidia control panel. I'm running a GTX 770, and it was basically just eating the card to run at like 1000+ frames per second (no, that's not a zero too many. Over 1 thousand frames. Basically if you have a dedicated gpu of any description, beware). Was incredibly annoying, and I ended up artificially capping the frame rate with RivaTuner. Which caused the game to occassionally experience some weird stuttering. Sort of amateurish that there's no Vysync option tbh, or anything else that'd solve that issue.________________________________________Pros: - Strong, varied music, all catchy and pretty unique in the video game landscape.- Visually decent.Cons: - Boring puzzles, not challenging or thought-provoking- Poor control of character (floaty)- Repetitive level design- Generic- Somewhat buggy- Doesn't support vsync			"

												I want to like this game so much, awesome concept, fun music, but the gameplay just sucks. The levels go on for too long, making me sick of the song by the end of each level. The controls/level design feel sloppy/sluggish, there's no way to avoid bumping into stuff all the time, slowing down your progress and ruining the mood. The game also can't decide whether to focus on puzzles or platforming, neither of which are designed all that well. I could be asking too much, just finishing playing Rayman Origins, but this game just isn't well polished.			"

Level breaking bugs and mediocre gameplay tarnish Beatbuddy's beautiful sights and sounds.Beatbuddy's concept of fusing catchy music with puzzle/adventure gameplay is an appealing one. At first glance it looks like Beatbuddy does a good job of bringing that concept into reality. Unfortunately that just isn't so.On the 3rd of 6 levels I ran into not one, but two different level breaking bugs that required a restart from the beginning of the stage. Exiting to the menu and continuing from last checkpoint did not fix either problem. I stopped playing the game after that. Normally I would persevere through these kind of issues but this brings up Beatbuddy's other fatal flaw: it's not fun to play.At its core Beatbuddy is a pretty simple 2D exploration game. The environment moves to the music but your character does not. That detachment from the beat makes playing the game feel like any other average 2D adventure game. Couple that with collectable shards that are completely worthless unless you get every single one within a level (e.g., 411/412 won't cut it!) and you're in for a ho-hum experience.Don't let Beatbuddy's snazzy soundtrack and visuals fool you; save yourself some time and money by just listening to the soundtrack on YouTube.

												The game is sort of a puzzle platformer type thing, but is not really a platformer. Rather, you click places and move there. The music theme is nice, but I found the controls awkward and the puzzles were more time-consuming than engaging. The reason I don't recommend the game is because I think it glitched into a unbeatable state in the second half of the organ level then saved a checkpoint, and I cannot continue the game.			"

-Quick Review-Beatbuddy: Tale of the Guardians is a short indie game that has emphasis on music quality. The music style is closer to electric, beatbox, and dubstep.  (Sorry dubstep fans, I didn’t hear any wub wub wub) The gameplay itself was more focused on solving puzzles. 


YouTube™ Video: Atratzu Reviews: Beatbuddy: Tale of the Guardians - But can he hold a beet? 

			Views: 53		

			Tales of the guardian is a music and rythem based 2d indie game developed by Threaks. Uhn tss, uhn tss, uhn tss, Join Atratzu as he reviews one of the earlier Indie games he played many years ago.		

-Detailed breakdown review-Story: There are two cinematic throughout the game, the beginning video and ending video, you  are the character “beat” who has been awoken from his sleep and must save the other two guardians and go back to sleep. The guardians are the ones who create the music for the world, so it’s of the utmost importance that they all go back to sleep soon.Game Play: The game itself plays to the music, everything is done in rhythm, if you’re boosting, you need to do it in rhythm, if you’re hitting a parasite, it’s in rhythm. There are two “play modes” that you experience in the game, one in a “beatbuggie” where you’re in a vehicle that bounces along to the music on its own, the other is when you’re just swimming through the water as Beat.As I indicated in my quick review, the game is quite focused on the music quality, and but to me the gameplay was focused on rather simple fun puzzles. I had been playing the game A Virus Named TOM for the past week, so the puzzles were very simple and relaxed compared to my earlier game.Achievements: First time playing through I got the majority of the achievements (this pleases me, I want to get through my indie games sometime this year) There are the notorious “speed run the game” and “collect all the things”  achievements, but as a whole most of the achievements you will earn simply by playing through the game once.Price: Beatbuddy: Tale of the Guardians costs $9.99, that’s a consistent price for indie games on steam apparently, I’d suggest waiting for a steam sale, or purchase the game in a humble bundle. I noticed there is also a demo you can download and test out. As always; if you’re really interested in getting a game, checking out a demo is always a smart way to go.For me on my personal value system (price divided by time equals value) I only played 5 hours of the game until I had It completely beaten, I do intend to go back and try to get tougher achievements, however 5 hours of entertainment for $9.99 would be too hefty for me. For most other people though, that’s a perfectly reasonable price. Conclusion: I really enjoyed this game, I found myself bobbing my head with the music as my character dodged with the music. I would recommend this game to anyone who really wants to play a game with A) Great music B) A beat-based music Game.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update May 26, 2015:Added a link to my updated version of the review -- my YouTube video!

												The music is great, the design is very nice, the art style is beatiful, but the controls just feel too loose, and for a music/ryhthm game about moving through spaces and dodging or timing obstacles, it's just not good enough. THe game is either frustrating, or boring, depending on whether the controls and the design are with or against you. Buy the soundtrack, because it is awesome. Watch videos of the levels, because the integration of music and level design, from a musical perspective, is great in some parts. Buy the game, if you want to support the developers more. Otherwise, though, don't. It's not a bad game, just not fun. No regrets about buying it, but I won't be playing it anymore unless I suddenly become fantastically wealthy and have too much time on my hands, somehow.			"

												Although lots of people think this puzzle game isn't hard at all and the music sometimes just become annoying while players stay in a scene for a long time, I would still recommend this game.First of all, with the beat music here, I say the developer team has a good intention to make the undersea lively and they succeed. The scenes of undersea here aren't dark and quiet but lively and bright. The design of the stages with the concept of the beat sound from objects which are interative and those which aren't have their own styles.Second, the puzzles here are simple. However, the standard about difficulty of puzzles is different based on players' different gaming experience and the experience they're seeking from thie game. To me, puzzle games don't have to be hard to challenge but simple to relax myself.So, in my opinion, if you don't want to beat it one day after playing several hours but just relax yourself by playing games, it's good for you, too.Last but not least, the game will be around 2 bucks on sale, which is pretty cheap to get. If you're pretty sure that this game is your type or at least you won't hate this game, I would say it's worth the price with the hours you spend enjoying youself.			"

												It's a pretty game at first glance, but there's nothing really going for 'Beatbuddy Tale of the Guardians'.As a little blue dude, you are summoned to go talk to your sister, an 'Etherial' who is one of the main caretakers of the world (I assume). You work your way through worlds that react to the rhythm around them, and by interacting with things, you can progress. But sadly, it's just a glorified platformer that doesn't bring anything new or fun to the table. Nothing even FEELS music based - it just so happens that things pulse to the beat, but you're not really rewarded for good timing or anything - you just move through a world that plays music.The first level took me half an hour to complete, going at a reasonable pace. In that time, I could see that the game was trying to be funny and trying to have intriguing plot elements, but by the end of the first level I was bored, nothing had me hooked, and I quit the game without caring where the story was going.I sadly cannot recommend this game, but to try and give a positive outcome to my review, I would recommend that you, the reader, try playing Aquaria.Aquaria is a slightly similar game with underwater platforming metroidvania-style play, some musical aspects to gameplay, and a great plot. I had loads of fun playing that game, and would happily recommend it instead.			"

												Beatbuddy is a fun game! You hover around in beautiful, hand-drawn environments and solve various puzzles to progress through the story. Most often, the puzzles are synced to the music, which really gives it a nice twist of rhythm gaming. The soundtrack is really, really good, the songs are groovy and hypnotic. At certain points in the game, you'll experience situations where environment, music, puzzles and player movement just click together, it's awesome! Definitely recommended!			"

												this game has nice music and looks good and the concept is really cool. You follow the music and go with the beat. It doesn't work out well. The best parts of the game are with the vehicle since the beat part of the game is actually working and the music is usually at full blast there. Till then you usually have to solve really dull puzzles. (Imagine doing mirror puzzles from Zelda, but you get those puzzles CONSTANTLY.) and when you're not in the vehicle part, the music is really really slow and just not there. You're expected to follow the beat, but the Beatbuddy thing doesn't really follow it at all. If this game could be JUST vehicle stuff, I'd be able to recommend it. It would be good enough. But as it is, even 2.50? I don't think so. It's too much dull work to get into the kind of good parts of the game.			"

												I usually would dodge games like this, but the musical side of it seemed to make for an interesting twist, so I tried it out. In a nutshell, it does have a funky take on mechanics and the music - and the sound bumps - are really pretty cool (though it grated on me after a while of playing it - it's relatively constant). When I started playing, the first thing I noticed is that the bumpity music part of the game really isn't as ongoing as you might think. You bounce off ""bass drum"" bumpers, you have to time yourself to move through tom-tom-like globes, you have to hit high-hat-crabs. To an extent, it does work, but it just doesn't really get executed quite perfectly enough.If you do pick this one up, force yourself to watch through the introduction story, at least half way. It's more evidence of a pretty cool idea.			"

												Pretty cool game.  Plays like a puzzle platformer but without the platforming, since you swim about freely.  Kind of like a simpler Aquaria without the Metroid structure.While a lot of the gameplay is governed by the rhythm of the music, I don't find that this sets the game terribly much apart from platformers with timing-heavy challenges, such as Donkey Kong Country.  Rather, the main draw here is Beatbuddy's personality and soundtrack: every time a character speaks, the text box is backgrounded by a different beatboxing track, and, as you move through the stages, the music changes in complexity depending upon what's happening around you.This sense that features of the level design are actually creating the music doesn't seem as potent or as 1:1 as in some other games that have done similar, most notably 140, but the music itself is good.  Beatbuddy isn't going to blow your mind, but it's an enjoyable experience overall and well worth picking up at a sale price.			"

												Suprisingly solid game, with just a few problems that bring it down. First off, the main character and his friend are awesome. Little things like leaving him to stand still prompt him to choose one of multiple dance moves that align to the beat, are a nice touch. There is some awesome music and having gameplay and mechanics align with the music and beat are a new and inventive touch. Some of the middle levels lose the quality music and just seem like opera music that doesn't really fit the level and the gameplay doesn't rely as much on it which is disappointing. Also multiple different beats and songs per level would have been better than just one. Problems are a lack of difference as levels, as each one looks and feels the exact same. Another problem is the game uses the same few puzzle, enemies, and game mechanics for the entire game, leading to way too much repeition. There are also numerous reported bugs, some of which you must restart the entire level over again for, such as I had to, which can lead to 20-30 minutes of lost time. Seeing as how the game has been out a while not as many bugs should persist as you see reported on the message boards. The ending is anticlimactic. More of the game should have been spent platforming/fighting enemies etc as opposed to just breaking barriers which bouncers and moving gateway triggers. The levels are big and have multiple branching paths which can be confusing because you have to spend way too much time solving similar puzzles. Some levels such as running from something, or guiding the way for someone, break up the monotony, but are too few and far between. I would there would have been more of those different type of levels. Each level boils down to using the ship and the guy, each of which feels like the last time you used them. Still a fun game and inventive way to incorporate music into it all. Also there is the cuteness factor. 7.5/10			"

The environment is beautiful and feels so alive since it is always a part of the music, which, is outstanding in itself as well as the way it fits the game. The characters all feel unique and the obstacles are all engaging enough to keep you interested. It's a well executed game and all you have to do is watch the trailer to get the need for this game.

												This is music about a game. No wait. This is a game about music. No not that either. This isn't a music game either.This is the one and only game where music is a complete part of the gameplay. Enemies and environment create the music. The music is literally played by the objects you see on or near your screen, and the volume increases as you get closer. Your character moves at the rhythm of the music. Most objects and puzzles beat, like the music, and your actions are tied to the beat you're hearing.Plus the music is great. Even more so in-game. Especially level 5.Praise the music. Amen.			"

												A charming little game that's like Fly'n in having a simple, yet vibrant and beautiful style, with a bit of Bit.Trip Runner, in that the level and your actions affect and are affected by the soundtrack. Controls can be a little clunky at times, but it's forgiving enough that the controls are never really frustrating (not to say it's mind-numbingly easy, although it's certainly not hard). Definitely has a very nice style that's very much its own in terms of both art and music, which is entirely why you should play it, it's pretty great over all.			"

												Beatbuddy is a charmer of an action-adventure, where you help a tadpole-seacreature-whoknows thing stop an evil moustached prince from stealing all the music from the land..err sea.Whilst it's not the most challenging as an action or puzzle game, it does provide a good few hours of gameplay.  Backdrops have an aquatic cartoon feel, perspective shifts smooth and well, but it's the music that's the feature - not just the selection, but the way in which the designers have integrated rhythm into the game.Much of the flora and fauna in the game both move along with the beat and in some cases provide percussion.  It's a charming experience and it's easy to find yourself stopping just to listen and watch them  all do their thing.  Being in time also helps in moving around and in solving some of the parts of the puzzles.  Even the beatboxing that musically represents the character dialogues fits in well.On the downside, it's a little short and it's a little easy, but if you want a few hours chilled gameplay, then you can't go wrong.

												Is awesome visuals and great music alone enough to sell a game? Not to say Beatbuddy offers nothing else but that was my first thought as I spotted this brilliant looking game. It seems to me often indy games either focus on game play or art and usually sacrifice one for the other. It is an unfortunate decision when it comes to the meager budgets such studios often have to work with. Beatbuddy certainly focuses on the visuals with some amazing eye candy that I can tell was lovingly crafted by a very hard working artist and on top of that it incorporates some amazing music into it as well.So the game looks amazing and features some pretty good music. But the ultimate question we always have to ask ourselves, how fun is it? Visuals are great but in my experience after a few hours of playing the wow-factor always wears off no matter how pretty the game is. At that point I just focus on the whole purpose of the game, playing it! Steam classifies Beatbuddy as a “Casual Indie Platformer Action Adventure” game. And while it does fit into the extremely generic Action Adventure classification, platformer seems not to do the game justice. Was Echo the Dolphin a platformer? That is what reminds me most of Beatbuddy’s gameplay style. And it is refreshing to see something similar with your little Beatbuddy swimming around the world rather than jumping from platform to platform. If anything its more of a puzzle action game as you traverse the beautiful looking water caves of ‘Symphonia’.Part of me feels like there was some sort of checklist over in Threaks’ development studio. What does a good action puzzle game have to have? Launch springs? Check. Vehicle sections? Check. Teleporters? Check. Dashing Combat? Check. Collectibles? Check. Open and closeable doors? Check. Moveable walls? Check. While nothing is particularly ground breaking it is certainly full of your typical puzzle elements. The vehicle section seems to offer the only really unique little caveat with your vehicle only being able to shoot in one direction and you have to find these arrow points to rotate you around so you can blast through different parts of the maze. Overall it’s a pretty good set of puzzle game components but I have one annoying complaint. Beatbuddy introduces one element at a time and gives you time to master each element before adding a new. This is a good idea and all but I feel they take too much time introducing new elements. Because of this the first 4/5 of the game feels like little more than a long drawn out tutorial where you master each element and then mix it in with some old element, then move on.This makes the first few levels feel incredibly unchallenging. Frankly I was starting to get bored but kept plowing through anyway. The visuals and music were almost enough to make up for the slow increase in complexity but the game was really lagging halfway through. Yet when I reached the last level and all the different complex systems were used together, the game was really quite fun. The only problem was I had about 45 minutes of fun after about 4 hours of meh. If the game had kept going, had a few more levels with all the toys in them, I’d have been really really happy with this game. Yet it left me somewhat disappointed when it ended. And the game is really much too short. Even though I was taking my time (flower sniffing as my MMO friends would say) I still completed the whole game in under 5 hours. That seems a bit of disappointing value for the $15 cost of entry even with the great music and visuals. Hell, you know a game might be too short when there’s an achievement for beating it in under 3 hours!The music system however is really quite good. I actually hope mainstream game developers might take a few chapters out of Beatbuddy’s book here. Each level (or track) has a unique song that flows in the background and changes dynamically based upon what you are doing. It will kick up into full gear when you’re in a vehicle or lulls back to a simple beat when you’re just mellowing in empty water. It is further enhanced as enemies add their own tracks that work into the rhythm of the song. This gives me ques as to upcoming enemies such as snare drums means I’m going to be running into some spike guys soon or a throbbing base drum means there’s a springy thing around. The best use of this is the snail mounted turrets that shoot at you in beat to the song. It’s really quite clever and makes me really feel the rhythm as I try to dodge deadly flying objects.For the most part I felt like Beatbuddy might be too easy. The game is incredibly forgiving most of the time with your character able to take many hits and plentiful sources to replenish health abound (heck your vehicle automatically restores health after just a couple seconds). None of the puzzles are mind bendingly difficult and only one or two near the end even take more than a few moments of thought to figure out. I almost feel like the developers didn’t want you to have any troubles in seeing their beautiful art/music project and made sure the game did not get in your way. There are a couple places that I got a little frustrated at but nothing so bad as to make me rage quit and generally I was able to figure out a way forward and continued my progress.While the game seems fairly well polished I did run into a few blemishes along the way. The intro and ending cut-scenes (which featured a horribly annoying beat-bop voice that I just wanted to strange!) had a white border around the hand drawn visuals. And then the caption, in white, bled over the border making it hard to read what was said. Since the voice was trying too hard to be beat-ish I could hardly understand was was said either. Also I found a few places when running from a collapsing ceiling (check) where I would get stuck. The ceiling collapsed down then stopped and locked me in a small box with no escape and I ended up having to quit and launch the game again to go back to the most recent checkpoint. For that matter, checkpoints? I thought we were past that ancient system! Another thing that really drives me bonkers is the camera constantly zooming in and out. I wish they’d pick a zoom level and stick to it, preferably far enough away that I can see where the hell I’m going rather than the tight shots that make it far too easy to get lost.Also don’t look for much in terms of story here. I think there might have been somebody somewhere with a nice story but almost none of it is portrayed in the game. It feels like it was ripped out of your typical tropes, some army invades some temple, kidnaps the princesses, and you have to rescue them. Also once you finally catch up to the end boss don’t expect some climactic final fight, the ending is more anti-climactic than doing laundry.

												I wish I could select both yes/no. I will put down NO. NOT because the game is bad. NOT because it isn't fun. NOT because the graphics are pretty nifty. I am putting NO down because this game has TOO MANY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BUGS! I've had to restart COUNTLESS levels because of the buggy game interaction. It's freakin' ridiculous. Like, at Chapter 4 of the hive, after narrowly escaping death, i get to the end point and... NOTHING HAPPENS?!??!?!?! What in the actual freight train is up with that?! I had to restart that whole chapter because of that. And, it's not the only chapter where this happens. When the game first introduces the option to turn on/off beats you get thrown into a world of fury with switches turning beats off and the beats NEVER TURNING BACK ON AGAIN. In my case... I had to restart the whole ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ level, NOT just the chapter, but the WHOLE... DAMN... LEVEL...It's enfuriating. But, once you get past that, it's a lot of fun and I'm still playing it.			"

The story mode is quite long so you can spend a lot of time playing this game without being bored. It is a really unique game, I really like the fact that is based on rythms.

												Bought this during a Winter Sale and was pleasantly surprised by this little gem of a game!Beatbuddy is a rhythmn platformer in which you play as a little dude swimming through a world where music is (literally) life. Nearly every moving object on screen has a set sound, which all combines into a really cool beat that plays throughout your adventure. You must dodge, remove, and blast through many of these objects in order to solve puzzles and clear your way through each level. Think the swimming sections of the old Ninja Turtles game, but without the electricution every two seconds.The world created here is absolutely gorgeous, with smooth animation and vibrant colors. The puzzles themselves aren't typically too difficult, but it will take a little over half an hour to clear each zone with numerous auto-saving checkpoints along the way. You'll run into various other characters, and there's quite a bit of humor and charm with this.The main draw, of course, is the music. The way the various ""creatures"" and objects in the game combine to make a solid rhytmn is marvelous. It's not like a lot of music games that claim objects fit the beat; here, you can see everything bobbing and moving in time with the song. Crabs become hi-hats, jump platforms pulse with bass, snare bubbles open chambers, and lasers are, well, laser beats. What results is an incredibly chill experience that will leave your own head bouncing in tune while you play.I really can't recommend this enough as a hidden diamond among Steam games. During Steam Sales, it tends to dip below $4 and is worth every penny. It was an absolute steal at $1.75.			"

												I guess you can call Beatbuddy a platformer even though there's not actual platforming or jumping segments throughout the game because you actually swim, or atleast I think so. Beatbuddy tells the story of the 3 awaken guardians of Symphonia, a land moved by music where everything including life itself, acts in response to the music. That's probably the strong point of this game, the synchronization of the animations with the soundtrack itself is just perfect. To be honest the game is not exactly nothing out of extraordinary, in my honest opinion, it's good at most but like I said, the soundtrack turns Beatbuddy into something much more enjoyable. The game takes about 5-6 hours to complete and each level has several chapters. There's checkpoints spread throughout the levels in which you save your progress. Overall the levels are pretty well designed along with the background artwork. Most of the game involves bashing walls using the ""bass plants"" which propel you foward and you might change your path by going against mirrors and rotating them in order to go to the right place, there's also times in which you drive some kind of submarine which is actually pretty fun because it moves in bumps synchronized with the beat, other than that is basicly just beating down enemies and moving some kind of devices from one place to another in order to open doors. The game was surprisingly fun for me to play through and relatively short. If you enjoy a good soundtrack then you'll probably have a great time with Beatbuddy, if you're expecting a platformer or something more elaborated, you're not going to get it here.			"

												This is a great simple Indie game, which is strongly related to the rhythm of the music playing, which is not boring or tiring at all.   It's interesting that you can play it with keyboard and mouse (sometimes only the mouse) and with the controller, because you choose how you feel most comfortable with. The story is very interesting, and the gameplay isn't hard to get, since as you play you receive information ""on demand"", that is, when you really need it. Finally, even if you don't play this game for hours straight it's still fun; and its FPS is 60 without requiring too much of your computer. Therefore, I advise that people buy this game, especially if it has some discount.			"

It reminds me of a less-fun version of Aquaria. In fact, I'd almost call it a blatant Aquaria knockoff.I got it with one of those bundles that has mostly shovelware in it, though, so go figure.

												The game seemed fun for the first 3 levels but after that it all went downhill. The controls felt really weird through out the game and I never got the hang of driving the vehicle. I just rammed through everything. Few bugs here and there and bad design choises overall gave a bad impression. The art was okay mostly, but didn't strike as something I would remember. Though sometimes the art cluttered the screen so that I didn't see anything I was doing. Too much stuff going on on the screen. Characters were good, but not used much, so the story was very thin. Most of the time I wasn't sure what was going on. Level design didn't help when I was just pushing one way without knowing what I'm supposed to do next or where I'm going. The game just wasn't fun to play and the beat/music part felt sometimes superimposed. The soundtrack was good though. "

												Rez is a rhythm-based game. This is not. I can only figure that this game is coasting on its ""indies....support the indies!"" status that tends to make people judge it less harshly. It reminds me of a less-fun version of Aquaria. In fact, I'd almost call it a blatant Aquaria knockoff.I got it with one of those bundles that has mostly shovelware in it, though, so go figure. I would pass on this unless you like uninspired platforming.			"

												A beautiful 2D puzzler that never really utilises it's music roots. The game's story is dull, and the ending truly unsatisfying. The gameplay started off novel, but grew tiresome by the time you have got the the second level out of six. The thing that really ruins this game however, are the multitude of bugs. I had to reset the level a couple of times, losing all progress, due to game breaking bugs such as the beat springs not working when they should. 4/10			"

												For those of you looking for a fresh take on rhythm gaming, I could not recommend this more.You travel the world of Symphonia as Beat, one of the 3 guardians that hold the rhythm of their world in balance. It's an explorative puzzler of a game that will have you dodging obstacles like the conductive hand of the Hi-Hat crab, or bouncing your way through the water on Bass drum plants on the quest to stop the evil prince attempting to take total control of Symphonia's music.Each stage of the game hosts its own unique tune, and it's incredibly fun seeing just what part of the environment is playing each instrument in the composition, with parts picking up or slowing down depending on where you are in the map. They've got all sorts of genres in store here and you're sure to find a favorite or two during your time playing.The art style is also gorgeous, with several layers of hand drawn visuals across every inch of the screen. Every new level hosts  a barrage of eye-popping visuals. From giant coves of crystals, to wide open expanses of sunset colored anemones.I do have a few complaints. Portions of the game that are more fast paced and on the clock can be a bit tricky to maneuver with the underwater controls, as you'll sometimes find your little Beatbuddy drifting in another direction or bouncing off the walls from trying to move too fast. I almost find it better just tapping the fast movement button for a quick burst as you're first taught in the game, rather than holding it down.Another bit of an issue can be the combat. It's not too often at the start, with just a mere enemy or two to smack. However when a multi-targeting system is introduced about 3-4 stages into the game, it can be a bit dodgy to use when 5-6 targets are constantly moving about. Thankfully there's usually enough health pick ups to make up for the health loss when I resort to spamming the punch button on everyone in the room.Gripes aside, the main pull of this game is in it's core mechanic, rhythm based puzzling. And that is where it definitely succeeds. There is an incredible charm to seeing the stage move in perfect harmony to the musical score as you solve it's mysteries to move to the next area.I also do enjoy the story and characters dollaped on top. This sort of game could've easily been done with no plot tying it together and more abstract environments, but the plot adds just enough without being too serious or overbearing to affect any enjoyment you'd get. All the characters have fun designs and quirky dialogue to carry it all along, and none of them overstay their welcome or take away from the gameplay. (Even if the character's various beat-boxing voice boxes can get a little jarring to hear after the 12th time that it's looped)I'm getting a real kick out of it, and as of writing this review I happened to pick it up for a steal at over 75%, so it's MORE than worth the money if you catch it on sale. It has it's quirks, but not enough to completely ruin the fun you're sure to have.			"

The game is beautiful to look at - escpecially the scenery - but it's the music that makes it such a fun game. The music is not only great, it is fully integrated in the game play. Beatbuddy needs to flow with the music, with the beat, in order to pass obstacles and beat enemies.Fun detail, in Beatbuddy's world, the language is beatbox... Haha. :)			"

												Contrary to some negative reviews, I find this game quite pleasing with the premise of rhythm and beat ruling the game. Sure, it's not exactly a strict move-on-the-beat game like Audiosurf or DDR, but instead is an adventure in a world that was created by music. The fact you can move freely and miss the beats doesn't really ruin the experience for me - it is a free-movement game, of course. The world itself moves to its own rhythm and you can try to follow it, or not. Using mouse controls makes a world of difference to the experience in comparison to other schemes. The art style is vibrant, the music is fantastic and so far it's proven to be an experience worth experiencing. Good job to the developers and musicians on making a fun, yet incredibly groovy game.

												This game's atmosphere is easily the best part about it, it's a joy to watch the elements of each song flow in and out while exploring each level. The puzzles are overally pretty good, a bit repetitive by the time you reach the last level though I suppose. The art and music are both fantastic, gorgeous-looking game world and a diverse soundtrack despite being only 6 songs long. There is some bugginess however and trying to complete the collector achievement isn't really worth it in the state the game is in however, as it requires collecting everything in each of the rather long levels in a single go, which is probably the most negative aspect of the game. Still fun enough and certainly unique enough to deserve being played though.			"

												""Beatbuddy: Tale of the Guardians"" is a sweet music and beat based game. The level of adorableness of this game is too damn high. So let's take it from the top.The environment is underwater. The beautifully made areas are hand painted, and filled with rock formations, plants, and cute sea creatures. It is all very pleasing to the eye, and generally forces me to smile throughout the whole experience. Also, the environment is not motionless, it is all vibrant, pulsating, bouncing, and swinging to the soundtrack.The main character is called Beat Buddy. It's a small, blue, bubbly creature with big eyes, and... earphones. Whenever you stop to figure out a puzzle, he floats in the water bouncing his head and swinging his arm, like a real DJ. Did I mention it is adorable?The game is basically an action-adventure with loads of puzzles, all focused around the music playing in the background. Each obstacle, element, creature has it's own unique sound which always incorporates nicely with the music, creating a beautiful, energetic soundtrack. From jazzy oldschool sounds, through clubby electronic, and even funky-rocky sounds.While you can solve any puzzle and go through any obstacle without even turning the sound on, listetning to the soundtrack gives you an advantage. The beat, the sounds actually give you small tips and clues, when and how you should move to go through a challenge effortlessly.The puzzles slowly progress from absolutely obvious to very complicated. It requires logical thinking, timing, and a good ear.For me, the game is very relaxing. As I traverse the underwater environment, searching for my friends, hoping to save them.. as I bounce, float, punch my way through complicated labyrinths, I feel myself unwind. The music, the soft but vibrant colours, the sweet personality and feel of the game have a wonderful, positive impact on my mood.So if you would like something gentle, soothing, and adorable. Something that will make you smile, but will still challenge your gaming skills, try ""Beatbuddy: Tale of the Guardians"". And don't forget to wear good headphones or turn your speakers up.			"

												TL;DR: It's not bad. It's well made, but it's too bland for a definite reccommendation.This game, uh... I don't know how to put this. I mean, I just completed it one minute ago but I think I can sum things up.If you skip this title, you're not missing much. I don't feel like my time was wasted, but there are more interesting games out there that I can't say pick this one up. I got it as a Humble Bundle order, and honestly wouldn't have played it if it weren't for that fact. Don't get me wrong, what it does is alright. For the most part the obstacles move to the beat rather than you, which is unique along with its art and setting.I'm only giving it a thumbs-down because I don't ESPECIALLY recommend it. If there were a more neutral option I'd give it. It's not an involving game, so if you need that then it might suit you. I'm pretty sure this was a college project.			"

												(Linux Version reviewed)For a game that advertises a great musical experience, it sure is devoid of music. “Beat Buddy” is actually an action-puzzle game, with a heavier emphasis on puzzles (and drums) than I was expecting. The production values are great, with slick, captivating graphics and smooth controls. But after an hour and a half of playing, I didn’t get to hear one song in the heavily-promoted soundtrack. All you’ll hear are drums and cymbals, with an occasional snippet of sampled music. Basically, you’re listening to a drum machine for hours on end, which I found so irritating that it killed the game for me.It’s a shame that the “drum machine” aspect ruins the game, because it’s otherwise a decent-enough game.

												This game is worth it for the soundtrack alone, but beyond that it's actually a great game in its own right. I won't lie this game has it's odd little problems, at one point I got stuck on some scenery and toward the end of the game some of the scenery actually started to disappear.Beatbuddy is a rhythmic platform puzzle game... Of sorts. The thing is the game world is, presumably, underwater. So your character (and all others) swim, so it's not like you jump, making the platform part kind of moot. I say it's a rhythmic game because the entire world runs to a beat, each level has it's own song, sadly there aren't many levels. Within each level are several puzzles which, of course, you have to do to progress.In honesty I think I spent most of this game just listening to the  soundtrack.			"

												It's not an overall terrible game, but it is incredibly tedious. The puzzles are bland and after the first fifteen times you bounce off plants after aligning a couple drum-things, it gets rather boring. Plus I encountered game breaking bugs like when, during a chase scene in Chapter Two, I could not shoot through the pillars to escape the giant fish head. There was also the time my character disappeared from the screen entirely, and I had to restart the game. It does have a nice feature where, if your computer has changeable colored lights on the front, they will pulse and change color with the music and environment.I did not finish this game, as I could not proceed past the aforementioned bug, and it was getting repetitive. Maybe the puzzles (and music) get more varied as you go on, but I don't feel compelled enough to find out.C-I felt this game had some interesting mechanics, but they weren't fleshed out enough. Plus, game stopping bugs.			"

												This is a mostly good game. I read some of the reviews while playing it, and for a while I disagreed. I have a lower end computer, and for most of the game the fps was fine, which worked for me. I loved the music, and at first worried that I would get sick of hearing the same song for upwards of 45 minutes or so, but it was always just fine, seeing as how it would always play differently depending where in the level you are. The songs are fantastic, no doubt about that. The problems with the game are all in the final level. Many of the puzzling elements are quite forgiving, and moving around each level is relaxing a majority of the time. Not so for the final level. It was buggy (I ran into three bugs within a half-hour), ridiculously hard (most puzzles in the game I cleared on the first or second try, for the final level the last puzzle took me twenty minutes alone), and the game wraps up in a cliched ridden and unsatisfying way. It could have been so much better, had it been anything like the previous levels. The worst part is, it leaves you on a sour note. The last level makes me bring the game from a 9/10 to a 6.5/10. I still suggest you play the game. Just set your BS tolerance on high for the final level.			"

												Now here's a game which is entirely its own thing. It's a bit like Alice: Madness Returns in that it has six very, very long levels which tend to be constructed from a rather small handful of mechanics, but they're all exceptionally pretty, and the game's integration with the music is impressive. By the last level I was tiring a little of the toolbox, but the last level itself has some good twists - sometimes literally - and overall I think it's well worth the price.			"

												I know how hard it is to create a good game and I want to say out loud that this game made many things fine, but there is also plenty of bad things. I especially like the idea of merging and developing the game mechanics together with other aspects of the game (here only with music). It is my ideal approach to game design. You should play this game to see it. On the other hand game isn´t fun. It is confusing in parts: beautiful paintings doesn´t show you your way through in some places. Although it is kind of easy it fails to learn you something about the environment: like that beautiful yellow crystals are bad. They looks like purple/pink one but these will kill you. I had it on my mind, but I thought: don´t be paranoid, just try it. New (and evil) things should be introduced more ""spectacularly"". Simply: play it to see new approach to game design. "

But that is not the reason I'm surprised, the game itself is built upon Unity's engine. Which is a wonderful sign of more and more developers using it.One can argue about Beatbudddy's level desigin or gameplay. But with such an awesome art style and soundtracks you tend shove it's flaws aside. It is one of the greatest journey that I'v been a part of.

												The game had potential as a music puzzle type but it just fell flat.The game has good visuals with almost no glitches and has good game mechanics (with a mouse anyways). There are two different modes: 1 with a vehicle and one with you moving around which offers a good change of pace once in a while so you don't get bored.However, the puzzles are simply get the key to the door with increasingly complicated ways and are not that challenging. The soundtrack had its moments but the same 10 second loop gets ANNOYING after a while. There is a story there with something about taking over the music or something but its so underdevoloped that you basically can skip all of it. Also, its very short (I took my time and beat it in 6 hours). There are collectibles but I just basically gave that up realizing that all it had were extras.Overall, it had potential but it lacked a good amount of challange. As a simple way to pass the time, not bad but you can do better.			"

												Really interesting ""musical platformer"" game.The soundtrack is superb, the dialogues blend in perfectly with it (some of them are not words at all, but beatboxes that go along with the music).Story is nice, simple and interesting, not pretentious at all (unlike some games that try too hard hard in this aspect and end up failing miserably).Controls are good. On rare occasions t might be a bit difficult to execute some moves, but I found it so rare that I can never say the controls are bad. It plays well both on a keyboard+mouse and on a controller.Graphics are gorgeous, really well done.You can see the devs put their heart in this game, everything has that extra tounch on it, like the sounds, graphics and dialogues.Overall I would give 9/10 to this game, mainly because of the soundtrack and sound effects.Great game, please give it a try.

												I see a lot of people on my friends list also, like me, bought this when it was cheap. I haven't played it that much yet but I don't think it's my sort of game. It's basically a 2d swimming between caves and so on game with charming, almost cutesy graphics and mildish puzzles. There's a connection to music and rythym in the mechanics of the game. It's not for me but you might like it if you like Aquaria.			"

												(Originally posted March 6 2014)Tried to give Beatbuddy a try tonight (no, that statement is not redundant), but gave up after about 10-15 minutes (and very little of that was spent actually ""playing""). I got this in a recent Humble Bundle (I didn't buy this game specifically), and a music/rhythm action–adventure game isn't really my thing, but I thought I'd give it a try…First off, this game is intended to be played with a gamepad (not mouse or keyboard), but gamepad support was…""not great"", in my experience. Buttons on my Xbox 360 controller didn't map automatically, and try as I might, I couldn't GET them to map. I tried both mouse and keyboard controls, and they were both terrible.As for the game itself, aside from an intro where the narrator was using such an annoying vocal affectation that it provoking me to feel an inclination towards physical violence… I'll just say that the gameplay wasn't my ""thing"". I might possibly have given it a bit longer had I actually been able to use my gamepad, but at this point my patience was wearing a bit thin. Too bad, Beatbuddy—no recommendation from me!			"

												Just no. It's not a bad game, but definitely not my cup of tea.The setting is unique - underwater world full of sea life. World is beatiful and levels are rich in details. Graphical style is unique. Sounds are beefy and music fits the atmosphere. Controls are weird. They definitely are bound to rhythm and you have to learn it. Mechanics are simple - collect things, shoot and destroy obstacles and enemies. Often you have redirect bumpers to lanuch things to destroy something. You are often required to time things and that's what I personally hated. Constant timing of movements, not getting hit, doing things in time... zzzzzzz. Nope. I don't like it.Performance and controls are fine.You can see that I'm bored, and I don't enjoy it. Yep. The setting and mechanics don't appeal to me. I just hate timing actions in game and that's what this game is about. I had to redo certain parts several times and that just killed fun for me. I can't enjoy a game that is constantly punishing me. Just let me get to another checkpoint. Nope, you have to time things right... Pffff, bog off. The best time I had with this game was the moment when I hit ""uninstall"" button and I knew I would not launch it anymore. That was a good time. "

												Beatbuddy is a beautiful side-scrolling game with lots of nuance and creativity, and the music is great, and guides you well through the game-play and puzzles. It lacks a little depth and variety but the good looking graphics and story make up for it.It is not my favorite type of game as I'm not a big fan of platforming but this is one is interesting to say the least. So if you are into this thing, I strongly recommend this game.Check out more reviews on http://completingthebacklog.blogspot.co.uk/ "

												BeatBuddy: Tale of the Guardians is a little relaxing game where you're controlling the cute little Beatbuddy into a musical adventure, where you have to solve little puzzles, follow the rythm to escape from somewhere and evolve in a constant moving universe.    This indie game, pretty cheap for what it offers, contains musics from nice artists like Parov Stellar or Sabre Pulse, to follow you in amazing world (I really love Parov Stellar.)     Level-designs, drawings and animation are very nice, it can't make you rage, if you'll stay happy and relaxed, thanks to this harmony of music, colors and nicelly placed checkpoints.     Its story is pretty simple, but attractive, the gameplay is easy to handle, you can choose between keyboard, mouse or Gamepad.It's actually on Humble Bundle, with other nice games, you should try it, for charity and for yourself. (More for yourself than for charity, because you'll love it.)			"

After playing this game i couldn't help singing over and over these musics. The story isn't really interesting but it matches the game atmosphere. The fact that you are under water is really awesome and i think that it fits perfectly to the concept of a music game.If you buy this game you'll surely want to buy the ost and that's perfect because you can get it on their website for 3 dollars or more as you wish.

												I enjoyed playing this game very much! So much that I am writing my first review about a game. This type of game is meant to make the player use the clever beats and rhythms the designers implemented to go along with the level environment. BE the Beatbuddy! The art was very pleasing to the eye and the color elements in each level had its own distinct flavor that added to the game's unique nature. When I thought the game showed everything it had, something would always surprise me and that's one of the things that kept the game interesting. I highly recommend it for those players who like games for their art, music, platformer and puzzle/problem solving elements a game offers. Great game. It kept me busy for some time. Don't zip through the levels, just take your time and really take in the hard work the makers put into it. Aside from art work and music, the puzzles were fun and there were parts that were quite challenging. Oh! One more thing of course. The extras that are given really make you appreciate the game that much more. It tells you the story of how they made the game. And as you play on and collect the pink shards, you get more extras and it was really neat seeing how the game progressed. Again great game!			"

												a cool rythmatic game that makes me happy just to look at. The art is great, as well as the interaction of audio with the game's elements. I would like to classify it as a antigrav puzzle game platformer, thought its actually taking place underwater so you swim freely about besides some stuff kicking you away quickly to the booms of a bass drum. The only reason i have little time on this is because i got a headache from it, the bass was too much. I DONT listen to modern music and as a matter of fact i despise it. This may have overdone it on the bass, but the actual composition is of a peppy techno jazz with a boom to it. 8/10 only because my head hurts.			"

												Let's get the good parts of this game out of the way first: This game is a mostly fun, rythmic, enjoyable puzzler with a great feel to it, and if you don't watch yourself, you'll probably be nodding your head with the beat. This game feels like an indie game. It really does, and I thought it was for quite a while. It's not. This isn't bad however - I like it when publishers make inovative games like this.The soundtrack is great, and so it should be, because, well, this game's core mechanic is music, and more specifically beat.The hand-drawn sprites and 2D design looks charming, if a little fuzzy up close.This game looks great, doesn't it? Well here's where we get to the flaws.This game frustrates me so much in that It could have been amazing, but the part at which it fails just so happens to be 'game' part, which just so happens to be a pretty vital thing in a video game. The controls are floaty and slow to respond, the levels are designed rather poorly, like the designers wanted to make them look good at any cost, even at the comprimise of functionality. Also, this game is riddled with bugs. On my first playthrough I encountered 3 gamebreaking bugs, which ruined entire levels as I had to go through 30 minutes or tedious work to bypass a bug. The devs seem to be updating this game, but for me the updates fix nothing - it's really buggy, and the devs haven't done much to fix it.Don't buy this game at full price. If it's heavilly discounted, think about giving it a go. Maybe.			"

It's a shame this hasn't had better promotion, because it deserves some love.  Great art and fantastic music that synchs with the gameplay.  It's Ecco or Aquaria meets rhythm action.  Good, clean fun with solid mechanics.  It had me grinning like an idiot quite a few times.			"

												Beatbuddy is a great game for music lovers, or just plain lovers of rhythm games. It also has a beautiful visual aesthetic which harkens forth memories of Rayman: Origin's amazingly beautiful graphics.For those without much care for musical games or bad rhythmic abilites, Beatbuddy may feel monotonous. But those of you who like their game to feel like playing a muical instrument, you'll see far past and even immerse yourself in that same monotony.			"

												I enjoyed playing this game very much! So much that I am writing my first review about a game. This type of game is meant to make the player use the clever beats and rhythms the designers implemented to go along with the level environment. BE the Beatbuddy! The art was very pleasing to the eye and the color elements in each level had its own distinct flavor that added to the game's unique nature. When I thought the game showed everything it had, something would always surprise me and that's one of the things that kept the game interesting. I highly recommend it for those players who like games for their art, music, platformer and puzzle/problem solving elements a game offers. Great game. It kept me busy for some time. Don't zip through the levels, just take your time and really take in the hard work the makers put into it. Aside from art work and music, the puzzles were fun and there were parts that were quite challenging. Oh! One more thing of course. The extras that are given really make you appreciate the game that much more. It tells you the story of how they made the game. And as you play on and collect the pink shards, you get more extras and it was really neat seeing how the game progressed. Again great game!			"

												Beatbuddy is a really lovely little adventure game which combines good old platform/puzzle mechanics with a really cool rhythmic aspect that will keep you jigging along as you play.  It's been said a million times, but the soundtrack to this game is amazing (and I'll probably be buying it next chance I get).  The graphics and general atmosphere are really nice to look at, and it's clear that a great deal of care went into the game design.  The story isn't particularly groundbreaking; it's tongue-in-cheek, really, but the most important aspect of Beatbuddy is gameplay, which does not disappoint.  It is a rather short game, but the behind the scenes extras give it some replay value.TLDR: It's short, but fun and pretty to look at with a great soundtrack.  Despite getting this game in a bundle, I would have gladly paid full price for it had I known how good it was.EDIT: Thought I should add that I used a gamepad, and had no issues, didn't need to remap, etc.  Just worked straight out of the box, so to speak.

												First, you have to know that there are only 6 stages which is a little bit weak for the cost of this game.I got this game on sales and i must say that if you don't mind spending 9 euros for about 6 hours of game or if you get the chance to buy it on sale then buy it!This game has really great music and the gameplay really synchronyzes you with music's beat. After playing this game i couldn't help singing over and over these musics. The story isn't really interesting but it matches the game atmosphere. The fact that you are under water is really awesome and i think that it fits perfectly to the concept of a music game.If you buy this game you'll surely want to buy the ost and that's perfect because you can get it on their website for 3 dollars or more as you wish.

The levels are beautifully designed and the dialogue and characters are really cute.Of course the music is REALLY cool. Pretty good for its cheap price, i'd say it's a must buy if it's on sale.

												While I found the trailer and reviews intriguing enough to try it, also given that I'm a fan of many music games and platformers I gave it a try. But my opinion is that too easy, the gameplay is way to repetitive only getting a bit interesting late game, and a lot of the difficulty, when it is there, is more due to annoying, imprecise/unpredictable controls, combined with high requirements exactly for precision. I tried both mouse and keyboard controls, both of which didn't work all that well.I also got stuck a couple of times, one time where I had to restart the level, and others that fixed themselves ultimately.That said, it is visually beautiful, music is so-so, story is a bit boring IMO. I DID play it until completion, but maybe after the second level it was more about finishing than having fun, and then the fun returned a bit because the puzzles changed towards the end. I would probably rate it 2/5.			"

												Beatbuddy is what the title says its got a Beat with rhythm and the main controls is by using the mouse . Often times , its frustrating when using the mouse but I understand  this is the best way . Often times the environment reacts by the beat of the soundtrack during that specific level and you have to follow the beat through various obsticles . Sadly I use quite little of it just to get through certain platforms . Beatbuddy is a cute little game with a story that I could not delve myself into cuz the characters literally beatbox when they talk and MY GOD i rather hear them Beatboxing then actually making dialog .  Overall , its a different kind of rhythm with platforming mechanics I give it 6/10			"

												In a way it's sort of a puzzle platformer, except it's hard to be a platformer when you move around by swimming and there are no platforms. Even though that's where it loosely gets lumped by genre, it already gets a head start on not being just ""oh no, another one of THOSE"".For one thing, the underwater theme allows the levels to wander off in arbitrary directions and be designed around exploring them and using the game's other unique mechanics, rather than the usual focus on precision running and jumping. And those mechanics? That's where the ""beat"" comes in. Nearly every interactive object and enemy makes a sound that's part of the (pretty groovy) soundtrack of the game, and even things that don't make some kind of instrumental sound (e.g. swimming into a wall makes a nice, percussive drum-thump). Fighting/evading enemies, zipping past barriers, and solving puzzles in general ends up having a flow to it that matches the feel of the song used in that level, but without being as restrictive about it as an overt rhythm game is. Kind of like the same basic musical interaction concept as 140, only taken in a completely different direction.The art's rather nice, with enough little details thrown in to give each level a different tone and personality, but clean enough that everything's immediately identifiable. Lots of deep colors going on, which is nice for a change. The characters and story are amusing enough and keep the game moving along. Probably most importantly, the music is good and actually works for what they're doing. They actually pulled off creating a world around half a dozen electro swing songs and stuck a game into it. It keeps making me think of the animated Mr. Scruff videos from a decade or so ago and how someone created a whole world about pies and stuff (it's been a while) around a few songs, only this takes it way further and lets you play around in the world they made.

												9/10 game. Follows every concept of good game design.The way music is used to both create and let you create the world, atmosphere, and story, is so simple, so basic, but executed so effectively. It's simply too enjoyable and immersive!The difficulty scales really well until the last level, which feels a bit less difficult than the level before it, which was kind of disappointing.The story is really engaging due to how your actions affect the world. The game is extremely linear, but you really do feel like what you do in each level is determining your progression—uuuuuuuuuup until the game's climax, which was really unsatisfying. Despite that, though, the gameplay picked up the slack.All in all, I highly recommend this game. It kept me engaged throughout the single session I played, in which I completed the game. Extremely fun and enjoyable!			"

												Let's get the good parts of this game out of the way first: This game is a mostly fun, rythmic, enjoyable puzzler with a great feel to it, and if you don't watch yourself, you'll probably be nodding your head with the beat. This game feels like an indie game. It really does, and I thought it was for quite a while. It's not. This isn't bad however - I like it when publishers make inovative games like this.The soundtrack is great, and so it should be, because, well, this game's core mechanic is music, and more specifically beat.The hand-drawn sprites and 2D design looks charming, if a little fuzzy up close.This game looks great, doesn't it? Well here's where we get to the flaws.This game frustrates me so much in that It could have been amazing, but the part at which it fails just so happens to be 'game' part, which just so happens to be a pretty vital thing in a video game. The controls are floaty and slow to respond, the levels are designed rather poorly, like the designers wanted to make them look good at any cost, even at the comprimise of functionality. Also, this game is riddled with bugs. On my first playthrough I encountered 3 gamebreaking bugs, which ruined entire levels as I had to go through 30 minutes or tedious work to bypass a bug. The devs seem to be updating this game, but for me the updates fix nothing - it's really buggy, and the devs haven't done much to fix it.Don't buy this game at full price. If it's heavilly discounted, think about giving it a go. Maybe.			"

												a cool rythmatic game that makes me happy just to look at. The art is great, as well as the interaction of audio with the game's elements. I would like to classify it as a antigrav puzzle game platformer, thought its actually taking place underwater so you swim freely about besides some stuff kicking you away quickly to the booms of a bass drum. The only reason i have little time on this is because i got a headache from it, the bass was too much. I DONT listen to modern music and as a matter of fact i despise it. This may have overdone it on the bass, but the actual composition is of a peppy techno jazz with a boom to it. 8/10 only because my head hurts.			"

It has the perfect combination of rhythmic skill and puzzle solving, leaving somebody who isn't so great at one or the other still able to progress through the game while gaining satisfaction from progressing from more difficult challenges. The game in total is relatively short, yet the levels are extremely long, but the ability to autosave from your last checkpoint helps it feel less like a marathon while playing. The music is extremely infectious and will get stuck in your head for hours. It could use a little polishing story-wise, but it is a great game for what it's worth and I definitely recommend it.			"

The music sountrack is probably the best I've ever seen because the songs interact with what you are doing.

												This is truly a great game, but I'm not sure if it's worth $10.  I got in on sale for about 2$ and I think that is a VERY Good price.  I recomend buying this game as soon as there is >30% discount.  The music is really nice and pretty, and all the characters are very cute.  It is very intuitive gameplay and great with a controller.  The music sountrack is probably the best I've ever seen because the songs interact with what you are doing.  Also, the vehicle / submarine moves along to the music beat and plays the base drum!Overall, this game is very well made and creative, but probably not worth 10$			"

												Amazingly simple and infinitely fun! Winner of multiple awards including: Best serious game, best game design and best sound at the German Dev Awards (2013) and Best PC game as well as Best of at Pax East. Composer Austin Wintory (Journey PS3) did just an amazing job with the audio that a full soundtrack was released as well. With 4 years in development and hand drawn artwork this game will hook you with it's simple and fun mechanics, then drive it home with catchy and infections audio through-out. Highly recommended for casual and all levels of gamers.			"

												This game is pretty good.  Its got some interesting mechanics and music, but I wouldn't necessarily call it ""fun"". It's interesting, cool to listen to, and occasionally hits you with waves of fun (specifically, when the music is playing, and something fast paced is happening); however, occasionally it starts to lose pace, and that's where it shines a little less.  I feel like a faster tempo was their strong suite, and those moments came a bit too few and far between.That being said. Definitely worth the play: if not fun all the time, its enjoyable.			"

The puzzles are interesting, not too easy that you get bored and not too hard that you want to quit. I just finished and it took me about 5 hours to complete the game, and in my opinion it's well worth it. I think I may try playing through it again right now!			"

												As an avid fan of games where music plays a key instrument (pun totally intended) in gameplay, I fell for Beatbuddy pretty much the second I started playing. I'm only the first level in, but the sound and art designs both seem exquisite. Colorful and happy are the two things I'd use to describe the game so far, and I have no doubt I've only just scratched the surface of what this game has to offer.Take my word for whatever it's worth, given my limited playtime thus far, but if you love music and feeling happy, there's just no excuse to skip this one.

												Beatbuddy is quite an interesting game. You are the light blue slimey guy and you have some kind of story, but the music is so great that I don't even care about the story. The music is everywhere and  everything happens in the rhythm of the music.Enough of music. Anyways, you swim around and you basically solve puzzles to get forward. They aren't that hard, but they're still puzzles. Underwater. With great music.Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												Even if I feel mixed, I'll recomend this game.The graphics are beautiful.The gameplay is really cool but tend to be the same all the way to the end. (I wanted to see more ""music tricks"")The musics are awesome but tend to be long after a long play... Mainly because of the tempo : and this is why I feel mixed about this game.Basically you'll need 30min for each chunk of the game. It is good enough to apreciate the music without hating it. this part is well done.But what I did not like is that there is no variation of the tempo : every songs have the same tempo ! So even if the music change every 30min, it's getting anoying after a while...Still, I recommend this game !			"

												This is a very simple game that requires some problem solving to get through the levels. The game mechanics are simple and I've seen it done in many others. That said, what sets this game apart is the incorporation of the music into the gameplay. You have to match the beat to get through certain areas. The music is great, and I love that the character voices are different beatboxing beats for each character. The artwork in the game is very pleasing with the bright colors and the animation in the environment adds visual cues to help you match the beat.While playing this game I found myself tapping my foot and nodding my head to the beat. Great way to spend a relaxing afternoon, and the little blobby characters brought a smile to my face.I'd definitely recommend this game.			"

												This game was not as fun as I thought it would be, but it was okay. Not the kind of game I'd get immersed into and play for hours straight... rather 10 minutes at a time, because the game tends to get annoying if you play it for longer periods. The graphics are colorful and nice, the animations smooth, the gameplay a bit dull, the controls somewhat tedious but not catastrophic either. I'd still recommend it because the way the music is integrated into the game is original and pretty well done, and the tracks themselves are good (except for level 5 which was quite a bit grating...). I also appreciated the nice little details, such as skippable intro logos (a rare and precious attention) and the fact that you can still control the character during the ending credits.I give this game 6/10, and if there was to be a Beatbuddy 2 with solid improvements, I think I'd consider buying it.

												Beatbuddy: Tale of the Guardians; an indie platformer from Threaks. Let’s get rocking (and rightly so with this one).The GoodTo be honest, I hadn’t even heard of this game until it came with last week’s Humble Bundle, but am I glad that it came in that glorious bundle of games. Beatbuddy is easily one of the most satisfying games I have ever played and an multiple levels at that. The whole game is, quite literally, moving to the beat. Do you have any idea how good that feels?Not only was the whole game keeping rhythm, the music was excellent. I’m personally a big fan of Parov Stellar, so, when I found out about that contribution to the soundtrack, I was pretty stoked. Every level features a different song from a different artist, but manages to keep the same flow.The design in Beatbuddy is simply marvelous (for the most part). It’s rare to see such a creative game in terms of world building and (especially) naming things cleverly.The BadI’ve got nothing bad to say about this one, sorry.The MehThere are some parts of the game where it becomes overly difficult to maneuver with your character. It’s not a huge problem or anything (and maybe I just suck), but it can be quite frustrating.Verdict: YeaYou have absolutely zero reasons not be playing this game within the next week or so. If you’ve been looking for something new and something far different than most platformers, Beatbuddy is the game for you. You can find it here on Steam if you’re interested (and you should be). It may end up on Humble Bundle’s End of Summer Sale too so keep an eye on that. As always, thanks for reading.			"

												Clearly a labor of love, Beatbuddy shines in its aesthetic, world, and gameplay ""feel."" Everything around you moves to the beat of the music. Even your own vehicle gets a speed boost every other beat. This all comes together to make a game that *usually* feels great to play. While the developers have obviously put a lot of thought into designing each level, there are still segments that are simply not fun to play. In many situations, you will find yourself punished and killed for making a wrong decision in a fast-paced segment. This happens often enough and comes with a large enough punishment that it really does detract from the gameplay.It feels like this problem comes from over-attachment to problematic gameplay elements. For example, throughout the game, there are these ""music sources"" which are unstable and explode after you've held them long enough. You have to deliver these sources to an appropriate receptacle or risk restarting the segment. While having segments like this helps the game from feeling too same-y, it's a bad choice and should have been scrapped or re-imagined.To be honest, though, these flaws are the kind of thing that most games have. It might have a few more of them than average, but they only stand out because they occasionally disrupt the magical experience that this game has to offer. Despite my occasional frustration, I finished this game in a single sitting and came away delighted that I'd put in the time. I would recommend this game to anyone who's at all interested by the trailer. Just don't expect it to be perfectly polished.(For those who care, playtime isn't tremendously long for a $10 game. But I don't really think it's fair to judge games by playtime; you're paying for the art, music, and creativity. If you're hesitant, get it on sale.)			"

												DISCLAIMER: Although I give this a reccomendation, do NOT buy this game at full price. No reason to pay that ammount for what you get. Wait for a sale.Overall? 7/10If there weren't game breaking bugs, I would most certainly give it an 8/10. A great sidescrolling puzzle/adventure game in the spirit of Donkey Kong under water levels. It's not perfect, nor is it the most in-depth puzzle scroller I have played, however... It's a beautifully executed casual game. The music is enjoyable to listen to, and (in my opinion) doesn't make you want to gouge your eyes out after listening to it for 10 minutes.A lot of the controls/environment effects are themed, of course, around the beat of the music... and timing according to that. Though I don't think it adds anything particularly ""unique"" to the game, they implemented it well... and it fits in with the world and story.Pros:-Very beautiful game, the hand drawn environments added to my enjoyment.-It's really fun. When you aren't stuck with a bug.-Not entirely unique, but it puts a good focus on timing your movements with the beat of the music.Neutral:-Controls are a little looser than I would like when interacting with objects, not enough to be a con.-Puzzles, they aren't too hard.. and they arent too difficult. Very casual. This could be a con or a pro.Cons:-Game breaking bugs.EDIT: This isnt accurately refelcting my played time.			"

												I really don't know how to feel about Beatbuddy. The game isn't really fun but it isn't really boring either. It's just a simple game where you flip switches and flow down corridors whilst the music changes based upon environmental hazards. The music is enjoyable but the game doesn't really compliment it a lot of the time. If you want a Music game this one has music and it's a game but that doesn't make it a music game. The story isn't something to write about as I felt there really wasn't a story. The Deus Ex Machina at the end really ruined anything that was going on in the game and then it just suddenly ends. The story feels tacked on and hardly there. The Soundtrack is nice but doesn't really compliment the game in any way. It's a very Electro Swing heavy OST by some big names but overall I felt that it's more of an advertisement for the artists than anything. Overall this game is very mediocre. It isn't really fun and only held my attention for the first couple levels. The last levels just left me dissatisfied and overall perturbed when I completed the game. This game is okay, but there are pleanty of better games available. "

												Gotta move with the rhythm!Don't let the look fool you, this game is kinda tough! If you're good with timing your moves right, it may not be, but if you're a little impatient sometimes, it can turn into a really rough playthrough. That being said, it's a fun, challenging game with some cool little puzzles as a result. The story's not much to write home about, but the art style and music are the biggest highlights of this game. The developers managed to bring together a variety of musicians of all sorts (including Austin Wintory of Banner Saga and Journey fame), giving each level a nice, distinct beat to match the changing environments and increasing difficulty. Even more impressive is that the sound effects of the various objects in the game complement each song, making more challenging sections even more enjoyable as you experience the full form of the background track. The gameplay itself is pretty straightforward swimming about, grabbing objects to open doors, swiping at enemies to defeat them or to hit switches in the environment. However, much of it is interwoven with following the rhythm of certain obstacles to solve puzzles by fitting into enemy movements and/or creating openings in moving obstacles to roll with the flow to get further along. It's not hard to figure out, but getting it just right can take a few tries, and it's pretty clever design to match with the overall theme of music embedded in the game from the soundtrack to the land of Symphonia's own little mythos. If you want a lighthearted, charming experience, that doesn't over stay its welcome too long, I highly recommend checking this out. It's lots of fun, though I might recommend a controller. =)			"

												Very disapointing!!!! Starts off as a fun game but then the puzzles quickly become very tedious. Then we get to the Bugs. I'm not just talking about crashes and screen freezes here, i'm taking about bugs that force you to reset the entire level you are on and start all over!!!!! Frustrating!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I got as far as level 4 before deciding that my lifespan is far too short to deal with buggy trash like this game. The latest patches have also not helped repair the game either. I would recommend that you avoid!			"

												I liked this casual puzzle\action game a lot. Sound is a big (and good) part of the game, so, make sure to play accordingly. I end up noding along the beat for 7 hours, and was amazed by symbiosis of soundtracks with the gameplay, great job.Other than that, game is comfortably easy to play and has good level and characters design (loved ""idle dance"" of the protagonist).On the bad side, there's only 6 levels and they're longer than I would like, but, all of them having different well polished themes, It's OK as is.P.S. Make sure to go through the extras, take a peek at how indie games are made, gamedevs are fanatics ;)			"

												The world of beatbuddy is based upon elecroswingish music. Various elements of the world ""play"" different instruments and so the level environment progressively increases or decreases the music as you progress. To interact with certain elemtns you have to keep up with the rhythm and time your actions right. At times there are labyrinths and logic puzzles to be solved.Despite a few bugs my playthrough suffered on, which seem never to be fixed but could be found on google and worked around, it is a fun game.

												Good game at its core, but mouse controls are ""spongy"" which makes it very difficult to sync up to the music beat (a core aspect of the game). I encounted many game breaking bugs which forced me to give up mid-way through after the third complete restart. Fun, but not recommended in its current state as it's more a recipie in frustration due to the above than entertaining gameplay.			"

You can move the character to the rhythm and powerful beat comes from the behavior of character. It's all very excited experience. Although pure gameplay is not that good and playtime is very short(about 4 hours), this game's soundtrack is so terrific. Totally worth to play.			"

												So there I was, hands off the keyboard, on my feet dancing to Parov Stelar blaring out the speakers. The music however wasnt coming out of Spotify or iTunes but from the spiky arms of the treble crab and thumpy leaves of the bass flower. This is the world of Beatbuddy, where everything breathes harmony, rhythm and melody. Beatbuddy is a product of the recent resurgence of the indie game industry, an original, lovingly crafted title that is brimming with child-like joy and fun.In Beatbuddy you explore a world that moves to the beat, each level has a soundtrack that weaves in an out as you encounter various creatures and obstacles. In terms of gameplay there is nothing under the skin that is particularly revolutionary or unfamiliar. You float around the world a la Flyn or Aquaria, solve puzzles to open your way forward and avoid dying horribly by terrible traps. So far nothing new you say, but it's Threaks approach these familiar mechanics that makes the game a really cool experience. Life threatning bubbles are only damaging every other beat, the spiky crabs that prevent you from continuing are actually playing the treble line of a Parov Stelar song and that clanky ship you're driving, it only moves every second beat.Unlike other games where the soundtrack may complement the on-screen action to create a mood or an emotion, Beatbuddy actually incorporates the music into your movements which means you better have good rhythmic sense otherwise you're gonna hurt that cute little buddy a lot. Movement in Beatbuddy is all about timing.The stellar soundtrack is not let down by the graphical prowess of Beatbuddy, the world is hand-drawn with equal parts wonderous beauty and charming silliness that is easy on the eyes and makes you smile inside. I particularly like what you could describe as the chubby technicians that beatbox to eachother complaining about things not being broken or stuff getting stolen.Beatbuddy is a great product that overflows with love and is just a fun game. The music is fantasic and will often have you dancing along with the on-screen protagonist. So turn that music up and get ready to rumble. "

												Pros:- Great soundtrack. You just can't stop your foot from tapping the floor while playing this game. I'm listening to Beatbuddy soundtrack even after finished the game- Artwork looks very neat. Concept art and developer notes show us how much work you have to do for the beauty which Beatbuddy is.Cons:- Game is actually short. I don't know how long it takes to finish the game, but after you did you feel unpleased.- Controls. I think best controls are with mouse only if your keyboard can't stand ghosting (for this game you often need to click 3 buttons at once). Mouse isn't great either, especially when you have to pick/drop an object...- Big SnareMonsters or whatever they're called. Just hate those things. I got bumped by it many times by them. If you can avoid swimming with them, just do it or you'll get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Well, more cons than pros, but still I think this game is great and you should look forward into buying it when it comes on sale.

												EDIT:  Here is my amended review now that I beat the game (on Windows) - I left the original review at the bottom.Turns out that Windows was the key to enjoying this game.  I loved the art style, the music was awesome, the level design was exceptionally well done especially considering how it could've been extremely easy to get lost (yet I never seemed to), the only issue I really had was the controls.  On the Mac side, the mouse controls were terrible and a 360 controller didn't function properly.  On the Windows side, everything worked great on the controller and it made the game enjoyable since the controls were so tight.  If you only have a Mac, avoid this game.  If you have a PC or dual boot (and have a good controller), it's absolutely worth a buy.V.1 - I want to like this game.  The music seems cool, the art style is interesting and the concept is a fresh take on the genre, but technical problems (at least for the Mac version) are holding me back.  The game crashes more often than it runs and the menu navigates without fail via 360 controller, only to have none of the buttons work once actually in the game.  Mouse control feels supremely subpar compared to what a gamepad setup would allow.  I'll try this game again on the Windows side later, but as it stands now, I'd pass if on a Mac.			"

												I enjoyed playing this game very much! So much that I am writing my first review about a game. This type of game is meant to make the player use the clever beats and rhythms the designers implemented to go along with the level environment. BE the Beatbuddy! The art was very pleasing to the eye and the color elements in each level had its own distinct flavor that added to the game's unique nature. When I thought the game showed everything it had, something would always surprise me and that's one of the things that kept the game interesting. I highly recommend it for those players who like games for their art, music, platformer and puzzle/problem solving elements a game offers. Great game. It kept me busy for some time. Don't zip through the levels, just take your time and really take in the hard work the makers put into it. Aside from art work and music, the puzzles were fun and there were parts that were quite challenging. Oh! One more thing of course. The extras that are given really make you appreciate the game that much more. It tells you the story of how they made the game. And as you play on and collect the pink shards, you get more extras and it was really neat seeing how the game progressed. Again great game!			"

After playing this game i couldn't help singing over and over these musics. The story isn't really interesting but it matches the game atmosphere. The fact that you are under water is really awesome and i think that it fits perfectly to the concept of a music game.If you buy this game you'll surely want to buy the ost and that's perfect because you can get it on their website for 3 dollars or more as you wish.

												Beatbuddy is a really lovely little adventure game which combines good old platform/puzzle mechanics with a really cool rhythmic aspect that will keep you jigging along as you play.  It's been said a million times, but the soundtrack to this game is amazing (and I'll probably be buying it next chance I get).  The graphics and general atmosphere are really nice to look at, and it's clear that a great deal of care went into the game design.  The story isn't particularly groundbreaking; it's tongue-in-cheek, really, but the most important aspect of Beatbuddy is gameplay, which does not disappoint.  It is a rather short game, but the behind the scenes extras give it some replay value.TLDR: It's short, but fun and pretty to look at with a great soundtrack.  Despite getting this game in a bundle, I would have gladly paid full price for it had I known how good it was.EDIT: Thought I should add that I used a gamepad, and had no issues, didn't need to remap, etc.  Just worked straight out of the box, so to speak.

												It's a great blend of electroswing and other wonderful music with an interesting combination of puzzle and action gameplay. The art style with its bright colors is also easy on the eyes, but the music certainly is the game's strongest point. I terribly suck at music games, but here I kept bobbing my head to the rhythm here out of sheer enjoyment of the tunes. This, of course, helps a lot in playing as you benefit from doing certain actions within a rhythm.But anybody entirely unable of keeping a steady rhythm needs not to fret either, as the game is rather forgiving.If I had to criticize anything, it would be the fact that it's entirely possible to miss collectibles on your first trip through a stage. Take the wrong turn, and you can't go back. Sure, that's a minor complaint, but for a completionist like myself, it can be a bit jarring as you need to replay a stage at least once to grab all trinkets and possibly once more to finish a stage in as little time as possible for the ""beat the game in under x hours"" achievement.Also, the controls feel wonky at times, but you get used to it, and in no time you'll swiftly sway though the ocean.Still, it's an overall wonderful and quite unique experience that's well worth trying out not only for its great style.

Even though that's where it loosely gets lumped by genre, it already gets a head start on not being just ""oh no, another one of THOSE"".For one thing, the underwater theme allows the levels to wander off in arbitrary directions and be designed around exploring them and using the game's other unique mechanics, rather than the usual focus on precision running and jumping. And those mechanics? That's where the ""beat"" comes in. Nearly every interactive object and enemy makes a sound that's part of the (pretty groovy) soundtrack of the game, and even things that don't make some kind of instrumental sound (e.g. swimming into a wall makes a nice, percussive drum-thump). Fighting/evading enemies, zipping past barriers, and solving puzzles in general ends up having a flow to it that matches the feel of the song used in that level, but without being as restrictive about it as an overt rhythm game is. Kind of like the same basic musical interaction concept as 140, only taken in a completely different direction.The art's rather nice, with enough little details thrown in to give each level a different tone and personality, but clean enough that everything's immediately identifiable. Lots of deep colors going on, which is nice for a change. The characters and story are amusing enough and keep the game moving along. Probably most importantly, the music is good and actually works for what they're doing. They actually pulled off creating a world around half a dozen electro swing songs and stuck a game into it. It keeps making me think of the animated Mr. Scruff videos from a decade or so ago and how someone created a whole world about pies and stuff (it's been a while) around a few songs, only this takes it way further and lets you play around in the world they made.

Google ""catgroove"", listen all the way through.The trailer doesn't fully express how it feels to be in control while the beat plays out alongside.The games biggest flaws are:Being short.Being repetitive after the 3rd chapter.The astoudingly horrible introductory cinematic.

												A very charming beat-keeping puzzle game. Gorgeous art, fluid animation and a killer soundtrack that changes depending on what's on screen. Everything keeps to the beat, from the pulsating plants to the animations of the main character.The puzzles within are simple, yet challenging enough to keep you playing, and often rely on matching the beat to succeed. The game is controlled entirely with the mouse, so laptop gamers and people with no sense of rhythm need not apply. Other than that, I can highly recommend this.			"

												Beatbuddy is common puzzle game. And it's not great. But, this game's soundtrack is epic! And gameplay is mixed with this awesome ost. You can move the character to the rhythm and powerful beat comes from the behavior of character. It's all very excited experience. Although pure gameplay is not that good and playtime is very short(about 4 hours), this game's soundtrack is so terrific. Totally worth to play.			"

												Beatbuddy is an incredibly fun rhythmic puzzle platformer that will leave you bouncing to the beat as you swim through the beautiful levels. It has the perfect combination of rhythmic skill and puzzle solving, leaving somebody who isn't so great at one or the other still able to progress through the game while gaining satisfaction from progressing from more difficult challenges. The game in total is relatively short, yet the levels are extremely long, but the ability to autosave from your last checkpoint helps it feel less like a marathon while playing. The music is extremely infectious and will get stuck in your head for hours. It could use a little polishing story-wise, but it is a great game for what it's worth and I definitely recommend it.			"

												a cool rythmatic game that makes me happy just to look at. The art is great, as well as the interaction of audio with the game's elements. I would like to classify it as a antigrav puzzle game platformer, thought its actually taking place underwater so you swim freely about besides some stuff kicking you away quickly to the booms of a bass drum. The only reason i have little time on this is because i got a headache from it, the bass was too much. I DONT listen to modern music and as a matter of fact i despise it. This may have overdone it on the bass, but the actual composition is of a peppy techno jazz with a boom to it. 8/10 only because my head hurts.			"

												As an avid fan of games where music plays a key instrument (pun totally intended) in gameplay, I fell for Beatbuddy pretty much the second I started playing. I'm only the first level in, but the sound and art designs both seem exquisite. Colorful and happy are the two things I'd use to describe the game so far, and I have no doubt I've only just scratched the surface of what this game has to offer.Take my word for whatever it's worth, given my limited playtime thus far, but if you love music and feeling happy, there's just no excuse to skip this one.

												I bought this game from Humble Weekly Bundle but haven't try it, just buy that bundle for nothing. But then it collides up my friend wants me to try this game. So I just try this, and get disappointed as expected. My friend claimed this is rhythmic adventure game, probably like 140 I've been already playing, and claimed that this game is much better because it has storyline. In fact it's not. This game just attempted to be rhythmic, see how when sign just appears up and some beats beat out there. But whenever you've controlling, your movement or such, nothing seems to follow that attempt to be beat. Everything is just like click, then fly there. (It's actually swim here, though) Puzzles? Nope, they aren't, they are not unique and, not even a puzzle I can say. Things are just screw up. Trust me, do not try this, it won't be good.			"

Felt more like ~10-15.+ You get the feel for the rhythm of the game pretty quick.CON:- Some parts are really(!) frustrating because the timeframes to do certain tasks are VERY short.- It's sometimes hard to controll in some areas.- Here and there you can't enjoy the athmosphere because obstacles screw you over.SUMMARY:Here and there frustrating but all in all it's a decent game.Might take you some time to get into it, but if you have a drill, time flies.6.5/10.

												Pros:- Great soundtrack. You just can't stop your foot from tapping the floor while playing this game. I'm listening to Beatbuddy soundtrack even after finished the game- Artwork looks very neat. Concept art and developer notes show us how much work you have to do for the beauty which Beatbuddy is.Cons:- Game is actually short. I don't know how long it takes to finish the game, but after you did you feel unpleased.- Controls. I think best controls are with mouse only if your keyboard can't stand ghosting (for this game you often need to click 3 buttons at once). Mouse isn't great either, especially when you have to pick/drop an object...- Big SnareMonsters or whatever they're called. Just hate those things. I got bumped by it many times by them. If you can avoid swimming with them, just do it or you'll get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Well, more cons than pros, but still I think this game is great and you should look forward into buying it when it comes on sale.

												It's a great blend of electroswing and other wonderful music with an interesting combination of puzzle and action gameplay. The art style with its bright colors is also easy on the eyes, but the music certainly is the game's strongest point. I terribly suck at music games, but here I kept bobbing my head to the rhythm here out of sheer enjoyment of the tunes. This, of course, helps a lot in playing as you benefit from doing certain actions within a rhythm.But anybody entirely unable of keeping a steady rhythm needs not to fret either, as the game is rather forgiving.If I had to criticize anything, it would be the fact that it's entirely possible to miss collectibles on your first trip through a stage. Take the wrong turn, and you can't go back. Sure, that's a minor complaint, but for a completionist like myself, it can be a bit jarring as you need to replay a stage at least once to grab all trinkets and possibly once more to finish a stage in as little time as possible for the ""beat the game in under x hours"" achievement.Also, the controls feel wonky at times, but you get used to it, and in no time you'll swiftly sway though the ocean.Still, it's an overall wonderful and quite unique experience that's well worth trying out not only for its great style.

												Yes I recommend this game BUT not to everypony.Beatbuddy is, mostly, a rhythm game before everything else. Of course you have some puzzles, you have some exploration, action, even some auto-scrolling... plus, regarding how you're playing, it can be a point'n click, and that is quite funny, I love it that way. You can choose between gamepad / keyboard or mouse. Not keyboard AND mouse, but keyboard OR mouse.So yes, it's a rhythm game. You're free to go where you want, but the enemies and various obstacles are all based on the rhythm of the soundtrack (which is great, try to listen to it in iTunes). So if you're not fond of this kind of gameplay, maybe you'll not like this game. Plus, the puzzles are not really that hard. It's not an easy game, but it's not really hard either.Because what I like is this kind of ""flow"" you feel when you're playing, your actions matching with the tempo, that feeling that everything is going well, you're ""in"". I don't really know how to explain it, because I feel it, but you got the idea I hope.Pros:- amazing OST if you like electronic music (electro swing and stuff)- easy controlling- the graphics, not really the quality (it's good though) but the atmosphere you know?Cons:- not really hard- low replay valueThose are not really cons if you can enjoy the game enough the first time you play. I think it's worth its price.			"

												I do recommend this game, but with a couple of warnings: I'm up to the last chapter of the 5th level, and I've had to go back to the menu and restart a chapter three times so far due to glitches preventing me from proceeding. I've spent absolutely ages swimming around trying to see if I've missed something, but checking out the discussion boards about the game, it seems like these are common bugs which have been occurring for a couple of years.Also, while the music is good, it can get a *bit* repetitive; it might have been nice to have a little more variety.HOWEVER, when the game is working fine, it's ridiculously good fun. A really unique play mechanism with some puzzles having a nice and challenging level of difficulty. They've nailed the difficulty curve.Its standard price is £6.99 ($9.99 US I think?) which is *probably* worth it due to the amount of fun I've got out of it. But if you see it in a bundle or on, say, 50% off, it's an essential purchase for people who like 2D puzzle platformers.			"

												This game has lots of pretty colors, and the musical rhythm worked into the gameplay is unique. Unfortunately, those two aspects do not change the fact that the gameplay is pretty identical to a myriad of other games out there. Now I love shooters. I have played tons of shooters and there isn't really one I regret playing because each is unique and different in it's own way. If you feel the same way about this genre, then maybe this game is for you.			"

												Good game at its core, but mouse controls are ""spongy"" which makes it very difficult to sync up to the music beat (a core aspect of the game). I encounted many game breaking bugs which forced me to give up mid-way through after the third complete restart. Fun, but not recommended in its current state as it's more a recipie in frustration due to the above than entertaining gameplay.			"

												This game is a swimmy platformer that excels at the gimmick of synchronizing environmental mechanics and hazards with the syncopation of the techno soundtrack. The music is great, the graphics are sharp and beautiful, and the engine is responsive with excellent player control. Other than the music gimmick it's a pretty run-of-the-mill platformer that doesn't seem to do anything other games in the genre haven't before. As such, I've played the first area twice and may never play more than that, but it was totally worth the price for just that brief experience. One of the hardest things to do is to meaningfully synchronize gameplay with music and Beatbuddy does it better than just about any other game. It's obviously a lovingly polished game made by lovers of dance music.			"

												strangely enough, this game is more of a typical 2D puzzler than it is a rhythm game. in fact, i did often find myself doing worse when i tried to follow the beat in some parts instead of just hitting the dash button and speeding forward.there seems to be a lot of these 2D swimming/flying-through-dark-caves, and im not sure how original the concept is as a whole by now. all i know is that the environments and obstacles in this game lack variety in many cases, and it honestly failed to keep me engaged for all that long. not to mention the reaaaally irritating NPC sound loops ughhhimo, Crypt of the NecroDancer is a much better example of how to merge a genre with a rhythm game, but i dunno. maybe i'm just picky			"

												People call this a platformer game.I disagree.  This is more of a bullet hell rhythm hybrid.Fist thing to note, is that the sound track is probably one of the best things about this game.  As it should, too, as the majority of gameplay mechanics are built around the beat of that soundtrack.There isn't much in form of a story, sadly, but what's there is enough to at least give a sense of purpose and the characters created are rather colorful and entertaining to view/interact with.This is more of a relaxing/casual game than anything, so keep that in mind.~STL			"

												It’s a strange rhythm game. Yep, rhythm is an important key in this game. In the first few level you might be able to brute force it, but then you’ll hit a road block. So enjoy the game and listen to the music. The better you do the more complex and complete the music gets, and what a good music it is.It’s a good game and a good experience, so give it a try. "

												Beautiful game, Beatbuddy's animations are stellar, and the music is amazing.Unfortunately, Beatbuddy's gameplay is not as great as its aesthetics. It felt like a chore to play. The puzzles were tedious and weren't mentally challenging at all; that's basically the majority of the game (from what I played). The controls on a gamepad are passable, but the movement is floaty and I never felt like I was in total control. The music aspect, while a fun concept, ultimately hindered movement (especially while in control of the submarine), and felt more like a gimmick more than anything else. Timing button presses to move to the beat was rewarding, but often times you went too fast for the camera to catch up, resulting in Beatbuddy hugging the edges of the screen constantly and being unable to see the dangers that lie ahead.3 hours in, I managed to softlock the game by simply dying. I restarted at a checkpoint, and the bass drum plant that I needed to break a wall to progress wasn't working, and there was no way to backtrack. Even after restarting at the checkpoint several times, the bass drum launcher was still disabled. That was the final nail in the coffin.It was just boring. I was waiting for some exciting gameplay, but it never clicked for me.			"

												This game seemed quite fun and innovative, however after playing it for not very long at all the game crashed - and it crashes every time I started it. I don't think I did anything glitchy in the game, and seen as I can play most other games without a hitch I have to concldue that it's probably this game which is the cause of the crash. On that basis, I don' t recommend this game. Apologies that this is more a warning than a review. "

“Austin Wintory, you say?”My eyes glaze over from Pavlovian training as I mindlessly turn on the PlayStation 3 to play through Journey again.The problem with most music- or rhythm-based games (except for established ones like Guitar Hero, Rock Band, and Dance Dance Revolution) is that they focus too much on the music and not enough on the game.  Beatbuddy: Tale of Guardians, from German developer Threaks, seems to want to solve that problem. Though it makes a valiant effort, it does fall short. This is not to say that Beatbuddy is a bad game – it isn’t, and you’ll have no doubt noticed that I recommended it. There are some parts in the game that are truly beautiful, parts where the fantastic soundtrack, stunning art, and fun gameplay combine into something special that is greater than the sum of its parts. Although these moments outshine the boring ones, sadly, they don’t outnumber them. But let’s start with the positives: namely, the soundtrack, sound design, and the graphics. As one would expect from a music-based game, the soundtrack is excellent and quite nice to listen to outside of the game. Most of the songs lean towards the funky-electronic-jazz genre, with hard beats and mildly-synthesized instrumentation. I happen to like it; indeed, I listen to the track by Austin Wintory quite often. Sound design ties in heavily with the soundtrack. You see, the soundtrack is not playing in the background. Instead, elements of the soundtrack emanate from certain game elements – for example, the bass drum from certain bouncy mushrooms. When all of these game elements come together, the full song emerges. It’s a very cool thing to hear come together. Similarly, the graphics are excellent. The color palette is bright and colorful, and a pleasant departure from the drab landscapes seen in many games today. If nothing else, it's a fun game to look at. Gameplay is where Beatbuddy falters. The gameplay isn't bad – indeed, the first hour or so can be quite fun – but it fails to develop over the course of the game. You've pretty much seen everything the game has to offer within the first hour. Though there is an attempt to shake things up with a submarine-type object, it fails to add any depth to the game. There is also a story, though it does little more than justify the existence of the game world. It's not particularly good, but the game seems to realize that poke fun at itself, so there's not much to complain about. It basically boils down to this: if you like the first hour, you'll like the rest of game. If you didn't, there's nothing for you here. --- Played on Intel Core i7-920, GTX 260 w/ 1.8 GB VRAM, 10 GB RAM, from 7200 RPM HDD. No performance issues. Smooth 60 fps.			"
