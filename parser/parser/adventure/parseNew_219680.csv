												I lost someone recently. In those first days full of grief and exhaustion from taking care of family matters, before I slept, I'd sit and try to play something to clear my mind. I didn't feel like playing my usual games. Not shooters, not puzzles, something where I could simply be transported somewhere nice.First I thought of Bernband and Euro Truck Sim 2, but I didn't have them installed. I played Secret Habitat, I played Minecraft, and I played this game, Proteus (and a bit of its mod Purgateus).It provides the simple pleasure of walking around in a cheerful, surprisingly interactive, rather mysterious place, rendered in fidelity low enough to let your imagination amplify it.I've heard about and seen screenshots of many mechanics to discover, and even an end game of sorts. I haven't experienced most of them, though many patterns are now clear and I even found how to control the time of day. This is to say that there is just enough substance here to keep you interested, if you ever get bored of simply walking around.It's a place to unwind, basically. I love walking around woods, but I don't have easy access to them.Also, my two young nieces love watching me play it, and chasing frogs or owls or pointing at far away landmarks and getting there, talking about the cycle of night and day, about seasons, forests and animals and wandering.

												To some, Proteus is a very tranquil and peaceful first person experience, to others it might be dull and pointless. There is nothing really here other than exploring randomly generated islands all in a lo-fi pixelated setting. The game seems to have a base soundtrack of lo-fi synth beats that gets added to based on what you're currently looking at. Trees, bushes, insects, animals and tombstones will all form a melody as you walk by them.There is no death in Proteus, just walking around. The islands seem small enough to be fully explored. If there are any caves, or underground areas, I haven't found them. Since this is an exploration game, there is only walking. There is a sit button, but there is no running, no jumping, and no zoom. No crafting, building or creativity, just walking.You'll see day turn to night, the sun will set, and the moon will rise over the ocean. Summer will turn to fall, fall into winter. You can stand on mountains above rain clouds, or go down to be in the rain. You can see the stars begin to trip out and pulsate. Comets will fall from the sky and other seemingly random things. Plus portals that will suck energy orbs into them and warp you away to the next season.While you won't die, there is an end to each game. Winter will lead to the end, a closing, a goodbye, but again there is always a new island to explore. Since the game generates different islands each time you play, one island can have an uncreepy graveyard, a circle of statues, a cabin, a bay full of crabs, a flock of chickens and another island can be seemingly barren. It is always a new trip to a different island.When you evaluate whether or not to play Proteus, you need to evaluate what you're looking for. Are you looking for something to relax and zone out? Are you looking for a clear cut objective? No matter how hard you explore in Proteus, you won't find any objectives other than ones you set for yourself. Do I go over that mountain or do I follow that snow owl in the trees? The choice is yours. While someone might be able to get hours of exploring Proteus through dozens of different play throughs, but others might get bored after 5 minutes. You can complete the game in an hour, with fifteen minutes in each of the four seasons.---- someone wanted me to return to Proteus again ----This island isn't some haven or vacation. It is a gaming prison. No doors, no keys, no jumping, no running and no way off the island. Forced to spend a year in solitary confinement. Alone on an island, but yet not alone. There is the wildlife. Crabs on the ground, bees chasing me through the forest, a flock of chickens and an ominous snow owl that watches me from afar. These are my roommates. My only playthings on a bright and vibrant island.This time on the island, I managed to find the circle of totems pretty quickly. Then I found a cabin on a peninsula. After that, I discovered the fat world tree and the squirrels that frolicked beside it. Its a beautiful place to be alone. In a way there were still others here, because tombstones littered the ground. Everything makes a sound. My walk, the crinkle of pixelated leaves, toads hopping away and even the stars themselves made a harmony.Spring turned to summer. The bees were swarmed around various trees. Some may say that bees belong to the spring to pollinate flowers, but for anyone that's ever been to a theme park or opened a can of soda, they know that bees love the summer. I had completely explored the island thoroughly. At some point I just wandered along the sandy beach outline of the safe haven from hardcore games.Fall rose before I knew it. Everything was orange and flaming red. The wildlife was on its back. This land was slowly dying and so was everything on it. There was a glimpse of what was to come. I saw trees with no leaves, brief glimpses of a red sky with swirling stars as if Armageddon was there. It was only a daydream it would seem. Everything returned back to normal with leaves on the trees and the clouds coming closer to the ground.Winter came one night. The island was bleak and everything was dead with white snow. The leafless trees looked like giant thorn bushes. There were no animals. Nothing but me. I scoured the island, but found nothing but frost that covered the ground. An overcast sky shadowed the trees with a purple hue.Then as I went to the cabin on the beach, I began to slowly drift away. No not into the water, but the sky. I was being pulled off the ground like I had the year prior in Proteus. Soon I was at the clouds themselves when I had just had my feet in the snow. Through the clouds I went, higher and higher, realizing that I had succumb to everyone's fate on Proteus. Up I went, looking at the stars ahead of me. Their light guiding me off the island. I was free again. My sentence was over. I had left Proteus behind. The time spent on Proteus had made me a calmer and better person. Goodbye my prison. I will never forget you!			"

												""Simulation"" should not be a four-letter word. Just because Proteus happens to communicate the joys of exploration and nature through a digital medium doesn't mean that it has any less merit than taking a walk in the real outdoors. Still, it is impossible to deny that it is a separate experience and akin to a poem in its presentation and tone.The game sets you down just offshore of a relatively small and uninhabited island with a variety of flora and fauna. You can walk around and observe your surroundings. There is no obvious objective or even an air of secrecy about the whole thing – it is purely a game that exists to let you wander. Eventually, you'll find out how to change the seasons and find certain landmarks that trigger heightened moments of reality. You can choose to investigate any of these moments for as long as you choose to let them linger, or let them fade away by wandering over to another point of interest.It is in these specific visuals of nature afforded you that set Proteus apart from a walk you might experience in real life; Proteus is an artist's rendition of a walk. In the end, my experience playing this game does boil down to that possibly vague distinction, but if you're someone who likes stumbling across that one huge tree, or seeing clouds drift overhead, or eavesdropping on the smallest sounds of nature, I'd highly recommend looking at Proteus. It is a refreshing change of pace to take a walk in someone else's walk.			"

												Proteus is a brilliant idea that only excels in its visual execution. It perfectly captures the kind of world once portrayed using just a few, two-toned pixels displayed from an Atari 800. A world that you, the viewer were forced to imagine rather than witness in high definition glory. The problem is; there is literally nothing to do within that world expect to wander its hills and valleys scaring off groups of animals while listening to the whimsical but unimpressive, procedurally-generated music.  It is best described as a tech demo and it would make a fantastic screen saver akin to the classic Windows 3D maze. The one thing it is not however, is a game.24 hours inside of Proteus would offer no more enjoyment or depth than simply watching its 2 minute long trailer video. And that is possibly the saddest thing I've ever written in review.While most indie games leave you wanting more for their own good reasons, Proteus leaves you to starve on an empty island for want of anything at all.

												Proteus is a really nice relaxing interactive-art-game-experience-thing. The warm, shifting colors fit perfectly to the soothing music, which alters depending on which element you pass. The sun rises, the sun sets, seasons go by until a year has passed. And you wander around, unwinding and enjoying the scenery and finding little eastereggs everywhere. Day and night have their own secrets, as do the seasons. Still the game does seem to be a bit short lived. The island is just not that big and after a couple of playthroughs (which mostly take around 40 minutes or so, depending on how long you choose to linger) you've seen all there is to see in this world. It would be wonderful to see this changed in either an update or a sequel. Bigger islands, more elements. That's basically it as far as I'm concerned.In the end I enjoyed Proteus, although maybe not for its full €10,- price (at the time of writing this review). It left me with a taste for more; I might even acquire Journey, The Unfinished Swan  or replay PS3's Flower just because of this.			"

												Proteus is pleasant and engaging, but just too light on content for the price.Consider this review positive if you see the game on sale. It has a clear vision: A pleasant atmosphere with just enough mystery to keep you playing until the end. However, I was left really wanting more opportunities to interact with my wonderful surroundings more than I actually could. And so, the world was never as immersive as you'd hope.I'd be interested in a sequel that takes this idea farther. There is definitely something to it.			"

												Are games art?That's a pretty loaded question. It's hard to call Proteus a game, and it's also hard to call a game ""art"".Typically, games consist of objectives, things to accomplish. Proteus does not. Proteus is a procedurally generated experience, the music and visual style changing rapidly throughout. Is Proteus a game? That's up to you.Is Proteus art?

												Kid loves the game. Why? because it's so meta. An adult only sees a simple explorer game with some funny colors and animals and sounds. The 'game' will be 'meh' in just 15 minutes. A 5-year old on the other hand sees a huge world to explore and discover wonderfull things. And they will make up a stories for the things they find there as they play. It does help though that there is a way to progress to 'next season' and finally end the game. It is so easy a 5yo can find the ending and complete the 'game'. Most recommended.			"

												I really was hesitant about Proteus, as I've a...less than stellar opinion with many ""art"" games. Particularly those in the vein of Dear Esther and The Path. The ""look and listen, but never interact. See things that don't really mean anything"" sort. The graphical style, another ""8-bit"" game left me worried as well. Yet another pretentious faux throwback?Well, as much as one could call Proteus that, it ends up on an entirely new level of beautiful. The music your journey creates is remarkable, and the pixels really do fall away into something greater.After some time wandering around, not quite getting it, I happened upon an animal. It made some sounds, it reacted to me. I laughed a little, and looked for more. More flowers. More creatures. More trees. More things.As I started to understand what was happening, I began to appreciate it and really get into it - and then the game threw little surprises at me still.This game is completetly about the experience. The sounds, the sights, the little moments of recognition/understanding.It's a wonderful experience, if you'll take the ride. Far more than I'd have expected.At a bit under an hour, it's not a long or even complex experience - but it's a good one.			"

												I really enjoyed this experience. I only wish i would have enjoyed it with someone. When you're in Proteus, you feel like you're in between worlds (as in limbo). You're not sure what is real. The seasons change as does the atmosphere. For whatever reason this game made me feel really emotional, In a good way of course. Its very relaxing, even though is pixels you cant help but to find beauty in the land, The chilling music. It is on the expensive side for what you get. But after playing i felt like it was worth it.

												Proteus is not a traditional game. In fact, it's not really a game at all. I guess I would call it a sort of... ""interactive experience""... (?) ... I dunno... (how's that for generic?). But seriously, this is a tough one to describe. Each time you play, the game - err, EXPERIENCE - puts you on a randomly built island. The island is full of trees, wildlife, mysterious stones, and more. Your goal, if you want to think of it as such, is simply to walk around and explore. That's it. Technically, you can ""finish"" each session by performing a series of specific actions (which I won't spoil), but essentially, you just walk around and explore the island through 4 seasons, starting in Spring. As you explore, the things you do and see affect the soundtrack, which is primarily comprised of low-key ambient sounds. The visuals are also very simplistic. The various trees, flora, terrain and animals you encounter are all rendered using the most basic blocky sprites imaginable. A good way to think of it is if the Atari 2600 had the capability to render a fully 3D world - this is exactly what that would look like. You wouldn't think such simple graphics could adequately portray a setting like this, but it actually works. Just watching how the environment changes from day to night and through seasons, it just looks so cool. Although the visuals and music are extremely simple, when taken together, the combination makes for an extremely relaxing and enjoyable experience. Before I close, I must reiterate one final time that this is not a game. I repeat - THIS IS NOT A GAME. This is one of those fancy pretentious artsy game-type things. If you are not into artsy game experiences, then stay clear. This is not the game for you. However, if you can handle non-traditional experimental games and this seems even remotely interesting, I fully recommend picking it up (definitely if it's on sale, but for full price, I'm not so sure... that's your call). In terms of length, you can see just about everything there is to see in maybe an hour or so. But that's not a negative. Nor is it the whole story. I see this is a game that you can come back to again and again for a slightly different experience, any time you just want to chill out and relax. So it does potentially have replayability, especially with the randomization aspects of the island. All in all, I really enjoyed my time with this and think it's definitely worthy of a look from those with an open mind and spare cash to burn. Check it out.			"

												More than a game, Proteus is an experience, one that would qualify as “semi-interactive”. You start your exploration in the ocean, near an island. Your “task” is to explore that island. There is no game-like goal here, but only a certain location to find, that will make the environment reach its next stage. After several of those transitions, you’ll have “completed” your journey. Clearly, the interest of Proteus doesn’t lie in its mechanisms. The idea is that the path to those specific locations will be paved with wonderful details for you to discover. The journey itself is its own reward.The sense of wonder begins with the sight-seeing. Proteus uses a first-person perspective with graphics that evoke the 8-bit era. Imagine what an Atari 2600 (VCS) game would look like if that system had 3D capabilities, and you will probably have a pretty good idea of what the experience looks like. This is a good concept, with one important caveat (explained below), and one that works very well in the beginning. The retro appeal is immediate!The music/sound design is something special as well. It can best be described as an ambient soundscape, with a fantastic twist: most elements in your field of vision have a distinct impact on the music. This strongly reinforces the otherworldly sensation.So what is there to discover on the island? In short (and to avoid spoilkers): fauna, flora and other landmarks. In the beginning, all of those elements are pleasantly eerie. You’ll probably find several of those brilliant little touches every minute. After 10 to 15 minutes, though, those occasions for wonderment will grow thinner and thinner. And advancing the journey/island to the next stage sadly doesn’t introduce enough significantly different stuff to sustain interest.I did make an important discovery while playing Proteus: It’s possible for a game to give me motion sickness. Now, before you discard that remark as something that does not concern you, let me assure you that I have no particular vulnerability to this ailment. I’ve never felt sick on a boat, I’ve never felt motion sickness in front of a movie or a game before, I can even wear 3D glasses for hours on end without feeling the slightest discomfort. I think I know what makes Proteus different, though. You see, motion sickness happens when your eyes and inner ear send conflicting signals to your brain about your position and movement. In theory, all first-person games could cause it: your eyes would say “Hey, you’re running!” while your inner ear would object: “no way, you’re just sitting on a chair!” Those conflicting messages cause confusion within the part of your brain that manages balance, and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ will exert revenge on your stomach, causing nausea. Some brains being more vengeful than others, people have different levels of tolerance for those conflicting messages.Now, in Proteus, the ground in your field of view is often composed of a big single stretch of plain colour, with no shading or nuance. So that when you are walking, objects like trees appear to move towards you, but the ground does not. Which means that even your eyes are sending conflicting messages by themselves, thereby increasing the potential for motion sickness. Being no MD, I cannot guarantee this is the actual reason, but a quick search on Google should be enough to convince you that at the very least, Proteus causes more cases of motion sickness than most other games.I therefore cannot recommend Proteus. It can make you feel awful for quite some time, and the risk is simply not worth taking: despite its short length (it takes about one hour to reach the ending), the delightful details that reward your exploration are not frequent enough. The developers have said that you don’t get to see everything in the game during a single playthrough, but I’m certainly not masochistic enough to investigate that claim.			"

												*seriously looking at keyboard*  Well, there're actually 2 things you will need to enjoy Proteus:First, a great sense of imagination.Like in the Atari 8-bit era where everything is better defined by your mind, not the graphics. Where some jumping pixels beside you is actually a wild animal that just passed by. Where you're offered a gorgeous view in front of your eyes, but need a open mind to really SEE the view, and not the pixels representing it.In Skyrim, if you can feel the wind while looking at the horizon on top of a mountain, you may know what I mean.(But if you're not able to understand any of this, ""f@#% off back to Gears of War!"")Second, headphones. Without headphones the immersion is really compromised.And that's it! Get yourself in a comfortable chair, a beverage/drink beside you, and take trip to Proteus. It probably won't last too long, but you'll be back if you've done things right.THE ENDFORMAL review: Proteus is a first-person exploration game/experience. Take a look at settings, tweak the mouse sensitivity to your preferences and remember that ""space"" makes you sit and ""F9"" saves the island as a ""postcard"".			"

												It's kind of hard to describe Proteus in words to somebody who has not played it.  Sure, you can explain how it takes place on a randomly generated island where you walk around taking in the sights and sounds. You can tell somebody that all the critters and plants and other elements make their own sounds and tones which contribute to the dynamic musical experience of the game. You can even tell them about how different the island is from season to season, and about all of the little things to find and explore.  But no written description will really cover all of the emotions and experiences you get when you play through Proteus. Proteus is about the joy of beauty and discovery, and simply must be played to be fully experienced.  TL;DR If you like chasing frogs and turkeys this game is for you.			"

												Proteus is a first-person exploration simulator. In it, you play as an individual who comes across an island, free of any other people but with plenty of wildlife. You explore it through both day and night of each of the seasons, enjoying the ambient music, changing weather, and various randomly generated locations on the island. As you explore, some of the wildlife will react to you, and the music/surroundings will change depending on the season, weather, time of day, and what's near.This is a recommendation only based on whether or not that sounds interesting to the player. It's well done, and entertaining for what it is. It is, however, a style of game which likely has limited appeal.			"

												I awoke in gentle waters. In the distance, trees of all the colors of Easter dotted the coast. As I made for shore, I began to hear the song of spring, the humming of trees, the zimming of grass, the zooming of the falling petals and leaves. A playful pair of blue bunnies hopped away, their footsteps taking to ground like my fingers would the keys of a piano. White birds dashed from tree to to tree, with the faintest zips almost synthetic. Through a clearing, a council of feeding chickens scurrying off, my presence disturbing their time of fellowship. My feet found a dirt path, a path home perhaps, or to an adventure I had not yet known. A breeze of familiarity rose up as I neared the summit of green foothills. And there, surrounded by dozens of Sakura trees, a small cabin, the only evidence of human hands among the islands. I made it to the clearing, turned, and watched as hundreds of cherry blossoms fell to its rest, like a rain of pink champaign. In the twilight, I witnessed a blue moon rise, breaching the horizon over the vast, immeasurable sea. The day's song began to fade, to melt into the soft grip of that is night, to change keys and moods within mere moments. I laid under the Sakura trees, and watched the moon reach its dominion, shining with the whole of the galaxy behind it, cheering their young sister on. In the quiet music of the night, as the world completed its change to hues of white, blue, and black, and the horns and percussion that had ruled the day were hushed by the chords and strings of the evening, I closed my eyes; unware that when I woke I would bare witness to entirely different journey of melodies.

												I'll be perfectly honest, when I first played this game I was at a point in my life when I was constantly feeling like♥♥♥♥♥♥ soon enough later I was on anti-depressants, and now and then I get bad, but that's not the point.I turned off my lights, put on my headphones and I was absorbed into an experience, calming vibrations, pleasant visuals, a walking simulator, yes. Proteus calmed me, it allowed me to colapse into a false world where I wandered and watch the seasons change, the wildlife pass and my essence rise above this small wonderful world below.During some of the dark in my life, I occasionally find lights that help me move on and give me small comfort.

												Not for everyone but definitely for me. Retro C64 graphics set in a 3D world to explore. Mix in the interactive ambient soundtrack and this one is a winner for me. An island I will always visit from time to time when in the mood.

												Is it ""unique"" and pretty? yes. Did it provide me any entertainment? No.About all I could say for this is that the visuals and sounds were unique but it never culminated in an atmosphere that drew me in at all. Everything to see is seen within the first of the four seasons the game is broken in to. Some colors change but then you just circle around through the three more waiting for Winter and the end. I didn't feel anything, experience anything, enjoy anything, or anything anything. There's no implied meaning. It feels more like a proof-of-concept than whatever 'art' is to me. Which is what I hear it referred to as. I'm guilty of owning too many Humble Bundles (if 'too many' is actually a 'thing'!) and thankfully this was amongst one of them. Because the asking price of $9.99USD is, to put it mildly, outrageous.One reviewer did mention their small child enjoying the game and making up stories for it and I can definitely say that it would be a very simple interface for a small child (WASD + purposely input lagged mouse). And I believe the visuals and mood of the game would lend itself well to an imaginative small child. But no matter what my heart tells me, I'm 30+, and don't possess that imagination any longer. I was dulled beyond belief after the first five minutes.Avoid.			"

												You really need to play the game with the lowest possible form of any real expectations in order for you to really feel  immersed, at all.Trust me when I say this you do NOT need to go through an entire playthrough to get the jist of the game and it is very dissapointing to say that. Seriously- play it for about 10 minutes and there- that's basically the entire game, you don't need to play anymore of it as it won't give you much more than what it offered  from the very start.The world itself is not as 'interactive' as the game claims its primary aspect was made to be. For the most part you'll be walking around mindlessly, wheather changes depending on the time of day,and location which MIGHT trigger a somewhat interesting world 'event' .There are also very minor aspects of the game such as small animals and whatnot that you can approach which will intiate a reaction and a  unique sound but this quickly becomes repetitive once you notice it's very petty as it makes no real difference within the meat of gameplay. The only one that does anything to your playthrough is a circle of lights that (from what I've learned) makes the world change from night to day or even its seasons without having to naturally wait for it to happen. But that on it's own right it is not that impressive enough for me to feel that this game shoud cost this much. The music is interesting at most but I also can't say it's memorable or something people would actually listen to outside of playing it, it's a constant loop  that grows mind numbing as you notice it's just the same several seconds of sound that never stops until something in the world causes it to change. I'm not sure how could they mess up one of the only elements  that would have made this game redeemable - but- they did for me.While It is decently ambient and soothing but i can't possibly recommend this at the full price of 10 f*cking dollars. Calling this a game is also a bit TOO generous, it's more like a pretentious pixelated walking simulator that is musically inclined.  Unless you're considering of buying this in a sale that makes it worth less than half of it's full price or you REALLY love this sort of thing- skip it and never look back- there are far better games that you can play than this which is barren of any real content.

												Experimental games are great, don't get me wrong, but I would never get 10 bucks worth of enjoyment out of this title. The main problem is that cool-visual-effect aside, there is no novel or gimmicky mechanic to actually making this a 'game'. Some titles like Dear Esther and Gone Home get around this by telling a story, others through interaction. Proteus needs something to drive the player to want to continue the experience beyond finding trippy little sounds or visual.Its cool, but needs more. Watch a LetsPlay and I am sure you will be done after about 10 minutes.			"

												Another reviewer said that you can see all there is to see in this game in only ten minutes. Friend, you could not have been more wrong. My mind boggles to think how much work must have gone into this game, to make the experience so subtle that it takes some time to even realise that you are playing a game. But trust me: you are. The more you explore the Proteus world the more you realise that there's more to this world than pretty graphics and nice music. The world responds to you. Not just to your simple actions, but to the emotions you're feeling in a particular part of the world because of what's going on, what's already happened and even what you already know. It's amazing that no matter what path I choose, the game always has something for me; a new experience that surprises me, even when I think I know what's coming. If you don't like games without tick-box goals then maybe this one isn't for you. But if you're willing to put aside your search for objectives for a few minutes and just explore instead, you may find that you come across them anyway.			"

												Proteus is one of these games which look pretty but doesn't have any goal, some people might refer to it as an 'Art game'. The only thing you can do is explore the island, check out the beautiful surroundings and listen to some nice sounds.So yes the game does look quite nice but that's about it. It doesn't mean I dont get 'art', I just think there should be more to it.At the moment Proteus is 10 euro, which is expensive for a game you probably will only spend 15 minutes in.			"

I dunno, seven copies of Fortix and trust me, it will be better spent money. This thing has no gameplay. You're just walking around the ugliest island you can ever imagine. My aunt looks better than that, and trust me - it's not a compliment. Some of you might say - ""you moron, this game is art!"". No. It's not. It's just empty balloon without anything inside. Oh, and ugly. I don't remember if I mentioned it.If you want to taste something different than shooting, racing and beating, you should try... I don't know, but certainly not Proteus. Oh, play Shelter. It's pretty good game, quite similiar to this one, but way better, mainly because of something mysterious called gameplay, which unfortunately, isn't included in Proteus. Or Walking Dead goddammit. Seriously, anything.I felt ashamed and embarrassed when I had to start this game in order to write this review (I played it waay too much on drm-free version).My note for this is really strong 0.5/10.

I would definitely recommend it to nature lovers, and to people who need a way to just calm down and let their stress fall away. It has no plot, and is very peaceful. It randomly generates an island for you to explore each time you play. This island has a day and night cycle, weather, and seasons that you can change more or less at will -- but I won't spoil how yet. I really reccomend figuring out for yourself. whether  you're looking for a beautiful game, a calming game, or a daily random magical island in a box, I wholeheartedly recommend this game.			"

Your much better off taking any money you plan on spending on this game and just put it toward buying Minecraft if you don't already own that. This is just an island with exploration of pixels that involves only trees and a few bugs/animals and thats it. Sure there's 4 seasons, but that only changes the appearance of the world's textures.

												A memorable, explorable piece of dreamlike atmosphere, Proteus articulates an essence of each of the four seasons with joy, loss and sadness.★★★★☆Immediately defined on the surface with its' soft, comforting colour palette and a distinctively blocky impression of an inhabited island, Proteus quickly captures the attention and brings to life a lush, fertile playground. Trees sway periodically in an autumn breeze. Snow gently falls to the ground as overbearing grey clouds loom overhead. Bunnies hop away to a brief tune as you approach - and soon chase - them. All of this accompanied by an indulgent and evocative soundtrack that perfectly accompanies you on your meandering voyage across this landscape. There's the faint sound of bagpipes, perhaps, as you close in on what appears to be abandoned castle. An almost military-like instrumentation joins you when you find yourself in what seem to be clusters of gravestones, positing the idea that maybe, in a day past, this island now inhabited by wildlife was also home to a human community.What someone will actually get out of Proteus is ultimately down to the player - and whether this is a strength of the experience or to its' detriment, I'm not sure. There will be countless players who either don't care for the idea of a piece like this that all but completely strips back mechanical interference, or who just don't enjoy what Proteus has to offer. However, in the right frame of mind, at the right time of day, in the right mood, Proteus hits a nerve and relaxes it, eases it, and offers an experience unlike much else. One that is almost inherently and necessarily short, but utterly memorable and worth the attention of those seeking a very pure form of escaping to another place and, indeed, other times.			"

												Proteus isn't a game for everyone- or most people honestly. It's one of those things you'll either love or hate, perhaps similar to how people view Animal Crossing. Simply put, you walk around, see the sights and witness how things change through the seasons on a randomly generated island. Really it's about how you see it. There's no ""plot"" or objectives except what you make of it, there are little events and landmarks that you can find however. I'd recommend this game to people who just want to relax or do something calming. Honestly, whenever I play it invokes this sense of wanderlust and strange homesickness I'm not sure how to describe, but I personally keep coming back to now and again.			"

It just happens to be about exploration and atmosphere, and to this extent it succeeds at creating a unique audio-visual landscape worth checking out. Each time you play, the world (an island) is procedurally generated, but I have yet to see much variety in the types of things you get to see. If anything, this is my only complaint, but I look forward to spending more time with this game to discover what else it is hiding.			"

Product received for free
 Proteus  is a procedurally generated walking simulator. There is only one aim to this game and that is to explore the pixelated environments. The soundtrack is also procedurally generated, meaning it changes as you move through your surroundings. Each playthrough is distinct as the terrain and topography is different. This is a very minimalistic game. There is no story or any achievements. I played the game for about 1.5 hours and the following are the positives and negatives of what I experienced. Positives:	- The game has a very relaxing melodic soundtrack which is also procedurally generated. Basically whatever you look at produces a distinct sound and together a tune is made. - The graphics are pixelated and colorful. I personally thought they were pretty but they might not be for everyone.- The weather and seasons change and have smooth transitions. The environment looks really good in the spring season.- There are many small creatures in the game which appear depending on your location or time of day such as owls at night and frogs near water. You can also chase them :D- I did not experience crashes or any bugs. - The game is relaxing and very causal and something someone would like after a stressful day at work. - There is no saving system which adds to it's casual ""in and out"" experience. Negatives: - The game is the most minimalistic game (genere defining almost) I have ever played and tbh there is not much to do. I was immersed in the game for the first 30 minutes, wandering here and there but it got repititive soon.- Having some lore or interactions would make this game so much more interesting but unfortunately there is none.- The pricetag is too high for what it offers. Final thoughts:	 This game is unique and pretty for it's art style but it provides almost no entertainment. Lack of content does not satisfy it`s pricetag and I feel like it should be at half it's current price, if not less. Watch the game's trailer first as it covers most of what you will experience playing this game. I did enjoy my short realxing period it promised. I am sure some people will find it even more interesting and suited to their taste. Therefore I would recommend buying this game when it's on sale or when the price is reduced. 6.5/10  I received this game for review purposes from Steamified.

												To describe my excursion with Proteus and attempt to use it as a cause for you to play or avoid it would be a rather disingenuous waste of time. This is a title that exists outside the spectrum of a traditional critique, and is not something that is easy to recommend or dismiss as the experience will differ vastly for different players.Like a piece of abstract art there will be those that fall in love with it and are able to recall in vivid detail just what they found so amazing, and an equal or greater amount that shrug it off as pretentious and insubstantial. Regardless of which side you fall on, Proteus is almost certain to draw a strong emotional response, from infatuation to downright anger.Dropped onto an otherworldly island, your only objective is to take in your surroundings through four seasons. The primitive graphics and bizarre soundscapes are in no way ideal for first impressions, but ultimately are integral pieces of the game that wouldn't be at all the same without them, that if you allow them can be surprisingly engrossing. The developers clearly had a vision how Proteus looks and sounds, and there's no doubt in my mind they managed to achieve it.If I was to level a complaint at Proteus, it's that in the end it wound up feeling like something that belonged in a gallery, not in my steam library. I want others to experience what I did, but also expect most would feel cheated to have paid what it currently costs, or even anything at all. Thus is the case with most things that aspire to be considered art, which for better and for worse, is the only way to describe Proteus, a love it or hate it affair if ever I saw one. I'm sure this hasn't helped in the slightest for you to decide if this is worth your time or money, but no matter how many words I type I couldn't tell you. If you have access to a copy then I wouldn't hesitate to tell you to play it, but otherwise I'm afraid it is a risk you have to take for yourself.			"

												I love Proteus. I love it so much I'm thinking of buying it a third time for the Vita. When I walk in the country I am not following an explicit objective, I'm not out there to ""achieve"" anything, I’m simply there for the experience. I want to take it all in, let it wash over me with no distractions. I am there to absorb the sights, the sounds, the smells, the feel and the atmosphere of the places I discover. That is the point. Proteus is a video game that facilitates this kind of experience but ever so slightly exaggerates it. Colours are more vivid, sounds are more musical and the lovely pixel art allows your imagination to fill in the gaps.If you're the sort of person who loves to explore the outdoors in your own time, on your own terms, then I expect you will enjoy this game just as I do - especially if you're finding you have less and less time for the real thing these days.

												1. This is a completely awesome tech demo but they seemed to have forgotten to make any sort of finished game out of it.2. Yes, I get that this is supposed to push the notions of what a game is and I support that. I've been supporting this same notion of pushing what a game can be over and over for some time now and frankly walking sims just aren't pushing anything these days.3. As per 1, this is built in a charming and effective pixely landscape and the way the music changes based on where you are and what you are doing is frankly breathtaking at times. 4. Also as per 1, some things are wonky and broken in the wild. I couldn't get this to run properly on my 4K monitor for example. 5. What you do in this game is walk around until it is time to stop walking around.6. I suppose the artistic purpose of this was to explore our relationship to the passage of time or to come to terms w/ the inevitability of death.7. *yawn*8. This strikes me as something that might be good to play while deeply involved in certain expanded states of consciousness. By that I mean you should play this after meditating. 9. I didn't really mean that.10. The breaking point where I decided to not recommend this is when I closed the game when I needed to do something and when I came back, it made me start all over again. There was no warning of this given.11. I was extremely annoyed by number 10 but it did make me realize and appreciate this world is procedurally generated.12. Procedurally  generated game worlds are cool. Too bad I didn't get to play a game set in this one. 13. The one thing that makes me want to change my vote on this to recommended is my wife, who does not think too much about video games, actually sat down a minute and watched me play this one. It is quite a striking little world and very lovely for what it is. This would be quite effective as an exhibit in a museum where a person would only spend a few minutes w/ it but on the couch or at your desk at home is just not the right setting for it.			"

												I tried to like this.   And now I just feel sorry for anyone who paid full price.  I did enjoy the sound.  The ambient music is quite nice and I enjoyed the music that came from getting close to certain objects and animals.  I am mixed on the aesthetics of this game.   I feel that the graphics may just be a bit too simple to provide the best amount of charm.   If I have to say ""wtf am I even looking at"" at some point, then it isnt ideal.The controls are not great.  I feel like a snail trying to move across the island.The island is tiny.  Not only that, but there is barely anything at all to see on it.  Even taking into account all the seasons.  There is also no way at all to directly interact with anything.  I really like the idea of this game.  I often love to just wander about exploring in games, even if I am not supposed to.  This feels like a demo... except this game isnt suddenly going to multiply several times in size.   I want to explore, I want to see amazing and fascinating things, I want to be able to just relax and get lost in some world... But thats not happening here.			"

												--- PROTEUS ---- This is less of a game and more of an experience. Possible SpoilersPROS- There are no objectives. - You wander aimlessly though a forever generating world- There's a nice feature in which you can save memories and transport yourself back to a certain location- Enough mystery and intrigue within the design of the world was enough for me to just walk around for about 35ish minutes, the game generates its own landmarks which helps with this- It looks great, its very clourful without being disorientating and the semi-pixelised art style is a nice touch- Like the world, the games soundtrack builds up as you walk around, It provides a nice ambient feel and compliments the sense of mindlessly walking around discovering different landmarks and localesCONS- For the experience the price tag is hefty, if you can buy it for $5 or less than i'd say its worth an interesting 30min - 1 hour- Since its a procedurally generated world and ,atleast in my experience, can potentually be rather buggy. In other words you can be walking around walking on the ocean for a while before you see anything- Once you've visited a few different worlds the game feels empty afterwards as there is nothing really to do, it'd be interesting if there was some form of journal that you could keep, this could help in providing your own stories for the different places within the worldOVERALL = 7/10 "

												Proteus is ugly, and beautiful; empty, and full; depressing, and joyful.Proteus is a game about discovery. After waking up to find yourself in (shallow?) waters, you wade toward an island and discover. The procedurally generated world hosts animals, landmarks, and oddities for you to find -- perhaps not all during your first playthrough -- and the music is shaped by your path and location. In other words, each time you visit Proteus, it truly is a new experience.This game isn't for everyone. It's an extremely slow boil, and there are no objective markers, quest givers, or prompts popping up all over the place. Dialogue and terminals aren't drowning you in exposition. There is a narrative, but it's slight and so completely shrouded in mystery, that the actual point could simply be a projection of the player. There are things to do, but the question is: Are they important? Are they part of the island's mystery? Are they merely moments allowing you to catch your breath before seeking your true purpose, or are they diversions keeping you from your end goal?This isn't meant as an insult, but rather a caution: If your entire Steam library consists of shooters and survival horror titles (likely containing zombies), you will likely hate Proteus. If your Steam library contains thoughtful adventure games, puzzlers, and ambient experiences, give Proteus a spin. It's been priced as low as $1.99 so even if it's not really your thing, you'll probably get your money's worth.I know I certainly did.			"

			Views: 956		

			Unfortunately this gave me absolutely appalling motion sickness. Realitybytes16 joins the 'Wanting Jenny to Suffer As Much As Possible Club'. You paid, I also paid. If you like it, like it!		

It's a kind of 8-bit walking simulator which, alas, gave me a terrible headache. For people who do not suffer with migraines, you may enjoy some time wandering around the landscape while the seasons change, the trees shed their leaves, meteors fly past, blobs make noises at you and quite an annoying soundtrack gets randomly generated.On the other hand, you may get really annoyed with it and wonder why you bothered, wishing desperately for an actual game. Until you try, you probably won't know.			"

While the game's description might sound interesting at first it did not meet my expectations with the music only slightly changing after passing certain points on the island.

												It took me a bit of thinking to decide how to review Proteus as it's clearly not following the conceptual template of game design where the player's efforts to fulfill a particular objective would be rewarded, nor is it a simulator. Instead, Proteus should be considered no more than a toy to kill time with. With its daring graphics and dynamic way of handling sounds and music, Proteus succeeds in constructing a mysterious setting which is empowered by the random events that may occur on your playthrough. Having that said, the player needs to be willing to explore the island, else there is little chance that these emphasized phenomena of Proteus will ever be discovered. And that's what makes this game a gamble for the price it's sold for while this was written, there doesn't seem to be a lot of variety as far as content is concerned whereas the lack of objectives will definitely put off potential players.Skipping through the four stages will make this game last about an hour (on default settings), though the intention of the developer is that you explore the island and decide for yourself what the meaning of this game is. Its purpose is clear however, Proteus is a colorful toy. My verdict will be open this time as I really can't decide whether this is your cup of tea or not, instead, the only sensible thing I can say about Proteus is that it requires you to be open minded and curious by nature.

												Proteus is not for everyone. That said, for me it was well worth the small amount of time I put into it and the $5 I spent on it. (I got it on sale.) Proteus does not tell a story. It does not have any characters. It doesn't have combat or puzzles or anything skill based like that. Proteus is a game about exploration and the beauty of nature. It is made entirely of pixel art, but manages to be well balanced visually. It doesn't have a set soundtrack or music in the traditional sense, but the sound design is superb. The time I spent playing it was relaxing, refreshing, even meditative. If this sounds like something you'd enjoy, I would highly recommend this game. If this sounds boring or pretentious, you might want to try another game.			"

With some good old fashioned, hypnotic flashing lights & textbook mind control! It would cause players to suffer vivid nightmares and in some cases, suicidal tendencies.Just another classic hit on the psychological operartions playlist.Proteus is the bi polar opposite.This other world is not a reality melting horrorshow,that leaves you trembling in the fetal position.insteadIt finds you tending to subliminal submission. It is has oodles of eternal zen, reflective moments and quiet contemplation.Rocks open portals to other realms, nature speaks with you as you dance with its inhabitants.You are the conduit that holds this world in a state of animated bliss.5 hours into Proteus and it still feels full of secrets.Open your mind and give your brain a spa day.All that CSGO is a great mental workout but its time for yoga.

It's a charming little walking simulator, where much of what you interact with creates a musical and meditative experience. Fun for a little while, and relaxing, but not worth the price of admission.This would make an excellent framework for a full fledged game though. Too bad there isn't much else to be had here other than a little exploration.			"

			Views: 618		

			Proteus: Quick Look Proteus is some thing you might call a walking simulator, but the game knows what it is and does it's best job at keeping it enjoyable. Might not be for every one...		

Proteus is about pretty colors, pretty sounds, and walking. A lot of walking. There's really not a whole lot of mechanics to speak out side of exploring a randomly generated world. As you explore, you can bump into random events and objects that through your ""interactions"" the music and sounds will change in response. The mechanic of the game is simply walking and exploring.I think it would be pretty fair to say it's not a game for every one. For those who's used to mi-maxing, meta-gaming, or twitching through their games, you probably won't find Proteus all that appealing. But for those who like their games a little bit more light hearted, simpler, and rather relax when they game, Proteus might be an interesting choice.The randomly generated worlds are quite pleasing on the eye with a fantastic art design behind it. It does 2.5D graphics expertly. The color pallet is very relaxing and appealing, and it even has dynamic weather effects. The sound and music are also equally praise worthy.For those who don't mind minimal mechanics but really enjoy the exploration aspect of gaming, then I am please to let you know, Proteus does a great job and mixing the world up with each play through, almost always showing some new random thingy or McBobber to find in the world, and for the explorers out there, that might be enough to satisfy your gaming needs.Overall Proteus shows an interesting concept and pushes the idea of ""Non-game"" games. It won't be for every one, but for those who might be interested in these sorts of games, Proteus is one of the best out there.Pros:- Gorgeous randomly generated worlds- Great art style- Great audio- Very relaxingCons:- Minimal mechanics- Not for  every one- Can not save current world you're exploring (new world every time you play)			"

												'Do you recommend this game?' is actually quite a hard question with regard to Proteus. I would not recommend Proteus to most people. But I would recommend my experience of Proteus. If I could be sure that someone else would feel the same wonder at wandering around a colourful, pixelated island, chasing critters and getting caught up in some kind of sprite island-changing dance party, then I would recommend Proteus to them. But I can't really be sure of that.I also can't really be sure of how they'll feel about the cost. I have only spent a little over half-an-hour with Proteus myself and haven't felt the urge to go back. (Not that I won't.) But for some, understandably, that's not enough for their money. (I got it in a bundle.)This is one of those situations where an inbetween would be great. But as we don't have one, I'm not sure I can recommend Proteus to others. :/			"

												The closest thing to an acid trip you are going to experience without a drug, but in a fantastically beautiful and minimalisticly artistic way.  You will wander around an island created in a pixilated simplistic graphical style and listen to odd and exhilarating music and sounds.   At first I thought what the F*@K is this thing and thank goodness I picked this up on sale for next to nothing.  But then a funny thing happened, as I began to explore the island and interact with its wildlife and landscape I became swept away in it.  After I explored enough I was able to find the whirlwind vortex to advance the island to the next season, and the next and then the last.  What an unusually odd but worthwhile way to spend an hour.  Not a game per say, definitely more of an experience, but if you like art (especially paintings), nature, the seasons and exploration do yourself a favor and experience what Proteus has to offer.

Look I get it, this isn't an objective based game, it's not for everyone, bla bla bla. This game costs $10 regularly, and while a lot of people may argue it's worth that, (such as one reviewer with over 27 hours of gameplay) this is just not worth it to me. Honestly, you could enjoy Gone Home and Dear Esther and still find this game to be boring repetitive slog to get through. The soundtrack is honestly nothing special. Yes the music does change slightly based on  where you are, what season it is, and what you are looking at, but it really never changes that much. This is not a game, it's a well-done art project. But it should be a free download. Just saying.			"

												Highly sensory and emotional; Proteus is essentially the love child of ASMR and BBC's Planet Earth. High-saturation, dreamlight colors and audio similar to Austin Wintory's flOw and Journey soundtracks. This is as aesthetic and atmospheric as indie games get, almost like reliving your first road trip as a child. Absolutely stunning.			"

												I keep coming back to Proteus in my mind. It's just that good.I haven't actually replayed the game since my first time playing. I intend to do so at some point, but it was an experience quite unlike any other, and I would rather not spoil it by letting myself experience it too often.Yes, all you can do in the game is walk around. No, that is by no means boring (though you may need to be in the right mood for the game to ""click"" for you). For one, there is more to it than just blindly walking around without a goal. There actually is a progression system in the game, and a big part of what I enjoyed here was discovering that by what felt like accident and being surprised by it. It's not challenging, but it fuels the game's exploration and gives it a purpose beyond curiosity. Which is great.Secondly, the game is a work of art. Now, art is subjective, and you may prefer realism over the abstraction Proteus offers. Fair enough. Just don't judge the game by screenshots alone. Give it a shot, and play it. Let the gorgeous, ever-changing colour palettes pull you in, let the reactive soundtrack (walking past certain objects or characters will yield various sounds) become it's own distinct melody.But what Proteus succeeded at most for me personally, and why I keep coming back to it in my mind is this: It is a game that loves nature, and it's love for it is infectious. It appreciates the seasons and the changes they bring. It knows the power of a beautiful sunset and the serenity of a summer night's soundscape. It understands the dread and beauty of autumn leaves signifying the passing of time. It's familiar with the romance of a melancholic winter's eve. It manages to capture the essence of both nature's biggest hits and the underappreciated details and distills them into this simplistic, impressionist pixel painting. The fact it goes for abstraction rather than realism is part of it's power, I think. It lets you fill in the gaps, pull from your own pool of memories; supports reminiscence. It lodges itself in your mind and after having played it; it will make you recall it, remember it's sounds and the feelings it brought up when you encounter that which it portrays in real life. And then, you will learn to love the game even more than you might have loved it when you played it.Proteus is an amazing achievement, and I cannot recommend it enough.			"

												An incredble experience, and one that should definitely be experienced at least once.  While the game has a desired goal for the player, Proteus is a great source of inspiration that the player can receive from seeing the different arrangements of scenery, animals, music, and lighting.A single experience can be hard to put into words, and should be interpreted by each player differently.

												proteus is a completely unique experience, and i mean that in a good way. absolutely gorgeous visuals, beautiful atmospheric sound and generative music, and an awe-inspiring sense of wonder and amazement. i'm sure the phrase ""it's not for everyone"" has been used in a million reviews of this game already, but it's true. if you enjoy games with a slow pace and relaxing ambience, and you take joy in exploration, maybe wait for proteus to go on sale and give it a try (because i will agree $10 is a bit much).i've seen some people here complain that there isn't much replay value, but i disagree; i'd say that proteus' random generation aspect adds plenty of replay value. sure it's not something you'd immediately want to replay over and over, but maybe every few months or so. you'll always find new things and new surprises. the goals may be the same every time, yes, but the goals aren't exactly the point here. the point is simply that you explore and enjoy doing so. find new things, appreciate the scenery, and have fun. i think this is where a lot of people get confused about proteus, and interpret it as being some kind of pointless pretentious art statement, but it's hard to be ""pretentious"" when there's no message being put across. proteus isn't made to tell you anything, force ideas into your head, or make any kind of statement. it's just here for your casual enjoyment, whenever you want some peaceful time alone. why get angry over that?

												Beautiful game because of what seems like a fundamental understanding of place. The contrasting colors that shift from day to night and season to season, the music that is generated according to your proximity and orientation to other objects in the environment, and the secret, mirage-like creatures that somehow manage to peak the curiosity of a person playing video games in the 21st Century all make this a substantial game worth playing then, importantly, playing again. What drew me to it in the first place, though, was a suggestion that the procedurally generated environments themselves were better than Minecraft, a claim that speaks for itself.I recommend you play until you get to the Summer season, at least.Also, there's a physical boxed version of the game available as of 2016-07-28 at Twisted Tree Games though it's limited so that link may be gone before I remove this note.

I'd praise the algorithmic music, the clever procedurally generated level design that none-the-less guided the player to the ending. I'd laud the game's devotion to the goal of exploration, and invoking a mood of wonder, while respecting the player's time and ending when thematically appropriate.I think this is a love-it or hate-it game.

												I really wanted to like this ""game"" but I just can't recommend it. I don't mind a good walking simulator--I thoroughly enjoyed Kairo, but unlike that game, there is not even a hint of a story here, nor are there puzzles to solve. I think I see what the developers were trying to do here and I would consider this as ""video games as art"", but there just isn't enough content to justify me spending time with it. I thought maybe I was missing something, but after reading a few Steam guides, it appears that I have pretty much seen everything that this game has to offer in just over an hour. I think if I had spent $9.99 on this, I would be pretty cheesed off. I am glad I got this on sale and only spent a third of that on this game, but I still feel like I overpaid.UPDATED: I just wanted to say that the only reason why my game time is up over 2 hours now is because my 7-year-old was interested in the game for a little while and wanted to try it out. Even he lost interest with it after not too long. Notice that many of the Steam users who gave this game a good review have less than an hour of gameplay. There just isn't really much content here.

												Christ, and I thought Dear Esther was bad. The game features no objectives but instead wants the player to immerse themself in an incredibly boring walking simulator. While ""walking simulator"" could be used as an insult towards titles such as Dear Esther, Gone Home, and Doctor Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, it literally is what the game wants to be.

It's ten dollars to walk on an island created by somebody who pointed at Minecraft and an Atari 2600 and decided they wanted to play god and create some unholy combination of the two. To summarize my point, never, ever buy this filth, but if you scored it from a humble bundle, go nuts and stumble aimlessly for all of 5 minutes before you realize you'd get the same experience taking a walk around your neighborhood, with the objective being exercise.

												I'd go so far as to say that Proteus isn't inherently bad, it's just not very interesting. You awaken as, presumably, a fat hobbit on an island filled with dancing mushrooms, birds and other cheerful and/or plesantly soothing decorations. While the environment is pretty in that retro-chic way, there's simply nothing to do in between vistas aside from wait for the time of day to change. In fact: the game would benefit from some sort of time-lapse button, so you could see what an area looked like during the day or night.I never felt the music really complimented what I was seeing, even though it was freeform and supposedly a shifting entity reacting to where I was. I felt that I would have been a better disc jockey for the occasion of chasing bunnies through a green and pink forest, which is sad, as I felt like there wasn't enough effort pushed forth to the one interesting aspect of this hobbit simulator. Most of the time it sounded like a bunch of chiptunes played at random, shifting as it pleased. It was much like having a personal off-key chiptune musician serenading me with their hands smashing against a synthesizer. Honestly, I would watch a video that doesn't have commentary instead for the same effect. It’s a very passive experience to start with, so watching someone else play is just as good. "

												Proteus, while not really a game, definitely comes close to being one.Placing you in a randomly generated world, you walk around exploring an island as the seasons change. The design of the island and the art style, and what I presume to be dynamic sounds, go far in giving the game a very calm and relaxing atmosphere. Things seem very upbeat and alive in summer, with lots of wildlife that reacts to your movements dynamically, and when winter comes around things start to feel extremely bleak and lonely. Despite the fact that everything is pixelated, it is still very immersive.Controlled with either a gamepad or the keyboard (mouse optional), the game plays very well with the sole exception of you not being able to jump.I wouldn't bother buying this game if you want a story or some aim, but if you want to spend an small while just exploring a randomly generated artistic representation of an island you should buy it.

												It's pretty clear within a few minutes of playing that there isn't much to do in Proteus, and yet I keep returning to it. Essentially you wander around a procedurally generated island, one that's full of life, colour and sound. It's a captivating sight, and you float around in a detached manner drinking it all in. You'll slowly discover that each creature, each plant has its own unique behaviour and sound, and it's quite rewarding finding some of the rarer critters and watching how their behavior changes from day to night. Eventually you'll discover that the island can change in other ways, and this is perhaps the only time that the game takes on board any kind of objective. It's enough to keep bringing you back to the strange world of Proteus, even though you might not be quite sure how and why you got there. A lot of people seem overly concerned with whether Proteus is a game. To be honest, if that kind of thing is likely to matter to you, then give this a miss. Otherwise, I'd recommend experiencing this strange place, maybe you'll find yourself sitting contentedly on an imaginary beach watching an alien sunset.			"

												Odd. Very confusing and odd. This game is basically a walking simulator that adapts to the ways that you interact with nature in form of music. The goal of the game is to walk until a surprise ending. I cannot see myself playing this game for more than 15 minutes and not getting bored with it. Honestly, it is not worth 10 dollars for there are a lot better options on the steam store. If a sale for the game ever comes around and its available for about $3 then it might be worth a shot. The optimization is frankly outrages. Verdict: 46/100 - Boring, unexplained plot but has nice artistical features.			"

												Feels like playing the first alpha of Minecraft with all except one biome removed, but you can't actually do anything in the world, just look and listen. Feels more like a cash grab than an experience. I think you could do amazing things with a simple concept like this, but this game unfortunately offers nothing substantial. Looked up playthroughs and indeed I wasn't missing anything. You'd have to pay me to play this game again. 2/10, the +1 because it wasn't particularly painful to play, just boring.			"

												Thank you both Ed and David... this thing, Proteus, was an incredible experience for me.It brought back many memories of being in the natural world, out of doors... times with friends, times alone, times of extreme joy and pleasure in simply exploring, with no objective other than that which sheer whimsy can conjure.This is how I felt many times.  I didn't realize there was a ""sit"" option at the time, but I stood, anyway, so many times.  And found myself going, chasing the wildlife.  Sometimes leading me places.  Sometimes leading me haunting places.  Sometimes it seems this world revolves solely around you.  Then I thought of the tombstones, littered everywhere.I love the owl. And the bats made me shriek in happiness.  (White nose syndrome, you know?)This is a game that makes me want to go outside.  It makes me want nothing other than a one-on-one connection with the natural world.  I've had the pleasure of that before, and it makes me appreciate my memories and the people I share them with.I can think of other things I didn't see.  And who knows?  Maybe they are on some island I just haven't been to yet.  But really, it doesn't matter.  All of the things I can think of are out there in the natural world already.  Maybe I've just been waiting to see them.			"

												Normally I am really open to new ideas of games and indie games in particular. But there is absolutely no point in this game. Nothing happens. The graphics and the sounds - which try to be the asset of the game - is neither artistic, creative nor in the slightest way interesting. It is just boring... let me repeat it: boring... I paid 3 euros. I should have bought myself an ice cream a beer or gifting a game to someone in my friendslist (what I actually never do). It would have made me happy, happier and hindering me from wasting my time even writing about this game... or, maybe this was the whole point of this game... annoying me, hunting me, convincing me that I write a negative review about it. Yeah, I am sure, this has been the reason... d'ohh... they got me.			"

												Mówiąc wprost: to nie jest klasyczna „gra“. Nie ma tutaj porażek, osiągnięć ani fajnej historii do opowiedzenia. Więc jeśli szukasz „gry“, Proteus może cię nie zadowolić. Warto jednak spróbować. Jako wirtualny bohater obserwujesz zmiany pór roku na bezludnej wyspie (wyłączając zwierzęta). To co widzisz i rozumiesz zależy wyłącznie od ciebie i twojego stanu umysłu - może to być po prostu fajna podróż albo podróż pełna ekscytujących widoków i rzeczy.  Gra jest całkiem ładna, oczywiście na swój sposób, gdyż do gier wręcz fotorealistycznych nie ma nawet startu. To takie połączenie Minecrafta z Dear Esther. Świetną atmosferę dodaje również ścieżka dźwiękowa gry, jest świetnie skomponowana i relaksująca. Cały świat wydaje się żywy - zwierzęta, rośliny, rozmaite miejsca, które wydają różne dźwięki.Podsumowując: jest to gra dosyć wyimaginowana, ale na swój sposób śliczna i relaksująca. Do gatunku nic nie wnosi, ale warto jej dać szansę.			"

												A day later, I'm still not sure how I feel about Proteus. I guess I thought it was great for a while, and then not so great for the rest, but I'll get to that. Like Dear Esther, it involves exploring an island, but rather than using the island to tell a story about something else, exploring the island in Proteus is for the sake of the place itself. As you wander, you can potentially encounter a variety of things at different times and places, some straightforward, some surreal, and seeing what you can find is the experience.The visual style is very simple, with it clear what everything is supposed to be, but leaving you to fill in the details yourself. The sound is more noteworthy, with different layers of the music entering and leaving as you approach different areas or climb a mountain, and creatures or objects you interact with or pass by plinking or blipping their own bits that contribute to it.I suppose my main problem ended up being that while it was wonderful strolling around aimlessly and seeing what I could find for the first half of the time I spent with it, I didn't agree with some of the ways it changed as it moved toward the end. I'll be a bit vague to avoid being spoilery, but while the changes to the world did fit with the theme, I didn't like the way the visual changes made it harder to navigate, and it was much harder to find anything interesting going on as a result, which made the world feel less alive toward the end. A+ for the idea overall and the first half, but a B- for the execution of the latter half.			"

												As a $3 tech demo on procedural generation, the game is fine. I wouldn't pay more for it though. Personally, I think I'd actually prefer it more if it was just a ""on-wheels"" style visual narrative that took me to all the different places (and therefore, different musical sounds) on the island, instead of forcing me to hunt for new areas with new music. If the game is supposed to be relaxing, let me relax.Then, if I find a place I particularlly like, I can 'cancel' the on-wheels movement, sit and enjoy, or explore on my own, then when I'm ready to move on, I press another button and I'm on-wheels again.As it currently stands, I wandered under a lot of trees gently wafting pixel-pollen onto me, and saw a couple owls and other birds(?) running around but nothing unique. If there is more interesting and exciting variation to the island (and therefore, the music) I beseech the developers to guide me around and show me and just let me watch for awhile!			"

												I figured I would play this for five minutes and then uninstall it.  I still felt this way after playing for a few minutes, finding the procedurally generated landscape and environmentally-based music moderately pleasing but ultimately disinteresting.Then I read that there is more to the game, and indeed you can ""win"" the game, and was a little more intrigued.  By about ten minutes later, I was staring with rapt attention and more than once had chills from the intensity of the experience.  Against all odds.Thus I think everyone should experience this.  If it is still not doing anything for you after the first season change, then you are likely free to go, but I challenge anyone to make it to winter without being struck by the utterly bleak and frankly unsettling transformation the game presents to your already-beloved little stupid pixel island.

												I don't usually write reccomendations...well, actually, I've never written one up till now. But, this one got my fingers moving because honestly, I've never until now encountered a game that's so simple, yet so...cerebral. It doesn't have a plot, no definite goal, no dialogue or enemies to fight. And really, it doesn't need any of these things, the reward comes from your own exploration, and the things you discover as you do. Proteus is, I'd say, one of the greatest example of games as art, because it doesn't need plot, dialogue or characters to evoke emotion, thought or introspection. It's simply the journey, and what you discover on it, that leaves you pondering over what you experienced in the end, and wanting more.			"

If there is more interesting and exciting variation to the island (and therefore, the music) I beseech the developers to guide me around and show me and just let me watch for awhile!			"

												This, fellow gamers, is a fantastic game to play after a long, stressful day.  Although you will most likely finish the game within an hour, I (almost) guarantee that doing so will prove to be relaxing.  The visuals are pleasing to the eye, as are the sounds to the ear.  If you consider yourself to be a fan of both indie and casual games, then you (most likely) can't go wrong with this title.  Due to the game's short length, however, you might want to consider waiting for a sale.  However, don't let what I've said keep you from purchasing and playing this masterpiece.  Some of you--undoubtedly--have a lot more money to spend on games than I do.			"

												proteus is a relaxing, outstandingly beautiful, and a curious indie game. i believe the story is on a wolf (of course due to it's first person view) who had been knocked out at sea as he was washed away by a wave. he soon arrives at an island in the middle of nowhere. as the wolf (which i will call Jasco) travels around he finds something interesting like the frogs and birds, along with the sparkling white rabbit in the night. he meets an owl who has told him about the strange starlike wisps that come down at night. soon, Jasco notices a few wisps drawing him near a clearing full of swirling wisps. Jasco soon notices that as he draws closer, the seasons change. do this four times and head to the ocean and it seems the wind carries him into the clouds and he also noticed a starlike wolf and now he is forever with the starlike wolf. 10 out of 10 X3			"

												I went into this game not really expecting much. It has been sitting in my library for a while, unplayed from a Humble Bundle. Before playing this game I had a severe case of the steam library blues, where each item I looked at seemed unappealing. Knowing that this game was short (less than an hour) I hit play...1 minute in - ""Is that green blob a frog???""5 minutes in - ""What am I doing? Yea everything is beautiful, but this isn't helping my boredom...""10 minutes in - I smiledThe rest of the game was spent wandering around searching for more smiles.I came away from this game feeling refreshed and happy. For that, 10/10. Pick it up if you need something a little different. "

												I don't usually write reccomendations...well, actually, I've never written one up till now. But, this one got my fingers moving because honestly, I've never until now encountered a game that's so simple, yet so...cerebral. It doesn't have a plot, no definite goal, no dialogue or enemies to fight. And really, it doesn't need any of these things, the reward comes from your own exploration, and the things you discover as you do. Proteus is, I'd say, one of the greatest example of games as art, because it doesn't need plot, dialogue or characters to evoke emotion, thought or introspection. It's simply the journey, and what you discover on it, that leaves you pondering over what you experienced in the end, and wanting more.			"

												I figured I would play this for five minutes and then uninstall it.  I still felt this way after playing for a few minutes, finding the procedurally generated landscape and environmentally-based music moderately pleasing but ultimately disinteresting.Then I read that there is more to the game, and indeed you can ""win"" the game, and was a little more intrigued.  By about ten minutes later, I was staring with rapt attention and more than once had chills from the intensity of the experience.  Against all odds.Thus I think everyone should experience this.  If it is still not doing anything for you after the first season change, then you are likely free to go, but I challenge anyone to make it to winter without being struck by the utterly bleak and frankly unsettling transformation the game presents to your already-beloved little stupid pixel island.

												Proteus has consistently created meaningful and deceptively unique journeys for me. This is rare for a repeatable activity, since I am part of a fickle species with fickle minds where the nice things get less nice each time it's revisited.Aided by the procedurally generated visual and aural elements, each time I wake up on the island I am treated to something new across the four seasons. On a whim, usually during stressful times such as winter's months, I'll launch Proteus with a skeletal memory of what I saw last - honestly, it is dream-like in that it just feels so personally true and authentic moment-to-moment until the very end, on an inverted awakening, you don't feel ready to climb out of sleep just yet, until you are, until you aren't, until you see the (spoilers) aurora during your ascent. Its affinity for synthesizing such majestic, natural sights with paradoxically quiet melodrama hits me hard. There are some genuinely frightening set-pieces/events/moments, too, to mirror the genuinely heartwarming set-pieces/events/moments. Throughout it all, it takes me to another place for a set of time and helps with the sometimes-stress of life.There are some bonuses. It runs well, has a fantastic options menu, and has a ""postcard"" system that allows you to snapshot moments you want to and are able to revisit. Perfect.			"

												Having played this game extensely I have to say Proteus has no equal in the sphere of gaming.  To those who think ""it's not a game"", I say try playing it.  Unlike many things that look like games Proteus requires interaction to truly enjoy.  There's no mindless button-clicking, no ""+20 POINTS"" pop-up when you experience something fantastic, no sidequest dialogue when you decide to chase a frog.  The minimalist interface is intensely immersive, and yet your choices in how you play are still integral to the whole experience.For anyone who has ever explored the vales of Skyrim for the pure fun of it, or driven off the track of a racing game just to see what's behind the barrier, this is the game for you.

												It's a mix between a beautiful dream and an experimental ambient electronica piece. If you prefer explosions and platforming, skip Proteus, but if you want to explore a procedurally-generated world and discover its secrets, this is well worth it.It has a magic feeling to it. The graphics look very low-fi in the stills, but when the game is in action, the illusion is so complete, it all works. While people who don't give Proteus a chance and play it through at least once say otherwise, the game DOES have a beginning and end, and completing it once unlocks a few extra options (including allowing the terrain generator to get a bit crazier).The save system is very clever. If you want to save a particular random seed because you like the island you're on, hit F9 to save a postcard. This postcard is a screenshot of basically your perspective at that moment, but it's more than that. The game visually encodes data into the image, and the image acts as a save state: Not only will you return to that island, you'll return to that moment.If you can handle going 30 minutes in a game without blowing something up or killing a terrorist, you should take a long moment to consider Proteus.

												The most relaxing game you'll ever play.Proteus is about exploration and enjoyment. There's no confinement. No clear goal. No enemies. No health system. No fighting. But there's plenty of walking to do and enjoyment to be had from encountering new terrain.There's no given idea to how long the game could last. I could have taken some adderall and walked around for a few hours because I'd like to think I have nothing better to do. But I have other video games I wanted to play, so I only gave this game what I thought was a fair amount of time when I realized that there's nothing else to do in Proteus.That doesn't make it a bad game of course. Just an odd with no clear intention of fooking with you. But I feel like I was fooked with, because I don't even remember buying this game, but I don't regret playing it for the short time I played it.I chased a pixelated squirrel for ten minutes.8/10			"

												Eerie, Beautiful, Reflective and Minimalistic are the words that mainly come to my mind when playing Proteus. Yes it's one of ""those"" games that is more about immersion and an experience rather than a cohesive goal to reach or any kind of interaction, in the classic video game sense of course. All you do is walk around a randomly generated island in the middle of the ocean and look around with the mouse. That's it as far as keys go. Even though the walking speed is a little on the slow side, I've come to like it as a part of the experience which wants you to take it all in slowly and enjoy the smaller details. Like that time I was following a jumping frog that made musical notes with each leap and lead me to a mountain peak above the raining clouds that had this most beautiful sunset scene. I ended up taking my hands off the controls and simply watching the sunset unfold and listen to the glacial and minimal soundtrack produced by the environment. This is probably what Zen feels like. Everything is connected. Everything is a wonder in itself.There's something immensely relaxing and reflective about Proteus and if you find this little gem on sale you should definitely grab and experience it. Hell I've bought this before full price and I'm still happy I got it again on Steam. One advice though, DEFINITELY play this game with HEADPHONES or you're missing out on 90% of what makes this game truly special.			"

												After only 33mins of, ""gameplay"", I already know I'll probably never uninstall Proteus. I get similar feelings from playing Proteus as I did from Sword and Sworcery, where the developer has really taken time to look at how sight and sound interract. You're given an environment that demands you take time to watch and listen, and then combines that with a visual style that encourages you to provide the details with your minds eye. A lot of people would say, ""That's just lazy, I want it all finished and polished so I don't have to think.""  But that's the exact opposite of what Proteus is about. The game constantly prods your atrophied brain to fill in the blanks, and unashamedly encourages you to sit still and do nothing. Then, if you can force yourself to do that and you find something magical, you can relive it over and over again if you like.I have never come across anything like it, and I am now in love. Probably more suited to those interested in the unique side of indie games, and people who like to be touched on the emotions.			"

												When Proteus first came out, there was a lot of controversy over whether or not it counts as a game. Because if you don't think about it, there's nothing to do, no overarching story, no buttons to press, just one decently sized possibly alien island.I absolutely believe this counts as a game. More specifically, a child's game. This is how wee babes see the world: as something weird and beautiful that NEEDS to be explored. In Proteus, your entire goal is to do whatever. You interact with the world as a child does: by running at things and seeing what they do. This game will be a million times better once Oculus is made usable, and a million times more if we ever get haptic gloves out of them. The idea is total immersion into a brand new environment and learning how it exists. So no, it's not a classical game, but that is in no way a problem.			"

												What a trip - granted it only takes about 30 minutes to ""finish"" but it really is interesting for what it is.The basic idea - walk walk, enjoy the sights and sounds.  Eventually you see something that makes you want to investigate.  Slowly you see all four seasons of the year. If I was to get all ""Artsy"" - I'd say it was a game about accepting death.  If my inner gamer had some ideas - why not give me a matter gun and allow me to break everything into beautiful particles.But really it is just a walk about simulator with pretty colors and funny noises for about 30 minutes.  I can see someone getting really ""High or drunk"" and having a good or potentially using VR for a fun experience.  I knew what it was before I bought it and would recommend it for what I paid.  Basically I sold some gamer cards and seen it was on sale for under $2.00 and though - eh - I've paid more for crappy coffee; why not?I had a goodd time!			"

												While this game isn't as bad as titles such as dear ester and gone home, I would definately not recommend this game. You basiclly walk around for half an hour looking at stuff. Thats it. The music and visuals are quite nice but in the end there is nothing to do and because of that it ends up barely being a game. Not worth your time or money.			"

												Proteus has beautiful visuals and great music and sound effects but it unfortunately lacks anything else substantial. Proteus is an exploration game with relatively little in things to discover. I found myself rather bored as I walked at a slow pace around the island searching for interesting landmarks (of which there are few). I feel like this game comes close to being good but just doesn’t quite get there.I will complement Proteus for definitely giving a sense of atmosphere. The aesthetics are very well executed and the audio and visuals work very well together to give it a sense of charm.For those of you who subscribe to the idea of having a certain amount of time per dollar invested (I personally don’t) then I am afraid Proteus will disappoint. My first playthrough lasted roughly 40 minutes and while the island is randomly generated each time you are still going to be stumbling upon the same few landmarks each time and you probably won’t find much in the way of anything new on your second playthrough.If it had some sort of story or more environments and cool landmarks or even just some level of interactivity then I could see this game as being something special, but at the state the developer left it in, it is simply charmingly boring.

												The year is 2257. You are Proteus, last in the line of a proud cyborg ninja clan. Voiced by Sam Neill, you embark on an epic journey of badassery and♥♥♥♥♥kicking, with plenty of laser katana dismemberment, and cyborg on cyborg action. The open world sandbox of NeoNagasaki is breathtaking, with its red light districts, cyberyakuza armies, and laser ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. That said, the blocking bullets with your type 550 laser shield gets a little repetitve with the button mashing, and the constant in game advertising of 'Laser Bud Light' and 'Cyber Dodge Ram' get kinda old.

												This is NOT a game to play when you want to play games. It's a wandering game with the only purpose of wandering, observing and, in a small degree, interacting with the given world.Consists in a random generated world that passes through time, and time only. Day, dusk, night, dawn, spring to winter. You can interpret it the way you like, there is no story line, just that as life starts, it ends at some point. You can view as much energy in a winter landscape as on summer days, it is just your perspective in play. If you know the meaning of wanderlust, you get the idea.Now, do I recommend full price? Not quite, there has been no update since launch and there could be more content, but if it is on sale and you like the exploration-observation type of games, you bet.			"

												When Proteus first came out, there was a lot of controversy over whether or not it counts as a game. Because if you don't think about it, there's nothing to do, no overarching story, no buttons to press, just one decently sized possibly alien island.I absolutely believe this counts as a game. More specifically, a child's game. This is how wee babes see the world: as something weird and beautiful that NEEDS to be explored. In Proteus, your entire goal is to do whatever. You interact with the world as a child does: by running at things and seeing what they do. This game will be a million times better once Oculus is made usable, and a million times more if we ever get haptic gloves out of them. The idea is total immersion into a brand new environment and learning how it exists. So no, it's not a classical game, but that is in no way a problem.			"

												I bought Proteus impulsively in the week it was released (I think) having read Rock Paper Shotgun's glowing review. Upon booting it up, I wandered around, peered at some trees and chased a rabbit, or perhaps a frog, before abandoning the game feeling miffed and shortchanged. I'm glad I came back.As I get older, I am increasingly finding that what I most want from a game is the ability to wander off and make my own fun. To explore, to pick flowers (probably Morrowind's doing), to fool around and to make my own choices. Or, given a choice, to reject it. I'm nothing if not contrary. Your interaction with Proteus' ever-changing world is subtle and, if impatient, as I was at first, you may miss what it has to offer. However, if you are willing to engage with it at its own relaxed pace then you will be rewarded with a beautiful, serene and wondrous experience, and one which is worth revisiting.			"

												After playing this game for twelve hours I can say this is not a great game. This is the greatest game. So many colors to dazzle yours eyes combined with exuberant soundscapes leaves you with a tingling feeling of psychadelia inside. Some may say this is not a game, as you merely walk around and explore. But then I tell them of how after roughly 6 hours you realize a video game does not have to be a game but rather just have the video aspect, as that is an experience unto itself.If I were to say this game was a combination of two others, I would say it's a combination of Deus Ex Machina and Gone Home, both GOTY's in their years of release. This game could have benefitted from slightly better graphics I must say. Maybe a better shader or palette of colors would have livened the game up.10/10			"

The entire game is fully exploration-based. You have to find some stone circles, and they shift you from season to season, until you finish the game.

Nobody will ever listen to the same music, ever. It all depends where you go. If you go near trees, you'll hear some additions to the music. If you go to a flower field, then you'll hear the music of the flowers. When you're walking through the landscape, it will all just blend together into a great, and truely unique musical score. If you are hesitant about getting this amazing game, don't be. You'll be very glad you did.			"

												Okay, I was going to give this a negative review. I was. The first time I played the game, my emotions ranged from frustration to boredom. I didn't give this a negative review, and I'll tell you why, but let me get to the negative points you should absolutely know before you buy this:CONS:-The Pricetag: Not worth full price. Wait 'til it's at least half off, if not more. Seriously, people have put out better content (game-wise) for free.-Fiddle with the mouse a bit-- I found the sensitivity was way too low for my liking.-The keys to capture a postcard of the island and load an island don't work for me (probably something to do with my f9 through f11 keys having dual purpose). There is no option to change those keys.-You have to be in the mood to ""experience"" the game. If you're not relaxed, it's not worth it. Treat it like meditation rather than gaming. PROS:My second Proteus experience: I opened up the game today, fiddled with the mouse sensitivity, and dived right in. Today, my friends-- today, I was chill as ♥♥♥♥. I turned off the lights, put on some headphones, and just immersed myself in it. And it was like videogame Buddha walked right the ♥♥♥♥ over and whispered in my ear: ""Yo. Yo, Carol-- this game right here is mother♥♥♥♥ing videogame nirvana."" And it was glorious.TL;DR --If you like to meditate, but you have trouble doing it the old-fashioned way 'cuz you have, like, ADD or something (like me), or you end up falling asleep instead, THIS IS FOR YOU.   However, if you're looking for plot or goals or something other than walking around, don't get the game. Just don't.			"

												Put simply, Proteus is lovely.  It's very simple, and it's not a very long game (one could find everything it has to offer so far in one or two sittings), but it is very attractive and soothing.There is no combat, no story, no progression in the strictest sense.  There is only exploration -- the game starts with the player out at sea just off a randomly-generated island.  The island itself is unpopulated, save for the local flora and fauna, but it is dotted with landmarks that must have been placed by people at some point (gravestones, towers, statues, etc.).  The origin of these objects is not the point, however.The only progression comes in the form of a vortex that appears at night, which will move the player forward through time, bringing them into the next season.  The appearance of the island changes from season to season, as do the resident fauna.  Each season seems to have its own strange occurrences as well.  (Here's a tip: don't enter the vortex on the first night of summer.  Stick around for the second day.)All in all, I highly recommend Proteus for anyone who enjoyed Flower or Journey, or just wants to take a break and enjoy chasing frogs, chickens, and fireflies around a colorful island for a little while.

												First thing, Proteus is not what I would conisder to be a game. There is no goal, no objective, and there really isn't anything to do. Well except be at utter peace with the world! Proteus is one of the greatest stress relievers I have ever known. It's always happy, and plays a relaxing soundtrack that changes depending on where you are. There are little monuments you can discover, so there is something to keep your mind occupied. The graphics are stylized to be like early 90's PC games. One thing that kept bothering me was the walking speed. I know its supposed to be peaceful, but I still felt like it was a bit slow. Proteus is everything I was hoping for, as I already have dozens of actual games.  Don't buy this because you want a game, buy it as a thing of art, and stress relief. EDIT: I recently just found out that this game does in fact have an ending, so there is an objective. However it took me only about 20 minutes to ""finish"" the game. But it was still pretty cool.Pros: +Stress relief+If you like exploring+Stylized graphics+Soundtrack+Secrets to findNeutral:*Movement speedNegitive:-Gameplay (its not really a game)Overall: 7/10 Buy only if its on sale, and only if you are interested in a game entirely made for relaxation.

												In Greek Mythology, Proteus is a sea god who allegedly changes his shape to avoid fortelling the future - only those capable of ""capturing"" him have their fates revealed.I can say without a doubt that ""Proteus"" is the only game I've played that has forced me to experience the entire spectrum of emotion in under 45 minutes.It started with apprehensive curiosity, then uneasy comfort - the sensation of discovery and uncovering secrets. This shifted quickly to awe, wonder and a sense of all-encompassing, childlike joy as Spring turned to Summer. The euphoric happiness turned to a sense of nervousness, worry and despair as Fall set in. I don't think I can accurately explain the sense of dread, lonliness and fear I felt as I trudged through the snow and twisted trees of Winter. In a fog of confusion and turmoil I finally had a chance to look up to the heavens, one last time - and only then did I feel the peaceful silence of Death.+1, would recommend.			"

												How can this game have any poor reviews. That would be like picking on an infant. This game is not about being a game. Its about being a zen.  This is brain candy which touches senses and feelings I forgot I had.  Its like the earliest dream you had which you can't ever quite remember.  The longer you stay the sadder and happier you get.  The artisans of Proteus somehow captured a place that I have  longed for, combining color palettes rarely seen, which stir such emotion.  What a masterful creation.  The genius in this artistic simplicity will be missed on many.  But for those whose minds can grasp the deeper significance and beauty, this game will excite you.  Thank you developers for putting so much love into this title.			"

												Good for a relaxing stroll, but you can probably find most of its content in about an hour, including replays. Your curiosity will be satisfied fairly quickly, and it leaves you wanting for more. Not a great deal in terms of time spent versus money paid, even at sale prices. Overall recommended for its unique concept and execution. It's simply exploring a procedurally-generated world, so avoid this game if that's not your style.			"

												The one and only thing you do in this game is walk around. There are no goals, failstates, or challenges. This isn't necessarily why I don't recommend the game; I enjoyed the little time I got out of it. The game progresses through days and seasons on a timer, and it's very relaxing to explore the world. If you're looking for a lighthearted experience that will let you let go of your stress for a while, this might just be the game for the job. But it's not worth ten dollars. The game outstays its welcome very quickly. I'm not sure who thought selling it for this price tag was a good idea, and it's the reason I can't recommend it. If you do buy it, I suggest getting it on sale for no more than two dollars.			"

												It will keep you entertained for a bit, but don't expect much. Sure, the game claims randomly generated worlds, and I'm sure this is true, but you will soon find everything familiar and.. dull. I've only played this game for half an hour, and what it can provide is already limited. Unless you are a  gamer who's just getting into the whole gaming world, I wouldnt reccomend buying this. For example, if you play Battlefield or Skyrim and REALLY love that game style, this will be a major step down for you because you wont be used to this type of thing. As is with my case. Also, the $10 price tag is way too steep for what this is. I got it on sale for $2, and still feel like I was ripped off.TL;DR) All in all this game is okay, but the price tag is not the greatest, and make sure to check out video reviews first.			"

												I'm gonna go ahead and hesitantly recommend Proteus. I'm not of the opinion that it's ""not a game"", although it could be argued. I just think the majority of people will only put the time into a single 40 minute playthrough, and it's hard to justify spending $10 on that.Proteus is absolutely beautiful though, one of the loveliest soundtracks and art styles of any game I've played. The sound effects are endearing too. In a lot of ways, Proteus is more of a musical adventure than anything. There's a fair few secrets to be discovered in its world. My complaints are as follows - It's very short.I could see people absolutely hating it for not having any clear objective or ""not being a game"".It crashed for me twice but only at launch. One time it launched but didn't have any sound until I restarted. Maybe I'm being a little too kind to Proteus because it's so charming and lovely to be a part of. I just really enjoyed my time in its randomly generated world. I recommend picking it up on sale if you're interested.			"

												This pushes the boundaries of what one would call gaming. It's more of a beautiful, semi random, synesthetic, exploration experience than anything else. That being said, if you like games or experiences different from the norm, that game is absolutely worth your time and money. I did two playthroughs back to back, and the experiences were significantly different each time. It's a strange feeling to not know when exactly you're finishing the game, and then feel a bit of sadness that this experience has to come to a close. This will definitely warrant more playthroughs for me.If mind altering substances of any sort are within your personal boundaries, I would highly recommend them paired with this game. Your experience and appreciation for this game will be greatly enhanced.			"

												Playing Proteus is like sitting down to consider a peice of art, observe a painting, or ponder a poem. It's meaning is specific to you, the player, and you alone.Take this hour and a half (or so) tour of what you need to discover at this current moment in life.Proteus is a game where you wander around, look at things, and sometimes interact with things with your presence. From this the game will tell you a story similar to a Robert Frost poem: Naturalistic, metaphorical, and most importantly: A plunge into the painful darkness of your own troubles unbeknownist to your own conscious frame of mind!Well perhaps the game doesn't act as a psychitrist, but it is an amazing piece of art to decypher for yourself!Fully approved for all artists.

												Proteus is part of the kind of experimental 'games' that keep popping up lately, in the same sence as Dear Esther and maybe even Gone Home. You wander around through some retro-gaming scenery, see some reactions to your presence (think about bunnies running away) and that's about it. There's no goal, no story, no beginning, no ending. I'd imagine most people regretting their decision to buy this. Unless you feel like taking a walk in nature, while being too lazy to get out the door, I would recommend skipping this one.			"

												You wake up in an ocean... How did you get there ? No one knows... In the distance you see an island. You decide to swim towards it. Once you've arrived you see one of the most colorful environments you've ever seen. There are trees, flowers, lakes, bushes, the sun is shining; it just feels so good to be there. It... it feels right. You decide the explore the island a bit. The trees start making noises. Not the annoying or natural kind, but a relaxing kind. You walk on. As you walk on the flowers and bushes start making sounds as well. You realize it's a symphony, a symphony created for you. A few metres away you spot a group of creatures. You have no idea what sort of creature as it's one you've never ever seen before. You approach them, but... they get scared and run away. While running away, they start making sounds. It's a lovely sound. And even though there are scared you decide to follow them. After following them for a while, enjoying the sounds they create, you start to wander off again. You head into a different direction. The sun is setting and it's getting dark. Somehow, you're not scared. Even when it's dark the island still looks magical. There are fireflies and stars in the sky. There are even different animals now. You see some white spots that look like insects or flies, you're not sure. There's a whole swarm of them. Then you start to realize this 'swarm' is trying to draw your attention. Once again, you decide to follow them. Suddenly, these things start circling around you. More and more; it's sort of making you dizzy. You have no idea what's going on and your lose your sight for just a moment. Once you wake up again, you see that a lot of time has passed. Seasons have changed. Should you be afraid, or worried, you ask yourself. No, you tell yourself that it's fine. Because even though it looks like winter's approaching the island still looks magical.You decide to stay here,... forever.[Rating: 78/100]			"

												Amazing!This game has an atmosphere like no other. It is very surreal. The music playing all the way through, constantly changing is excellent and and can be influenced by things in the world like the little creatures, or the owl. The game gets to its best during winter, the music is beautiful but sad during this part of the game, echoing what I can only presume is, well I can't tell you! You need to experience this. During the end of winter, I got goose bumps, but I will not spoil it. One of the most beautiful peices of art I have ever experienced. If you do drugs this may be an opportune use for them, it will get even more surreal.			"

												This game is only recommended for those that don't mind just wandering around a game landscape without any direction. Even then, for the asking price, $10 is steep. The pixel landscape is unique for this kind of thing, which adds some appeal to it, and there is something to do in the world at least, which is just pass by all the seasons. Main issue with the style is that things tend to blend together a lot with samey blobs of pixels. Even though it will randomly generate you a world each time, it will feel essentially identical to any other world with only a few lucky exceptions. $10 is also a rather steep price for something several benchmarking programs offer for free. Get it on a steep sale if you are into this sort of thing.			"

												This game is amazingly beautiful, a cross between Minecraft and Journey that takes the best of each game's beauty and adventure. Although this game has no goal, it offers a unique free-roam adventure that lets you go where you want and experience the mystery and views of each randomly generated island. One of it's best qualities is the music; the adaptive audio (which Ed Key and David Kanaga have mastered) makes the game just that much better, and other than the music, the sound effects are great in their own way. I think that this game is one of the most relaxing and calm games i've ever played and never fails to give me a great time.

Without a play button I had to smash around the screen to get it to play. Interesting choice but whatever. Then my game cut to a black screen, locked up, and refused to close.

												I'm not sure this counts as a game, but it definitely is a piece of art.The screenshots capture the mood of the game very well, you begin near an island which you head towards, then move across the island listening to dynamic 'music' as you approach trees, flowers, towers, stone circles and mountains. Each of these elements change slowly over time. Once night falls, you find a stone circle that will advance time to the next season. Once you have experienced Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter you will rise above the island and your experience will be over.The islands are randomly generated, so each experience is slightly different.Whilst I don't think this counts as a game, it is a beautiful and striking piece of art. It is slow and peaceful, something that takes time and patience, but there is something to appreciate here. Climbing a mountain above the morning mist in summer and watching the clouds roll below you is really quite moving, the stars spin away slowly at night and you can see comets streaking the sky on occassion. Small clusters of chickens run from you, conjuring up another layer of the dynamic music. Part of the charm of the game is moving near these small elements and seeing how they react, what they do, if anything at all. Sometimes just sitting and watching these elements reveals small surprises.The graphics are simplistic, but there is a strength in their simplicity. The style brings to mind old text adventure game screens brought to life. The colour pallette is really striking and part of the strength of the games beauty. The sun sets and you see the sky and the clouds and the trees change from greens to browns to oranges, into the cool blues of night.A walk through a virtual environment that may not be for everyone, but for those patient and willing to try, it is an experience unlike anything else.

												There is huge potential here: the landscapes are wonderful (if pixelated styles are your thing), the ambience is amazing, but aside from a few of the other events and ""creatures"" you can witness, that's about it. When I first played Proteus, I found it quite breathtaking, but that feeling was short-lived as I noticed there really wasn't anything significant to do. I can appreciate an experimental project and look for the positives it offers, but I find myself unable to give Proteus much more praise.Some people may find the environments relaxing, which is good by all means; it may be worth the $10 if simply existing in a beautiful and calm world helps you find peace. Otherwise, the price is steep for what the game offers and it's definitely not for everyone.			"

												Proteus is not a game, it's an experience. Frankly, I think it could've been more. If you've ever played Dear Esther before, (yes, I  own it) you know it wasn't much of a game, just a ""showcase"" of how powerful it's engine was. Proteus is the same in many ways, but its a pixel-y game, showcasing what the developers can do.I assume this is open world. The only reason I'm still attempting to play it is because of the music, but I'll get that later. It may just be an island, but you can walk around wherever you want and ""do"" whatever you want. You can't click on anything, you can just walk around, ""enjoy"" the art style, and enjoy (I say in a positive way) the music. There is no point to Proteus. The only main objective  is to drift away in the music, and I'd glaadly just open the game for the music. The soundtrack is pretty much the only thing it has going for it. Don't get me wrong, I kind of like the colorful, pixel world, but what really sold me was in fact the soundtrack.If you can find the soundtrack to this ""game"", just get that. To be honest, I don't think that Proteus is worth it's price tag.			"

												Proteus is nowhere near worth the current $9.99 price tag. I'll start by saying that much. That said, this is one of the most ""casual"" gaming experiences you will ever play. There is no purpose to Proteus other than to provide the player with a unique world to explore along with a relaxing soundtrack. You can not interact with any objects. You can not jump. All you can do is keep exploring the repetitive yet distinctively unique world. There is no narrative behind Proteus so nothing drives it forward and that is what this game lacks the most, some kind of goal. There are games which take a simple approach and execute so fluently and perfectly such as Journey or Minecraft. There is nothing to achieve out of this game and after some time, the soothing soundtrack and lush world gets old and then the game justs gets boring. And It gets boring fast. 5/10			"

												This is a good game. There is no doubt about that. However, I do not want to play it as I much as I did, Journey. Proteus, is great, there are parts I love. One of the main things I love, is the interaction with the animals  and dependent on the experince of playing, how hard it will hurt to close the eyes and end the game. However, in comprasion to Journey, there is no contest. Joureny will intrigue you, isolate you, surpise you and it will then destroy you. Proteus, will intrigue you, isolate you, surpise you. However it will not destroy you. It is not as emontianlly griping, this it's flaw. Nevertheless I like it, and you should buy it. It is a great game, it is worth it. Just play Journey after it.			"

												Proteus is a game I am particularly fond of myself, you play as a shipwrecked pirate captain, who finds himself lost in an island where nobody wants to be his friend. The moment you set foot on the island, you seal your fate. You make your best attempts at befriending the local population, but your wooden peg and eyepatch give it away, nobody wants to be a pirate's friend. You will traverse the scenery of this barren land, only to find an ancient spell that was cast on it many seasons past. Will mastering the ancient spell cast on the island allow you to befriend the local population and maybe recover your eye and leg, or are those sacrifices long past behind you?			"

												I have no idea how to review this to be honest. I've had it for a while and decided I'd get other games that fall within the ""Art"" genre. Proteus functions I suppose. It's pretty I can say that. It can be relaxing to go to after a bad day. I guess the problem I have is what am I supposed to feel in this game? I've tried other games such as Dear Esther, Stanley Parable and Thirty Flights Of Lovin but they all had a story in some degree. What would you like me to say? That it's good? I can't say that. That it's bad? No that would imply there is something wrong with it. So I'll leave you with this: Don't expect anything at all with this game. Think of nothing prior to it. Make your own assumptions of what it is. If you like it then thats great but if you don't like it then don't say that it is a half made game. This is what the game developers were hoping to achieve.Because I have to I give it 5/10 It exists. Try it out if you like the idea, unlike me who has no idea what to think of it.			"

												I'm not sure this counts as a game, but it definitely is a piece of art.The screenshots capture the mood of the game very well, you begin near an island which you head towards, then move across the island listening to dynamic 'music' as you approach trees, flowers, towers, stone circles and mountains. Each of these elements change slowly over time. Once night falls, you find a stone circle that will advance time to the next season. Once you have experienced Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter you will rise above the island and your experience will be over.The islands are randomly generated, so each experience is slightly different.Whilst I don't think this counts as a game, it is a beautiful and striking piece of art. It is slow and peaceful, something that takes time and patience, but there is something to appreciate here. Climbing a mountain above the morning mist in summer and watching the clouds roll below you is really quite moving, the stars spin away slowly at night and you can see comets streaking the sky on occassion. Small clusters of chickens run from you, conjuring up another layer of the dynamic music. Part of the charm of the game is moving near these small elements and seeing how they react, what they do, if anything at all. Sometimes just sitting and watching these elements reveals small surprises.The graphics are simplistic, but there is a strength in their simplicity. The style brings to mind old text adventure game screens brought to life. The colour pallette is really striking and part of the strength of the games beauty. The sun sets and you see the sky and the clouds and the trees change from greens to browns to oranges, into the cool blues of night.A walk through a virtual environment that may not be for everyone, but for those patient and willing to try, it is an experience unlike anything else.

It is one of the most unique and interesting games I have played in years and the sheer satisfaction of finding something new is amazing!Be warned, this game is extremely addicting and what you may find may suprise you. There are many, let me say it again so you understand, MANY secrets this game houses, but it's up to you to find them and what to make of them. If someone told me I had the opportunity to go back and keep my money, I would slap them in the face for even thinking that I don't love this game. Proteus is 100% worth the $10 and I wish it was more popular than it is right now.			"

												There is huge potential here: the landscapes are wonderful (if pixelated styles are your thing), the ambience is amazing, but aside from a few of the other events and ""creatures"" you can witness, that's about it. When I first played Proteus, I found it quite breathtaking, but that feeling was short-lived as I noticed there really wasn't anything significant to do. I can appreciate an experimental project and look for the positives it offers, but I find myself unable to give Proteus much more praise.Some people may find the environments relaxing, which is good by all means; it may be worth the $10 if simply existing in a beautiful and calm world helps you find peace. Otherwise, the price is steep for what the game offers and it's definitely not for everyone.			"

												#####1.5 hours playtime as of release of review##### Overview Proteus is an instantly appealing and fun little casual indie game. You wander around an island with no idea what you are suppose to be doing. You will encounter some cute little creatures and listen in awe as the charming sound immerses you in the ethereal world. Proteus is a fairly short, but highly replayable game. Components Visuals - The visuals of Proteus are very simplistic and stylized, but very pretty. This game may not have the fanciest graphics, yet the unique charm is captivating and pleasing to the eye. The game features a day/night cycle and even the four different seasons! This game's ethereal landscape is a place I could lose myself in for ages. Overall, Proteus has some incredible visuals.Audio - The audio is one of the most major components of Proteus. If you lack a good quality audio device, you won't enjoy this game nearly as much. Every action you make is rewarded with beautiful sounds, and as cute creatures scuttle away, beautiful melodies are formed. The music adapts to the season and time of day, and it always sounds serene and tranquil. Overall, the audio quality of Proteus is phenomenal. Gameplay - The gameplay of Proteus is very simple. You are dropped into an ocean as soon as you start and you make your way towards a procedually generated island. The only thing you'll be doing on this island is walking, and exploring. It may sound boring, but there is so much to see and discover that it remains fun. However, I did find the gameplay to be fairly shallow.Story - N/aFunctionality - Proteus is a very simplistic game. It will perform well even on weaker systems. This is a technically well performing game which is bug-free. Pros  Very memorable Beautiful, ethereal landscape So much too see and discover that you will need to play it at least twice Phenominal audio design Cons  Minimal interaction Minimal gameplay Relatively short Heftily priced  Conclusion If you're looking for a gorgeous casual exploration game, then I highly suggest Proteus.In conclusion, I suggest getting this game for the incredible and unique experience, but it's only worth it if you're getting this while it's on sale.I give this game a 5.5/10, it was a memorable and fantastical experience, but feels shallow and short.

												Are you Experienced? If so there may be somthing for you to find here. If not you may be left wanting somthing more. You dont do anything in the game but walk around in a dream like island for a time until you wake up. I found it a peacful immersive experience myself. May want to play this game with an altered state of mind to fully appriciate.			"

												This is interesting from an artistic perspective. When you view the screenshots, it may not look like much with its extremely dated pixelated graphics, but the developers sure knew how to use that visual style in interesting ways. The music is generated by the changing landscape as you explore and those willing to appreciate this ""game"" as artistic expression will probably enjoy that immensely. The colors are great, the sprite effects visually interesting. Proteus is a wonderful world to explore for about 20 minutes. Then you realize there's no point to it and the experience is over. It's like stopping to look at a painting in a museum, taking it in, and moving on. There is no ""game"" here in any traditional sense. It's just exploration and soothing music. What you see in the trailer is the highlights of what you'll see in-game. If Proteus were $1 or 2, I would probably recommend it. At $10, I cannot. Just check out a ""Let's Play"" on YouTube. Everything you can get out of ""playing"" this game, can be achieved watching a YouTube video, or a bunch of official trailers.			"

												Have you ever heard the fable about the Emperor's New Clothes? It's the story of an Emperor who starts walking around outside in the nude and everyone around him has nothing but praise for his ""new clothes"". Basically each bystander knows that he's actually naked but they're too afraid of going against the crowd by acknowledging it publicly. That story is just like this game. All the reviewers I've seen say that it's ""intoxicating"" They say it's so good that it'll just suck the hours away with its immersive genius. I say this ""game"" is in fact a cynical practical joke made by the developer at the gaming community's expense with the explicit purpose of proving that people will buy *anything*. There is no interactivity whatsoever. The game consists of pixels of alternating colors (sometimes they move and sometimes they don't) accompanied by stereotypically surreal ambient music. I do get (and even appreciate) that sometimes developers push the boundaries of what a game actually is (Osmos, etc.) but under no circumstances... on no planet... could this title honestly be referred to as a ""game"". My experience consisted of walking around aimlessly for about 10 minutes until I realized that you can't do anything. Literally. A youtube video is more interactive than this (since you can at least pause it). I bought this game based on having read several reviews but now I seriously regret it. I want my $10 back. Selling this title on Steam without appropriate warnings, prominently placed, is tantamount to theft.Update (01/13/14) -Below is a snippet from a user review on metacritic that says it way better than I did:""Proteus isn't actually a video game, it isn't even an interactive movie. I'd hardly even call it an ""experience"" let alone the digital Nirvana people claim it is. Proteus takes the ""player"" to an island which is supposedly randomly generated and it features a lot of pixelated objects passing for natural objects and animals. The player walks around using the WASD keys (W, mostly) and looks around with the mouse the music changes according to where you are walking and what you are looking at. Although the music will speak to New-Age electronic fans the game play won't. Neither will the graphics. Animals scurrying away and solid objects blocking your path is about the extent of your interaction with the world. There is supposedly an end to the game and I believe that ""progress"" is made by chasing certain objects in the world.

												It's a walk through an art piece. It's a game in which you explore and interact with the world. What I didn't like about it was the fact that the only way to *interact* with the world was to *look* at it and *be* in it. I wish the game would provide some way to establish goals or at least give the ""player"" a little bit more to intrigue them. It doesn't ever tell you why you appeared suddenly in the ocean near an island and must now wander aimlessly. You don't need to eat, or sleep, apparently. Overall it's quite zen, though. Walking around and hearing the music reflect your environment is actually a very strong aspect of the game. And even though I felt a burning desire to figure out what the game had to offer, eventually it sort of washed itself away and I felt content with being in the world.As far as a recommendation, it's quite a good experience, but it's one of those games that questions what a game is. Being so abstract and artistic, I don't think it'll be accessible to most audiences.To summarize my recommendation: I like it, but a lot of people won't. I recommend you play it. But don't expect to *do* much in the game.			"

												Proteus isn't really a ""game"" exactly, but that doesn't mean it isn't enjoyable. The gameplay is restricted to walking around, exploring a randomly generated island, being guided by your own instict and nothing more.While a lot of people would hate this game because it has no interactivity and no real gameplay, don't knock it until you try it. Proteus isn't for those that would rather relax by playing something intense. Instead, Proteus is for those that come in after a long stressful day and want to relax by winding down.The music and sounds can really capture the senses, if you'll let them. Plus, the various things you find can catch your attention and give you a new direction to explore in. If you want something to help you get away from a bad day, give Proteus a try. It's not that expensive and every island is different, so it's worth a try. Just don't expect to kill anything or talk to anyone.			"

												A combustible mix of abstract pixelated landscapes and chillwavy chip-tune synthetic/ambient music. Proteus is the 3D version of ‘mountain’. Play this when you are high. You can hear bit of ‘Tomorrow Never Knows’ by the Beatles near an artificial tower not far from the start of the game. “The wonderful gateway in your pocket to a world that is yours for the creating, whether it be talking frogs, stary faces on apple trees that just wont blink and you're sure that they know your name or maybe just the good old headmash that convinces you that you ARE, in fact, a carrot.”			"

												#####1.5 hours playtime as of release of review##### Overview Proteus is an instantly appealing and fun little casual indie game. You wander around an island with no idea what you are suppose to be doing. You will encounter some cute little creatures and listen in awe as the charming sound immerses you in the ethereal world. Proteus is a fairly short, but highly replayable game. Components Visuals - The visuals of Proteus are very simplistic and stylized, but very pretty. This game may not have the fanciest graphics, yet the unique charm is captivating and pleasing to the eye. The game features a day/night cycle and even the four different seasons! This game's ethereal landscape is a place I could lose myself in for ages. Overall, Proteus has some incredible visuals.Audio - The audio is one of the most major components of Proteus. If you lack a good quality audio device, you won't enjoy this game nearly as much. Every action you make is rewarded with beautiful sounds, and as cute creatures scuttle away, beautiful melodies are formed. The music adapts to the season and time of day, and it always sounds serene and tranquil. Overall, the audio quality of Proteus is phenomenal. Gameplay - The gameplay of Proteus is very simple. You are dropped into an ocean as soon as you start and you make your way towards a procedually generated island. The only thing you'll be doing on this island is walking, and exploring. It may sound boring, but there is so much to see and discover that it remains fun. However, I did find the gameplay to be fairly shallow.Story - N/aFunctionality - Proteus is a very simplistic game. It will perform well even on weaker systems. This is a technically well performing game which is bug-free. Pros  Very memorable Beautiful, ethereal landscape So much too see and discover that you will need to play it at least twice Phenominal audio design Cons  Minimal interaction Minimal gameplay Relatively short Heftily priced  Conclusion If you're looking for a gorgeous casual exploration game, then I highly suggest Proteus.In conclusion, I suggest getting this game for the incredible and unique experience, but it's only worth it if you're getting this while it's on sale.I give this game a 5.5/10, it was a memorable and fantastical experience, but feels shallow and short.

												First thing you need to know about Proteus is that it is not a ""game"" in the classic sense of the word.It doesn't contain much interaction or any tasks to complete whatsoever, so if this what you are looking for this title may simply not be for you.What it does offer is an interesting audio-visual experience with the freedom to explore procedurally generated islands made of  stylised 8bit 2D/3D hybrid visuals. It would be right to say that there is simply not much to Proteus, but that is the point of it. It is not meant to provide high octane action or hours of convoluted plot. It simply places you in its world in order to for you to see the sights (with some neat stuff happening at night) and enjoy a relaxing moment. It could best be compared as a pleasant, waking dream.It will not appeal to everyone, but those interested in being sent to a surealist dreamscape for a few dozen minutes may just find something to enjoy.

												Video games teach us to follow linear pathways to achieve a clear objective and reach a single, desirable end, a clear ""game over"" where we know we've succeeded or failed. Proteus could not deviate from that system farther. The first time I opened the game (which was just now), I found myself tearing up over... well, it's beauty, it's adventure, it's hard to describe. It's Proteus. (now admittedly I'm a huge wimp, but the experience was really emotionally moving, and not at all something I expected from a video game :P) It felt like five minutes of gametime; my Steam says I've logged five times that much. If any game is truly magical, it's Proteus.Most games are easily beatable with a lot of grinding and the help of a google search, a wiki, or a friend, but the thing about Proteus is you don't ""beat"" it. You just play it. That's somewhat of a radical thing in video games, I think, and it makes playing Proteus a real stress-relieving experience. There's nothing to tell you what's going to happen, or even how you go about making it happen - that's what playing the game is for! You explore, you learn, you discover. It's a game that doesn't bend itself to the will of a dedicated, competitive player, it's a game that takes you along for an adventure. The music has the quality of pre-composed pieces but is formed naturally as you explore the environment, which changes with what seems to be a mind of its own. Swim to that island. Bump into that rock. Follow that blue hopping thing. Who knows where you'll end up? I don't. My mom don't. The wiki don't. At least I sure hope it don't... This game is whatever you want it to be, so I encourage any players not to start with asking what they can find or how to find it, but just to hop into the game and enter their own little dreamscape where anything and everything can happen. :3On the practical side the game is very friendly with the options. You can play it fullscreen or in a window and you can adjust your field-of-view and mouse sensitivity very easily and even do it ingame if you please. The creators have pulled out all the stops to make sure this game is a convenient and comfortable experience as well as a beautiful one. I reckon I'd pay the full ten bucks for it, but if you can, get it on sale; whenever you can get your hands on it, Proteus will be waiting for you. :PThe game's not for everyone, but if you enjoy video games as an art form, if you're looking for a truly unique adventure that's both dynamic and peaceful at the same time, and heck, if you just flippin want to, give Proteus a try. This is a world I wouldn't mind going to when I die.			"

												Proteus,A Game of exploration, sound, sight, peace.When i first got this game, i was looking at it for the art. See, I am a big fan of videogames with art. When i downloaded and launched proteus, little did i know what was going to hit me.First Impression:When I awoke on the island, the first thing i noticed was the art (suprising, huh?). The art is almost an old school style atari-like style. This pleased me, for i was sick of games such as Call of Duty and other major FPS games. They try to competet to have the most realistic graphics. This game completely throws it away and gives you beutiful colors.Gameplay:Proteus is a game with no goal. You dont try to blow up the other ships, nor try to get the best KDR ratio to brag with your friends. This is a game about sight and sound. What you look at and where you are changes the soundtrack very uniquely. For example, there was a line of tree stumps. as each one of them got out of my sight they would play a deep bass note. There are also animals on the island. For example, some bees may be chilling by a treee enjoying proteus with you, but when you come close they al gather together. When they do this, they will chase you (but not hurt you) and you will get a speed boost. And yep, soundtrack altered with bees. Nature will sometimes act of of the ordinary, such as youll see a bunch of leaves flying into a kind of circel in the middle of the night. As you approach, time speeds up with multiple days fly by. Then, your screen goes bright white. When the whitness fades.... buy the game to find out :).Final Note Before Pros/Cons:This game gave me a huge amount of peace/zen. Its almost liek meditating in an awesome way. It calms down your heart and your mind making you focus on everything around you. For example the day i got this game, i had goten a test back... the grade i got made me feel terrible. I dont do bad at school, but this grade was below my average. I come home feeling like crap and all, and boot up my computer. First thing i go to is proteus. I had just goten it and i wanted to check it out to see how it works and all. After onoy 15 minutes of gameplay, i was relaxed and ready to finish off my day.Pros:Artwork is different and fun.No goal makes you wander and explore.Intresting soundtrack that interacts with you.Cools you down and makes you peaceful.No guys decked in military uniforms trying to headshot there way to a better KDR.Cons (partially biased):No goal making it unapealing to some (although i do like this because it gives me a sense of freedom)Walking speed is fairly slow (probably because its a slow paced game)Mouse/Trackpad is not very sensitive (though it adds up to a nice way to look around)Mouse/Trackpad keeps some motion even when you stop. (doesnt affect game too much and it eventually stops, but sometimes annoying)OVERALL:8/10Great game to play in your spare time.P.S.I hope you found my review helpful and honest! Any questions? Just add me!-Dagz :3(right now its only at 2 dollars, so if you read this within the next 20 hours id recomend buyin git cheap at 80% off :D) "

												Video games teach us to follow linear pathways to achieve a clear objective and reach a single, desirable end, a clear ""game over"" where we know we've succeeded or failed. Proteus could not deviate from that system farther. The first time I opened the game (which was just now), I found myself tearing up over... well, it's beauty, it's adventure, it's hard to describe. It's Proteus. (now admittedly I'm a huge wimp, but the experience was really emotionally moving, and not at all something I expected from a video game :P) It felt like five minutes of gametime; my Steam says I've logged five times that much. If any game is truly magical, it's Proteus.Most games are easily beatable with a lot of grinding and the help of a google search, a wiki, or a friend, but the thing about Proteus is you don't ""beat"" it. You just play it. That's somewhat of a radical thing in video games, I think, and it makes playing Proteus a real stress-relieving experience. There's nothing to tell you what's going to happen, or even how you go about making it happen - that's what playing the game is for! You explore, you learn, you discover. It's a game that doesn't bend itself to the will of a dedicated, competitive player, it's a game that takes you along for an adventure. The music has the quality of pre-composed pieces but is formed naturally as you explore the environment, which changes with what seems to be a mind of its own. Swim to that island. Bump into that rock. Follow that blue hopping thing. Who knows where you'll end up? I don't. My mom don't. The wiki don't. At least I sure hope it don't... This game is whatever you want it to be, so I encourage any players not to start with asking what they can find or how to find it, but just to hop into the game and enter their own little dreamscape where anything and everything can happen. :3On the practical side the game is very friendly with the options. You can play it fullscreen or in a window and you can adjust your field-of-view and mouse sensitivity very easily and even do it ingame if you please. The creators have pulled out all the stops to make sure this game is a convenient and comfortable experience as well as a beautiful one. I reckon I'd pay the full ten bucks for it, but if you can, get it on sale; whenever you can get your hands on it, Proteus will be waiting for you. :PThe game's not for everyone, but if you enjoy video games as an art form, if you're looking for a truly unique adventure that's both dynamic and peaceful at the same time, and heck, if you just flippin want to, give Proteus a try. This is a world I wouldn't mind going to when I die.			"

												I recommend this game if you're into walking simulators or if you appreciate art.I've only played a little over an hour though, and that is about the most you'll ever really need from this experience. I can't say the price justifies it, because frankly, it doesn't. There isn't enough ""game"" for the $10 price.I recommend picking it up if you want a quasi-surreal experience, want something completely different for your library, and it's on sale.While I enjoyed this game, and recommend it, I can't say it's worth picking up unless it meets the criteria listed above.

												In Proteus you awake, walking on the water for some reason, on a randomly generated ""garden of eden like island. Now there is not really any interaction within this game, if you can call it a game (Its sorta more like art). Proteus is all about immersing yourself in the ambient environment around you. As you explore the island you will find that the music of the game is influenced by your actions. whether you decide to follow a frog, the hoot of an owl, or even listen to the wind weave through the leaves. During the night if you follow the falling.. uhh stars, (I think that's what they are anyway) will lead you to a sort of worm hole that changes the season from spring, summer, fall , and winter. Proteus really exploits your curiosity, and curious is really how you feel while playing Proteus. Eventually You will find strange things scattered over the island, like grave stones, broken towers, cottages, and the very mysterious circle of totems. Now this game really doesn't appeal to everyone, I would recommend it if you like to relax while playing video games and have patience to explore the beautiful world of proteus. Because the world truly is beautiful. However the price of $10 seems a bit much for this game, as there are some better games on steam for cheaper. But I still recommend it, that is if you are interested in this type of game.			"

												Not really recommended, but it was interesting and short. You're on a minimalist island that's a little... too minimalist? The game tries to strike a balance between peaceful wandering and curious exploration, but there's too many hills over which there's just more hills, and too many animals or plants that just sit there or plainly run away.  Finding a pretty or intriguing event feels quite special, but was it really worth the minutes of walking past even more samey trees and slopes?I like my Dear Esters and my Gone Homes etc, but this felt too sparse. It has a lovely ending (I hit it an hour in) that leaves a good taste in the mouth, which I expect is where a lot of the positive reviews come from. Looking online, there doesn't seem to be much I missed, and I'm left wondering what all the fuss was about, for something that was maybe 1-2 steps above a quick, touching browser game.			"

												First thing you need to know about Proteus is that it is not a ""game"" in the classic sense of the word.It doesn't contain much interaction or any tasks to complete whatsoever, so if this what you are looking for this title may simply not be for you.What it does offer is an interesting audio-visual experience with the freedom to explore procedurally generated islands made of  stylised 8bit 2D/3D hybrid visuals. It would be right to say that there is simply not much to Proteus, but that is the point of it. It is not meant to provide high octane action or hours of convoluted plot. It simply places you in its world in order to for you to see the sights (with some neat stuff happening at night) and enjoy a relaxing moment. It could best be compared as a pleasant, waking dream.It will not appeal to everyone, but those interested in being sent to a surealist dreamscape for a few dozen minutes may just find something to enjoy.

												THIS IS NOT A GAME.Do not spend money on it!I was fooled by the nice graphics, in fact I hate pseudo-retro stuff but this one is different - it has really creative and non-ordinary graphics.In this game, you have nothing to do just roam in the map and listen to the ""music"" that changes by your steps etc.Some people says it's for ""relaxig"", but it was rather irritating for me. Nothing to do in this game just walk. That's all.The full price is 7 eur. It does not even worth a dollar! I've bought it on indiegamestand for 1$, and I still feel being robbed. It really has some beautiful scenery, but it's not enough.I have no idea how the hell did this ""something"" ended up on Steam. If you want to expand your library with something you won't ""play"" for more than 3 minutes, go ahead and buy Proteus and enjoy this... don't know how to call it, but it's definitely not a game.I'm really sad to see that a lots of cool Greenlight games are rejected and not founded, but this awful something in the disguise of ""artistic, relaxing game"" is in Steam catalog for 7 eurs...

												Literally all you do in this game is walk around a world and look at it. This might be a cool concept if the game didn't look like it was made on a calculator. Now I'm NEVER someone to say a game is bad just because of the graphics, but when a game's primary focus is its visuals, exploration, and all that, it NEEDS to be at least remotely pleasing to the eye, which this game is not. Don't let the trailer fool you like it did for me. This is not some quirky game where the worlds are full of fun mysteries and wonders to unravel. You walk around a boring world that you can't do anything in and where nothing is interesting. You're basically spending $10 to have your eyes♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and your sense of boredom sent to a new peak.			"

												For the first few minutes I was kind of impressed.  The island was bigger than I had imagined based on my initial sighting.  I started to look around and some things in the distance caught my eye.  I found a cabin I couldn't enter.  Some animals that I could sort of chase.  And a weird circle of statues on a mountain that made the stars pulse like the universe was having a seizure.  And then I thought, ""Ok, so I've been here 5-10 minutes... I've seen most of what I can pick out as interesting features... is this it?""  I walked around a bit more thinking, ""What do I do now?  Are there any goals or things to look for if only I had some hints?'""  This is when I decided there was nothing more to do and quit the game.And then I remembered the game was put out on PS3/Vita where it was required to have trophies.  And as I looked at the Proteus trophy list (here: http://www.playstationtrophies.org/game/proteus/trophies/ ), I once again felt like I got the short end of the stick by supporting this developer on PC before they ported their game to consoles and left us forgotten (much like those jerks at KLEI).  Looking through the trophy guide there, at quick glance, it seems like the developer actually put some thought and effort into the trophy list, so I searched through the community forums here on Steam to see if anything was mentioned as far as developer commentary on the possibility of an achievement patch or why there will be none.  Even KLEI, for all their hypocritical behaviour, at least tried to come up with a reason for not porting the trophies for Don't Starve into Steam achievements... but there was nothing.  Even google didn't turn up much.  Perusing the article on the game over at wikipedia, I found that the dev said that the features added to the PS versions ""could come to PC in the future"".  This was over a year ago and nothing has been seen regarding it since then... and it's an absolute shame.  Looking at the guides in the community section, it seems there's an actual goal and some other neat aspects of the game that casual gamers and players not using guides will miss out on.  Achievements would be a way to help clue people in on theses aspects and encourage them with hints on ways to find them... but Steam users are left wanting and envious of the console ports.I wish more developers would support their PC games and update them with the added content seen when the games are ported to consoles, much like The Astronauts have just done with The Vanishing of Ethan Carter (and the achievements added will probably match the PS4 trophy list, if I had to guess).Don't buy this game, put your money toward something like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter instead.

About and hour in I was completely revolted that something with so little effort put into it ended up on steam.  This game can barely be considered interactive.  All you can do is hold W and walk around a tiny island that looks like it was made in MS Paint. I ended up dissapointed to say the least.  Absolutely nothing happens the entire time.  I could have watched a series of MS Paint drawings done by elementary schoolers for the same effect.  For $9.99 I got to waste 2 hours of my time. An hour ""Playing"" and an hour working to earn the money to burn on this pathetic excuse for a game.			"

												I guess I wasn't made to enjoy this kind of games: it's basically a pixelated environment on an island you can walk through, but you can't really do anything. Specific about this walking is that the music changes depending on your surroundings, so if you love looking at pixels with slight variations in background music, this is it, but you'll likely not spend too long 'playing' this game.

												When I bought this game I thought it was a puzzle game or a point and click adventure, like Myst or Zork. I was sadly disappointed to find that it is not. There is no purpose to this game other than walking around and triggering visual and audio effects. Many people debate whether this is a ""game"" or not.

												I'm not sure this is really how I want to spend my time.The game world is definitely curious.  Granted, I wish that there were more lighting effects.  I really want to see the trees cast shadows, and the sky to have a gradient to it.  Maybe something like global illumination too, maybe.  The absence of any sort of lighting effects makes the world feel off, like it's a strange land where everything is alien.			"

But there are also mysteries to discover, randomised islands, postcards and creepy little spirits that scares the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you the first time you meet them. To be honest, this game is peacefull with a good touch of creepy.

												Proteus is a joy to experience. Contrary to some folk, I always find new things to do each time I take a wander - it is up to you what you do and where you go. Sometimes I just like to watch a sunset, stare at the sun or stars, or watch the clouds roll by in the lowlands. Other times, I go chasing chickens and see where I can get them to. When it is dark, I go and try to find owls. In all honesty, I find Proteus to be an intense experience (in a good way) in which I have to turn down the lights, put the headphones on and minimize all other distractions. Go explore! There is plenty to do.			"

												I can not emfasize how much I hat this game. It is hard to determin were to start picking this game apart. So, let's start with the excessive violence. The game begins with blaring 80's pop synth, and thrusts you into an environment that impedes progresion unless you violently murder everything in your path. It made me sick to even look at the screen. Most of the screen was covered in red, and when it wasn't, I was acosted by scenes of brutal gore. Moving on to the other primary offensive factor! The story is just aful, having no interesting charaters or any sign of a coherent narrative. The story killed my ability to tink, causing the variety of spelling erors in this revu. All in al, 4/5 trucks and trains. Wood replay.			"

Product received for free
												There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;And frogs in the pools, singing at night,And wild plum trees in tremulous white,Robins will wear their feathery fire,Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;And not one will know of the war, not oneWill care at last when it is done.Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree,If mankind perished utterly;And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn,Would scarcely know that we were gone.-Sara TeasdaleThis was a very good experience. I rushed through it, though. You play as someone who stumbles upon an island, and as you progress through the year, you get a lot of different emotions. I don't want to spoil it, but it had some moments that felt tense, mostly due to the calming nature of the rest of the game. I chose the poem because the game reminded me of a movie adaptation of it, and I seriously felt like the last man (or woman) on earth, up until the end. I recommend this if you have a ""musical personality""			"

												I recommend this game to everyone. This is an amazing example of in-game immersion without having to care about a story line, or a certain set of characters...*looking at you ""Beyond Two Souls""* But I digress, all of my friends should take advantage of this sale. Proteus has a certain atmosphere most games aren't able to master. Its using the persons mind to imagine what the world ""feels"" like. Unlike most Triple A games where HD graphics are the norm, Proteus takes gaming back to when you had to IMAGINE what was happening on screen and believe you were in it. Its a certain charm most games lose due to the game screaming at you to go to the next checkpoint, or mission when they really could focus on the environment and setting. Thats why I play FPS's like CoD and heavily critize the campaign for its lack there of immersion. All around this game is not a game, its a statement about modern gaming. I find it to be pretty true and agree with it. :)			"

												I thought I had seen everything this game had to offer within the first five minutes. I'm now very glad I didn't quit at that point. This game had so many cool and unexpected things that happened in it! It was absolutely beautiful. The music, the scenery, the atmosphere in general. By the time I beat the game, when everything was wrapping to a slow serene peaceful close, I got the shivers big time. This game may not be a standard video game, but I'd say give it a play all the way through. You'll know when you've finished. Not having any direction at all, and being dropped into this mysterious and beautiful world was quite entertaining. Figuring things out was very rewarding. This game is a work of art.

												I recommend this game to everyone. This is an amazing example of in-game immersion without having to care about a story line, or a certain set of characters...*looking at you ""Beyond Two Souls""* But I digress, all of my friends should take advantage of this sale. Proteus has a certain atmosphere most games aren't able to master. Its using the persons mind to imagine what the world ""feels"" like. Unlike most Triple A games where HD graphics are the norm, Proteus takes gaming back to when you had to IMAGINE what was happening on screen and believe you were in it. Its a certain charm most games lose due to the game screaming at you to go to the next checkpoint, or mission when they really could focus on the environment and setting. Thats why I play FPS's like CoD and heavily critize the campaign for its lack there of immersion. All around this game is not a game, its a statement about modern gaming. I find it to be pretty true and agree with it. :)			"

												Proteus isn't a game.  I'd compare it to Dear Esther but Dear Esther actually had a linear path, story, and ending.  Proteus is just a visual and auditory pleasure.  As the description says, the audio changes as you traverse, not just around the island but when you bump into other oddities that add to the curiousty that is Proteus.  I was going to be quick to dismiss it as a ""Fun for a few minutes but that's it"" sort of thing but then I ran across a few locations that intrigued me.  There are certain places and objects  that cause subtle change, as long as you're patient enough to look for it.  It's these little tiny and hidden details that delight me to keep exploring.I'd definitely call this one a ""Come back from time to time"" type of experience, when feeling a desire to just wander and think, without being burdened by anything else.I honestly can't give this a rating.  It's good but for completely different reasons than the ones I'm used to.			"

												I thought I had seen everything this game had to offer within the first five minutes. I'm now very glad I didn't quit at that point. This game had so many cool and unexpected things that happened in it! It was absolutely beautiful. The music, the scenery, the atmosphere in general. By the time I beat the game, when everything was wrapping to a slow serene peaceful close, I got the shivers big time. This game may not be a standard video game, but I'd say give it a play all the way through. You'll know when you've finished. Not having any direction at all, and being dropped into this mysterious and beautiful world was quite entertaining. Figuring things out was very rewarding. This game is a work of art. It also serves as a feel good meditation-like experience. It really is something. Give it a shot!			"

												This game is a meditative piece of art.  It's fun to just wander around and explore the island.  The music fits well with the art style and it's relaxing.  I guess I beat the game, or lasted through a full ""session"", because the game ended and sent me back to the start screen.  I think it randomly generates new islands to explore so I'm definitely going to play some more.  If you're just looking to chill out and explore this is pretty fun.  My only minor complaint is a lack of achievements, I realize that maybe this may be against the nature of the game for some people but I think it would have been a fun addition to the game.  I would gladly support a kickstarter for a sequel.			"

												SUMMARY: A relaxing game where you wander around a procedurally generated island, and your travels create the soundtrack.  With some interesting visuals and a focus on playing around, the game is for people who want something experimental and playful and/or want to back an innovative game.  Not for something where you're looking for scores, skilltrees, and so on.Proteus is wandering through a child's drawing while listening to a freeform prog rock soundtrack.  If that appeals to you, then it's probably a game to get.  Be warned - it's not for everyone.Every time you start Proteus, you end up in the ocean near a procedurally generated island.  As you explore, the sound reflects the surroundings.  You wander into the soundtrack, as it were.Exploring the island allows you to experience various sites, find interesting things, or just hang out.  There's various landmarks in each game that provide certain features, as well as plenty of randomness.  There's some discoveries to be made that will let you experience the game in depth, and there is an ""end"" to get to if you want (and lets you experience assorted visual and auditory experiences).Then?  You can start again.It's really a game of wandering, playing on that urge that often drives us to see ""just what's around here"", combined with the freeform soundtrack.  It's compelling and relaxing, like you're experiencing a dream.If you want a game with skilltrees, combat, construction, etc. it isn't for you.  You don't do anything except choose where you go and what you experience.  I find myself playing it when I need to take a short break, and it's surprisingly soothing.Is it for you?  Like many games it depends on you - if the description has you interested, it probably is.			"

												It is... kind of a weird game. In fact, it is not exactly a game, more like an exploration sort of thing. It seems to be more a kind of demo to render the island, which is randomly generated every time.When you visit the stone circle at night, you'll see a whirling circle of orbs. If you step in its ring, you'll skip to the next season. Starting at spring, you ultimately end up in winter. It is kind of interesting to see the various seasons. But as the game resolution is so low (or rather, very pixelated), it is not exactly something to linger too long at.There are some landmarks on every generated island which are interesting to find and wonder about, but that's basically all you can do with those landmarks. You can't interact with those at all.I'd not suggest to buy this game unless it was part of some indie bundle anyway (which was how I got this). Mostly because 1) it is not exactly a game and 2) there is not terribly much to do besides just wandering around and looking at the differences in scenery per season.			"

												That was wierd, I wasn't aware what the game was about when I started it, neither i am once i've finished (sorta).So you watch how different seasons affect a pretty island, listen to atmospheric music (which is 10/10 btw) and wander from one strange place to another (the latter allows you to skip to the next season). Not gonna spoil for you how it ends. I son't ecxactly dig the graphics, perhaps with a smoother design they would have gotten much greater effect. Though that could be compensated if you're on drugs or smth.			"

												Ah, I hate to put a ""no"" review for Proteus. It's a quirky little game that has some heart to it.Proteus is one of those 'experience' games a-la Journey where the enjoyment is in experiencing what is around you. For what it's worth, Proteus does offer a lot of charm; the background melodies combine with the various sounds of your island to create a hypnotic symphony. The wide open environment reminds a lot of Minecraft, only in a beautiful cell-shaded manner.But unlike Minecraft or Journey, Proteus lacks any form of gameplay. It consists of wandering around until you find something that piques your curiosity, investigating it, and then leaving. And there are a couple non-standard things to find in Proteus; if a player feels like they're being led somewhere, there's probably something to find. Alas, there could stand to be way more of these curiosities, as they are too few. Exploration is all that Proteus has, yet Minecraft does it with wider worlds, more mysteries, more gameplay, and the ability to express one's own artsy fartsy tendencies rather than just experiencing those of another.If you got the game as part of a bundle, it may be worth it to play; the experience is very serene, and the way the music synergizes with the environment is wonderful. However, even though the game may be ""art,"" it is missing an actual game, and I would not recommend its actual purchase.Final verdict:Exploration games are an excellent concept, but it needed way more to be as memorable as something like Journey.On a scale out of 10 where 4.7 is considered ""average,"" this game would rank at a 3.5 - has potential, but doesn't necessarily meet it.

												Not a game, and not much to it. There are no mechanics to speak of. You just walk and look at the roughly 6 things there are to see, change a season and see the same 6 things in a slightly different color scheme, then you're done. There is no plot, and the most interesting thing about it is that ambiant music stems from what's around you (And that's been done much better elsewhere). It's essentially a zen program; An awfully expensive one. Watch a Let's Play on YouTube if that interests you at all, you'll see all there is in short order.			"

												Definitely not a game for everybody.  Certainly not for me.  After forcing myself to endure a few minutes of play, I just can't understand the appeal.  I guess I'm just not into the ""artistic expression"" this game tries to convey.  Maybe if there were goals of some kind, I could get into it.You start off in the water and then wander around a 3d-ish island.  Music changes now and again.  Animal-like things bounce around, rain falls, touching certain stones does something weird I'm not even entirely sure of.  It's pretty much an exploration game with no long-term state and no goals.  For some, this may be appealing, but for me it was just not terribly interesting.I could recommend it to people if its base price were more in the $3 range.  But $10?  I can't really see recommending it to anybody for that price, even if this style were up their alley.			"

												This is a game where you slowly walk around while soothing electronic noises sedate you.  If that sounds interesting to you, you should try it.Proteus has garnered a lot of praise as an art game, but the ""art game"" genre is so young that virtually every entry in it is guaranteed decent reviews.  Personally, I suspect that this is because game reviewers, who are more accustomed to reviewing the sort of conventional pulp titles that built the industry, are afraid that giving a negative review to a game like Proteus might make them look stupid.But honestly, this game isn't some kind of artistic masterpiece on any level.  The player slowly walks around in a simplistic, dull, and mostly static landscape while sleepy electronic sounds are dynamically generated by the player's surroundings.  Sometimes, the season will change, and new sounds will play.  It feels more like a palliative treatment for patients recovering from severe brain damage, and it is difficult for me to believe that even its most ardent supporters have honestly enjoyed playing it for more than 30 minutes.  Personally, I checked out around 12 minutes.			"

												Games can be many things.Games can challenge us, can be an outlet for our stresses and our boredom, and they are absolutely wonderful for that ability. They can be exciting, gripping, and engaging, certainly. They can demand your full attention, and hold you, breathless with anticipation, spellbound by the compulsion to uncover more of their world, to play the next match, the next level, the next moment. They are magical, in the way they can draw the player in and keep them engaged despite the challenges they may present and the stress they can occasionally cause.But games can also draw stress out of us, too. They can soothe, they can relax, and they can even heal. Certainly, they can provide a distraction, and often... that's enough.And Proteus makes a wonderful distraction in that regard. It isn't much in the way of mechanics -- you generate a new world and wake up there, free to wander around and explore it. That's all there really is to it -- seeing what comes next, seeing what the world has to offer as it changes and evolves over the days and the seasons is its own reward, and some people may find that off-putting. Certainly, those people are entitled to their preferences, as well.But others may find in Proteus the exact break they need from whatever they've been playing recently, a quiet escape away from everything else nagging them in worlds both real and fictional. There is beauty in simplicity, and sparse mechanics executed well can be better than feature-rich experiences with less polish, to the right person. I happened to really enjoy this game personally (and do pardon my playtime, I tend to be an offline player in most things.) As to whether or not you might enjoy this -- if you want to interact and get into the nitty-gritty of things, you may wind up diappointed here. Walking around and sightseeing is the brunt of what you will find in Proteus' gameplay offerings. Those who already enjoy walking simulators will feel right at home so long as the art style appeals to you! For anyone left undecided, all I can advise is that if you think you will enjoy it, with the knowledge of how the game operates fresh in memory -- if you need a break from your traditional fare or you feel drawn to this game -- give it a chance, grab it on sale if you can, and see how you feel about things. I hope you find what you're looking for in it. I certainly have found an appreciated sojourn, here, and for that reason I recommend this game.			"

												Well what can you say? If I ever did acid this would be the game to play. Its very well............spiritual.  Cycles of life, wonders of life, possibly the ending embraces death? Hard to say really, its your journey and what you make of it.  There is no game play, this all experiences only. You glide in any direction on this every changing island. I wont spoil it and tell you how you move from season to season but Im sure you'll get it.  Follow the light? Let it embrace you?  Probably the strangest title Ive ever played but certainly worth it. Environment creates the music, entities are charming. Some seem to die during different seasons but that speculation on my part. You take from the game what you personally experience.  Scary actually at certain points and nothing changed really but the lighting. I think it shows you the joy of life, how it changes, how to appreciate seasons, and a hint possibly that death is more than just death.  Took me 40 minutes to get through to what I can only guess was the end. Nothing dramatic, no epic end story. You just know its the end when you see it. Certainly will go through this again to see if the experiences are different per play through but first time through was pretty joyful. You smile a lot, frown a lot, seem even sad at times. There is no playing this game, there is only experiencing whatever message you take from it. I can only say my experience said this. Life is beautiful, seasons are beautiful, life is way to short, and maybe death is not as scary as it seems to be.Certainly your experience or what you take from it will be different.			"

												Proteus is a beautiful, emotionally rewarding game with wonderful graphics and beautiful music; any discussion of it's status as a 'Game' is an academic one at best, a distraction at worst.There is interaction, there is game play, there is a progression and an end to the game (  you use the stone circle on each island to progress from one season to the next and after four seasons the game ends with what may be death but if so it is an infinitely peaceful death after a few days of bliss  )and for these reasons I have no hesitation in recommending this as a gameProteus is one of the most beautiful games I have ever played.

												Art... Blah...Heres the thing. Most 'Art' games bug the hell out of me because of two big reasons. Theres a lot of them that seem devoid of any meaning or message and instead 'Look Pwetty'. Then you get ones that just go so arty, they forget the whole 'Game' part.Sadly for me, this hits both issues hard. Yes Proteus is quite pretty at times, the music soothing occasionally, however theres just no story, no message and nothing informative at all. That would be fine by itself to be honest but then theres the total lack of interactivity bar of walking about and staring at repeated patterns, trees that kind of look similar, cloned flowers and pixel bunnies. For some I imagine this title is a great thing, a soothing massage of a title. For me its just dull and devoid of anything to keep me entertained for over a few minutes. In fact, if you have noticed I have yet to even call this a game once here. Thats because it isnt and, just not for me.			"

												Changing my score a bit after spending more time with this...First off - don't look at screenshots or watch the video, the less you know the better.  This game is like taking a hike on an island while on LSD. Trippy, weird, interesting, sometimes shocking, and very very relaxing. All you do is walk and that's it so don't expect any *real* gameplay but there is ways of making stuff happen. It's a short game (about an hour to complete) but there's a lot of interesting and well hidden things to discover, good observation skills are required.  You must play this game in a pitch black room and headphones are an absolute must.  The more times you complete it the more you will discover about this strange island.+ Awesome graphical style+ Great sound design and music+ Lots to discover- steep price- short+/- Decent replay value+ Extremely relaxing+/- I wish there was more+++ Trippy as ♥♥♥♥ing hellOverall 7/10Definitly not for everyone, beware.

												For me this game suits a speicific purpose - it relaxes me. I have a hard time shutting down, and if I'm stressed/angry/emotional, this game cools me off and just lets me relax. It's like a spa trip but with a mouse and keyboard, a bit more control, and less touching. Can't reccomend enough.			"

												The music and night time settings are simplistic but beatiful for about 5 min, the rest is ultimately pointless and shallow. I paid $2.50 (normally $10) for this and regret the investment, not much to justifiy the purchase or the time. I understand it's supposed to be art, it's supposed to evoke feeling, emotion, and introspection - it scratches the surface for a moment, but accomplishes nothing substantial.

												I do not recomend this game. It's a short little pixelated mess. That's not meant to be too much on the graphics, they were going for pixels and they scored. It's a very bright game. I might give it to someone who was depressed if they liked minecraft and were tired of challenge.I'll tell you what I think they were trying to do before I explain why I believe that they failed at it. What I believe they were trying to do is create a unique experience where you didn't have to do anything, you were just out on a walk (that happens to start out on the ocean). It seems like you arrive by boat to admire the pretty scenery and get to see the seasons change. It's meant to be a work of art, a road of many different directions with many different sights and a host of different experiences.I've actually looked, I can't find anyone who's found anything to do. The guides could be one sentence long: find fairy circles. That's all well and good but this game offers little up front. I tried to play it for the sound and scenery but you don't get medatitve, you get board.Do I recommend this game? No, I recommend playing minecraft with a seasons mod installed. At least then you won't be bathing in the ""artwork"" and will be able to look up again and admire how it is the world changes around us as we get so wrapped up in the little things that suddenly seem so insignificant. This does not. This makes me feel like I should go on walks more.Now here's what went wrong: I came into this game with no expectations. I heard it was an art game, so I expected it to challenge my perceptions on a game. That it did. There's no levels, no challenge, you're just on a walk with nothing to do. And that's where the problems begin: There's nothing to do. There's no new trees to find, there's no new experiences. I walked around for the entire time I played, I even abandoned the little goal the set for it (stepping in fairy circles to advance the seasons so you can see your island for a whole year? What?) and tried to see what the game offered. I found nothing. If that were their goal, they might as well have put things in it for you to do. They didn't have to exclude content for the sake of making a point, but they did. This is less a treatise on human nature and more a dull walk through the woods. I don't think adding some optional activities would have			"

												Have you ever played a game where the mechanics were so rich you felt like you could refine the entire thing into one concept and it would still be great? That feeling may work for many games but most of the time you won’t find out one way or the other. Most designers and gamers alike understand that games are an amalgamation of many ideas rather than a thoroughly impressive one-trick pony. This understanding seems to have evaded the creators of Proteus, or maybe they thought their game was exempt. Proteus is a one-concept tech demo that might’ve been neat if it was part of something bigger but what’s there isn’t enough to keep your interest or justify the seemingly inoffensive price.The concept of Proteus is relatively brief. You control a first-person character that starts off in the ocean with an island in sight on the horizon. Once you get to the island, your only source of interaction is what you walk next to. The game reacts to your presence by playing different music depending on your location and occasionally there is a sprite animal or insect that runs away from you. That is the entire game. There is “progression” and an “endpoint,” but not in the way you might hope for. Endings are usually synonymous with finales or closing thoughts. Proteus’ ends a lot like a High School final project. They probably could’ve kept prolonging it for a better grade but the class already lost interest and the teacher gave a glance that implied what they had was good enough.That’s not to say that “good enough,” is actually any good. Proteus’ quality hinges on the music and visuals, neither of which is very impressive. The artwork may be appealing in screenshots, but the environment remains completely static during gameplay. There are occasional lighting effects which add a bit of variety but nothing to make up for the overall stiffness of the game. As a result, the world feels very lifeless and the lack of interaction from the player doesn’t help. The music doesn’t add much personality either. Proteus’ concept of “different music plays depending where you are” certainly works but the sounds you’re hearing sound like placeholders rather than actual music. Most of the tracks sound like someone pressing buttons to see if the instrument is working rather than playing actual music. This blunder contributes to the feeling that Proteus is an undeveloped tech demo, not an actual game.If you somehow “finish” Proteus, you won’t be getting much more from the experience than the person who loads it up for five minutes and closes it out of disinterest. This game may be the latest discussion in the “are games art” debate but I’d argue that Proteus offers absolutely nothing to the player. There is no interaction to speak of, the music is amateurish, the visuals are mediocre and the experience is pointless. There is no message or mood established in Proteus, it’s the definition of wasting time. Proteus may serve as inspiration for a mechanic that’s a part of a bigger game, but on its own there’s nothing worth playing.			"

												Not recommended. Not condemning it either. It's a pretty cool experience, actually. If you get it for free or for very cheap as part of a bundle or sale or something, you should definitely play through it once or twice. It's short, so it's worth your time, but maybe not worth your money, is what I'm saying.The game consists of wandering around a brightly colored, pulsating, low-fi landscape which transforms as you explore it. There are animals and plants, weather effects, and a day/night/seasonal cycle, all of which sync with a hypnotic, throbbing, synthy electronic soundtrack. It's trippy and pleasant and if you plug in some headphones and stare hard at the screen, can be pretty compelling and immersive.			"

												Proteus – a game about walking… Yeah that’s it. Obviously I’m not a fan, but let’s get into the details (or lack thereof). If you haven’t heard of this game don’t be alarmed, I had not heard of it either until I purchased the one of the Humble Indie Bundles.When you first start playing, you appear in the ocean and begin to walk towards an island, imagine if you will, Minecraft, with no features, no running, no jumping, no enemies, no crafting, building, etc… Absolutely nothing, just walking and looking. What I later found out, was that you need to find a circle of stones to change the seasons over allowing you to look at a different color pallet of the trees, grass, and bugs. Hence the main narrative is to progress through the seasons. Hmm okay, so I can finish the game by standing in the circle afk. Ah! but beating the game isn’t the primary focus, no, we should experience this transcendental artistic expression of man as the changing of seasons, the absolution and solidarity of this naturalistic soul trapped on a lonely island; how profound?! And to think, I was just a meek imbecile, a dim-witted brute until I experienced this revolutionary journey.Alright so maybe I’m being a little sarcastic and acting like a♥♥♥♥♥♥ and I will give it that it looks ‘pretty’, but this is only in the sense of the color schemes chosen associated with the seasons, other than that the world is fairly generic. There are dips and valleys, hills and mountains, and they are all, respectively, not too deep or too tall, but just average. Occasionally you will find roads, tombstones, a house, a strange black polygonal shape, and even an assortment of wildlife, but so what, it is just an assortment of objects to look at. Why incorporate anything into this visual discourse? it all feels like a generic, ancient, simplistic, fantasy world. For instance, maybe there was an old tribal village that existed at some point but it’s one of those things that is left for interpretation. I will say, that I was pleased to see the existence of actual music, (I’m surprised they decided that was worth keeping). And yes, the music was fitting in a sense. But I could not help feel that it was little too intrusive, coupled with the lack of substance in the ‘gameplay’ it all just feels forced, it needed more ambiance and less 8-bit digital.And that’s about it. I mean seriously, they actually charge money for this, and no I do not want to here “Oh, it’s an art game, it’s supposed to have no plot or gameplay.” How is this even a retort, I thought all games were art, how come if I say Lord of the Rings: Conquest is a terrible game, no one will resort to the “but it’s art” defense. Most people will say, “I had fun playing it.” And there is your key word, ‘play’, it is a game and it is art, but first and foremost it is and should be a game. This whole moronic idea of art games needs to be laid to rest, it is pretentious and egotistical. If you truly want to ‘play’ Proteus, here is what you do. Boot up Minecraft, download a simplistic colorful/seasonal texture pack, turn on some ambient music, generate a world and run around in creative mode occasionally changing the seasonal texture pack. No I do not recommend this game.			"

												The sluggish movement and bad camera design make this game tedious and frustrating.Touring a procedurally generated island would usually be a fun thing to do, but I wouldn't exactly call this exploring. The constant wrestling with the restrictive camera angle and the stifling walking speed makes this an exercise in patience. Instead of feeling free to explore, I feel claustrophobic.The camera cannot look up or down past a certain angle from the horizon. Looking down from a precipice or up at the tree isn't possible. Climbing up or descending steep slopes means the player can't watch where they're going, which feels very unnatural.The environment is nice enough from a distance, but the 2D sprites can be really immersion breaking. Tree branches rotate to constantly face the camera in that eerie fashion.The music is not good.The day-night cycles are much too quick, and the stars in the sky look very artificial.Some creatures just ignore collision detection.The default mouse settings has smoothing enabled, and only 10% sensitivity.

												This is NOT a game. You do nothing. Literally. You wander around enjoying the soundtrack and beautiful Atari 2600 color scheme, but there is nothing much else there... It's a great stress reliever, but nothing at all close to a gaming experience. I can't BELIEVE the $10.00 price tag.  This peace and happy time simulator is not worth it.			"

												The first time I treid to play this game, it crashed and then wouldn't load again. The next day I realized that it was still showing me as being in the game and logged 30+ hours of gameplay. I decided to close the process and actually give the game another shot... and I couldn't take more than 30 minutes of it. The crash was a blessing and I should have taken it as a sign. Sure, the game is surprisingly visually appealing, but its lack of gameplay barely qualifies it as a game. This is a pixelated walk in the park but substitute burning calories with killing braincells.			"

												It's already been said, but this game really isn't all it's cracked up to be. I've played artsy games before and I usually enjoy them; but this isn't even that. The 'art' in it isn't nice, at all... I wouldn't mind walking around the island if it was actually nice to look at. I'm fine with pixel art (Minecraft is gorgeous at times after all) but this just seems to have no effort put into it.Also, not sure if this was a problem just with my game, but I wasn't even able to access the 'options' and 'help' menu, and as such I hated how slow and clunky the movement felt. I was having to move my mouse far too much just to turn around, and I'm not sure what you're supposed to be playing as, but the eerie floating through space thing isn't fun.This game could do with some interaction in it, honestly. No combat is fine, and definitely could work, but having things just constantly run from you gets boring fast. And the random statues and houses dotted around for seemingly no reason just add to the overall feeling of pointlessness.			"

												UPDATE: Original ""review"" at the bottom of the current oneIt's been a little more than 2 years since I posted my original ""review"" for Proteus, and looking back I must say it was hardly a proper overview of this game. Just some loose, short and rather ambiguous opinions of the overall product as a whole, hardly anything constructive or informative, something that is unfortunately quite common in the review section, but it is definitely no excuse for producing a rather poor piece of writing regarding this particular product (even if I'm not a journalist, I should have tried harder). The problem is, that this type of game doesn't really suit me and does not match my preferences, something I didn't know before I tried it, and since I was unable to gain enjoyment out of this, I felt somewhat salty and decided to leave unfavorable opinion.I can definitely say that the graphics are really nice,and although they are simplistic, I think they are the perfect choice for this kind of game, because of their charm and the fact that they go extremely well with the soundtrack, that is dynamic and changes depending on what happens on the screen. But unfortunately this is how I perceive this game: simple (though pleasant) graphics accompanied by the appropriate, everchnaging soundtrack, and the only one can do is to explore the procedurally generated island, something that I, personally, wasn't captivated by and ultimately didn't enjoy. In the end, if I were to summarize my whole experience I would say that ""It isn't my cup of tea.""If you are considering the purchase of this game, I hope my thoughts can be of some use, maybe as another point of view, though I highly encourage you to read other reviews, as others explored the features of this game more extensively. And if you enjoyed this game, I must say that I am envious that it met your expectations, though I'm glad it did, as at the end of the day this is the most important part of all the gaming: to have fun.ORIGINAL REVIEW:While the idea is interesting, and the soundtrack is quite relaxing, ""Proteus"" gets boring really quick. The only thing player can do, is to walk around and observe the rather empty scenery. Seven euros is way too much for this game. To be honest, it doesn't deserve even half of the asked price.			"

												I shouldn't complain really, because I got this very cheap in the Xmas sale. But WTF? Maybe I needed to play it for longer, but I was left wondering where the entertainment value was. Undoubtedly a beautiful game, if the retro graphics appeal, but there simply wasn't enough to discover to make it all worthwhile. I was left wondering what it was all about. The music was annoying, and only loosely related to the events on screen. Most of the tones were way too full, resulting in an ambient cacophony of jarring textures. When you seek to jam so many notes and timbres together, less is definately more.			"

Those are all great games to play and are artful in one way or another. I give it no score as it doesn't qualify as a game in my eyes.			"

												Ethereal, Cathartic. Proteus is like is the Nintendo Entertainment System was a sentient beign and we were allowed to enter it's dreams. As someone who finds difficulty enjoying the flood of indie games that claim to be ""installations"", ""a vessel for an interactive story"" and ""purely artistic expressions"", such as Dinner Date and Dear Esther- Proteus seems to settle in a good place for me. You find yourself coming upon a randomly generated island, with music  that matches the environment and changes with your actions. There, you experience the island changing seasons, and interact with the different elements that come along with it- all in a relaxing exploration of a place that becomes more and more familiar and serene.And then it is gone.I highly reccomend wearing headphones and having a large screen or a multimonitor set up.

												This game is one of the better walking simulaters I have played but I hate to give it a negative review but I feel it has two issues. One issue I have is price.  It is difficult to price a ""game"" where there is nothing to the game itself.  There is walking and minor and I emphasize minor interactions.  For 9.99, I feel it is expensive for what it is.  Another issue I have with the game is the soundtrack.  It is an annoying soundtrack at best.  I feel it trys to do a bit of retro with some electronica and it does not sound good.  What I liked about the game was it isn't that long for a walking simulater and you walk at a decent pace which many similar games make you walk slow to extend the game time which is just annoying.  I would say get this game if you enjoy the non-game genre when this is on sale but to the regular gamer who wants have a compelling story or gameplay or other features that makes a game a video game, they would not enjoy this.

												I won't say this ""game"" is terrible or anything. It might have been an interesting concept at the time it came out. Today however I can't recommend this to anyone at full price. For 1,99 I would say, check it out.There is no real gameplay. You just walk around and explore, but there is nothing really worth to explore. I figured out the secrets pretty quick and after less than one hour you have seen absolutely everything it has to offer. Right now there are other artsy games which do better what Proteus does.It tried something different back then and that is worth mentioning but other than that there is nothing else going on. If you want to experience walking around in nature just go out and don't sit in front of your computer.			"

												After the first 10 or 20 minutes of  frustration, i feel strangely relaxing, and that's exactly what has hooked me at first. But no buttons, tools, task bars or hints, just your first person presence to meditate or something.But then i discovered little constants that leaded me to found the simple environment interactions, just activated by presence. Sounds, lights and movements, nothing more.The surprises really start to came when i began another world - procedurally generated, so they're never the same - and at the first night i heard a loud and strange sound, and then an owl flying from a tree to another. Curiosity catches me, and i found me exploring this an other worlds.And they reveal secrets, beautiful, but sometimes kind scary or supernatural.But to reach them you have to find how, because they're not random and as you discover it you can make it over and over as your wish and event conditions.It have a meaning - a naive and predictable one - and even a story with the same previous attributes, but you'll have to discover how to reach it. Like any other game, you'll learn the mechanics that led you till the end, doesn't matter how boring or stupid it sounds to me or you.Finally, to me Proteus - very personally saying it - has being an overwhelming experience, even after discovered all secrets. Now i use it to relax, making me - sometimes - feel me like a child pursuing birds, but in a ""3d-like"" 8bit magical world, with a deeply relaxing soundtrack that you, somewhat step in.			"

												Visually the game is cool and nice to look at but it doesn't help with the experience due to bad controls and annoying music.People claim this game is nice to get you relaxed, something to play after a bad day etc... but no. This game doesn't relax you unless you turn off the sounds, which is like 90% of what this game is, the badly made 'music'. And the controls are horrible, the game is more likely to make you angry at the bad controls and constantly waiting for something to actually happen.A game like Dear Esther and the countless other exploration games and similar games are a lot better at relaxing you, and they are actually immersive. You can actually live into the worlds in those games, you can't in this one.There's not much to say as this game contains no actual content, it's a cool pixel graphics world with not-so-great 'music' that badly generates as you walk past triggers.And let me just slip this in, the options menu isn't horrible but extremely weird, it feels like they made it weird and kind of bad on purpose to differ themselves from the good options menu's most other games have.The world is nice to look at if you enjoy pixel graphics, that's the only compliment I can pull out of me. It's a nice world.This game is certainly experimental indeed and I hope the developers(and other aspiring developers) can learn what to not due via this game.I cannot recommend this game at any price, not even free.

												Pompus game with no gameplay, storyline, depth or intruigue.Its supposed to be a big world to explore and adventure and find interesting things without it being aggresive, dark or anything other than pleasant.What it ACTUALLY is is a teaspoon deep game where the entire world is copy and pasted with NOTHING interesting to see. I walked around for ages trying to give it a chance but there was just nothing there. They dont even give you the freedom to create your own fun or an enjoyable way of moving.The graphics are ok at best but overchildish.Gameplay is non-existant.Atmostphere is wafer thin.Storyline at its most complex is ""Youre a guy who goes to look at rocks"".What this is is a game which feels like it was made as a first test subject by a student but what it actually is is someone who doesnt understand what art is getting a basic understanding of games and throwing this together in a couple of hours (being generous).It aims for a mix of art and games and achieves neither.A cheap masturbatory aid for the creator who gets to sniff his own farts while massaging their own ego.I wouldnt give this to a child for fear of stunting their development.I wouldnt give this to a teen for them thinking this is acceptable behaviour.I wouldnt give this to an adult as we have enough♥♥♥♥♥♥to deal with without wasting our time with this.I wouldnt give this to an elderly person as Id hate for them to know the world they worked for had lead to this.I would give it to someone as a bad example.

												God awful.I don't know what compelled me to buy this game. All I can say for that is I have my own shortcomings. Gameplay is nonexistent - it's a walking simulator.Graphics look awful, especially when you look at certain objects like trees, and I don't mean that because it's pixelated. There are good ways to accomplish that art style, this ain't it.Audio quality is alright, making it the best thing about this game by a long shot.Now it's time for me to go into ranting. The section below has little to do with whether or not you should BUY this game, and everything to do with me being tired of seeing walking simulators tirelessly hoisted as the best gaming has to offerGames like this and Dear Esther are awful as games and as art. They're not games, they're virtual art exhibits, and that is the problem. If you think these games are art and the rest of gaming isn't, you are part of the problem. We view these games as art because it reminds us more of what we've already established long ago. They don't progress art except by saying ""see, I can replicate the feeling of an incredibly boring film or art exhibit ON THE COMPUTER"". They don't establish anything new. At all. Still, the knee-jerk reaction across almost the entire gaming press is to heap praise and worship it. Why? Because we tend to see older types of media as having more artistic merit by default. Books are seen as having more worth than movies, movies as having more merit than games. Dear Esther, Proteus, Gone Home, and the entire library of pretentious indie titles only serve to play along with this by regressing gaming to feel more like old media, even if it's with new messages and perspectives.How about instead of praising walking simulator after walking simulator as shining examples of games as art, we instead hoist up games that actually use more aspects unique to gaming?

												I'm finding it hard to consider this a game.  It randomly generates an island out of gigantic pixels, and then you walk around to procedurally generated music based on your surroundings.  That's literally all you can do.  I'm not really sure why they expect people to pay $10 for this (horray Humble Bundle!)			"

												It´s beautiful... but 10 bucks? Nope! Nope! Nope! This is essential Minecraft, without the interaction. Imagine Minecraft where you can´t affect the world. That is Proteus.You are a floating camera in a random created world. You have no goal. You can only experience sounds and visions. But there is nothing to discover, nothing to experience. It tries to pass random sounds and sights of as depth... but a random block (a frog) that emits random sounds ain´t that different from a random pack of blocks (birds?) that emits different random sounds.I feel that even 2 dollars were to much for this experience. For 10 bucks you can take a bus trip to a part of town you´ve never been. That experience would be more meaningful than 7minutes of this pretentious waste of time.			"

												A mind-numbing, heacache induced art student nightmare, a game with almost zero gameplay, replay value, characters, or infact anything of any real tangible entertainment value and nothing more to offer beyond the stylized visuals. A pretentious person will tell you this is beautiful - Do not be fooled. This is the artier and more pompous end of the Call of Duty spectrum. If you want a ""walk around and look at things"" game that is actually worth while, play Dear Esther, which is a moody, atmospheric ""experience"" game much like this only it doesn't have an utterly intolerable degree of pretentiousness and fart-sniffery. It's a dark, ambiguous journey through a wind-swept isle which still maintains a certain degree of pretentiousness but is a thousand times less irritating about it than this dayglow eyesore. Avoid like cancer.			"

												This is the worst purchase I ever done, it doesn't even count as a game. 10euro for a pixel forest simulator. The game has a very odd pixel style to it which annoys me. The games does not have a goal and is boring as hell. It also have a pretty high metascore (80/100) because it's ""beautiful"" and ""artistic""  game with a ""fantastic"" pixel graphic. But no one can seriously enjoy playing this game. It's like modern art; you own a painting of something weird like three straight lines and a circle. You don't even think the painting is beautiful and it's only hanging on your wall so that the people visiting you thinks you are artistic and sophisticated. You are refusing to have real beautiful paintings of landscapes and such where you can actually see that the artist but effort into making it.Sure go full indie hipster on this game, but don't trick other people to buy this game because you want to sound like a modern art hipster critic. ""Oh it's colorful has no goal and is ugly as♥♥♥♥♥♥ this must be the game of the year"" - a random indie hipsters first impression.  The pixel style and the ""no goal"" thing is just a result of lazy game developers. But they are not stupid! They knew that all indie hipsters would go full ape♥♥♥♥♥♥on something colorful and simplistic and give it 10/10 on metascore and call it the game of the century. I'm generous and I give this game 0/10			"

												There is no forward button.  Trying to go forward actually veers to the right significantly, so you're constantly trying to reorient yourself.  Pressing left + forward is the closest direction to going forward, but since it's straffing, it slows you down (and you're already going at a really slow pace already, without any run option).  Does the forward button go forward?  I think that's a critical aspect to having a good game.			"

Maybe I'll do multiple playthroughs (if you can even call it playing) on various drugs. Better on acid? Worse on shrooms? Best on krokodile??

It feels like a contemporary museum, where the feeling when you walk out of the door is ""wait, some people pay for this crap?, they found that in the dumpster!"". There are tutorials about programming that last 10 minutes, which have greater complexity than this game.A special mention to the music that sound like if a monkey found a keyboard plug to a synthesizer.Run away from this thing.

												There is simply nothing here....I bought this game after I had finished ""Dear Esther"" because that game had changed the way I view games as art. This came onto Steam riding the heels of ""Dear Esther"" and billed itself as the same type of ""artistic experience"" of a game.I will say again that there is simply nothing here. The world you enter is bland and uneventful with zero interaction or goal. It wouldn't be so bad if the world itself was pretty to look at but using this pixelated 4 bit art style was a cheap cop-out to knock something out quick and call it art.The game fails on so many levels it's not even funny.I'm not looking for world interaction or a definitive goal in artistic styled games, but this simply is devoid of anything at all!This piece of tripe is something that the developers should be ashamed that they charge money for.....even if it was free (which it should have been in the first place) I would still say that the 91mb  it took to download it would be a waste of bandwidth.ABSOLUTE FAIL!

												Discovering islands in Proteus is a wholeheartedly wonderful experience. It tickles one's senses connecting visual and auditive aesthetics in a new age environment. Travelling this world made me feel warm and fussy, yet also very much alone and melancholic at the same time - like the first time I played Magic Carpet and didn't give a flying ♥♥♥♥ (get it? GET IT?!) about the gameplay mechanics. Everyone should play Proteus at least once.			"

												Odd to put this under games titles. Interesting consept that makes 8bit music by affecting the 8bit enviromet you explore in the world they have made.  graphics are 8bit but the random music it makes keeps me puzzled. How. Good if you have a 5yr old that wants to play with your new PC. Good enough audio and visuals to keep them intrested and learning thw mouse and hand control. chasing things on the screen they will never catch. There is always something behind the next tree for them to chase. Very simple movment hold down left click to move forward and right for backwards. listen for music changes. Would be better if it played music that was a pleasure to listen to. More insterment options or band options.			"

It's very artistic in a semi-abstract style which lets them exercise their imaginations, and I don't have to worry about them getting mauled by ""bad guys"" while they explore the world. The music accompanying the world is beautiful as well. The game to me seems to be geared toward self-paced exploration and allows you to interpret it for yourself.I enjoy wandering the world myself, and my kids enjoy watching me.			"

The soundscapes were very pleasant, as were the animations and colour palettes.Not a fan of the huge pixels, I don't thiknk they're cute, I think they're hideous, but the complete picture is still aesthethically pleasing.

												Interesting. Relax and explore. That's all there is to this. Glad I spent the 2 bucks on it while it was on sale. I'd probably feel less than satisfied if I'd paid full price, but for just a couple bucks, it was worth it. It's not a game. It's interactive art, but there are some interesting things to discover as you explore.  I feel that this is the sort of thing that the minds behind Flower and Journey might have made had they been much more limited in budget. If you enjoy these sorts of experiences and you find it on sale, give it a go. If you're the sort of gamer who must always have stated goals, achievements, weapons and power-ups, move on. You'll be happier spending your money elsewhere.			"

												Got this in a Humble Bundle for very cheap, so I have no personal grievance with my experience. However I really do not reccommend buying this for the full listed price (£6.99). I think that is a downright arrogant asking price for what amounts to a mere exploration tech demo. Better off watching the trailer or getting it in a bundle.There is no gameplay here; the only function is just wandering around a generated environment and occasionally bumping into or chasing things that make noises when doing so. No objective, found nothing new after 10 minutes of slow wandering.			"

												This is a game in which there are no enemies to defeat or problems to solve. Your only goal is to explore. Every time you play a new island is randomly generated. The island will have its own seasons, weather, and day/night cycles. There will also be some wildlife that will react to your presence in various ways. The soundtrack will react to your location (under a rain cloud, on top of a mountain, ect.).This is a ""walking simulator"" game, and while I have no problem with walking simulator games per se (see my positive review of Dear Esther) I can't really recommend buying Proteus. The island of Dear Esther was interesting to explore because the graphics were AAA quality and the music was top notch. But Proteus suffers from low res pixel graphics (seen one pixelated tree, seen em all), a simplistic soundtrack, and the lack of interesting stuff to see. I played 20 minutes of Proteus and felt I had seen 95% of what the game had to offer; I felt no incentive to wait another 10 minutes to see what few changes the next season might bring.Fortunately I paid just a few cents for it, and those 20 minutes I did play were enjoyable, so it wasn't a total wash. If you like exploration games and you see Proteus on sale for a few cents you might give it a try, but I wouldn't pay more than that.			"

I enjoyed the simplistic gameplay and controls, which you can literally play with 3 keys or just the mouse. The music and ambience of the different seasons make it fun to explore, not to mention the critters make noises. It does very well at being a relaxing game where you can observe and explore the procedurally generated islands without pressure.It's worth a playthrough if you get it in combination with some other games or on sale.

												I got this on sale for $2.  While I wouldn't have spent $10 on it, there's no remorse in purchasing this game for less than the cost of a large bag of chips.  It's also about 90MB, which meant it was playable within minutes, and isn't taking up a huge amount of space on my machine.  I can keep it there and come back to it from time to time with no guilt.Now, from someone who DID NOT enjoy Dear Esther, I do like this.  It's fun to just walk around.  Laugh because I made the little square bees angry, or something.  Unlike Dear Esther, which has lofty, pretentious aims, this is just there to let you relax, and doesn't pretend to be anything more.  It's the squishy stress ball of games.  At no point will you be stuck on x area, looking for some stupid bauble, or trying to get the game to trigger an event by doing the right hoohah dance, or whatever.  Grab it while it's $2, and play it when you're too stressed to even handle conventional game play.  (You KNOW that happens.)			"

After my first playthrough at around 45 minutes, I was absolutely positive that not a single cent was wasted.Really, it's like walking around in a dream with lo-fi graphics.The game is very simple, both in concept and graphics. It's a game I will play from time to time, to relax, or to just be amazed for an hour or so. There's always something new to see, and it's always just as intoxicating.I recommend you buy Proteus and support the hard-working developers. It's one of the most charming walks in recent memory.

""why it's a procedurally-generated landscape of terrible textures and audio trigger points, that lacks any intrigue, and in which nothing at all happens."" he sighs, plays it for FIVE freakin' hours. you sleep downstairs with the un-killable cat; cursing the plan, the game, your aunt (his wife), the whole world.post: i would like to add that the concept is a lovely one, it's just the execution that is lacking. i feel as though an experience like this should have some semblance of longetivity. for me at least, it didn't. one set of rolling hills blended into the other and any sense of discovery soon disappeared.

When I got to Winter, it was extremely bleak and hard to navigate due to fog, so I just hit the constant walk button (q) and kept going into the ocean for several minutes.  I'm not sure how the game ends for most people, but I found my ending somewhat sad.FYI, as the settings indicate, you can get motion sickness from this game. That is a first for me when playing a video game.It's also a steep price at $10, but I'm not mad.			"

												This game reminds me of a time in my teens, going to the fair and paying money to peek in a majestic aquarium and see a mermaid. I don't know what I actually thought I'd see, probably nothing amazing, but it ended up being a really ugly old fat man in a one piece bathing suit and an XXL long sleeve green tshirt around ""her"" legs, sitting at the bottom of a disguised dunk tank. I paid one dollar and fifty cents to see that man and this game disappointed me more. Its exactly what you'd expect, except with less going on. It's peaceful, but if that's what you're into, hiking in real life is free at a lot of places and the rabbits are more than 4 pixels. It was the anticipation that made me hate it, if I just stumbled across this for free, coded into a web page, I'd probably play for five minutes and then stop and be like, ""Hey, that was sort of cool.""You can press Q, and it auto-walks forward, and you just look around with the mouse with really not much other than trees to see, aside from a few graves, and the changing time of day. I think a lot of people are arguing that this is art, or this game is just trying to be different and show that you don't need goals or objectives, but from my perspective, many of those people are just fighting the norm, playing the devil's advocate. I can't see someone spending more than 20 minutes max on this game.Overall: 2/10 for being pretty.			"

I found the dragonflies among the grass, weakly twitching on the ground, clearly dying.I quit the game for the rest of the day.			"

												Similar in a way to Dear Esther, this game is not so much a game as it is an experience. The only action you make is walking around a world in a first person perspective. About an hour long, with cool music, sounds, colors and a few things to figure out... It's a great game to relax and have a beer while playing.			"

												I got this on sale for $2.  While I wouldn't have spent $10 on it, there's no remorse in purchasing this game for less than the cost of a large bag of chips.  It's also about 90MB, which meant it was playable within minutes, and isn't taking up a huge amount of space on my machine.  I can keep it there and come back to it from time to time with no guilt.Now, from someone who DID NOT enjoy Dear Esther, I do like this.  It's fun to just walk around.  Laugh because I made the little square bees angry, or something.  Unlike Dear Esther, which has lofty, pretentious aims, this is just there to let you relax, and doesn't pretend to be anything more.  It's the squishy stress ball of games.  At no point will you be stuck on x area, looking for some stupid bauble, or trying to get the game to trigger an event by doing the right hoohah dance, or whatever.  Grab it while it's $2, and play it when you're too stressed to even handle conventional game play.  (You KNOW that happens.)			"

												I've always been a sucker for games like these. At first I wondered if the 9 euros I put down was a mistake. After my first playthrough at around 45 minutes, I was absolutely positive that not a single cent was wasted.Really, it's like walking around in a dream with lo-fi graphics.The game is very simple, both in concept and graphics. It's a game I will play from time to time, to relax, or to just be amazed for an hour or so. There's always something new to see, and it's always just as intoxicating.I recommend you buy Proteus and support the hard-working developers. It's one of the most charming walks in recent memory.

												who signed off on this? this is the type of game you show to your uncle after your  aunt (his wife) has just passed away. although the funeral isn't till thursday, he insists on staying over three nights prior (monday), and just by consequence of his very existence, you become desperate to show your extracurricular activities are not damaging. ""what exactly is this?"", he asks between sobs. you slide the headphones over his ears. ""why it's a procedurally-generated landscape of terrible textures and audio trigger points, that lacks any intrigue, and in which nothing at all happens."" he sighs, plays it for FIVE freakin' hours. you sleep downstairs with the un-killable cat; cursing the plan, the game, your aunt (his wife), the whole world.post: i would like to add that the concept is a lovely one, it's just the execution that is lacking. i feel as though an experience like this should have some semblance of longetivity. for me at least, it didn't. one set of rolling hills blended into the other and any sense of discovery soon disappeared.

												Proteus isn't your typical game, as has been stated by many reviews now. That said, if you give it the time it deserves, it will be a rewarding experience. It's basically a walking simulator, you're on an island and how you interact with the world around you (read: where you walk/how you explore/do you explore) is really up to you. I do strongly recommend playing the game with sound -it really adds to the experience. I, for one, spent a great deal of the first season chasing after various critters simply because of the sounds they made.Good way to relax, definitely worth the time. Give it a shot, if nothing else you can enter the debate of ""is this really a game""! ;)			"

												This game reminds me of a time in my teens, going to the fair and paying money to peek in a majestic aquarium and see a mermaid. I don't know what I actually thought I'd see, probably nothing amazing, but it ended up being a really ugly old fat man in a one piece bathing suit and an XXL long sleeve green tshirt around ""her"" legs, sitting at the bottom of a disguised dunk tank. I paid one dollar and fifty cents to see that man and this game disappointed me more. Its exactly what you'd expect, except with less going on. It's peaceful, but if that's what you're into, hiking in real life is free at a lot of places and the rabbits are more than 4 pixels. It was the anticipation that made me hate it, if I just stumbled across this for free, coded into a web page, I'd probably play for five minutes and then stop and be like, ""Hey, that was sort of cool.""You can press Q, and it auto-walks forward, and you just look around with the mouse with really not much other than trees to see, aside from a few graves, and the changing time of day. I think a lot of people are arguing that this is art, or this game is just trying to be different and show that you don't need goals or objectives, but from my perspective, many of those people are just fighting the norm, playing the devil's advocate. I can't see someone spending more than 20 minutes max on this game.Overall: 2/10 for being pretty.			"

												Proteus isn't a ""game"" as noted in many other reviews. It's an exploration through 4 seasons on a procedurally generated island. While this in itself isn't a bad thing, there simply isn't enough to see to justify buying it. If it were an early access game or some sort of tech demo or something, I'd say give it a shot if you're bored. But your money would be much better spent on another game. If you want to do some exploring, go down to a local park. There'll be much more to see than Proteus has to offer.			"

												For me, this game had a big focus on what you should follow in life. You start off with a large unexplored island full of life, and you end off with just the moon being the only thing to guide you. Everyone need something to guide us, and this game has alot of examples of it. I found myself aimlessly wandering around, looking at the beautifull landmarks, only to get lost after a while, but when the night came, a large vortex of light swarmed away into a direction.I followed, and when i got to the end, i found a large stone circle that changed the seasons. When it was done changing, it went all dark. The trees were dead. The life was gone, and the island was full of gravestones. The music changed into a dull string of nothingness. The things i used to guide me around the island were gone. With nothing to guide me, i wandered away from the island, With nothing happening, i went back again, but this time, it seemed that the island was a bit small, but to my surprise, i was flying. Higher and higher, until i saw the only landmark to guide me; The moon. The screen went dark.			"

A lot of people won't get it or understand the concept. But it's more a work of interactive art than a game. At first I thought there wasn't a point to it till I noticed I was in a way... ""leveling up"". After getting the hang of it I reached a point where I was slowly lifted up to the air and the game ended and started over.It's not as story or emotionally driven as other art style games like Flower or Journey on PS3, but it's an amusing piece of work with fun visuals and sound.

												This is an incredible experience.I am not usually one for things billed as ""relaxation"".  I literally cannot count to ten for the purpose of relaxing my mind; the attempt triggers very unpleasant memories for me, which I guess I won't go into here.  I regard essentially everything - nature audio recordings, massage, etc - billed on those merits with extreme skepticism.Proteus is in a different league.  A true meditative experience.  Also a rumination on aloneness and what it means, which is very close to the core thing I need to come to terms with in my own life, so it's really wonderful to play.The visuals are already really beautiful, but the audio takes it above and beyond.  I played around with it for about half an hour and found a bunch of stuff, but not everything, according to the forums.  I'll probably go back another day - this is strong stuff, and I can't do too much at once! - but it would have easily been worth the $10 even for the one session.Thank you.			"

												Proteus is art, but it is not a game. If you like the concept of intrigue and immersion while walking around a funny little island, then get this game.That being said, if you're looking for a point, steer clear because there is none. All you do is walk around looking at trees, creatures, and monoliths. There isn't an ending, and it doesn't really qualify as a game. It's artsy, so if you're like me and you're looking for direction or things to do, you don't want this kind of limited experience.I recommend it because while I didn't particularly gel with the purpose of Proteus, I can appreciate the purpose and the time spent creating it; hell, each island is randomly generated which has gotta be worth something. That said, though, 10 bucks is a bit much. If the price drops to say, 5 dollars, or less, I would say give it a try. 5 bucks is the price of a hamburger. Really not a total loss, even if you didn't fully enjoy the game.			"

												Although I don't entirely agree with the price, it is a relaxing game to listen to, sometimes I hop on the game just to hear a certain song in one of the seasons but I dont know if it should be called a game more that a mere visual novelty. I guess you just have to be into this sort of thing. I would only recommened it to individuals that are fans of the music genre thats in the game.			"

When you open the game it puts you into a procedually generated island so it's a unique experience each time and I still find something new almost everytime that I play it. I is verry calming and has an unexpected "" Ending "" to it. I love this game and just being able to come in and relax exploring the island is a great thing. I can say that this is not a game for everybody and you should think about buying it before you invest in it.			"

												This is a game where you are shown things. You walk about actively but the enviroment is different consistently giving you different sounds for every feature in the enviroment resulting in a beautiful journey meets minecraft style experience. I highly recommend this for anyone who looks for deep meanings in everything, since you can sort of make up a story for your island as you experience it, or perhaps that's just me. All the same I say give it a shot while it's 2 bucks!			"

												Pixels, art, exploration, seasons, and relaxation are what make up Proteus. In this game your thrown out in a area of water and have to ""swim"" to shore. More like move to it. Anyways, once you get on the island there are many sights to see. Jumping um... frogs, crabs, little weird plant people that get scared then pop back up, seasons, structures, twinkly star shiny orby things (most of the stuff I just really can't tell what it should be called), all sorts of wonderous trees, and at the end a wonderful light show (the game's depiction of the aurora borealis). It has wonderful music to go along with the game's many sights. I truly enjoyed the game despite a short playthrough time and I would say average replay value unless you want to discover every little detail of the island generation which I personally wish to do sometime soon. Overall the game may take 45 minutes to two hours depending how long you spend in each season. The 10 USD (~7 EURO) price tag is a little large for this game, so I would wait for a sale like I did so you can get Proteus for a fifth of that price. To sum it all up, Proteus is a great island exploration simulation with wonderful music and sights that would be best to buy during a sale.			"

												The question isn't whether this is a game or not but whether you enjoy Proteus or not. For me I can say I enjoyed it. Why? Because Proteus isn't just about exploring some island and getting nothing from it. Proteus delivers a very wonderful experience without all the fancy bits. Some nice features include; each time you start a new island it is different, there are 4 seasons to explore plus day and night for each and depending on the circumstances you will experience different events, the music is beautiful and helps to evoke certain feelings in the player and there is a goal to this game, it's not a big, major, spoiler-inducing one but it's there. The experience is difficult to describe to anyone who hasn't played this yet but, it's an experience that will make you want to come back to Proteus over and over. I'm not saying this is everyone's cup of tea, especially to the high octane guzzling, bacon devouring man beasts who crave the newest, shiniest, va-va vroomiest game to date and on that note this game also isn't exclusive to the interests of the salad nibbling hipster, indie, artsy fartsy kids who are ""2deep4u"".

												It's pretty difficult to say this is a 'game' at all, as it's basically just a painting, and your only way of interacting with things is walking. It's a nice little aside, and I've spent roughly half an hour walking around it breathing it in with its lovely graphics and blipping noises, and trying to uncover strange secrets (there are a few, but all they do is affect the behaviour of the environment basically). If you can get this as part of a humble bundle as I did or something similarly cheap, then I would recommend it as something to check out, it's something different. However, I doubt most people would enjoy it with it lacking much to actually actively do in it, and I wouldn't be happy with it if I'd spent much money on it, so I'm not going to recommend it from that standpoint.

												Kind of like a 320x200 video game rendering of ""Koyaanisqatsi."" Not just because its primary appeal is its visuals, but also because of its pretty neat, procedurally generated, Phillip Glass-esque score. The primary mechanic is exploration and the combination of the audio and visuals make it play more like a sort of extended tone poem than a ""game,"" but there are interactive elements and new things to see and discover on different playthroughs. Not sure if there's enough there to warrant many play throughs, but it is incredibly....relaxing. Its cumulative effect is a bit like popping a couple valium and listening to one of those self-hypnosis relaxation tapes (which wouldn't be a compliment if referring to most games, but in Proteus' case it is). In fact, it's so relaxing that I kind of find the demand to control it to be a bit of an impediment at times. Someone needs to make an ""auto-wander"" mod for it so I could turn it on and veg out when I'm stressed or just fall asleep to it.			"

												Commenting on a game like this almost requires someone with a proper sense of poetry, because artful words are necessary to communicate the experience.  Proteus isn't a ""game"" in any sense of the word but rather a literal experience to discover and explore.  To that end I encourage you to play this in a manner which best allows you to immerse yourself and let Proteus BE your world for a little while.  Play in the dark with headphones on and toss out your preconceived ideas for what you should see and do.  If you can approach Proteus in this way you'll find a tangible sense of wonder and intrigue as you are presented with details that are both familiar (land, trees, mountains) and unfamiliar like pixel presentations that alter your perception of what's normal along with an everpresent sense of music and interplay as your participation in the world changes the experience.  There are sights and things here to capture your imagination if you spend the time to take the world on its own terms.  With that being said Proteus is rather short and repetitive.  The whole world is procedurally generated which in theory means that every time you play you'll be greeted with an entirely different island than you ever visited before, but there are certain rules about the lay of the land which remain consistent and so the wonderful sense of new discovery can fade over repeated plays.  This doesn't diminish the enjoyment of the game any more than repeated trips to your favorite campground at a national park can make you tired of going back, but one of the primary appeals is that sense of discovery where you're confronted with a world that's simultaneously familiar but alien. ...so despite playing the game several times now I still feel like there's more yet I haven't found.  I'll come back again.			"

												Let's get one thing straight from the beginning - Proteus isn't a game. It's an experience. It combines two elements - sound and vision - to create a uniquely moving and personal experience as you roam a small island. You don't do anything. You explore your own personal world, one that teems with surprises. You won't forget the first time you walk through a creaking forest at night and an owl hoots at you form a nearby tree. Nor will you forget the first time you stepped atop a mountain. The first sunrise actually set the hairs on my arms on end.It's about exploring what Proteus has to offer with your eyes and ears. Both sounds and sights are simultaneously abstract and magnificent, drawing the traveller deeper in. You could find yourself chasing a bunny for the strong notes it creates versus a melodic background, or simply sitting under a tree watching a sunset, admiring the view and ambience.As I said, Proteus is an experience - if you don't give it the time it deserves, you won't feel it as you should, you won't be drawn in as the developers intended. If you want instant gratification, go play CoD. But if you want something a little deeper, a little more personal, something that isn't all about the numbers, give Proteus a try.Starman			"

												Picked up Proteus when it was on sell recently for 2 dollars. I didn't know what to expect with this game, and honestly that is a good thing. I recommend this game to anyone who doesn't have any expectations of it. Confused? Well let me explain. Proteus is a game about exploring and experiencing an island. It gets a tiny bit more complicated and it's not the same experience every time, but that is pretty much it. It is one of those games where the journey is more rewarding than the end. I did like the game though, so honestly if you can catch it on sale and would just like a nice, friendly, relaxing game to poke around at this is one I'd say to give it a go. It's cute, fun, whimsical, and just a nice way to relax.			"

												In short: This is what happens if minecraft swallowed windows Paint and replaced combat and building with dynamic sound and visuals. I don't think it is bad, just different. Look, let's not B.S ourselves this is very much an ""art"" game in the style of Journey and Brothers: A tale of two sons. There's no enemies to fight and your goal is just to mess about. It's meant to be a meditation piece as something you do to relax and want to see pretty colors. I remember I kept thinking how much it reminds me of minecraft for obvious reasons, but like the afformentioned games it can be really beautiful to sit by the large tree on autumn night and see the fox peering at you curiously. Proteus builds itself on little moments. I can imagine this being an excercise for buddhists, because it really shows how we break down when we have no objective or goal to reach. Where you simply sit and appriciate the world and it's beauty.I sound like a hippie, but the simple truth is you need to be in the right mindset. I came to play this after some darker themed games like Dishonored and Papers, Please and I felt it a nice change of scenery. Honestly the game shouldn't take you more than 90 minutes to see everything.Don't expect something new and innovative with this game. It's a boring at times and it's easy to get lost and not understand what you are doing. In that fact there is a beauty though, because it forces you to use your imagination like retro games did. If you have and open mind and are in the mood for something upbeat, simple, and fairly pretentious I recommend it. You might be suprised when you start noticing themes like life death and change, that standards themes of ""art games"", but done uniquely enough to be interesting. p.s  I WISH THERE WAS A RUN FUNCTION OMG<ASDFHFGasnduivonajwkdbnfuilawdsivblYIWL... *sigh*			"

												I remember buying this on a whim and man oh man, was it worth every dollar I spent. You begin in the water close to an island where you are greated with cheeping birds and croaking frogs, among all sorts of other wildlife, in the beginning of Spring. Your task is simple: Explore the world and find its treasures, and move through the seasons as the environment changes from happy and cheery to overcast, still environment. If you want a game you can play to relax  with, give Proteus a try.			"

												Proteus is, in my opinion, the most beautiful game I have ever played. It's a quiet game about exploring and experiencing an unknown world. In this world, you are rewarded for your curiosity--but not in the ""bonus points"" and ""level up"" sort of reward. Instead, your reward for what you discover is the very witnessing of what you've uncovered. The world is fully immersive if you let it be--immaculately gorgeous and warmly sonorous. Proteus is a game that asks for your wonder. If you give it, you will experience something both comfortably familiar and excitingly new.			"

The music accompanying the world is beautiful as well.

												The world and creatures are a synthesizer where you walk determines your ambient musical experience. Syncopated rhythms and a symphony of sounds aids you on your slow and beautiful journey. It's one of those few games that really makes you appreciate nature and just how creative the gaming industry has become. It's a very short game, but the ending sequence left me with a sense of satisfaction, relaxation, and newfound love of and appreciation of nature and music.The only thing I would suggest is not playing this on laptop speakers, or integrated speakers that are found within monitors. This game deserves, and in my opinion, requires some closed-ear headphones or a great speaker system. "

												This game's very design--from the curious yet delightful sounds, soft and pleasant colors, and soul-quelling music, to the way the player's screen enters and exits the game like eyes slowly opening and closing--is meant to be strongly reminiscent of a dream; a beautiful, subjective dream. A dream where the more you get lost within, the more you get lost within your own thoughts. Abandon the day-to-day burdens of goals, duties, tasks, competition, opposition, and reward--the values that our workaholic, robotic, and disconnected society holds so dear. Abandon those--just for a few moments, and take the time to bask yourself into consciousness within another plane. Take the time to simply... be.			"

Like the whole thing is more than a casual musical adventure.  It hints at a giant allegory that is wants you to figure out.  A playthrough is about 30 minutes.  I was almost bored in Summer, but Fall and Winter were shorter and very interesting.   I would highly recommend that if you get tired of it early to at least press on to one playthrough as my whole perception changed in winter.This is very much an artistic work.I will have to play this again.

												It's very important to keep in mind that Proteus is not a game. It is a relaxation toy. It's Dear Esther without the story or the dialogue or the 3D graphics -- that is to say, you walk around an island. You can change the season you're in by stepping into a swirling halo of lights; after you do that, you're basically done with Proteus.If you have a setup that can really immerse you -- a large screen and good speakers, for instance -- Proteus is a great way to come home after a hard day of thinking and just relax.

												It's not really a game so much as it is an adventure. It's not meant to be played, it's meant to be explored. This game can only be fun if you take it with an open mind. Absorb the surroundings, see what things make what sounds. The point is to feel like a child exploring the forest. See something interesting? walk towards it. Found a circle of totem poles? Try and find out if they do something. Herd of pink chickens? Chase them! Sure, the graphics do take away from the experience (I think if it had mor realistic graphics I'd feel more inclined to explore), but it's an experience all the same. Also, play more than once. More things seem to appear the more you often you play.I find it to be overpriced, I reccomend if on sale.			"

												I highly recommend this for people who simply enjoy an experience. This artful ""game"" is a sensory goldmine. Headphones highly suggested. Sound is REQUIRED. The purpose of this game is to experience the sights and sounds as you simply walk on the island. There is no real interaction, merely pure observation. The simple graphics and soundscape add a truly trippy atmosphere to melt in and relax. The little things matter in this game. If you allow yourself to immerse in this abstract and surreal world, you will leave the game in a more peaceful state of mind after the experience.			"

												Proteus isn't a ""game"" as noted in many other reviews. It's an exploration through 4 seasons on a procedurally generated island. While this in itself isn't a bad thing, there simply isn't enough to see to justify buying it. If it were an early access game or some sort of tech demo or something, I'd say give it a shot if you're bored. But your money would be much better spent on another game. If you want to do some exploring, go down to a local park. There'll be much more to see than Proteus has to offer.			"

												I had just finished a stressful match of League of Legends and I decided that I needed to take a breather, so I loaded up Steam and remembered I had just bought this game as apart of a Humble Bundle. Figuring that it could be good, I installed it, put on my headphones, and dove in. Waking up waist deep in the pixelated ocean, I was immersed in a simple yet utterly beautiful world. I watched day turn to night and night turn to day. There were no goals, nor any rules of what I had to do. I walked around an island, listening to the world. I climbed a mountain and heard the sea wind blowing. I walked into the rain and heard a gentle drizzle land on the nearby trees. As I played-- no, not played. As I experienced Proteus, I felt my muscles relieve themselves, and even now do I feel utterly calm. I can't explain this game, because it's not a game. Walking through Proteus was a reminder that the world is beautiful, and all we have to do is take time to see it.			"

Better off watching the trailer or getting it in a bundle.There is no gameplay here; the only function is just wandering around a generated environment and occasionally bumping into or chasing things that make noises when doing so.

												Proteus is less a game and more an experience, but it is surely a grand one. If you can play it with an open mind, not getting hung up on the fact that there are virtually no objectives, you will have a wonderful experience. If you play games merely for the difficulty, thrill, or highscores, this is not the game for you. Being a game of exploration, Proteus will obviously be the best during its first playthrough. I recommend playing when it's dark so you can turn out all the lights, wear headphones, and get immersed in this quirky world of sounds and creatures. It is truly a unique and pleasurable experience. I have even played Proteus as a means to relieve stress, and it works. This game is well worth the $10 price tag.			"

												I've been trying to think of a way to review this since I got it in a humble bundle a while back, but, even now, I'm not sure I quite get this game.The game is pretty simple, you just walk around and observe. The map is procedurally generated, but I couldn't really tell because it all felt samey. As I played it, I wasn't exactly sure what to do. So, I must say that maybe this game isn't just meant for me. I'm fine just walking around in either Skyrim or Minecraft, just observing, so long as I am choosing to do that and can stop doing that at any time. This game is literally just looking around, watching how the environment interacts with the player.I can't recommend this game for $9.99, but it's worth checking out if it's on a pretty big sale and you're interested in an interactive art gallery. Don't buy this expecting anything more than pretty, pixelated scenery.			"

												The only game that I've ever played with the sole intention of chilling out. People have called it a walking simulator, but it's more of a wandering simulator. You stroll around and look at low-fi pixel art landscapes. There's dynamic music and you can just sort of play around for a bit discovering things in a randomized world.			"

												I got this on sale for $2.  While I wouldn't have spent $10 on it, there's no remorse in purchasing this game for less than the cost of a large bag of chips.  It's also about 90MB, which meant it was playable within minutes, and isn't taking up a huge amount of space on my machine.  I can keep it there and come back to it from time to time with no guilt.Now, from someone who DID NOT enjoy Dear Esther, I do like this.  It's fun to just walk around.  Laugh because I made the little square bees angry, or something.  Unlike Dear Esther, which has lofty, pretentious aims, this is just there to let you relax, and doesn't pretend to be anything more.  It's the squishy stress ball of games.  At no point will you be stuck on x area, looking for some stupid bauble, or trying to get the game to trigger an event by doing the right hoohah dance, or whatever.  Grab it while it's $2, and play it when you're too stressed to even handle conventional game play.  (You KNOW that happens.)			"

After my first playthrough at around 45 minutes, I was absolutely positive that not a single cent was wasted.Really, it's like walking around in a dream with lo-fi graphics.The game is very simple, both in concept and graphics. It's a game I will play from time to time, to relax, or to just be amazed for an hour or so. There's always something new to see, and it's always just as intoxicating.I recommend you buy Proteus and support the hard-working developers. It's one of the most charming walks in recent memory.

												who signed off on this? this is the type of game you show to your uncle after your  aunt (his wife) has just passed away. although the funeral isn't till thursday, he insists on staying over three nights prior (monday), and just by consequence of his very existence, you become desperate to show your extracurricular activities are not damaging. ""what exactly is this?"", he asks between sobs. you slide the headphones over his ears. ""why it's a procedurally-generated landscape of terrible textures and audio trigger points, that lacks any intrigue, and in which nothing at all happens."" he sighs, plays it for FIVE freakin' hours. you sleep downstairs with the un-killable cat; cursing the plan, the game, your aunt (his wife), the whole world.post: i would like to add that the concept is a lovely one, it's just the execution that is lacking. i feel as though an experience like this should have some semblance of longetivity. for me at least, it didn't. one set of rolling hills blended into the other and any sense of discovery soon disappeared.

												To the game's credit, it has very nice ambient sound/music. It adds additional little notes and melodies that play depending what you're looking at or near and what's happening, and that part is very nicely done. All in all though, I found this game a bit of a let down. The environments are too repetetive to make exploration a very rich experience for more than the first couple minutes, and the game itself is over very quickly. I finished it without feeling like I had explored much of anything, without feeling like I had felt deeply relaxed or enjoyed any beautiful scenery, without feeling like anything interesitng had been communicated to me via sublte symbolism - more or less feeling like I'd barely played a game at all. I feel like the use of audio in this game shows a lot of creativity and potential, but unfortunately there's not much else to see here. I'm afraid I've got to agree with the reviews saying you've basically played the game by watching the trailer.			"

												2015 edition, Might make you smile and cry. Depends how much you read into it I guess. Had a review for this title once, felt it was too childish as it was, but it came from the feeling the game gave me. Now I'm writing a short one again as I finish the game a second time. I did not live to see the aurora this time...It's a brief walk on a small island. Four different seasons to see and listen. Until the end. That's it. For some it's just that and bit boring. For me. It's like watching the Snowman cartoon as a child  for the first time during christmas time. It's like stepping into the forest of Mononoke Hime for a brief moment or strolling in the woods of Mushishi. The visuals, music and sound in complete control of my mood. It's pretty hard to rate or explain stuff like that. Obviously things like this won't work always like charm, but it did twice for me.I just wish someone could take stuff like this and put it into a longer and more complete package.			"

												Deep within the shadow of a memory of a dream you once had, you recall an island, familiar to you and yet foreign. Awakening offshore you stumble onto the beach, the light of a Spring sun above you. All about you is music of your making, a strange beautiful melody crafted merely by your presence here. The notes drift through the air, tumble through the leaves of the trees and blow wistfully through the grass with the wind.As night falls, you walk among fireflies, following a trail of standing stones that hum and mumble as you touch them. With the moon high above, you find a ring of the mumbling stones, and inside the warm light of the fireflies dances in a circle with your tune... the world begins to change...10/10 would do shrooms again. Also Proteus is a great game.			"

												Thought I would try one  of these ""artsy/poetic"" games. Thought it would be interesting, but it was pretty boring.  The main screen left me a little confused on how to even start playing. Thought I had to hit the title screen but it was apparentlly the image (you can interact with pretty much everything on the main screen.) I get it is supposed to be some walk and enjoy the scenery game, but the art style just didn't do it for me. Just blocky trees and mountains and I guess things supposed be animals like baby chicks. The music in the beginning sounded like some weird alien sci-fi-esque tune, Later on it sounded okay.  Either way, felt the music choice didn't really fit the walking around.  The only slightly amusing thing I guess was the little bouncing characters(which when I followed seemed to lead me to the water?) but that's about it. There's is no set place to go, just walk around and explore the one island, where everything looks very similar but in maybe two different colours.If you like an interactive screensaver or want something soothing before you go to sleep, check it out.

												A strange, but beautiful game that does what it sets out to do. Create a vibrant atmosphere. You will have some fun with discovering the randomly generated worlds and find new things you can do. However, it is a limited experience and you should not count on spending more than 30 minutes or so in the game to get your fill for some time. Sadly, I cannot be certain you will get your money’s worth out it, as it is priced way too high compared to the experience you get.I was quite satisfied with it, but I did also use it for a study project, so my estimate of the time you can use playing it is accurate. As such, I cannot recommend it at the price, but get it on a 75% sale or so and you will definitely find some enjoyment. If nothing else, it is a very relaxing little game.			"

												Number one; this is an intensely buggy game. All it did for the first few months of my owning it was crash almost immediately when it was opened. It was only through some vague whim that I happened to try and load it again ages after purchasing it.While I fear I will be accused of missing the point, I must admit to finding Proteus utterly pointless. It is less a game, than a screen-saver and must be regarded as unfinished, laziness, as opposed to avant-garde, 'higher-meaning', indie game. Not all games need a crude starting line and a goal, but they need something more than the Emeperors Clothes that this game is evidently adorned in. Proteus is a meandering and ultimately unnecessary experience for anyone to have. It's only use might be to gently ease people back into society after some horrible, drug-addled. breakdown, but it's certainly not as a videogame. When you finally exit Proteus, the pixels make for an eye-closing animation; but my real eyes had already done that long ago. It was like a trip to the shops, only with less to show for it; I could have got a pint of milk during all of that pointlessness.			"

												To start I would like to say that I love indie gaming and am not one of those individuals who feels you truly have to define ""what a game"" is by scores, or quests. However the trend may have been taken to far with proteus. This is one of those games that is just supposed to lull you to sleep with its calming environments and harmonious sounds, which I can dig. I mean Flower really got the genre off the ground doing the same thing. Proteus is not Flower. It costs the same. But is nothing close to Flower.Proteus as a whole feels empty to me. It starts of for the first minute as this lush world of beauty and quickly diminishes once you realize that it doesnt go any where from there. The sounds and views wont change at all from what you first see wandering onto the island and only get worse as the seasons pass. Fall and Winter are actually depressing in this depiction. The sounds themselves actually made me more annoyed than anything being high pitched as they were with that 8-bit midi style the game tries to make its own. And even the navigation is empty and lazy you essentially no-clip with gravity the whole time. You will never feel as though you are walking or are an entity at all except when creatures run from you and weather you are swimming, going up or down hill, or running in a grotto your speed will not change.This lazy half an hour (at best) experience feels as though the developer is screaming at me to appriciate thier work and I feel I could if I weren't asked to cough up 10 bucks for it when games like Cloud are being offered for free by other developers. If you are looking to take some pretty screenshots to make some nice 8-bit wallpapers then maybe this is for you. If you are looking to kick back and relax in an exploratory game then I can definitely recommend something better with a cheaper price tag if not for free.			"

												This is probably the simplest of the world exploration games and the calmest.There is a randomised island creation with a list of distinct landmarks. Music and sound in this are produced by the locale. The purpose is to wander around in a state of calm noticing things.			"

												It lacks any gameplay except for walking around with sounds playing in the background. The graphics are atari 2600 level of♥♥♥♥♥♥and the soundtrack is just annoying.For me to consider something a game it must have an objective and you have to be able to fail that objective. The objective with this game is getting to winter. And you cant fail that if you just play the game. That makes proteus a visual installation, not a game.Its really boring, go spend your money on a game instead.(I guess this is a good thing to interact with if you are high as ♥♥♥♥.

A trip taking you to a weird, mysterious place and leaves you alone with it - no enemies, no directions, no story. It's about exploring the world shown to you and trying to make sense of it. You'll find amusing, puzzling and even sad things here, but  that's all up to you.			"

												I like exploration in games as much as the next guy, but I think this ine takes it a little too far.  Games like Minecraft and Terraria offer a great deal to do as well as a great deal to discover, but this one has neither.  As far as I can tell, all there is to do is walk around.  I found some sort of frog/bug/thing that hops along a little faster than you can move, every once in a while slowing enough so that you think you just might catch it....but no.For the record, that was the most interesting thing to happen when playing this game.I did see an owl, quite a few trees, and some water, but there are more enjoyable real-life places I could hang out if that was what I wanted from a game.

												More than once I've heard ""at least Minecraft is more interactive."" Yes, that's true. There's no TNT or redstone or swords or enchantments or endermen here. In Minecraft, you own the world. Here, as in real life, you do not. It presents a peaceful experience of simply being in video game form. Think of it as a walk in an alternate-reality nature park. This game is not for everyone. And that's fine. Don't buy it if the above paragraph doesn't sound appealing, because this game is simply not for you. But I remember spending hours just enjoying the scenery in Myst and Riven back in the 90s, and Proteus activates the same brain centers. So I'm happy.			"

												Alright, if you thought Gone Home ""wasn't a game"" because it didn't involve shooting dudes in the face well you really won't like this one.  Proteus puts you on a procedurally-generated island, with graphics that will show off the horsepower of your new 386.   It's a vacation to a magic land of pixelated trees and wildlife, where fireflies dance in the woods at night and a circle of mysterious stones can take you to the next season - spring, summer, fall and winter all have different characters.  There's an ending of sorts, but the entire game is calm, slow, plotless, but graphically stunning in its low-resolution way. Certain vistas made me gasp or smile when I moved through them.  The music is also procedural, setting ambient electronic mood that matches perfectly with the visuals.  I like to just run it in the background to play the music.Proteus is digital antidepressant and well worth experiencing from time to time when you need to destress.NOTE: On Mac OS X, it took over a minute of black screen at the beginning before it came up - just be advised to wait without any kind of feedback before the title screen.  I had thought it had crashed several times before I waited.			"

With its peaceful soundtrack and beautiful world roaming the island will be the most peaceful 40 minutes you can possibly have. After finishing Proteus for the first time it can be rewarding to play through it again due to the island being different every time. All in all Proteus isn't for everyone since there are no objectives however after one plays a heavy session of a hardcore game one can relax with Proteus. Recommended			"

												It's nice. Honestly, its not really a 'game' in the usual sense. you dont win it or lose it, it doesnt end until you quit, theres no goal, not even in the Minecraft 'build a full sized replica of the USS Enterprise' meaning of the word. You just wander around an island and listen to it breathe, so to speak. And, I think, that's okay. It's colorful but not garish, and the modular soundtrack/ambient noise is pretty well done. It's a lot like a rock garden: there's no real 'why' to it, but you don't mind having it there.			"

If I start in windowed mode, the game starts up fine, I create a new world, and when I join for a brief few seconds the game works, then it drops to 1 frame and crashes. I have deleted and reinstalled 3 times, downloaded new drivers, done everything I can, but to no avail. So I wasted 10$ on a product that doesn't even work. From my experience I would not buy..Concept: Sounds unique and interesting but I cannot say from personal experience. N/AGraphics: Has a nice look to the game, and everything looks full of life. N/ASound: Soundtrack is very up beat and cute. N/APlayability: Well the simple fact that the game cannot even start says a lot... N/AEntertainment: From what i've seen, and heard, it looks very interesting. I unfortunately have not been able to even try it :( N/AReplay Value: LowOverall Score: N/AP.S: If I ever get the game to work, I will revise my review, until then, keep this as a personal warning.

												ProteusProteus is a very interesting piece of work. I don’t call it a game because it doesn’t fit into that category in any traditional sense. It’s less of a game and more of an experiment in musical exploration. After giving it a try for a few hours and seeing a bit of what it offers, I feel confident giving it a solid recommendation for those of you who are looking for something a little different. Allow me to explain why, and perhaps snag your interest.Proteus begins simply; you open your eyes. You find yourself standing waist deep in the ocean, and can just make out an island off in the distance in front of you. Naturally, you will make your way towards it. Upon reaching the island, it becomes clear that there are some key differences between Proteus and other games. For starters, there is no music until you reach the island. Once you arrive and the music starts to play, you are in for a treat. It is all generated procedurally by what is around you. Frogs, toads, birds and even flowers all play their own notes as you move around and interact with each of them. These sounds combine to form very relaxing musical numbers. The soundtrack, as a result, is a fascinating part of the game. It is in part created by you, the player, and thus becomes a form of gameplay by itself. It’s a brilliant idea put into great use by the developers.So how about the rest of the gameplay then? It’s equally strange. Upon setting foot on the island, you are left entirely to your own devices. At no point do you ever see text, receive an objective, or have a designated goal handed to you. You are entirely on your own. And that’s exactly how it should be. Explore, find hidden little secrets and tidbits and write your own story! When you are prepared to quit, you don’t simply press escape and use a menu to quit. Instead you hold down the escape key, and your eyes begin to close. Quitting is represented as returning to sleep. When you’re ready to play again, you once more open your eyes and find yourself standing waist deep in water, with an entirely new, procedurally generated island waiting for you in the distance. Each new game is a new day, a new world, and a new opportunity for discovery.I personally came away from Proteus filled with wonder, and far more relaxed than when I went in. It is almost meditative rather than being tense and stressful. For anyone with an open mind looking to try something new, Proteus is a fantastic and beautiful way to relax and pass the time. There’s nothing else quite like it on the market. The most closely related comparison would come from last year’s Playstation 3 exclusive title, Journey, by ThatGameCompany, and that is a glowing comparison to a fantastic game. Proteus is a great little title in a sea of big-budget blockbusters, and should not be overlooked. Give it a shot, you may find yourself pleasantly surprised. "

												Glorious ""game"" this. Probably best enjoyed when not sober.  Even if you only play it once - you owe it to yourself to experience this if you're into games like Flower or Journey. Games that are based on beauty rather than deep gameplay. These games tend to lodge themselves as memories in your mind grapes.  Not a game for those who can't justify short games or those who get butthurt that games like Gone Home are even called games. This is ""one of those games"", and I want many many more.			"

												I am very conflicted by this game. There are really, a lot of redeaming qualities, and I often do like exploration based gameplay, it's just that there's not a lot to see here.What there is to see is nice. I love the art direction, the world is just flat out breathtaking. So much life is made through a very simple ""8-bit-esc"" art style. Despite there being not much life on the island (there is some), it just feels very full and vibrant. The sound design tops the visuals though with just a beautiful ""8-bit-esc"" ambiance and sound effects. The problem I have with suggesting this game though is that not everyone in the world is a fan of what is essentially virtual tourism. You see great sights and hear very pleasent noises, but that's it. If anything, it is more like a painting with a soundtrack which you can walk through, which is not an inheriently bad idea. I would feel better about this game if there was more honestly, but despite random generation of the island, it doesn't offer much variety. Luckily I got it for $2, which feels like the perfect price to me.But for the $10 price, I would not reccomend it. While I'm sure the creator worked hard on the game, there is not enough content to warrent the price tag. But hey, it's better than Dear Esther. I personally enjoyed Proteus for what it was but I just can't tell you to go buy it.			"

												Another reviewer referred to this, perhaps derisively, as ""an interactive screensaver,"" and I think it is a reasonable description. However, I enjoy Proteus, and I think it has a nice experience to offer. It is calming, and really doesn't require much in the way of input or interaction. I feel like this is a great thing to throw on before bed, or to take a break and clear your head.In many ways it reminds me of the Katamari games, minus the annoying Japanese pop music and frenetic gameplay; the 'world' of Proteus could easily be a level on Katamari. Interesting, and serves a niche purpose fairly well. Verdict: [ 6 / 10 ]			"

												People will argue whether or not Proteus is in fact a game, One of which you simply explore an island as music is procedurely generated based on your surroundings and presence. Sometimes I can't decide whether it is a game. At best I've sort of come to this conclusion...Its a moment in time that you remember.Playing Proteus for the first time envoked memories of my first moments of Minecraft. Back when it was a far simpler game. Vivid thoughts of me wading out of the water to a small peninsula to start building a shelter, Those scary nights hearing the growls and hisses of the mobs as I hid in my underground dwelling. Than meekly venturing out during the day; scaling a small hill by my house, assuming I was only on an island and expecting to see the shoreline, than being confronting by endless lands. Its that lasting realization that your a small thing a large, large world that sticks with you.Proteus is exactly like that, little moments of things and occurances you merely stumble upon that accumulate into something you'll is instilled into your memory and stay with you.

												Introducing: Hold ""w"" and Pretend To Be Immersed in this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Minecraft Wanna-Be World: The (not) Game!I tried really hard to enjoy this game the way it advertised itself as. I really did, I put in effort to try and be immersed.

												I had just finished a stressful match of League of Legends and I decided that I needed to take a breather, so I loaded up Steam and remembered I had just bought this game as apart of a Humble Bundle. Figuring that it could be good, I installed it, put on my headphones, and dove in. Waking up waist deep in the pixelated ocean, I was immersed in a simple yet utterly beautiful world. I watched day turn to night and night turn to day. There were no goals, nor any rules of what I had to do. I walked around an island, listening to the world. I climbed a mountain and heard the sea wind blowing. I walked into the rain and heard a gentle drizzle land on the nearby trees. As I played-- no, not played. As I experienced Proteus, I felt my muscles relieve themselves, and even now do I feel utterly calm. I can't explain this game, because it's not a game. Walking through Proteus was a reminder that the world is beautiful, and all we have to do is take time to see it.			"

												Proteus is probably the best example to an abstract video game. There is no story to tell in this game, it is entirely what you make of it. With that being said, like abstract paintings (or other forms of art), it isn't for everyone. Some will enjoy it, some will say ""What's the point?"" It truely depends on the individual.			"

Interesting consept that makes 8bit music by affecting the 8bit enviromet you explore in the world they have made.  graphics are 8bit but the random music it makes keeps me puzzled. How. Good if you have a 5yr old that wants to play with your new PC. Good enough audio and visuals to keep them intrested and learning thw mouse and hand control. chasing things on the screen they will never catch. There is always something behind the next tree for them to chase. Very simple movment hold down left click to move forward and right for backwards. listen for music changes. Would be better if it played music that was a pleasure to listen to. More insterment options or band options.			"

												This game's very design--from the curious yet delightful sounds, soft and pleasant colors, and soul-quelling music, to the way the player's screen enters and exits the game like eyes slowly opening and closing--is meant to be strongly reminiscent of a dream; a beautiful, subjective dream. A dream where the more you get lost within, the more you get lost within your own thoughts. Abandon the day-to-day burdens of goals, duties, tasks, competition, opposition, and reward--the values that our workaholic, robotic, and disconnected society holds so dear. Abandon those--just for a few moments, and take the time to bask yourself into consciousness within another plane. Take the time to simply... be.			"

Like the whole thing is more than a casual musical adventure.  It hints at a giant allegory that is wants you to figure out.  A playthrough is about 30 minutes.  I was almost bored in Summer, but Fall and Winter were shorter and very interesting.   I would highly recommend that if you get tired of it early to at least press on to one playthrough as my whole perception changed in winter.This is very much an artistic work.I will have to play this again.

												Proteus. A great looking game with all of it's bright vibrant colours, amazing sounds and interesting landforms and animals. This game is good in that aspect but the downfalls can be obvious; expensive for what little it provides, no objective can make it a little boring, performance issues with non top of the line computers. These 3 things can ruin your experiance and can make you quit the game within 5 minutes. The game is beautiful to look at and and great to listen to. I would recommend this to casual gamers. People just looking for an experiance rather than an objective. I do give this more credit for being emotionally moving. If you have bought the game and havn't played it, playing it at night for the first time will improve your experience, with headphones and no interuptions also.So if you're rich and have a good computer, throw money at Proteus and give it a shot.

Since your only interaction with the world is the change of music according to your actions, that's were the ""game"" excells. It tells you everything you need to know in music. It's full of mysteries and secrets and just plain beauty.I highly recommend this experience to everyone who is interested in the capabilities of games as a medium.This something else, new.

												Proteus is, in my opinion, the most beautiful game I have ever played. It's a quiet game about exploring and experiencing an unknown world. In this world, you are rewarded for your curiosity--but not in the ""bonus points"" and ""level up"" sort of reward. Instead, your reward for what you discover is the very witnessing of what you've uncovered. The world is fully immersive if you let it be--immaculately gorgeous and warmly sonorous. Proteus is a game that asks for your wonder. If you give it, you will experience something both comfortably familiar and excitingly new.			"

I'd probably feel less than satisfied if I'd paid full price, but for just a couple bucks, it was worth it. It's not a game. It's interactive art, but there are some interesting things to discover as you explore.  I feel that this is the sort of thing that the minds behind Flower and Journey might have made had they been much more limited in budget. If you enjoy these sorts of experiences and you find it on sale, give it a go. If you're the sort of gamer who must always have stated goals, achievements, weapons and power-ups, move on. You'll be happier spending your money elsewhere.			"

												Alright, if you thought Gone Home ""wasn't a game"" because it didn't involve shooting dudes in the face well you really won't like this one.  Proteus puts you on a procedurally-generated island, with graphics that will show off the horsepower of your new 386.   It's a vacation to a magic land of pixelated trees and wildlife, where fireflies dance in the woods at night and a circle of mysterious stones can take you to the next season - spring, summer, fall and winter all have different characters.  There's an ending of sorts, but the entire game is calm, slow, plotless, but graphically stunning in its low-resolution way. Certain vistas made me gasp or smile when I moved through them.  The music is also procedural, setting ambient electronic mood that matches perfectly with the visuals.  I like to just run it in the background to play the music.Proteus is digital antidepressant and well worth experiencing from time to time when you need to destress.NOTE: On Mac OS X, it took over a minute of black screen at the beginning before it came up - just be advised to wait without any kind of feedback before the title screen.  I had thought it had crashed several times before I waited.			"

												There's something wonderfully meditative about Proteus. It may not qualify as a game in the traditional sense of the word, but exploring the randomly generated islands and taking in the charming and colourful pixelated vistas while listening to the soundtrack changing according to your path, is something special. It's not something you'll want to spend hours with at a time, but time does seem to fly while you play. It's a great little game to sit down with if you need to take a breather from more hectic action-packed games, or just from the stress of life in general. Thoroughly recommended.			"

												I've sat here today for not very long starting to explore Proteus and all it has to offer and though Ive been unwell with the flu it's made me feel relaxed. It's the sort of thing I wold recomend as a destress or a nwind activity after a long hard day. Wonderfully rich with places to see and fine it's ot laced with HD grathics or shoot this kill that type quests but that's part of it's charm. It has it's own very simple wonder about it self. So go for it and explore let your mind relax and discover what curiositys lay in wait in this lovely little game.			"

												Proteus is a wonderful, enlightening and curious example of what can be done with video games.  It's less a traditional game, and more of an experience.  One certainly worth experiencing.  Enjoy the wind blowing through spring time trees.  Marvel at the sun setting on a warm summer night.  Walk through a mist shrouded autumn landscape.  Watch snowflakes dance on the cool winter breeze.  Simply put, experience Proteus.			"

												The boundaries between what is a ""game"" and ""art"" are being more blurred, or revealed not to actually exist, more and more, and Proteus is a clear example of this. Clearly if you are solely into ""traditional"" game structure you will not really enjoy your experience because you will be trying to achieve something or wondering if you ""beat"" it. The game isn't going to give you that feedback; it won't pat you on the back or give you an achievement for interacting with a new creature or playing through multiple times because that is not the point of this game. The ""point"" is whatever the you want it to be; you are playing solely because you want to, there are not really many ulterior motives. The game creates an immersive atmosphere through visuals, audio, and minimal interactive elements, and it is up to you what you do with that. If you don't like it, don't play it. If you do, keep enjoying and exploring.I understand that this is an extremely polarizing game, but one thing that many people who negatively review it are missing is that they claim to have ""completed"" the game in 30 minutes, and are disappointed about not getting their ""bang for their buck."" But the problem is you can't ""complete"" Proteus. There is no built in goals or achievements.  Experiencing one cycle does not constitute anything really in terms of objective progress; everything you gain from your playtime is subjective, it is up to you what you gain (or if you gain anything) from your playtime.I'll admit $10 may be a bit pricy for this title, however it is entirely your decision to buy this and enough is known and has said about this game where you know what you're getting into if you are purchasing it. I personally loved the couple run throughs I have experienced and definitely plan on revisiting Proteus periodically. For me it is a beautiful little escape where everything is familiar yet new, and in just 30 minutes I am given a feeling of catharsis that I may not even be able to understand, but it feels beautiful every time.

												More than once I've heard ""at least Minecraft is more interactive."" Yes, that's true. There's no TNT or redstone or swords or enchantments or endermen here. In Minecraft, you own the world. Here, as in real life, you do not. It presents a peaceful experience of simply being in video game form. Think of it as a walk in an alternate-reality nature park. This game is not for everyone. And that's fine. Don't buy it if the above paragraph doesn't sound appealing, because this game is simply not for you. But I remember spending hours just enjoying the scenery in Myst and Riven back in the 90s, and Proteus activates the same brain centers. So I'm happy.			"

												This game is without a doubt absolutely magical. Sure, from a technical stand point, it is not that graphically impressive, but once you're in the game, and begin to experience all the wonders this has to offer, it will quickly no longer matter. This game invokes an almost child-like sense of discovery, something I haven't felt replicated in many other, if any. The adaptive/procedural musical score is also a massive plus for this. You're immersed not only in your discoveries, but in the ambience as well. It's somewhat difficult to call this a game, as there are no objectives or end goals, but it is still absolutely lovely nonetheless. Definitely recommended.			"

												Looks great, only problem is it won't work. If i start in fullscreen the game stays black and never changes. If I cntl-alt-delete, the menu music plays, but game freezes. If I start in windowed mode, the game starts up fine, I create a new world, and when I join for a brief few seconds the game works, then it drops to 1 frame and crashes. I have deleted and reinstalled 3 times, downloaded new drivers, done everything I can, but to no avail. So I wasted 10$ on a product that doesn't even work. From my experience I would not buy..Concept: Sounds unique and interesting but I cannot say from personal experience. N/AGraphics: Has a nice look to the game, and everything looks full of life. N/ASound: Soundtrack is very up beat and cute. N/APlayability: Well the simple fact that the game cannot even start says a lot... N/AEntertainment: From what i've seen, and heard, it looks very interesting. I unfortunately have not been able to even try it :( N/AReplay Value: LowOverall Score: N/AP.S: If I ever get the game to work, I will revise my review, until then, keep this as a personal warning.

												ProteusProteus is a very interesting piece of work. I don’t call it a game because it doesn’t fit into that category in any traditional sense. It’s less of a game and more of an experiment in musical exploration. After giving it a try for a few hours and seeing a bit of what it offers, I feel confident giving it a solid recommendation for those of you who are looking for something a little different. Allow me to explain why, and perhaps snag your interest.Proteus begins simply; you open your eyes. You find yourself standing waist deep in the ocean, and can just make out an island off in the distance in front of you. Naturally, you will make your way towards it. Upon reaching the island, it becomes clear that there are some key differences between Proteus and other games. For starters, there is no music until you reach the island. Once you arrive and the music starts to play, you are in for a treat. It is all generated procedurally by what is around you. Frogs, toads, birds and even flowers all play their own notes as you move around and interact with each of them. These sounds combine to form very relaxing musical numbers. The soundtrack, as a result, is a fascinating part of the game. It is in part created by you, the player, and thus becomes a form of gameplay by itself. It’s a brilliant idea put into great use by the developers.So how about the rest of the gameplay then? It’s equally strange. Upon setting foot on the island, you are left entirely to your own devices. At no point do you ever see text, receive an objective, or have a designated goal handed to you. You are entirely on your own. And that’s exactly how it should be. Explore, find hidden little secrets and tidbits and write your own story! When you are prepared to quit, you don’t simply press escape and use a menu to quit. Instead you hold down the escape key, and your eyes begin to close. Quitting is represented as returning to sleep. When you’re ready to play again, you once more open your eyes and find yourself standing waist deep in water, with an entirely new, procedurally generated island waiting for you in the distance. Each new game is a new day, a new world, and a new opportunity for discovery.I personally came away from Proteus filled with wonder, and far more relaxed than when I went in. It is almost meditative rather than being tense and stressful. For anyone with an open mind looking to try something new, Proteus is a fantastic and beautiful way to relax and pass the time. There’s nothing else quite like it on the market. The most closely related comparison would come from last year’s Playstation 3 exclusive title, Journey, by ThatGameCompany, and that is a glowing comparison to a fantastic game. Proteus is a great little title in a sea of big-budget blockbusters, and should not be overlooked. Give it a shot, you may find yourself pleasantly surprised. "

												I am very conflicted by this game. There are really, a lot of redeaming qualities, and I often do like exploration based gameplay, it's just that there's not a lot to see here.What there is to see is nice. I love the art direction, the world is just flat out breathtaking. So much life is made through a very simple ""8-bit-esc"" art style. Despite there being not much life on the island (there is some), it just feels very full and vibrant. The sound design tops the visuals though with just a beautiful ""8-bit-esc"" ambiance and sound effects. The problem I have with suggesting this game though is that not everyone in the world is a fan of what is essentially virtual tourism. You see great sights and hear very pleasent noises, but that's it. If anything, it is more like a painting with a soundtrack which you can walk through, which is not an inheriently bad idea. I would feel better about this game if there was more honestly, but despite random generation of the island, it doesn't offer much variety. Luckily I got it for $2, which feels like the perfect price to me.But for the $10 price, I would not reccomend it. While I'm sure the creator worked hard on the game, there is not enough content to warrent the price tag. But hey, it's better than Dear Esther. I personally enjoyed Proteus for what it was but I just can't tell you to go buy it.			"

												I don't get it.  I don't even really like it. It's garish, noisy and there's no real point.Exploration gets dull quickly, and the graphics are bad to the point of wondering if I'd somehow accidentally plugged in an Atari 2600 instead of a PC.However... my 4yr old loves it to BITS, and will happily follow a frog (I assume it's a frog) around for ages, or run from tree to tree listening to the music change... or climb a mountain to look at the ""scary statues"".  She adores the weather changes, the light changes, the way the stars move, and... well, all of it.So... if you're a grown-up... well, each to their own. I'd recommend having a damn good look at a Let's Play video on YouTube before spending money on this one... but if you're wanting to find something totally harmless (eg: No monsters, zombies, frights or swearing) exploration game for your carpet monkeys, it's actually pretty good... and the reason I will recommend this game.

												Amazing. Absolutely fantastic. It's relaxing, it's beautiful, and it made me smile with glee on more than one occasion. The music is wonderfully done, and the way every single thing in the area changes it makes it amazing and so it never gets boring. There are small creatures to interact with, that are cute  and have sound that meshes so perfectly with the music from your surroundings, and it's nice to have something that doesn't involve killing and that has no dark storyline.

												Proteus isn't a ""game"" as noted in many other reviews. It's an exploration through 4 seasons on a procedurally generated island. While this in itself isn't a bad thing, there simply isn't enough to see to justify buying it. If it were an early access game or some sort of tech demo or something, I'd say give it a shot if you're bored. But your money would be much better spent on another game. If you want to do some exploring, go down to a local park. There'll be much more to see than Proteus has to offer.			"

												Proteus is the most casual and relaxing game I've ever experienced. The sound track is tailored to your experience and what is happening in the world around you making it pleasing to listen to. The art style is fun to admire and if you play through enough times you'll experience many new creatures, objects, and events throughout the island. However, it isn't worth $10 to me due to the small amount of hours I found myself investing in it. If you want a unique game bound to soothe the soul, go for it. Definitely grab it if it goes on sale.			"

												My initial opinion of this game was that it is boring and pointless... actually, that's still my opinion of the game. The experience is more like an interactive screensaver. There are no action buttons, no sprinting, no jumping and no death. You simply walk around and enjoy the ambience. There are no goals or objectives other than the ones you set for yourself. Even those were simple tasks such as, make it to the top of that mountain, chase the squirrel, or try to find that tree that played bagpipes. I owe my positive opinion of the game to a gameplay review that I was attempting to record. After several takes, the environment started to grow on me. It was amazing how long I found myself wandering around while still trying to make myself hate it. This is not for everyone, but I see the appeal now. While this is not a must buy or must play, the experience is unique and enjoyable.			"

												This isn't a game for everyone.And you'll know right off the bat whether you'll like it or not.Consider this game to be a holiday location in the video game realm, it is a place where the digital generation can unwind after a hard day's work killing zombies and setting up trade routes across the galaxy.A pure, filtering of the basic exploration and discovery mechanic, and everything else has been stripped out.Wait for everyone to go to bed, hole up in your room, turn out the lights and turn off the internet, put on your headphones, and explore the island that's been willed into existence just for you. The first five minutes might seem a bit odd, you'll be expecting something to attack you, or  for some puzzle to bar your way to the next area, but when you understand that this is a safe and free place for you, you will understand that we live in a beautiful world, and that it is yours to explore and experience.

												This is an incredible experience.I am not usually one for things billed as ""relaxation"".  I literally cannot count to ten for the purpose of relaxing my mind; the attempt triggers very unpleasant memories for me, which I guess I won't go into here.  I regard essentially everything - nature audio recordings, massage, etc - billed on those merits with extreme skepticism.Proteus is in a different league.  A true meditative experience.  Also a rumination on aloneness and what it means, which is very close to the core thing I need to come to terms with in my own life, so it's really wonderful to play.The visuals are already really beautiful, but the audio takes it above and beyond.  I played around with it for about half an hour and found a bunch of stuff, but not everything, according to the forums.  I'll probably go back another day - this is strong stuff, and I can't do too much at once! - but it would have easily been worth the $10 even for the one session.Thank you.			"

												Proteus is art, but it is not a game. If you like the concept of intrigue and immersion while walking around a funny little island, then get this game.That being said, if you're looking for a point, steer clear because there is none. All you do is walk around looking at trees, creatures, and monoliths. There isn't an ending, and it doesn't really qualify as a game. It's artsy, so if you're like me and you're looking for direction or things to do, you don't want this kind of limited experience.I recommend it because while I didn't particularly gel with the purpose of Proteus, I can appreciate the purpose and the time spent creating it; hell, each island is randomly generated which has gotta be worth something. That said, though, 10 bucks is a bit much. If the price drops to say, 5 dollars, or less, I would say give it a try. 5 bucks is the price of a hamburger. Really not a total loss, even if you didn't fully enjoy the game.			"

												This game is technically interesting, and worth an hour of your time, but little more.  In Proteus you find yoruself on an island and are never given any objective, though at verious points you discover ""events"" which are obviously your progression to the next section of the game.  The game is very relaxing, and the art is peculiar but also pleaseing.  ITs a work of art, but, unless you can play an almost aimless game and enjoy exploring, you probably won't understand this games appeal.  If its cheap, or if your a fan of ""art as a game"", this is a great experiance, if only to broader your horizens and if you happen to enjoy it, you'll find a great escape when you need to relax and forget about life for awhile.

												Initially pretty interesting. Played again and well it was the same island, with the same sounds and creatures. Interesting sounds coupled with minimalist graphics - pretty, but pretty boring overall.It feels like an interesting experiment, but you won't find yourself coming back for more. It seems to boast of it's infinite amounts to explore, but every time you restart you have to go through days worth (not literal, but game days) of the same stuff you've already seen and experienced. On top of that, the new stuff is just not really that exciting.I did enjoy it for a little bit - had some wine and kicked back. However, to recommend this ""game"" for the asking price I simply can't do. Great expirement, but and overall boring experience. I'd be very eager to see future experiments by these game designers, but can't recommend this piece.			"

												While it's not as satisfying as, say, Flower or Journey, Proteus is a relaxing, very short exploration game-as-Art that is competently done and has some really good audio design behind it.  It maybe isn't anything revolutionary, but you can tell a fair amount of care and exploratory experience (if that makes sense) went into it.  In fact, I wish there was a ""screensaver"" or self-playing mode, because I feel like it would be neat to experience it more (or in the background), but I don't particularly feel that I need to physically play it again.  Just make sure you know what to expect by checking a few minutes of an LP to make sure the gameplay and ""lo-fi"" graphics aren't a personal turn-off, and pick it up in a bundle or really good sale.Supposedly there is a soundtrack version planned, something that would've increased the value substantially in my opinion.  I've also read rumors about Oculus Rift support, which would be a small plus (though not a big one as the graphics are rather flat, and there's often a lot of fog).  I was somewhat skeptical before, but now I'll keep my ears open for the developer's and composer's next projects.			"

												This game reminds me of a time in my teens, going to the fair and paying money to peek in a majestic aquarium and see a mermaid. I don't know what I actually thought I'd see, probably nothing amazing, but it ended up being a really ugly old fat man in a one piece bathing suit and an XXL long sleeve green tshirt around ""her"" legs, sitting at the bottom of a disguised dunk tank. I paid one dollar and fifty cents to see that man and this game disappointed me more. Its exactly what you'd expect, except with less going on. It's peaceful, but if that's what you're into, hiking in real life is free at a lot of places and the rabbits are more than 4 pixels. It was the anticipation that made me hate it, if I just stumbled across this for free, coded into a web page, I'd probably play for five minutes and then stop and be like, ""Hey, that was sort of cool.""You can press Q, and it auto-walks forward, and you just look around with the mouse with really not much other than trees to see, aside from a few graves, and the changing time of day. I think a lot of people are arguing that this is art, or this game is just trying to be different and show that you don't need goals or objectives, but from my perspective, many of those people are just fighting the norm, playing the devil's advocate. I can't see someone spending more than 20 minutes max on this game.Overall: 2/10 for being pretty.			"

												I believe games can be art but not all art can be games.  Proteus is not a game.  It is an auditory and visual experience with virtually no interaction.  Truthfully, I think if Proteus had an semblance of gameplay it could be quite unique and worth playing.  ""Flower"" on the PS3, for example, is art but also has simple gameplay and leaves a lasting impression.  Proteus has none of this.  Fortunately, it was free in the a Humble Bundle. 1/5 Stars			"

												It is incorrect to say this is not a game and more like an interactive experience. Yes it is an interactive experience, all games are interactive experiences, but this is indeed a game. Those that claim it is not a game just haven’t spent the time figuring out the mechanics of the game or taken the time to search for guides online. You can choose to explore aimlessly and enjoy the peacfulness of the world or you can follow a set of rules in order to experience the timeline of the game and end (or beat) the game. Unless you create a snapshot, everytime you play the game you will be in a newly generated world. So even if you've finished the game before, you can try again in a new world.			"

												So.....I have mixed feelings about this game. Did I enjoy playing through it once? Yes.Will I ever touch it or even install it again? Not likely. Essentially, all you do is wander aimlessly through a procedurally generated island. The island has a day/night cycle, and seasons. There are a small variety of animals that make various musical sounds as they move.That's pretty much this whole game. Now, there are lots of good things to be said about it. It was certainly interesting, and I think that an attempt to be creative and make a new type of game is admirable and overall a good thing. However, I feel the same way about this game that I do about those random splotch paintings in art museums - I look at it, and think, ""that's interesting"" and then leave it, feeling like I should have gleaned something more from the experience, but not really sure what exactly that should have been.The reason I don't recommend this game is mostly because I think it is extremely overpriced. There is maybe 1 or 2 dollars worth of game here. If it's on sale for about that much, it's probably worth giving a shot, just for the experience. But 10 dollars is way, way too much for this game. If you want to spend that much, go for it. Just remember you're buying one of those random splotch paintings.			"

												Proteus is a game by Ed Key and David Kanaga which has received nominations; awards; mixed reviews from various sites and bloggers; and challenged the notion of what a game is. This game is on the border between video games and art and so you could call it an ‘Art Game’.Whether you think Proteus is worth the $10 that’s being asked depends on what you’re after. As a game, I would say $10 is not worth it. But if you’re after a simple, well-designed and eloquent piece of interactive art, then this is for you, especially considering that you can buy non-interactive, static, noiseless posters of your favourite movie for around $15.For full review, visit:http://icarusreviews.net/2013/05/06/brief-write-of-a-brief-flight-proteus/ "

												One of the most ~~~ART~~~ indie games I've ever played; that's not to say it's bad, though! It can be quite relaxing to play, even though all you really do is walk around and look at things; it's sort of the inverse of LSD Dream Emulator, where you do the same thing but are generally scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Then again, I can't shake that feeliing that the author thinks I should have liked this game just a BIT more than I actually did...Either way, it's barely an hour long, so give it a shot if you have it - just don't blow a wad of cash on it.

												""Minecraft without building"", first impression is that in this game you can only walk and sit.

												Proteus is sort of an open-world exploration game in a cute pastel, pixely environment. While there is a goal, you'll probably discover it accidentally and understand what to do, but for me the main enjoyment of the game comes from getting to know the landscape and its inhabitants. There are stylistic versions of chickens, frogs, and other animals that make me grin when I see them. The weather changes, from a sunny day to rainy even to nighttime.Overall, it's a wonderful game to play when you're stressed and need relaxation, or just need to unwind in general. It's a great game for just slowing things down, and the music is wonderful as well.The only problem that I have with the game is that my computer won't run the full version (not sure why--it's a decent computer), so I have to play one of the beta versions on Steam. I have played the full version offline on other computers.To me, this isn't one of those games that I just sit down and play anytime (it's usually when I want to de-stress), but it's well worth it to buy. I'd give it an 8/10, but you should only buy it if you're interested in this sort of game.			"

												It is kind of like a game without what makes a game a game. Take an octopus for example, beautiful aquatic creature with 8 arms, now take that octopus, rip off its arms and place it in a desert, that is what this game is, an armless octopus in the desert. It feels like I'm playing an incomplete game, like a game in very early alpha.I recommend a game with a beautiful world that when you get tired of exploring you can go and do other things.			"

												Proteus is an excellent ""game"" if you can call it that to relax you. With its peaceful soundtrack and beautiful world roaming the island will be the most peaceful 40 minutes you can possibly have. After finishing Proteus for the first time it can be rewarding to play through it again due to the island being different every time. All in all Proteus isn't for everyone since there are no objectives however after one plays a heavy session of a hardcore game one can relax with Proteus. Recommended			"

												Proteus is a pixelated, first-person adventure game where you explore the island of Proteus and interact with its inhabitants. The artwork, sounds, and music are very good for the most part, and the first half of the game makes you curious and intrigued as to what different sights there are to see on the island and how to interact with different things that you find (as the game offers no instructions or tutorial, but instead lets you find out how to play and explore Proteus on your own.)The second half of the game, however, is very dull and boring, and these negative aspects worsen until the game finishes. Also, after 1 or 2 playthroughs, you've pretty much seen everything, as Protues is a very short title that should take less than an hour to complete, and there's no incentive to play again. In fact, the painfully dull second half of the game may DETER players from exploring Proteus again.In short, the first half of Proteus is quite well done, but considering the boring second half and lack of replay value, the positive qualities of this game are not enough to recommend a purchase.

												Let's get one thing straight from the beginning - Proteus isn't a game. It's an experience. It combines two elements - sound and vision - to create a uniquely moving and personal experience as you roam a small island. You don't do anything. You explore your own personal world, one that teems with surprises. You won't forget the first time you walk through a creaking forest at night and an owl hoots at you form a nearby tree. Nor will you forget the first time you stepped atop a mountain. The first sunrise actually set the hairs on my arms on end.It's about exploring what Proteus has to offer with your eyes and ears. Both sounds and sights are simultaneously abstract and magnificent, drawing the traveller deeper in. You could find yourself chasing a bunny for the strong notes it creates versus a melodic background, or simply sitting under a tree watching a sunset, admiring the view and ambience.As I said, Proteus is an experience - if you don't give it the time it deserves, you won't feel it as you should, you won't be drawn in as the developers intended. If you want instant gratification, go play CoD. But if you want something a little deeper, a little more personal, something that isn't all about the numbers, give Proteus a try.Starman			"

												Proteus makes Dear Esther look like GTAV. I know sometimes developers read these reviews, and I don't like to be cruel. So please forgive me, devs, if you read this. Proteus is a horrible piece of pretentious garbage. It was given to me as a gift, so I gave it a try. After 20 minutes I am totally and completely finished, and I have absolutely no idea what I am meant to get out of this. Proteus is about wandering a pastel day-glo island where NOTHING HAPPENS. You can walk into obelisks (oh boy) and you'll get teleported to other parts of the island. Sometimes animals will scurry out of your way. Once in a while glowing lights will form into a circle and you can stand in it, and then it goes from night to day. Hold on to your hats, people!Maybe I'm missing something. Maybe I'm not appreciating the subtle, inexorable beauty of this minimalist enterprise. Maybe I'm bringing faulty hard-hearted expectations from console shoot-em-ups into something which is clearly trying to tread a different path, one of intangible essences and abstract textures. Maybe I'm going to puke all over my keyboard.While I appreciate everyone who tries something different, that does not automatically qualify their products for a badge of quality, fun, or beauty. In this case I have experienced none of those. Just a boring romp around a boring island.I feel like 20 precious minutes of my life have been wasted, and I want them back. Stay away!			"

												I like original/weird indie games, but Proteus is just not for me. I knew it was purely an exploration-based/art game, but i don't find enough in it to like itAt first i was taken in by the randomly generated landscape. It reminded me a lot of how i like going in the wild in Minecraft. However, it soon turned out that there was little to explore, and even less to actually do. So you're rapidly stuck on your tiny island, trying to find the few hidden stuff, or just pass the time till you can progress forwards (yes, there is an ending).The one thing i really like about the game is the ambient soundtrack, i could listen to it for hours, just lying on my bed and enjoying the random sounds.

												I will warn you now: Proteus is not for everyone.There are those who won't see the beauty behind the pixels. They are not wrong, they are not bad. They just have a different view.There are those who will be touched by the intrigue. They feel immersion, curiosity. I hope that you can be counted in these numbers.Proteus has no point. No goal. No villain. No ultimate evil that needs to be stopped. It simply has time. You can spend as much or as little time as you want just being. You may see many things that you have seen before. You may see a few things that you will never see again. And that is all that is asked of you. See, observe, explore.I personally played Proteus because I liked the idea that it posed. What I came away with was a lot more than the beauty of the idea. I came away feeling sad, because of what I had seen and what I had been powerless to stop. I came away feeling happy, because of the beauty in what I had seen and the fact that I had no power over it.Never have I felt like I do now. Proteus is an experience that is not quite like anything else. I have no real comparison to it. Buy it, play it through. If you're like me, you'll understand why I love it so much.			"

I've never ever been more pleasantly suprised by a mistake.I would recommend Proteus but i need to stress, not as a game and to be honest, i didn't play it thinking that. Within the first 60 seconds i could tell that this wasn't a game in the traditional sense. As i piece of art i would heavily recommend it. I would more so like to recommend it to people looking for some sort of tool to induce calm.It's ""gameplay"" is a simple 3d based movement mechanic without sprinting of jumping functions. So far all i've done is wander around and be constantly suprised by little quirks. I love the sounds of this game so much, from its little animals to the random gusts of wind. I had no expectations and i've enjoyed it. If you're looking for...well a video game, i'd say steer clear of this title. If however you want to try something different then i'd whole heartedly recommend it. I hope you enjoy it.I use it as a calming tool and it really does work.

A lot of people won't get it or understand the concept. But it's more a work of interactive art than a game. At first I thought there wasn't a point to it till I noticed I was in a way... ""leveling up"". After getting the hang of it I reached a point where I was slowly lifted up to the air and the game ended and started over.It's not as story or emotionally driven as other art style games like Flower or Journey on PS3, but it's an amusing piece of work with fun visuals and sound.

												Have you ever been getting to the point where you are winding down and are about to stop playing a game and you sort of space out and just roam around the world?  Proteus is attempting to be that sort of experience.  The problem is that there is nothing about the exploration that is really any more engaging or relaxing than exploring any other world.  If you want to recreate the experience of playing this game, just roam around and explore any safe area in any game.  Chances are everyone already has several games they haven't played, much less explored fully, so you are eskimos and Twisted Tree is attempting to sell you ice.  Don't buy it!			"

												I initially thought Proteus would be like Dear Esther (which I didn't like at all) and I got it from a humble bundle.Well it's not. Proteus is a piece of art! It entertained me 43 minutes straight and it's something I'd show other people. The soundscapes were very pleasant, as were the animations and colour palettes.Not a fan of the huge pixels, I don't thiknk they're cute, I think they're hideous, but the complete picture is still aesthethically pleasing.

												While I wouldn't consider it worth $10.00 I would definately pick this up during a steam sale. If you're looking for a story or engaging gameplay you'll be dissapointed, but it's a great way to kill 30 minutes to an hour every once in awhile to help you relax.			"

												Proteus in my opinion is an OK game. The game focuses on the beauty aspect and not much else. The game is made to be a casual game where you may roam around an island and discover numerous things. Other than that there isn't that much you can do. It's a fun game for people who enjoy scenery > gameplay and like playing casually.			"

												Proteus is an experience, plain and simple.  It's a game that's hard to categorize but no less compelling because of it.  The charm it exudes as you wander through it's fantastical world cannot be denied, and as it grows on you, it opens up a part of you that you may have thought was lost from your childhood.  The world of Proteus is a musical one, and a living one.  The world reacts to you and sings to you as you explore it.  As the symphonies of rain drops and rustling trees combine, they start to make sense and melt together with the vibrant scenery into something beautiful and beyond description.  Proteus is a work of art, a tool for relaxation, a vibrant and ever-changing chorus, and so many other things that it feels futile to try to describe the sum of its part.  Simply put, the only thing you can do is play the game for yourself, and let it amaze you.			"

												Back in the mid-90s I used to spend a little time in a ""virtual reality"" chat program called Alphaworld, which I suppose was a sort of early Second Life, but I rarely ever wanted to talk to people, instead preferring to wander around and look at creations and just explore. A few minutes of ""playing"" Proteus gave me exactly that feeling again; a sort of lazy and relaxed exploration that's enhanced by the otherworldly music you help create by walking through or near objects.I found myself just spotting something in the distance and lazily wandering in that direction, idly coming up with a theory and then meandering off to some other interesting thing I saw on another hill. I'd love to see what this game would be like with something like the Oculus Rift; I expect it'd be wonderfully immersive and relaxing!I'm recommending because I found it a beautiful, stress-relieving and thorougly relaxing experience that reminded me of something I used to do that I'd almost forgotten about. It's not something I'd ""play"" for hours, but a half-hour or so or meandering through beautiful, surreal scenary once in a while sounds great. Glad I picked Proteus up!			"

												Interesting. Relax and explore. That's all there is to this. Glad I spent the 2 bucks on it while it was on sale. I'd probably feel less than satisfied if I'd paid full price, but for just a couple bucks, it was worth it. It's not a game. It's interactive art, but there are some interesting things to discover as you explore.  I feel that this is the sort of thing that the minds behind Flower and Journey might have made had they been much more limited in budget. If you enjoy these sorts of experiences and you find it on sale, give it a go. If you're the sort of gamer who must always have stated goals, achievements, weapons and power-ups, move on. You'll be happier spending your money elsewhere.			"

												I don't know how to explain what it is about this game that I really love. It's unlike anything I've played before and probably never will be anything like it. It didn't cause any motion sickness for me as other people have said they experienced. There is no dialogue, and the music and sounds fit seamlessly together.  Although this game is good I wouldn't play it again as it wouldn't be anything new and the expreience is once off. Definitely glad I took the time to play this game. Would recommend it for casual gamers and but not FPS or other fast paced game fans.			"

												There's something wonderfully meditative about Proteus. It may not qualify as a game in the traditional sense of the word, but exploring the randomly generated islands and taking in the charming and colourful pixelated vistas while listening to the soundtrack changing according to your path, is something special. It's not something you'll want to spend hours with at a time, but time does seem to fly while you play. It's a great little game to sit down with if you need to take a breather from more hectic action-packed games, or just from the stress of life in general. Thoroughly recommended.			"

												I've sat here today for not very long starting to explore Proteus and all it has to offer and though Ive been unwell with the flu it's made me feel relaxed. It's the sort of thing I wold recomend as a destress or a nwind activity after a long hard day. Wonderfully rich with places to see and fine it's ot laced with HD grathics or shoot this kill that type quests but that's part of it's charm. It has it's own very simple wonder about it self. So go for it and explore let your mind relax and discover what curiositys lay in wait in this lovely little game.			"

												I began my journey not knowing what to expect. I awoke in an 8 bit world. I was about to have a first person atari style adventure. I was in the middle of what appeared to be a vast ocean. It was very foggy, but I could see land in the distance. I could also see a comforting and familiar sun. I choose to head towards land. Gameplay wise, there isn't much there. wasd to move and you can also look around. Initially I was annoyed at the slow pace and the fact that once I had arrived at a castle like building I could not enter. My curiousity to learn more drove me to continue my journey. There were interesting sounds and visions all around. I appeared to be on an island inhibited by many creatures and containing it's own weather system. Soon enough the clouds began to disperse and the sun began to set. With night upon me I enjoyed some light star gazing upon a snowy mountain top. I noted the slow movement of the stars. Once again my emotions switched when I came to a small cottage down the mountain side following a dirt path. Not only could I not enter this cottage, but the door itself looked terrible. I would not be fooled....no one lives here. No one has for some time.....I started my next day much like the first, blindy moving forward in an effort to discover what, if anything, remains to be discovered. This is where I had my first encounter. A silly creature bounced gracefully away from me. It did not matter how I decided to approach, the creature was sure to make haste. Remnicient of Stan's dad in South Park attempting to ""catch the Dragon"" I gave chase to this creature. I followed it so long that eventually we arrived at the shore line. Sadly the creature simply hopped into the water, never to be seen again. I happened upon numerous more of these creatures during my team on the island. My experience remained the same. I would follow until I could no longer. Eventually I found a circle of what appeared to be grave stones. Upon bumping into one I noticed a small ""bend"" in reality. The world in which I was located was being distorted by these things. Whilst looking around  I realized the pace of this world changing picking up. Soon I was watching as days were flying by before my eyes. Getting a grip on my bewilderment I became aware of the small circle in the center of these stones, seemingly created by wind. It seemed to call me. Feeling as though it was my destiny I entered the circle.Opening my eyes once again I took note of a slightly new sun. Perhaps this was a new world, or perhaps I had simply traveled through time. The landscape had changed. The entire pace of things seemed to pick up entirely. Wildlife was much more abundant than the when or where from which I had traveled. I had received exactly what I had asked for, as if I had somehow  directed the growth of this existence. After taking in what this new landscape had to offer I once again happened upon the bounding bouncing creature from before. Only this time something was different. The creature appeared to have let me get ever so slightly closer before making it's escape. I'm not sure what will happen to me now. I feel as though my only route is forward. It is as if I have put a curse on myself to make a goal of understanding this creature. I fear I may never catch it, but I also feel that I must try. It occurs to me that I may travel endless worlds in search of my goal, wandering through time and space relentlessy. It is for that reason that I leave this record of my travels. Perhaps as a warning, perhaps as an explanation. If this is to be my last correspondence, please hope for me. Hope that I have attained my goal of capturing the bouncing creature. ------I would definitely define this as an exploration or art type game. It is a soothing experience that may help certain people feel calm or tap into the childlike wonder of days long past many of us have forgotten. Recommended For: Anyone with a tramatic past""City-folk"" who will never see real starsIndividuals afraid to leave their homesAnyone who is really stoned.Not Recommended for: Graphics ♥♥♥♥♥sFast paced action junkiesMeth addicts. Recommended, but only under specific conditions. I honestly would probably be upset if I had paid much for this game.			"

Interesting consept that makes 8bit music by affecting the 8bit enviromet you explore in the world they have made.  graphics are 8bit but the random music it makes keeps me puzzled. How. Good if you have a 5yr old that wants to play with your new PC. Good enough audio and visuals to keep them intrested and learning thw mouse and hand control. chasing things on the screen they will never catch. There is always something behind the next tree for them to chase. Very simple movment hold down left click to move forward and right for backwards. listen for music changes.

You wander around a colorful island, looking at the polygonal floral and fauna and listening the music that changes depending on where you are. As you advance through the game, the environment changes, though I won't spoil how, and you encounter new flora and fauna and music. It concludes in a strangely moving way that will stay with me for a long time.			"

												Proteus is art, but it is not a game. If you like the concept of intrigue and immersion while walking around a funny little island, then get this game.That being said, if you're looking for a point, steer clear because there is none. All you do is walk around looking at trees, creatures, and monoliths. There isn't an ending, and it doesn't really qualify as a game. It's artsy, so if you're like me and you're looking for direction or things to do, you don't want this kind of limited experience.I recommend it because while I didn't particularly gel with the purpose of Proteus, I can appreciate the purpose and the time spent creating it; hell, each island is randomly generated which has gotta be worth something. That said, though, 10 bucks is a bit much. If the price drops to say, 5 dollars, or less, I would say give it a try. 5 bucks is the price of a hamburger. Really not a total loss, even if you didn't fully enjoy the game.			"

												I'd hesitate to call this a game, but it's interesting nonetheless. You get a randomly generated island with pixelly 3D graphics, and the music can be changed just by walking around and exploring.  There's a magic circle that changes the season when you approach it at night, and season affects both your audio experience and your video experience.With its postcard feature, you can take a screenshot that has your randomly generated world encoded into it, and send it to a friend, who can then load your world and explore it themselves.As for whether it's worth buying, it's hit or miss.  This might be the kind of thing you like, or it might not.  Grab it on sale if you can.			"

												I must not be on the right drugs...This is, without a doubt, pretty, but it's not the sort of experience I get very much enjoyment from. Proteus certainly evokes the discussion of what it means to be a game. Whether or not it is I still do not like it. Please and thank you, keep your sandals to yourself.			"

												I got this on sale for $2.  While I wouldn't have spent $10 on it, there's no remorse in purchasing this game for less than the cost of a large bag of chips.  It's also about 90MB, which meant it was playable within minutes, and isn't taking up a huge amount of space on my machine.  I can keep it there and come back to it from time to time with no guilt.Now, from someone who DID NOT enjoy Dear Esther, I do like this.  It's fun to just walk around.  Laugh because I made the little square bees angry, or something.  Unlike Dear Esther, which has lofty, pretentious aims, this is just there to let you relax, and doesn't pretend to be anything more.  It's the squishy stress ball of games.  At no point will you be stuck on x area, looking for some stupid bauble, or trying to get the game to trigger an event by doing the right hoohah dance, or whatever.  Grab it while it's $2, and play it when you're too stressed to even handle conventional game play.  (You KNOW that happens.)			"

												I've always been a sucker for games like these. At first I wondered if the 9 euros I put down was a mistake. After my first playthrough at around 45 minutes, I was absolutely positive that not a single cent was wasted.Really, it's like walking around in a dream with lo-fi graphics.The game is very simple, both in concept and graphics. It's a game I will play from time to time, to relax, or to just be amazed for an hour or so. There's always something new to see, and it's always just as intoxicating.I recommend you buy Proteus and support the hard-working developers. It's one of the most charming walks in recent memory.

												who signed off on this? this is the type of game you show to your uncle after your  aunt (his wife) has just passed away. although the funeral isn't till thursday, he insists on staying over three nights prior (monday), and just by consequence of his very existence, you become desperate to show your extracurricular activities are not damaging. ""what exactly is this?"", he asks between sobs. you slide the headphones over his ears. ""why it's a procedurally-generated landscape of terrible textures and audio trigger points, that lacks any intrigue, and in which nothing at all happens."" he sighs, plays it for FIVE freakin' hours. you sleep downstairs with the un-killable cat; cursing the plan, the game, your aunt (his wife), the whole world.post: i would like to add that the concept is a lovely one, it's just the execution that is lacking. i feel as though an experience like this should have some semblance of longetivity. for me at least, it didn't. one set of rolling hills blended into the other and any sense of discovery soon disappeared.

												My wife's review: ""Proteus was really awesome. Granted, there is no real point to the game, which made it much less of a game for me and more of an experience. Can we call it an experience instead of a video game? That would be nice. Otherwise, one might refer to it as a beautiful waste of time. I could have spent hours wandering around and squealing over the super cute noises and flashy shiny colorful things that pop up all over the place. It was very relaxing and enjoyable with zero stress. YAY :)""Read more: http://www.substance-tv.com/jess-plays-proteus/ "

												Have you ever been getting to the point where you are winding down and are about to stop playing a game and you sort of space out and just roam around the world?  Proteus is attempting to be that sort of experience.  The problem is that there is nothing about the exploration that is really any more engaging or relaxing than exploring any other world.  If you want to recreate the experience of playing this game, just roam around and explore any safe area in any game.  Chances are everyone already has several games they haven't played, much less explored fully, so you are eskimos and Twisted Tree is attempting to sell you ice.  Don't buy it!			"

												So.....I have mixed feelings about this game. Did I enjoy playing through it once? Yes.Will I ever touch it or even install it again? Not likely. Essentially, all you do is wander aimlessly through a procedurally generated island. The island has a day/night cycle, and seasons. There are a small variety of animals that make various musical sounds as they move.That's pretty much this whole game. Now, there are lots of good things to be said about it. It was certainly interesting, and I think that an attempt to be creative and make a new type of game is admirable and overall a good thing. However, I feel the same way about this game that I do about those random splotch paintings in art museums - I look at it, and think, ""that's interesting"" and then leave it, feeling like I should have gleaned something more from the experience, but not really sure what exactly that should have been.The reason I don't recommend this game is mostly because I think it is extremely overpriced. There is maybe 1 or 2 dollars worth of game here. If it's on sale for about that much, it's probably worth giving a shot, just for the experience. But 10 dollars is way, way too much for this game. If you want to spend that much, go for it. Just remember you're buying one of those random splotch paintings.			"

												Proteus is a game by Ed Key and David Kanaga which has received nominations; awards; mixed reviews from various sites and bloggers; and challenged the notion of what a game is. This game is on the border between video games and art and so you could call it an ‘Art Game’.Whether you think Proteus is worth the $10 that’s being asked depends on what you’re after. As a game, I would say $10 is not worth it. But if you’re after a simple, well-designed and eloquent piece of interactive art, then this is for you, especially considering that you can buy non-interactive, static, noiseless posters of your favourite movie for around $15.For full review, visit:http://icarusreviews.net/2013/05/06/brief-write-of-a-brief-flight-proteus/ "

												The game involves wandering around an island.  That's it.  The graphics are very crude, the only stand out feature is the audio.  The clever idea is that everything in the visual landscape reflects itself in an audio landscape that you wander through at the same time.  As the weather and the seasons change the music reflects in this.  Blooming trees lead to resonant earthy sounds,  wondering past gravestones leads to ominous bass notes and falling rain leads to precussive tinkles.  All in all the video and audo worlds collide beatifully, and is a thoroughly meditative experience.  I've not experienced anything quite like it.Ultimately though this feeling wore off rather quickly and just lead to boredom.  I wondered around for the best part of an hour and let the game reach its conclusion.  I can't deny that this was a work of art, and a lovingly crafted calming diversion.  I respect it for trying to be different, its an experimental album if you will, and the world is a better place for having things like this.  I want to love this game but however hard I try I can't bring myself to recommend it.  There's just not enough to do.  But maybe that's the point?If you are like me then a review like this will make you want to play it more just to see what its like and prove me wrong.   You won't regret it, but a few weeks down the line ""Proteus"" will be just another word languishing in your Steam games list.			"

												This is not a ""game"" per se, it's more like an interactive stress relief device.  It's like the video game equivalent of yoga, some may call it boring and some may say it's relaxing.  I am one of the latter as this is good for stress relief after a bad day at work.The visuals, though 8-bit, somehow look absolutely stunning.  The music is quite good, though some of the sound effects are annoying but don't detract from the experience.Two negatives come with this: 1.  Like I said, people may find it boring since it isn't particularly action-packed2.  The price point is quite steep.If you want a good game to relax to, pick this up when it goes on sale. Just don't expect too much gameplay			"

												I began my journey not knowing what to expect. I awoke in an 8 bit world. I was about to have a first person atari style adventure. I was in the middle of what appeared to be a vast ocean. It was very foggy, but I could see land in the distance. I could also see a comforting and familiar sun. I choose to head towards land. Gameplay wise, there isn't much there. wasd to move and you can also look around. Initially I was annoyed at the slow pace and the fact that once I had arrived at a castle like building I could not enter. My curiousity to learn more drove me to continue my journey. There were interesting sounds and visions all around. I appeared to be on an island inhibited by many creatures and containing it's own weather system. Soon enough the clouds began to disperse and the sun began to set. With night upon me I enjoyed some light star gazing upon a snowy mountain top. I noted the slow movement of the stars. Once again my emotions switched when I came to a small cottage down the mountain side following a dirt path. Not only could I not enter this cottage, but the door itself looked terrible. I would not be fooled....no one lives here. No one has for some time.....I started my next day much like the first, blindy moving forward in an effort to discover what, if anything, remains to be discovered. This is where I had my first encounter. A silly creature bounced gracefully away from me. It did not matter how I decided to approach, the creature was sure to make haste. Remnicient of Stan's dad in South Park attempting to ""catch the Dragon"" I gave chase to this creature. I followed it so long that eventually we arrived at the shore line. Sadly the creature simply hopped into the water, never to be seen again. I happened upon numerous more of these creatures during my team on the island. My experience remained the same. I would follow until I could no longer. Eventually I found a circle of what appeared to be grave stones. Upon bumping into one I noticed a small ""bend"" in reality. The world in which I was located was being distorted by these things. Whilst looking around  I realized the pace of this world changing picking up. Soon I was watching as days were flying by before my eyes. Getting a grip on my bewilderment I became aware of the small circle in the center of these stones, seemingly created by wind. It seemed to call me. Feeling as though it was my destiny I entered the circle.Opening my eyes once again I took note of a slightly new sun. Perhaps this was a new world, or perhaps I had simply traveled through time. The landscape had changed. The entire pace of things seemed to pick up entirely. Wildlife was much more abundant than the when or where from which I had traveled. I had received exactly what I had asked for, as if I had somehow  directed the growth of this existence. After taking in what this new landscape had to offer I once again happened upon the bounding bouncing creature from before. Only this time something was different. The creature appeared to have let me get ever so slightly closer before making it's escape. I'm not sure what will happen to me now. I feel as though my only route is forward. It is as if I have put a curse on myself to make a goal of understanding this creature. I fear I may never catch it, but I also feel that I must try. It occurs to me that I may travel endless worlds in search of my goal, wandering through time and space relentlessy. It is for that reason that I leave this record of my travels. Perhaps as a warning, perhaps as an explanation. If this is to be my last correspondence, please hope for me. Hope that I have attained my goal of capturing the bouncing creature. ------I would definitely define this as an exploration or art type game. It is a soothing experience that may help certain people feel calm or tap into the childlike wonder of days long past many of us have forgotten. Recommended For: Anyone with a tramatic past""City-folk"" who will never see real starsIndividuals afraid to leave their homesAnyone who is really stoned.Not Recommended for: Graphics ♥♥♥♥♥sFast paced action junkiesMeth addicts. Recommended, but only under specific conditions. I honestly would probably be upset if I had paid much for this game.			"

												If you're reading reviews, well, I take it that means you're on the fence. A nice pair of headphones makes Proteus a much more immersive and awe-inducing experience. Otherwise, well, it's probably not nearly as impressive. If you have a nice pair of headphones and are still hesitant, well... I would be hesitant too, at full price. I bought this as part of a humble bundle. As much as I enjoy Proteus (and sharing this game with others, especially), 10 euro is asking a lot.Calling this a ""game"" isn't quite right. It's more of an exploratory experience, like Dear Esther but with more freedom and much more wow, even with the graphic downgrade. There's no story, no goal, just wandering around an island populated by things and beings that create an aural and visual landscape. The ""island"" changes with each playthrough, though in the games I've loaded, it's always been populated by the same beings/things. Except that one time, in the graveyard with the firefly symphony-whirlpool that controlled time. Never was able to make that happen a second time.			"

												It's very important to keep in mind that Proteus is not a game. It is a relaxation toy. It's Dear Esther without the story or the dialogue or the 3D graphics -- that is to say, you walk around an island. You can change the season you're in by stepping into a swirling halo of lights; after you do that, you're basically done with Proteus.If you have a setup that can really immerse you -- a large screen and good speakers, for instance -- Proteus is a great way to come home after a hard day of thinking and just relax.

The real genius of Proteus is its simplicity, and it excels in this field. As minimalistic as it may be, the world feels as if it's brimming with life, thanks in part to the menagerie of music, caused by the trees, wilidlife, etc... it's visual eye candy, and the experience personally made me feel... happy. Proteus is not something you play, it's something you experience, and you'll be hard pressed to find anything like Proteus.			"

												I had just finished a stressful match of League of Legends and I decided that I needed to take a breather, so I loaded up Steam and remembered I had just bought this game as apart of a Humble Bundle. Figuring that it could be good, I installed it, put on my headphones, and dove in. Waking up waist deep in the pixelated ocean, I was immersed in a simple yet utterly beautiful world. I watched day turn to night and night turn to day. There were no goals, nor any rules of what I had to do. I walked around an island, listening to the world. I climbed a mountain and heard the sea wind blowing. I walked into the rain and heard a gentle drizzle land on the nearby trees. As I played-- no, not played. As I experienced Proteus, I felt my muscles relieve themselves, and even now do I feel utterly calm. I can't explain this game, because it's not a game. Walking through Proteus was a reminder that the world is beautiful, and all we have to do is take time to see it.			"

												More of a walking simulator than anything. If you're looking for some high action, objective based game this isnt for you. Very good audio. I would reccomend this for someone who wants just a peaceful little game to enjoy for a while. Saying that, Its not for everybody. But if you think you might kinda like it, I would suggest you to get it.			"

												This isn't a game so much as a work of art. Its low resolution ""8 bit"" graphics but nonetheless there is a beauty to it - not only visually, as the music changes as the environment changes.I tried this ""game"" a year or two ago, played it for about 10 minutes, didn't really get what I was supposed to do, and gave up. I came back to it today wandered around for a bit and then after a while I started to understand what it was about.When I came back to it this time, I didn't try and do anything, I just wandered around, and then I understood what I was supposed to do - which was just to wander around!This isn't a game about competition, its not a game with much of a story, its not a game about self-improvement, but it is Art.

												Proteus is basically an island you can generate with your computer. There's a full range of plants and animals, a handful of landmarks, and a couple of secrets and surprises. Although there isn't much to do in Proteus, the procedurally generated landscape, fudgy graphics, and kaleidoscopic sound occasionally come together into something worth bearing witness to. If nothing else, Proteus can be enjoyed passively and functions well as a palette cleanser.There also exists a free mod called Purgateus, which uses alternate graphics and sound to create a darker setting.

 For those who love music Personally, I enjoy this game. I absolutely love video game soundtracks, however, this soundtrack is different. Typically, video game soundtracks are something on the side. The music plays in the background or it may be a part of an event in the game. Let's use  Skyrim  and its soundtrack as an example representing most other games. The soundtrack to that game is my favorite soundtrack ever, but it isn't interactive. Songs play in certain areas and play for certain events (like battles). Proteus  is different. Everything around you is part of the sountrack you create simply by being around those objects. Everytime you play, the soundtrack changes. You won't experience the same soundscape twice. That's something I enjoy. The music is very relaxing and there aren't really any objectives. I think that's a good thing. With games like  Minecraft  (another game with a beautiful soundtrack) there aren't really any set objectives or goals. You're just there in the world and you can do whatever you'd like, but the soundtrack is just an added part of the game. It isn't integral to the game. With  Proteus,  the sounds are everything. It's basically the point of it all.Nothing is perfect, so I do have a problem with this game. There are options to play older versions of this game, which is fantastic. The problem I have is that there aren't many options to choose from. There are the versions after the full 1.0 release, and a beta...  just one. I wish there were more beta versions that I could play. There is a particular version that I wish to play (the February 2012 version) because I prefer certain cound effects in that version over the ones in the newer versions. I came to know about this game through that version and that's the  Proteus  I fell in love with.Overall, I enjoy this game. Some might not call it a game, but I certainly do. It's definitely not for everyone, though. If you like relaxing games or ambient music, then this game is a good choice.			"

												Number one; this is an intensely buggy game. All it did for the first few months of my owning it was crash almost immediately when it was opened. It was only through some vague whim that I happened to try and load it again ages after purchasing it.While I fear I will be accused of missing the point, I must admit to finding Proteus utterly pointless. It is less a game, than a screen-saver and must be regarded as unfinished, laziness, as opposed to avant-garde, 'higher-meaning', indie game. Not all games need a crude starting line and a goal, but they need something more than the Emeperors Clothes that this game is evidently adorned in. Proteus is a meandering and ultimately unnecessary experience for anyone to have. It's only use might be to gently ease people back into society after some horrible, drug-addled. breakdown, but it's certainly not as a videogame. When you finally exit Proteus, the pixels make for an eye-closing animation; but my real eyes had already done that long ago. It was like a trip to the shops, only with less to show for it; I could have got a pint of milk during all of that pointlessness.			"

												I believe games can be art but not all art can be games.  Proteus is not a game.  It is an auditory and visual experience with virtually no interaction.  Truthfully, I think if Proteus had an semblance of gameplay it could be quite unique and worth playing.  ""Flower"" on the PS3, for example, is art but also has simple gameplay and leaves a lasting impression.  Proteus has none of this.  Fortunately, it was free in the a Humble Bundle. 1/5 Stars			"

												It is incorrect to say this is not a game and more like an interactive experience. Yes it is an interactive experience, all games are interactive experiences, but this is indeed a game. Those that claim it is not a game just haven’t spent the time figuring out the mechanics of the game or taken the time to search for guides online. You can choose to explore aimlessly and enjoy the peacfulness of the world or you can follow a set of rules in order to experience the timeline of the game and end (or beat) the game. Unless you create a snapshot, everytime you play the game you will be in a newly generated world. So even if you've finished the game before, you can try again in a new world.			"

Good if you have a 5yr old that wants to play with your new PC. Good enough audio and visuals to keep them intrested and learning thw mouse and hand control. chasing things on the screen they will never catch. There is always something behind the next tree for them to chase. Very simple movment hold down left click to move forward and right for backwards. listen for music changes. Would be better if it played music that was a pleasure to listen to. More insterment options or band options.			"

												To the game's credit, it has very nice ambient sound/music. It adds additional little notes and melodies that play depending what you're looking at or near and what's happening, and that part is very nicely done. All in all though, I found this game a bit of a let down. The environments are too repetetive to make exploration a very rich experience for more than the first couple minutes, and the game itself is over very quickly. I finished it without feeling like I had explored much of anything, without feeling like I had felt deeply relaxed or enjoyed any beautiful scenery, without feeling like anything interesitng had been communicated to me via sublte symbolism - more or less feeling like I'd barely played a game at all. I feel like the use of audio in this game shows a lot of creativity and potential, but unfortunately there's not much else to see here. I'm afraid I've got to agree with the reviews saying you've basically played the game by watching the trailer.			"

												I've been trying to think of a way to review this since I got it in a humble bundle a while back, but, even now, I'm not sure I quite get this game.The game is pretty simple, you just walk around and observe. The map is procedurally generated, but I couldn't really tell because it all felt samey. As I played it, I wasn't exactly sure what to do. So, I must say that maybe this game isn't just meant for me. I'm fine just walking around in either Skyrim or Minecraft, just observing, so long as I am choosing to do that and can stop doing that at any time. This game is literally just looking around, watching how the environment interacts with the player.I can't recommend this game for $9.99, but it's worth checking out if it's on a pretty big sale and you're interested in an interactive art gallery. Don't buy this expecting anything more than pretty, pixelated scenery.			"

												I began my journey not knowing what to expect. I awoke in an 8 bit world. I was about to have a first person atari style adventure. I was in the middle of what appeared to be a vast ocean. It was very foggy, but I could see land in the distance. I could also see a comforting and familiar sun. I choose to head towards land. Gameplay wise, there isn't much there. wasd to move and you can also look around. Initially I was annoyed at the slow pace and the fact that once I had arrived at a castle like building I could not enter. My curiousity to learn more drove me to continue my journey. There were interesting sounds and visions all around. I appeared to be on an island inhibited by many creatures and containing it's own weather system. Soon enough the clouds began to disperse and the sun began to set. With night upon me I enjoyed some light star gazing upon a snowy mountain top. I noted the slow movement of the stars. Once again my emotions switched when I came to a small cottage down the mountain side following a dirt path. Not only could I not enter this cottage, but the door itself looked terrible. I would not be fooled....no one lives here. No one has for some time.....I started my next day much like the first, blindy moving forward in an effort to discover what, if anything, remains to be discovered. This is where I had my first encounter. A silly creature bounced gracefully away from me. It did not matter how I decided to approach, the creature was sure to make haste. Remnicient of Stan's dad in South Park attempting to ""catch the Dragon"" I gave chase to this creature. I followed it so long that eventually we arrived at the shore line. Sadly the creature simply hopped into the water, never to be seen again. I happened upon numerous more of these creatures during my team on the island. My experience remained the same. I would follow until I could no longer. Eventually I found a circle of what appeared to be grave stones. Upon bumping into one I noticed a small ""bend"" in reality. The world in which I was located was being distorted by these things. Whilst looking around  I realized the pace of this world changing picking up. Soon I was watching as days were flying by before my eyes. Getting a grip on my bewilderment I became aware of the small circle in the center of these stones, seemingly created by wind. It seemed to call me. Feeling as though it was my destiny I entered the circle.Opening my eyes once again I took note of a slightly new sun. Perhaps this was a new world, or perhaps I had simply traveled through time. The landscape had changed. The entire pace of things seemed to pick up entirely. Wildlife was much more abundant than the when or where from which I had traveled. I had received exactly what I had asked for, as if I had somehow  directed the growth of this existence. After taking in what this new landscape had to offer I once again happened upon the bounding bouncing creature from before. Only this time something was different. The creature appeared to have let me get ever so slightly closer before making it's escape. I'm not sure what will happen to me now. I feel as though my only route is forward. It is as if I have put a curse on myself to make a goal of understanding this creature. I fear I may never catch it, but I also feel that I must try. It occurs to me that I may travel endless worlds in search of my goal, wandering through time and space relentlessy. It is for that reason that I leave this record of my travels. Perhaps as a warning, perhaps as an explanation. If this is to be my last correspondence, please hope for me. Hope that I have attained my goal of capturing the bouncing creature. ------I would definitely define this as an exploration or art type game. It is a soothing experience that may help certain people feel calm or tap into the childlike wonder of days long past many of us have forgotten. Recommended For: Anyone with a tramatic past""City-folk"" who will never see real starsIndividuals afraid to leave their homesAnyone who is really stoned.Not Recommended for: Graphics ♥♥♥♥♥sFast paced action junkiesMeth addicts. Recommended, but only under specific conditions. I honestly would probably be upset if I had paid much for this game.			"

												SOmetimes, when you're walking around outside you can look up into the sky that belongs to no man.... and accidentally pee on the side of a tree.

												Proteus is a interesting creation to me, It's clearly a video game but the it's nothing like I've played before, however saying that it does resemble some similarity to another game called ""Dear Esther"", the idea of both of those games is to explore and have a sense of adventure to progress to completing it. In Dear Esther however there is a narrator telling you bits of a story and it all pieces together when you finish the journey, in Proteus though there isn't a back story, or a plot, or an objective, there's nothing to do either,  it's very mysterious and from what I've heard from people they've seen and found thing I didn't see and vice versa.You start the game by left clicking on the isles in the background, you spawn in the ocean next to the shore, you use the WASD keys to move and mouse to look around as the norm for most PC games, you must explore to continue the game and like I said before there's no object so do as you please, also the notice how the music changes depending on where you are, but it's not only the music you should notice, everything in the environment makes a unique sound of some sort. I remember chasing a frog for a while all because it makes a sparkly spring noise when it hops, everything makes a sound, and sometimes you have to wait until night time to hear some interesting sounds. I found to continue to another part of the game, you have to wait until night time and find out where the these floating white partials are heading and follow them, you'll soon find a large cluster of them almost dancing in a circle, head inside the circle and you'll be taken into a new part of the game, it's easy to figure out what this game is basing its ideas on but all the same, you'll have to see for yourself, or buy it and have a go.Not much else to say about Proteus with it being a sort game, I managed to finish just under an hour, but if you take your time and find everything you can find this game will easily last you more than a week. I urge  everyone who reads this to please try it out, over your mind to something bigger than your attachment to your comfort zone and try something new, it's won't hurt to try right? Thank you for reading! "

												Proteus is my personal chilling simulator. You walk around the island, find a nice spot, and just sit down and chill for a bit. It's not the most exciting game, but it succeeds in creating places and sounds that are soothing, and sometimes slightly creepy.It's more of an experience than a game. I really like it, though.			"

												This game is different. It's not about gameplay in my opinion but more about an experience. You start of-shore next to an island. You walk to that island and then what? You don't have much to do but walk. But then what made me get 95 minutes of play time? I turned up my volume on my headset and enjoy the audio. What I like about this game is that you open it and you look... You basicly look around and watch the environment around you.You can find alot of stuff in the randomly generated world. You see statues and stones and you can watch the rain fall down. Or you can find animals jumping around or flying around.It's really immersive and exciting to play through the first time.Ontop of that it's calming... You start it up on a stressful day and you relax.I recommend this game because it's cheap and it's short... That's usually not a good combination but depending on your reasoning to buy this game it can be. Personally I bought it because I needed a game I could relax with. But it's also not worth 19,99€I opened the game and played a bit and then closed it... I never got to the final ""level"" before today. It was truly an experience to look at how the game changes while you play. I'm glad I got this game and I will probably load it up more.			"

												This isn't a game so much as a work of art. Its low resolution ""8 bit"" graphics but nonetheless there is a beauty to it - not only visually, as the music changes as the environment changes.I tried this ""game"" a year or two ago, played it for about 10 minutes, didn't really get what I was supposed to do, and gave up. I came back to it today wandered around for a bit and then after a while I started to understand what it was about.When I came back to it this time, I didn't try and do anything, I just wandered around, and then I understood what I was supposed to do - which was just to wander around!This isn't a game about competition, its not a game with much of a story, its not a game about self-improvement, but it is Art.

												I hesitate to thumbs-up this game because not everyone will experience the same catharsis as I, and others who've reviewed this game have. Before I go further, I'll say I'm a sucker for interesting art styles and good music. The reviews on Proteus and the Summer Steam Sale convinced me it was time to give it a go. I smoked, fired up Steam, and embarked on my journey into Proteus.I was delighted with every little creature I came across. Some animals were recognizable, others were alien to me. Each creature emanated its own ethereal melody; not a single bit of negativity to be seen. The pixelated art encouraged me to use my imagination to fill in the blanks--tabula rasa, if you will. Before long, I began to feel the anxiety of having no objectives, or even a button to interact with my surroundings, creep into my psyche. But when I found a group of singing pink mushrooms that popped down into the earth at my approach, only to pop back up nearby, I was satisfied to just experience the land. It became refreshing to not have to put forth effort to have a lovely experience, like receiving a massage. As for the circle of mysterious stone statues, the gravestones littering the land, the cabin in the woods, or the mother tree at the foot of the mountain...the lore behind them was whatever I want it to be. I learned to be present in the moment.This game reminded me a bit of Flower, the game that many folks insisted was not a game, but more of a toy. But the message behind Flower is the same I received from Proteus; sit back, relax, experience, and do or don't do whatever you like.My only frustration with this game is the mouse sensitivity. Even turned all the way up, I would have to lift my mouse up off the mousepad at least 10-20 times to turn around and go back the way I came. It definitely fudged with the flow of the game and introduced frustration where there had previously been calm delight. At times, I was so annoyed that I wanted to put the game down, but wanted to see it through to the end--and there IS an end.I can see many traditional hardcore gamers getting frustrated with this game. Many might perceive it as empty, devoid of any sense of accomplishment or productivity, with the beautiful art and lilting music being small compensation for the cost. Unfortunately, I think a large majority of gamers simply won't want to find the headspace to enjoy this game to its fullest, hence my hesitation to recommend it. If you can read the reviews and know Proteus is your cup of tea, buy it, mate! If you're still cautious, wait for it to go on sale and buy it for a few bucks.			"

												Spoilers:I play this game whenever I want to relax and waste some time. Proteus is a very simple game where you walk around and explore. There are different scenes to the game. At the start of the game, you awaken in the sea with an island ahead of you. It is spring time. There are new born animals jumping about and exploring the land similar to what you are doing, for the first time. As the sun drops and the moon rises the stars appear and you can see an unusual cluster of stars dropping and flowing towards this one point in the game. As you follow you are engulfed by the stars and time speeds up. When you are released the scenery has changed. It is summer time. Here there are more animals and bugs. The music is upbeat and happy. You explore more of the land and follow some creatures around. Once night falls again, you are swallowed by the stars again.It is autumn. Here the trees leaves start to fall off and turn brown. There are less animals and the music is starting to slow down and become sadder. You explore more. The stars once again fall down around you.It is winter. The trees are dead. No animals are in sight. The music is merely just a humming. You explore more. Everything seems dull and depressing now. The stars don't come and get you. You wait through the night.You feel tired, depressed and cold. You raise into the sky. You close your eyes. This is the end.I feel that Proteus is a game about life. You rise in the spring and fall in the winter. The atmosphere in this game is very strong and it makes you really want to keep exploring and you wonder what has changed for each season. Great game.			"

If you're the sort of person who can appreciate a nice walk, buy this game. If you're familiar with what a theremin is and know the difference between bunk and quality LSD, well...I reckon you should buy this game.			"

												Proteus is, in my opinion, one of the prettiest games I've ever had the pleasure of exploring. While it lacks the technical power/marvel of higher-budget games, the aesthetic and atmosphere is something that higher graphical fidelity would struggle to achieve.The simple, somewhat  abstract graphics and minimalist soundscape created a surreal atmosphere that used my imagination and curiosity to draw me into the experience. Very few games have managed to inspire the feelings of awe that Proteus has.While it is far from something everybody would enjoy, this game is certainly worth trying (especially if it is on sale).(ignore my playtime, I've spent most of my time playing Proteus offline, and offline play does not contribute to the playtime logged on steam)			"

												Thought I would try one  of these ""artsy/poetic"" games. Thought it would be interesting, but it was pretty boring.  The main screen left me a little confused on how to even start playing. Thought I had to hit the title screen but it was apparentlly the image (you can interact with pretty much everything on the main screen.) I get it is supposed to be some walk and enjoy the scenery game, but the art style just didn't do it for me. Just blocky trees and mountains and I guess things supposed be animals like baby chicks. The music in the beginning sounded like some weird alien sci-fi-esque tune, Later on it sounded okay.  Either way, felt the music choice didn't really fit the walking around.  The only slightly amusing thing I guess was the little bouncing characters(which when I followed seemed to lead me to the water?) but that's about it. There's is no set place to go, just walk around and explore the one island, where everything looks very similar but in maybe two different colours.If you like an interactive screensaver or want something soothing before you go to sleep, check it out.

												A strange, but beautiful game that does what it sets out to do. Create a vibrant atmosphere. You will have some fun with discovering the randomly generated worlds and find new things you can do. However, it is a limited experience and you should not count on spending more than 30 minutes or so in the game to get your fill for some time. Sadly, I cannot be certain you will get your money’s worth out it, as it is priced way too high compared to the experience you get.I was quite satisfied with it, but I did also use it for a study project, so my estimate of the time you can use playing it is accurate. As such, I cannot recommend it at the price, but get it on a 75% sale or so and you will definitely find some enjoyment. If nothing else, it is a very relaxing little game.			"

												This game is amazingly theraputic. That's it. Dont expect a lot of mechanics. it's just like taking a nice relaxing walk in a beautiful forest. I  bought it a while ago when it was on sale for less than a dollar, and it was WELL worth it. At its current price of nearly $10, a can't recommend unless you REALLY enjoy atmospheric games.			"

												To call Proteus a game would be selling it short. Much like Dear Esther, Proteus isn't so much a game, as it is an art piece. Unlike Dear Esther though, each viewing is different, your islands are randomly generated. The graphics and sound are all perfectly simplistic and work oh so well in tandem. The only interactions are your movements and discoveries through the beautifully pixelated world. The sound especially is the draw, changing to different soothing tones based off your surroundings and season. While it's possible to see everything in a single island, you'll want to keep coming back to view it in a different setting. If you find something that takes your breath away, you can share the postcard (F9 ingame) with friends to let them explore the same island. If you're at all interested in interactive art, Proteus is a must play.			"

												I just finished this game, and my first impression was more or less: ""WOAH..."" First things first, this is definetly not the kind of game for everyone. To be specific, a very narrow demographic would enjoy it. Theres a couple of things I felt that made it possible for me to play the whole game in one sitting (took about an hour to complete). 1. Play with friends, this game would be intolerable by yourself (maybe that's just me)2. You have to be the kind of person that is open minded, because if you're used to the status-quo when it comes to games, Proteus is not for you. Final Thoughts: If you allow it, this game will honestly change you. I gained a new respect for the beauty of nature, but more prominently, I felt like I had become a more Zen person. My patience level has skyrocketed, and I feel like I can better enjoy life and all its hidden meaning. Replay Value: There is none. I dont feel like I'll ever play again, or need to for that matter, but it was definetly fun while it lasted.Money Value: Not worth $10.			"

												Kind of like a 320x200 video game rendering of ""Koyaanisqatsi."" Not just because its primary appeal is its visuals, but also because of its pretty neat, procedurally generated, Phillip Glass-esque score. The primary mechanic is exploration and the combination of the audio and visuals make it play more like a sort of extended tone poem than a ""game,"" but there are interactive elements and new things to see and discover on different playthroughs. Not sure if there's enough there to warrant many play throughs, but it is incredibly....relaxing. Its cumulative effect is a bit like popping a couple valium and listening to one of those self-hypnosis relaxation tapes (which wouldn't be a compliment if referring to most games, but in Proteus' case it is). In fact, it's so relaxing that I kind of find the demand to control it to be a bit of an impediment at times. Someone needs to make an ""auto-wander"" mod for it so I could turn it on and veg out when I'm stressed or just fall asleep to it.			"

												Proteus. A great looking game with all of it's bright vibrant colours, amazing sounds and interesting landforms and animals. This game is good in that aspect but the downfalls can be obvious; expensive for what little it provides, no objective can make it a little boring, performance issues with non top of the line computers. These 3 things can ruin your experiance and can make you quit the game within 5 minutes. The game is beautiful to look at and and great to listen to. I would recommend this to casual gamers. People just looking for an experiance rather than an objective. I do give this more credit for being emotionally moving. If you have bought the game and havn't played it, playing it at night for the first time will improve your experience, with headphones and no interuptions also.So if you're rich and have a good computer, throw money at Proteus and give it a shot.

												Number one; this is an intensely buggy game. All it did for the first few months of my owning it was crash almost immediately when it was opened. It was only through some vague whim that I happened to try and load it again ages after purchasing it.While I fear I will be accused of missing the point, I must admit to finding Proteus utterly pointless. It is less a game, than a screen-saver and must be regarded as unfinished, laziness, as opposed to avant-garde, 'higher-meaning', indie game. Not all games need a crude starting line and a goal, but they need something more than the Emeperors Clothes that this game is evidently adorned in. Proteus is a meandering and ultimately unnecessary experience for anyone to have. It's only use might be to gently ease people back into society after some horrible, drug-addled. breakdown, but it's certainly not as a videogame. When you finally exit Proteus, the pixels make for an eye-closing animation; but my real eyes had already done that long ago. It was like a trip to the shops, only with less to show for it; I could have got a pint of milk during all of that pointlessness.			"

												Proteus is basically an island you can generate with your computer. There's a full range of plants and animals, a handful of landmarks, and a couple of secrets and surprises. Although there isn't much to do in Proteus, the procedurally generated landscape, fudgy graphics, and kaleidoscopic sound occasionally come together into something worth bearing witness to. If nothing else, Proteus can be enjoyed passively and functions well as a palette cleanser.There also exists a free mod called Purgateus, which uses alternate graphics and sound to create a darker setting.

												This game's very design--from the curious yet delightful sounds, soft and pleasant colors, and soul-quelling music, to the way the player's screen enters and exits the game like eyes slowly opening and closing--is meant to be strongly reminiscent of a dream; a beautiful, subjective dream. A dream where the more you get lost within, the more you get lost within your own thoughts. Abandon the day-to-day burdens of goals, duties, tasks, competition, opposition, and reward--the values that our workaholic, robotic, and disconnected society holds so dear. Abandon those--just for a few moments, and take the time to bask yourself into consciousness within another plane. Take the time to simply... be.			"

												It's not really a game so much as it is an adventure. It's not meant to be played, it's meant to be explored. This game can only be fun if you take it with an open mind. Absorb the surroundings, see what things make what sounds. The point is to feel like a child exploring the forest. See something interesting? walk towards it. Found a circle of totem poles? Try and find out if they do something. Herd of pink chickens? Chase them! Sure, the graphics do take away from the experience (I think if it had mor realistic graphics I'd feel more inclined to explore), but it's an experience all the same. Also, play more than once. More things seem to appear the more you often you play.I find it to be overpriced, I reccomend if on sale.			"

												This game is without a doubt absolutely magical. Sure, from a technical stand point, it is not that graphically impressive, but once you're in the game, and begin to experience all the wonders this has to offer, it will quickly no longer matter. This game invokes an almost child-like sense of discovery, something I haven't felt replicated in many other, if any. The adaptive/procedural musical score is also a massive plus for this. You're immersed not only in your discoveries, but in the ambience as well. It's somewhat difficult to call this a game, as there are no objectives or end goals, but it is still absolutely lovely nonetheless. Definitely recommended.			"

												This game is different. It's not about gameplay in my opinion but more about an experience. You start of-shore next to an island. You walk to that island and then what? You don't have much to do but walk. But then what made me get 95 minutes of play time? I turned up my volume on my headset and enjoy the audio. What I like about this game is that you open it and you look... You basicly look around and watch the environment around you.You can find alot of stuff in the randomly generated world. You see statues and stones and you can watch the rain fall down. Or you can find animals jumping around or flying around.It's really immersive and exciting to play through the first time.Ontop of that it's calming... You start it up on a stressful day and you relax.I recommend this game because it's cheap and it's short... That's usually not a good combination but depending on your reasoning to buy this game it can be. Personally I bought it because I needed a game I could relax with. But it's also not worth 19,99€I opened the game and played a bit and then closed it... I never got to the final ""level"" before today. It was truly an experience to look at how the game changes while you play. I'm glad I got this game and I will probably load it up more.			"

 For those who love music Personally, I enjoy this game. I absolutely love video game soundtracks, however, this soundtrack is different. Typically, video game soundtracks are something on the side. The music plays in the background or it may be a part of an event in the game. Let's use  Skyrim  and its soundtrack as an example representing most other games. The soundtrack to that game is my favorite soundtrack ever, but it isn't interactive. Songs play in certain areas and play for certain events (like battles). Proteus  is different. Everything around you is part of the sountrack you create simply by being around those objects. Everytime you play, the soundtrack changes. You won't experience the same soundscape twice. That's something I enjoy. The music is very relaxing and there aren't really any objectives. I think that's a good thing. With games like  Minecraft  (another game with a beautiful soundtrack) there aren't really any set objectives or goals. You're just there in the world and you can do whatever you'd like, but the soundtrack is just an added part of the game. It isn't integral to the game. With  Proteus,  the sounds are everything. It's basically the point of it all.Nothing is perfect, so I do have a problem with this game. There are options to play older versions of this game, which is fantastic. The problem I have is that there aren't many options to choose from. There are the versions after the full 1.0 release, and a beta...  just one. I wish there were more beta versions that I could play. There is a particular version that I wish to play (the February 2012 version) because I prefer certain cound effects in that version over the ones in the newer versions. I came to know about this game through that version and that's the  Proteus  I fell in love with.Overall, I enjoy this game. Some might not call it a game, but I certainly do. It's definitely not for everyone, though. If you like relaxing games or ambient music, then this game is a good choice.			"

												Retro visuals are the whole point of the game, there's really nothing else here to enjoy but the sound (so raise your volume). That said, the visuals feel half-done. They started to make something aesthetically interesting but didn't take it all the way. Exploration starts off exciting, then you start to realize how empty and flat the content is.~16 minutes of playtime for me.Rating: D+			"

												immerse youself in a world of color and of seasons, take a break from all those competitive games, all those griding games, this is a game where you wander around chasing a rabbit or seeing whats on the top of a mountain, a game with some curiosity and mystery to it because there is actually a sort of way to 'beat' this game and some hidden stuff but honestly you don't even have to be aware of that stuff to enjoy it i dont think i got what you were supposed to do for a while but thats the beauty of it you dont know, your just walking around and its like oh hey maybe if i do this something will happen its a very different experience from most video games its more of a thing to hop into and expereince every now and then more than anything			"

												I remember buying this on a whim and man oh man, was it worth every dollar I spent. You begin in the water close to an island where you are greated with cheeping birds and croaking frogs, among all sorts of other wildlife, in the beginning of Spring. Your task is simple: Explore the world and find its treasures, and move through the seasons as the environment changes from happy and cheery to overcast, still environment. If you want a game you can play to relax  with, give Proteus a try.			"

												I find this game strangely cool. It's not what you might traditionally consider a game. There's no real goal.The graphics are ""simple"", at least in the sense of resolution and complexity of shaders, colours and texture. Yet it's beautiful in its low-res simplicity.The exploration aspect of the game, is surprisingly interesting, and the game is very calming.			"

Discover captivating little nooks in the wilderness. Watch the seasons change. Realize that the bleakness of winter is actually the gentle tug of serenity. Bask in the solitude.			"

												It's 5:39 am and I haven't slept yet and I need to do (more) productive stuff around 8 am (excuse my spelling). Proteus was a game I was excited by when I learned about it which was a long while ago. It's been at least a year or two since I heard about it and I got it on the summersausagesales. I liked it. It was rather immersive and the sfx was fantastic with the stuff you could interact with. I think I do wish there was more you could interact with and that my first playthrough would be longer and more eventful (but it was still mindblowing) I did very much enjoy this game. It affected my dreams when I went to bed the day of playing the game. Maybe I'll write more about this game soon but this is my basic review of Proteus. I don't recommend getting it for full price since I found the game to be short though.			"

All joking aside, if you are the kind of person who enjoys exploring environments, feeling the mood, the atmosphere, the visual and sound immersion and feel moving around in pretty landscapes is its own reward, regardless of whichever brownie points a game might give you for exploring, you will find this gratifying. I just... definitely did not expect getting creeped out as often as I did, neither from the screenshots nor from the reviews. But it's very mild, even for someone like me who gets scared extremely, embarrassingly easily, and it does add to the experience.There is a lot of detail and thought put into processing things with your senses. I found it surprising how well the game manages to communicate other types of sensory input via sight and sound only; for instance, looking at directly at the sun is very uncomfortable and something you'll find yourself avoiding doing, same with messing with a swarm of bees. The transitions in sound are very subtle yet effective, and feels like part of a coherent whole.If feeling an environment isn't your thing, don't buy it. Otherwise it's worth it.			"
