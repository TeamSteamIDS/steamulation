												My 6 & 8yo really enjoyed the movie and are having a blast ""playing"" the movie (like most LEGO games based on LEGO movies). To them, it adds more to Emmet's and WildStyle's stories. Plus they have to cooperate, take turns picking up items and work together as a team to achieve each stage's goal (we've dual controllers on our SteamOS/Windows SteamBox-MediaPC). Basically, they have to practice patience, not being bossy telling the other to do something, asking the other for an assist (even swapping controllers), etc. Watching them play and work together this way as a parent is so worth the sale price.

In short, is the game good?Yes, it's very good.Is it worth my time and money?Yes it is. Although, if you're having doubts about paying full price, I'd strongly suggest to wait for a -50% sale.Is this game for anyone?Yes. The game can be enjoyed by both kids and adults.Linear, open-world or something else?The game uses hub worlds which house connected, individual levels. Very reminiscent of late 90s platformer games. There's a lot of stuff to do in each hub world and the connected levels. Expect around 10-13 hours of playtime to reach the ending and around 20-24 hours to 100% the game.Gameplay mechanics, gimmicks?Pretty varied but all challenges and puzzle are based around LEGO. Each minifig has a specific ability that you'll have to use in order to progress throughout the level. There are some fun minigames sprinkled around the levels, in just enough quantity to keep the player interested.Graphical aesthetics, set pieces and world design?The game looks pleasant to the eye. Level design is varied, rich with little details. Graphical fidelity could be slightly better but it does its job.Audio design and soundtrack?Sound effects are decent. Character voices sounds alright in most cases (with the exception of a few lines of dialogue that sound rather silly). Soundtrack is interesting and uses tracks from the movie. Oddly enough, Batman's ""no parents"" song from the movie seems to be replaced with a generic drumstep wub-a-thon, for some strange reason (licensing issues maybe?).Plot, story?You play as over-night-chosen-one Emmet (and friends) trying to stop President Business from ruling the world. The game closely follows the story of the movie, although it expands the first two acts of the movie and shortens the 3rd act into just a few levels. This actually works in favour of the game, as you're able to explore more of the areas that were hastily rushed through in the movie. In theory, you could just play the game without watching the movie as the story is explained pretty well in the game. Still, I'd personally recommend watching the movie first.How does the game run?Runs without any issues on my 5 year old PC (Dual-Core 2.66GHz, GeForce 9600GT, 2GB RAM) on 1920x1080 resolution with SSAO and V-Sync turned off. No jittering, no sudden framerate drops. Loading times are usually pretty short. Expect way better perfomance on newer machines than mine.Any details, character, motif, etc. you particularly liked?Yes, the ""Bonus Room"" is a very cool touch.Anything you didn't like?The game suffers from some really weird collision and clipping bugs. Didn't break the game for me but it was annoying at times, forcing me to restart a level at some point. Also, the minifig selection screen is a mess and doesn't explain which minifig has which ability.Final score?I give The LEGO Movie Videogame a double-decker couch out of 5. "

												As a huge fan of the movie and Lego games in general, I got to say this entry into the Lego series by Traveller's Tales is one of the weaker ones. The game's campaign follows the movie closely and each level is based off a key scene from the movie, like Lego Lord of the Rings or Lego Star Wars. In those levels is a fun mix of puzzle solving and platforming using different characters with unique abilities. It's essentially what we've come to expect from all the Lego games up to this point. What makes this one different is that it's actually tying in with a new movie, not just based upon an old franchise. Fortunately, it's tying in with a movie about Legos, a perfect fit. But the syndrome of movie tie-in games rears it's ugly head into The Lego Movie Videogame. It feels more rushed than previous Lego games, like the designers are stretching out scenes in the movie to go on for a 20-30 minute level. It feels like they're padding the game out to be much longer than it should be, and that creates boredom. This reminds me of the Lego games on the Nintendo DS, where the levels are padded out with extremely repetitive puzzles and and button-mashy combat sequences. It's a shame too because I was really looking forward to this game. In terms of everything else, the music and graphics are fantastic and fit the style of the movie perfectly. This is one pretty looking game and is the first of the TT Lego games to be entirely made of Legos, so that's nice. Unfortunately, the core gameplay feels scaled back and TT just gave us the bare minimum, even the open world part of game is contained of small chunks instead of one big world. Really, the game is not bad, I would recommend it if you like the previous Lego games or really enjoyed the movie, it just isn't solid as previous Lego games.UPDATE 12/2/14 - I actually have grown a soft spot for the game so far. I still find Lego City Undercover and Lego Marvel better, but I love the source material so much that, it's hard for me to look at it as the weakest (Lego Indy 2 and Star Wars 3 are much worse), it gets better, trust me.

												Iv just started playing this game im on like lvl 4 or 5 and im so glad i bought this game. The levels are alot shorter than most of the other lego games so you move through it very fast but you can go back and free play and explore and get everything. Which is fun even after compeleting the level. There is a lego charm about this game that i dont think iv ever seen from any of the others, its fun just being in the game itfeels like your playing in a real lego world. I would recommend thisd to anyone who like video games. Id give 9/10			"

												Awesome games,  play exactly like you imagine. It's a lego game that follow the story of the movie. Each cutscene is directly took from the movie. For the gameplay, I heard some people says it looks like minecraft, but i't doesn't. It's a Lego Game and it exactly the same formula it always been. The game's funny, beautiful and is a BLAST when playing in couch co-op. If you were on the edge about buying yet another Lego Game, buy it now!			"

												Generous with its content, The LEGO Movie Videogame goes through repeating the entire movie through cutscences and gameplay.  Its wonderful for completionists who hunt for every single pickup they can find.  Its kid friendly, has local co-op, and most importantly it has steam achievements.  Its definitely a game you can get hooked on until completion.  It has hours of gameplay, all the humor of the movie, and you won't lose interest halfway through.   The DLC is not needed to 100% the achievements.			"

												Ahh lego, who doesn't have a soft spot for it.If you are new to the series don't let the appearance fool you. While the gameplay is simple in nature it's still very enjoyable for all age groups. Great blend of action and puzzles. Keeping to the tried and tested formula you swap between 2 or more characters (if playing solo). Each character will receive different costumes throughout the story, every costume changes the abilities you can use. Puzzles usually require use of all characters combining abilities to complete the task. Controls are simple and effective, though as with all lego games I would definitely recommend playing with a gamepad (or two).Levels are a little shorter then some of the previous titles, but they do manage to fit a lot of action into each 'scene'. Upon completion you will unlock each of these for freeplay mode (open world). Length of the game gets extended quite a bit because as you progress through the game unlocking more characters, you can use these and return to past levels finding new areas and secrets you couldn't access earlier. Each level is a scene reenacted from the movie while cutscenes are copied directly from the movie itself, though they blend in well with the gameplay.Graphically speaking it looks the part and performance is great overall. The artstyle helps a lot with the humour too which is classic tongue-in-cheek lego. Both adults and children should find it amusing on different levels. Game supports a range of video settings covering some higher end setups, eg, basic AA, 1440p+, 120hz+, DoF toggle etc.  (small note: at the time of writing you need to load into the game itself to change graphic options). No fps caps in place here either folks.Voicework is top notch, all the official voice actors are used and I'm almost certain they managed to get some new lines written too.Does make me sad each time a new lego game is released and it doesn't have online co-op support though. That would be the only small downside. Having played most of them now I can honestly say the last several have been brilliant. LOTR, Marvel and now The Lego Movie Videogame are all well worth picking up, particually if you have a children or friend nearby for some couch co-op. Solo play is a still an absolute blast, don't hear me wrong. ;)Bonus Tip: If you can't see the game for purchase on your local storepage. Try this link. http://store.steampowered.com/widget/267530/ "

												Traveler's Tales again offers a fun game for all ages.  This game offers 15 levels that span the movie's storyline.  The levels are filled with collectables that give you construction manuals so you can move the level forward or give you other collectibles that help you get extra abilities or special construction manuals that you can only use in the final hub of the game.Overall, this game plays like most other movie related games like Star Wars and Indiana Jones.  However, not everyone like the Lego Movie, so this may not be as attractive for some as it would be for others.  My kids loved this more than me, yet I enjoyed the Star Wars and Indiana Jones games more.  However, the game and graphics are just as good, just as fun, and just as long.I did find a few glitches here in this game that I had not found in other games.  Though, reloading a level or a hub easily fixed my issue.Definitely a fun game that I'd recommend to you, especially if you have kids that play with you.			"

												Well, even a mediocre Lego game is still above average overall. This one's short. It's got some bugs, but most Lego games do.  Honestly? This game is OK. It follows the movie fairly well, but there are points of divergence. And more than just ""makes for a better video game"". There are parts that honestly felt like it was an earlier draft of the movie. Which wouldn't surprise me. The game was released the same day the movie hit theaters. That strikes me as a bad idea. You haven't given the movie time to build interest in the game, and the parallel development means that if a change is made for the movie, the game lags behind. This was most noticeable with the cut scenes. They were taken from the movie, but the music is wrong - when it exists at all. Music is added fairly late in the film, and it's entirely possible that the scenes were sent to the game before the music was complete. The music that does exist smacks of ""temp tracks"". It's just not good, doesn't fit. One scene in particular, taken from the movie, references a specific song.. that's not in the game. Which makes that cut-scene particularly awkward. It has an interesting mechanic in the swapping of pants. You can unlock pants that give you an effect in game. There's only a couple effects that actually make any real difference. And it's more ""good idea, bad execution"" than anything else. The fact that some of the pants are only available via codes found with the Lego sets for the movie troubles me. Not that the codes are hard to find. I'm sure they were online the day the sets were released, if not sooner. I don't really mind it for something like the alternate character model that the DVD/Blu-Ray comes with a code for, since that's purely cosmetic (though it does give access to a character and thus its abilities sooner). The pants, on the other hand, do have an effect on the game. Again, only one has any major impact, and there's a similar - but not exact - pair in the game you can unlock. Maybe I'm just being a curmudgeon here, I have nothing really against cross promotion in general. As long as it's cosmetic. Overall? Well, the game was on sale, so it's not like I paid anywhere near full price for it. And I certainly got my 'money's worth' out of it. But, on sale is really the only time I would recommend this particular game. Especially given the quality of others in the series, such as Lego Star Wars III and Lego Marvel Superheroes.  Still, if you are looking for more Lego games to feed your addiction, this one can fill the gap nicely.			"

												Here's a way to sum this game up:Performance- 10/10 (Works 100% Amazing)Graphics - 8/10 ( It depends on the graphics card so it's not the creators fault.) Dialogue- 10/10 (I love to hear the characters voices instead of them mumbling.)Texture Details- 10/10 (Game features look absolutely amazing.) (Controller) Controls - 9.5 (Great controls but when I enter the steam overlay, it adds another player to the game.)(Keyboard) Controls- 7/10 (Not the greatest or easiest controls but still very useful when you do not have a controller. The game still is fine with the keyboard but may be confusing to use. Screen Resolution- 10/10 ( Works perfectly with my computer screen and the video settings can be changed to the highest setting without any crashes or many problems.[Could probably do the same for others.]  Comedy - 10/10 (Extremely hilarious, the characters are very funny.)Gameplay - 8/10 (Nice and long levels but not enough of them, I would love to play Lego game that would have a lot of levels so I don't finish in one day.Free Roam - 10/10 (Drive cars, knock over people, and change into tons of different characters.)Price - 8/10 (Expensive, but it's the usual price. I got this for 4.99 and It feels worth 19.99.)Emmet - 10/10 (Hilarious as ever.)Hints- 9.5/10 (Good and helpful hints but could use some more details.)Overall: ITS OVAR 9000!!!!			"

												Not the best Lego game, but still a pretty good one. You can even play as Superman and Batman. Game is shorter than the other Lego games. Had trouble sometimes trying to figure out what had to be done, but nothing frustrating. I believe you should watch the movie first, you will understand the game better if you do so. I missed the HUB very much. If you want to replay a level you have to walk around the world and find it. A little irritating but you do get past it easy enough. Good game overall. 7 out of 10.

												Basically, it's a Lego Game, this time based on the Lego Movie instead of a different license and one of the strenght in a lego game is the humour at having lego characters replaying iconic scenes from movies, like Indiana Jones or Star Wars, and in this case, it kind of falls flat because it is already a movie full of humour. That aside, it's a good game, there is some new things that gives a bit of variety inside this whole franchise (Like the dancing or the building with guide) and I did enjoy it a lot. Also, it's a good thing there is no races in this game because the handling of cars is horrendous.			"

												Lord Business, also in his realm called President Business, is a perfectionist with a masterplan to use a secret weapen called Kragle (glue) to make whole world pernament, perfect without errors, but there are rebels - masterbuilders, from other realms, who would do everything to stop him. Masterbuilders believe to a prophecy spoken by an old wizzard Vitrius. Prophecy claims there is a speacial one, someone who will find a Piece of Resistance and stop Lord Business, who would expect that the one will not be a masterbuilder, but an ordinary construction worker called Emmet. Emmet follows the instructions, loves President Business and his favourite song is Everything is Awesome like everyones' else in Bricksburg, but it feels like he doesn't fit. He doesn't know that everything is going to change...It's kinda fun, it's like a movie, but much longer than usual 90 minutes. The game offers a good and interesting story, but gameplay isn't so fantastic and after few levels has nothing new to offer.6.5 /10			"

												By now you should know that if you've ever played a Lego game before that this new one brings nothing new to the table. It focuses on the movie, which is great by the way, and it's split up in 15 missions. There's no true open world this time; there are hubs that can be freely explored with many of the characters, but they're not connected to each other. It isn't all that bad, but I can see why people don't like it this way. In fact, all the hubs could've been connected with a bit of creativity. Just sayin'.The world is built entirely from Lego blocks which looks really cool. It fits the style of the movie perfectly. The graphics are, again, the same as all the other Lego games; colorful and sharp. The game in general performs well, but there were a few times where the framerate dropped for a few seconds.A big part of the sounds and music were also taken from the movie, including the catchy 'Everything is awesome' song.As far as gameplay is concerned, there are a few new tricks. Building stuff with blueprints has potential, but isn't really all that fun. It needs more polish and people should be able to build stuff from scratch, instead of selecting the correct blocks. The master builder move looks great in motion and even though you don't really do anything it's still nice to do and watch.About the missions. Each missions lasts about 15-45 minutes, and it can take much longer than that if you want to collect everything. Collecting everything will take you tens of hours. Finishing the game by just completing the missions will take you about 4-5 hours max. That's pretty short for a Lego game. I'm not the kind to collect and complete all things, but even I thought it was short in comparison to the other games. To be honest, I don't really mind. Every Lego game has the same gameplay and it's quickly wearing thin. Give us something completely new, or add enough new stuff to make it special again. Special and fun, like Lego is supposed to be. In the meantime, this will do. Just don't play it before watching the movie first.[Rating: 72/100]			"

												If you are a fan of LEGO games, then you are probably going to love this. With a plot loosely based around The Matrix, it features some fantastic sequences, like a high-speed pursuit on a futuristic bike. As Wyldstyle (the female Trinity-esque protagonist) jumps from one vehicle to another while being pursued by the bad guys, it uses LEGO's two character co-op format brilliantly. Matrix 2, eat your hat! Early on though, a lot of the 'action' does involve building and demolition in the construction world. It's a clear nod to the real-world LEGO and you even have to seek out the instructions for the builds. These are identical to the type of instruction leaflets packed with real boxes of LEGO, on of many nice little touches to the game. I haven't watched the movie yet, but it's likely it pretty much recreates most of the scenes from the movie, as previous LEGO movie-tie-ins have. This time of course, with it being LEGO's very own product and movie, they have free reign to go nuts, throwing everything at you like a bucketload of trademarked plastic bricks. It also continues the trend of featuring humorous dialogue and sight gags. It's probably the funniest of all the LEGO games, and quite possibly the best. You rush through plenty of different themed LEGO worlds in the multiverse, donning some nifty apparel, which changes from location to location. There are as usual, plenty of characters to unlock, or purchase in the game. It doesn't really scream originality, with the usual tasks of collecting many, many hidden items  in an attempt to add replayability. It does pretty much what previous LEGO games have done before, but it does this very well, and is nicely graphically polished. Those who avoid LEGO games won't find much here to change their opinion. But fans will simply enjoy the ride. And the annoyingly catchy ""Everything is Awesome"" song will be rolling around your head for days after. 9/10			"

												While not inherently a bad game, this is probably the worst of the main Lego games and should only really be an option for you to play if you've played all the rest and just want more. The story feels stretched out to reach the same old 15 level structure, there's more bugs than any other Lego game, and there's not much to do in the hub worlds. The only major draw I'd say this game has is the worlds are made entirely of Lego bricks instead of the usual style and is very nice to look at. If you love the Lego games and just want 1 more to fill up your library, go for it. Otherwise check out Lego Marvel Super Heroes or Lord of the Rings instead of this one.			"

												Lego the movie is a game that combines Mark Ecco's Getting Up, 1984, and of course Legos all into one super fun game!  Join the resistance and start the revolution by taking on the super nefarious Lord Business and his diabolical plot to strip the world of imagination!The game like past PC titles utilizes hubs where you can go around building things.  The story is great with outstanding voice acting, and impressive visuals.  The mechanics are the same as past lego games, getting gold bricks, and such, so there is replay value.  The game is based on the movie so is shorter in gameplay than other games.  There is no doubt people who play this will have fun, if you like to have fun playing games, this would be a good game to own.  EVERYTHING IS AWESOME!!Best Version:

												Did you play any lego game that came out after Lego Star Wars? Did you watch The Lego Movie?If you answered yes to both those questions, you probably shouldn't buy this game. It's the standard Tt Lego formula applied to a drect adaptation of the Lego Movie. If you never played a lego game (Or just really love Tt's Lego games), this might serve as interesting. I'd still rather the movie over the game, but some people may think otherwise.Since I can't say ""I reccomend this game to some people"", I'm just giving it a ""yes I'd reccomend it""			"

												The LEGO Movie game is just like any other LEGO game, except for once it caters to people who actually like playing with LEGOS. Instead of just breaking stuff and combining it into whatever you need, now sometimes you need to find instructions for more complex LEGO creations and then play a mini-game that gets you more involved with the building and let's you appreciate how much effort goes into these creations a bit more.The ""job"" system also caters a bit more to real LEGO fans since the jobs are the kind you get from normal LEGO sets, firemen, builders, wild west gunmen and cops.The real difference from other LEGO games is the ""completionist"" part. This game ""only"" has 75 gold brick, but after the nightmare of collecting the brutal 250 gold bricks in LEGO Marvel, this is a much less frustrating and more fun experience.Gone are the terrible racing games that were either too easy or too hard, gone are the overly long and convoluted quests for a measly gold brick. This is something I sincerely welcome and I really hope this stays this way.You only have to get all the collectibles and all the rest of the gold bricks are in the bonus room, that's it and that's how I hope it stay for the next game.The fact that I'm probably going to buy a LEGO set after playing this game speaks volumes on how this game is about the love for LEGOs.

												I absolutely loved this game. I'm a fan of Lego games anyways, but this one was just hilarious. I feel that it could have been a bit longer, but has good replay value since I finished the main story and only have a 39.5% completion status!! Overall, VERY good game, worth the money.			"

												After playing nearly every one to date, I can safely say that this is by far my favourite LEGO game. Pros:-The writing is perfect and the humour exactly like the movie-The gameplay is simple yet engaging, constantly changing the pace and mechanics to prevent boredom-Each characters voice actor make a return from the movies in this game, adding to the true charm of it all-Animations and style is much more true to real LEGO than any other game, with stiff movement emphasising the fact that they are just toys-Levels that directly follow the movie, adding more to it while still feeling relatable and not just ""filler""-Appropriate length; not too short yet not too long that it becomes stale in any way.-Very high replay value-That bonus level; A true guilty-pleasure to me!Cons:-For some reason all cutscene and game music is different from that from the movie, even the lovable ""Everything Is Awesome"" is altered negatively. - .... That's it really...From start to finish I enjoyed every moment, captivating me like no other LEGO game could do, and forcing me to play just one more level even though I told myself I'd get off 3 levels ago. If you're in any way a fan of LEGO games, the LEGO movie, or just LEGO in general; I can't recommend this game enough.			"

												I've played my fair share of LEGO video games, from Star Wars to Batman, to Indiana Jones. But The LEGO Movie easily comes out on top, possibly because I loved The LEGO Movie too much. It feels like a true LEGO game, with literally EVERYTHING made out of colorful bricks, just like in the film. Which is amazing to see. The cutscenes are taken from the fantastic movie itself, revealing the plot, and going along with the gameplay. On that note, the game IS based on the movie, so it feels rather short in some areas or levels.The characters are all voiced by voice actors that sound just like the original cast, which I was shocked to find out, because they sound so much like the original characters from the movie! I hardly noticed! It's really funny to hear them talk, and say a lot of really clever lines. It's all written up to standard! On the subject of charcters, there's many many different characters to choose from! Including about 3 or 4 different Unkittys which was awesome! There's also a few superheroes from a certain company that you'll enjoy playing as! I guarantee!So, if you enjoy the LEGO line of games, or really enjoyed the movie, get this fantastic game by TT! It's a lot of fun playing with friends, and you'll be sure to have yourself a really special experience that no other Steam game has brought. Maybe Portal or Half Life. But you get the idea!You'll freakin' love The LEGO Movie game! Everything is Awesome, after all!			"

This is first LEGO game I played since lego star wars and it was quite enjoyable ride. I know that those games are basically the same, with same gameplay, just different franchises, but it is nice to play one once in a while anyway.			"

												Excellent graphics, good gameplay, it's a well made port of the Xbox One/PS4 versions of the game. It's fun for all ages. Best of all it doesn't take much to run this game. My current system I was using uses 8GB DDR3 RAM, Intel i7 860 with an Nvidia GeForce GT 630 card and it ran it at 60 to even 90 FPS. It never dipped below 60 even in prolong use. What really surprised me about this game is that is features all the original voice actors of the movie like: Will Ferrell, Chris Pratt, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, Charlie Day, Elizabeth Banks, etc. They are all here with new lines just for the video game. That really impressed me. The gameplay does get repetitive at times but it's all fun. My only complaint is that their is not much to do after you beat the game unless you want to go for achievements. Also the game plays a bit wonky with keyboard/mouse. I highly recommend playing this game with a gamepad instead. It's a 7.5/10 for me.			"

												I own all or most of the Lego games, finished a fair few of them. I figured the Lego Movie game would be right at the top of the quality list but so far (after a few hours play) it's been rather - meh. I wish I could give it a neutral rating but since that's impossible, I'm going to give it a not recommended. The main reason to play the Lego games is the fun of the grind, because you will grind a lot. So you have enjoyable humour and fast action within that grind. This game fails then in two ways.1) The comedy is weak. It's not bad, but it's just rare and repeated.2) The unskipable cutscenes on free play.Compare this to say the great Lego Batman or Marvel franchises or LOTR, all of which really got the humour and grind right. Play any of those instead.			"

Product received for free
Introduction:The game itself is good, it's basically the Lego movie told in a video game and that's a great idea, also, because it's a Lego game, some cinematic moments are really fun and this is cool !I finished it at 100% with all achievements in 18.5 hours but I took my time so it can be easily finished in 15 or 16 hours only, so the lifetime of the game is really short and poor for a game that was released in 2014...I got this product for free, one of my friend have gifted me it, but I'd not have paid this game 20€, it don't really worth it. So if you want it, take it when it's on sale for 4.99€ !Advantages:-The graphic quality is really good actually. -The character diversity is good, there is many types of abilities for every characters, some can hack, shoot lasers, dynamites or even fly... (and there is way more abilities). And there is, like in a lot of Lego games, some customizable characters which is nice but not really usefull.-The fact that you can choose your characters in the full character grid whenever in a level is awesome (free play), in older games like Lego Star Wars The Complete Saga it wasn't possible.-The red bricks are only in the lobbies which is nice so the lobbies are not only here to walk around and the previous ""in level"" red bricks are replaced with pants which is a good reference to the movie with the ""Where are my pants ?"" show. The other things to colect in the levels are the golden instruction pages which are used to, at the end, build special things in the bonus room.-Every pants that you can equip has their own effects, like destroying everything, exploding, dancing, etc...Disadvantages:-Sadly on some stages that I found too long, I was a bit bored but I felt that only in 1 stage out of 15 so that's still ok.-The free camera system is well made for lobbies but not in levels, and that's really pity.-The bonus room is fun to build your things with the golden instructions, the 10 gold bricks are fun to get but the 1 million studs things is honestly too easy, for example, I had fun completing the 2 similar levels in Lego Star Wars TCS, they took me 30 minutes each.-Sometimes crashes (still rare).-It don't really worth 20€.For those who wants to know, there is:-15 levels,-96 characters,-20 red bricks,-70 gold bricks,-75 gold instruction pages,-15 pants.Other:I can highly recommend you playing this game with a controller because of some phases like when Emmet need to do constructions following instructions, it can really be easier than with a keyboard.The Steam achievements with this game are also nice to achieve, some are fun and are references to the movie (48 achievements).And for the peoples who wants to do speedruns of this game, you can but it will be hard to do in short times because of unskippable little cinematics and construction phases.I had only some problems while doing alt+tab twice, the game crashed but that's not really frequent.Rating:My rating: 8/10.If you read it, thank you ۩ THE_Incinerate ۩ ◕ω◕ !

												I'm a fan of the Lego game series in general, but this one tops them all. It's like a mash-up of all the previous games combined with all your favorite characters and a ton of new ones. It even introduces some new game mechanics like the hacking mini-game and pants collecting. I haven't seen the movie yet, but I felt like I did after completing the game.  The cut-scenes I believe are taken right from the movie which gave the game a more cinematic experience. As such it contains a ton of spoilers, so if you are worried about that I suggest watching the movie first.			"

												Saddly, I have not yet watched The Lego Movie so a Pre/Post-Watching the movie review.Firstly, I loved the first Lego game, Star Wars, it was awesome and innovative. I also enjoyed all of the rest of the lego games. So far, I am enjoying this game and have not yet found any issues nor bugs so far. (so far :D )Multiplayer WiseWell, not suprising it is fun as hell. They brought back the split screen, in which, works great as I like to go my way and my son likes going his way unless team work is involved. Movie WiseI have heard, if your a ""I don't remember.."" or ""That didn't happen ..."" then you won't like the game. My toughts, for Star Wars, they had 6 movies; For Harry Potter, they had 6 movies; for Pirates of the Caribean, the had 3 movies,;  overall they had a boatload of content to create levels etc and as for the Batman and Marvel ones, well decades of comic book lore. With the Lego Movie, they had 1 movie that was about what 2 hours or less. They had to embellish certain area and add certain things. Really who cares.... The game is great, my opinion won't change even after watching the movie this weekend. My son and I are enjoying the game, even more than the past ones.			"

												ꜛ Keyboard controls are fine for a big kid, maybe a bit hard for a child, but the gamepad is fantastic for the wee-ones.  ꜜ Audio is dubbed imitation voice actors, but they're doing a hell of impression.  The cutscenes are re-dubs, you can tell which ones they spent more time on :]ꜛ Graphics are what you'd expect from the Lego series.  One reviewer said they look ""too Wii-ish.."" ... I think they mean the textures are bland? that's Lego's style.. plastic.. and shiny :)ꜛ My 4 year old had a blast free-roaming or co-op'ing with me.  Local MP, dynamic split screen, drop in/out, was impressed with the MP.♪ Rated 4 white heads out of 5. ♫( ☺ ☺ ☺ ☺ / ☺ ☺ ☺ ☺ ☺ )/\ /\

												In a way, this game is both a condensed version and an expanded version of the film. It's condensed in that a lot of parts from the film (told via cutscenes) are either shortened or taken out (in fact, one part of what makes the final act so great is taken out entirely), and it's expanded in that the levels themselves are extended versions of scenes that happen in the film.Even so, it's still a great game if you're as big of a fan of the LEGO games as I am. But please, watch the movie first before you purchase this. Trust me, it's worth the 100 minutes of your time and it'll increase your enjoyment of this game.			"

												This may actually be one of my favourite lego games. I love the added features like the Building Instructions and the Pacman-style hacking mini-game which are both really fun and break up the casual gameplay which can get boring after a while. I also really like the level design which means the game is not too difficult but easy enough that I can keep on playing and is the only Lego game I\'ve played so far that I literally couldn\'t put down. I\'m also not a big fan of the massively open-world Lego games as I can easily get lost and I won\'t know where to go but this game shows where to go easily. The only criticism I would give is that the setting menu is lacking, especially for PC users but this is present throughout all of the Lego games. The default keys are also lacking but I also have my own setup which works for me as well as a controller which I sometimes use. I also couldn\'t find the resolution settings in game which I think should be more obvious as I ended up playing in the wrong one for half of the game. I also came across a few bugs but they weren\'t game breaking and didn\'t require me to restart the level (like Uni-kitty getting stuck in places, but this was easily fixed by just jumping out, even thought it took a while). Overall I do recommend this game to people who like Lego games as it does offer a slightly different formula to the original games we all know and love and I would love to see this same formula reused again (perhaps using the same characters but with a new story?)

												One of my favorite LEGO games. I have enjoyed almost all of the LEGO games growing up. The ones I played were LEGO Star Wars 1 & 2, and the Complete Saga, and LEGO Indiana Jones. A huge improvement and change from those LEGO games. This game in particular has many voice actors, many characters, a lot of missions, and so much more. The storyline does have some funny parts in it as well.			"

												All I can say is if you liked the Lego movie and the other lego games DON'T buy this game...I just don't get how awesome movie + great developed game series = this - it just doesn't make any sense. Granted I have only played it briefly, but that's only because that is all I could take. You are much better off With Lego Marvel, Pirates, Lord of the Rings or any of the other wonderful lego games out there. And if you've played them all, hey just go play them again!EDIT: I've played through more of this since first writing this review and I still wouldn't recommend it - however for the steam sale price it's probably not too bad... just to answer compujosh - the main things I had a problem with were the overall sloppiness of the graphics (half the lego textures in the cowboy world were UPSIDE DOWN on the model amongst many other inconsistencies) the puzzles were painfully simple, rather boring and it all just felt very rushed. Also visually the choice to use actual movie footage as opposed to recreating the movie scenes with real-time animations as they have done in EVERY other lego games led to a disparity between the cut scenes and the real time play which I found quite jarring - it generally made the game look even worse every time you jumped back in..Anyway that's my rant. If you're buying this for a kid they probably won't notice or care about the things that annoy me, but think twice if you're buying it expecting a top notch lego game.			"

												The lego game is rather fun..though there are some bugs where people fly around randomly without things, cam angles screwing up and also how useless the fellow team AI is not attacking enermys while they all go for you. if you look past all the floors and rage moments of the AI not even helping you, or the jumping into random things in the direction you don't want its quite a fun game.

												As far as LEGO games go, this game is definitely... well, a LEGO game.What I mean by this is that if you have ever played a LEGO game in your life then you already know everything there is to know mechanically about this game. In my experience, LEGO games are not so much about ground breaking, innovative gameplay; but rather, immensely enjoyable fun for the whole family that comes in all kinds of assorted flavors. Personally, I find the Star Wars flavor to be the best out of all of them, but for the same reason that a die-hard Harry Potter fan would tell you that the Harry Potter LEGO Games are the best.On a more specific note for this title, if you've seen the LEGO Movie then don't expect anything new from the game; of all the LEGO titles I've played in my life, this one definitely feels the laziest. That does not mean I won't get countless hours of enjoyment out of it, but as far as the whole adoption from film to game goes The LEGO Movie Videogame is anything but creative.Overall, if you haven't ever played a LEGO game, then don't just buy the ""latest and greatest"". Buy a flavor you love, and I promise you won't be disappointed :)			"

												Bought this game to play with my 7 yr. old brother after we went and saw the movie, and was not dissappointed. This game does a great job of fulfilling the reputation of all previous LEGO games, and even adds a little more. A combination of linear and open world elements make the game always interesting, all while following the storyline of the actual movie perfectly. The PC version is also phenominal, with all of the graphical and controller support + splitscreen that I could've hoped for. If you're looking for another great LEGO game, definitely pick this one up.			"

												This is one Lego-@ssLego game. I say that very deliberately. I love Lego games. I played every single one to 100% up until LoTR and have played a smattering to 100% since then.Lego games are a blast. They're super formulaic. Destroy, build, run around collecting stuff and find hidden things. I love the cutesy sense of humor that these games bring to the table. Before the days when the Lego games included voice acting, there was such a great charm in the way the characters moved around to convey the mood. Despite voice acting, that is still there. This game is no different. They took a great movie and turned it into a full length lego game. The HUB world is huge, but this game followed the LoTR and Harry Potter style of adding ghost coins to follow in order to know where to go. The vehicles handle beautifully. The character purchasing is done from a menu in this game instead of running around on a wild goose chase.Now the bad: This IS a Lego-ey Lego game. Which means it will feel that no one ever beta tested it. When I played Lego Potter (1-4), I had a game breaking glitch. I restarted the game. I had a completely different game breaking glitch. Same That's the only Lego game I have ever played and not played to 100%. The bad news: While playing this, I have hit almost a dozen glitches and I have not even finished story mode yet. Cut scenes won't load, areas don't register so I can't enter them, it will show I have to kill enemies but none will spawn. Worst of all, when I save and exit the level, it doesn't remember my progress. The good news is these aren't game breaking problems (yet). Each time I find these issues, I quit out and the bug is gone the next time I play. I recommend this game as a Lego game. It does exactly what you would expect from this style of game. It's light hearted, fun, charming and addictive. It is also incredibly glitchy, like most Lego games. Play this at your own risk!			"

												BitzComms Reviews: The Lego Movie Video Game(This review covers the PC - Your experience may differ from platform to platform)I have to be honest with you - The Lego Movie came to me by complete surprise. For all the time I spend on YouTube, no word was spoken of the movie (at least that I saw) until I first saw the trailer for it on TV... But then I was surprised even more when a video game was announced for it - It wasn't even a full year after Lego Marvel Super Heroes came out, and Traveller's Tales came out with a new game already?It was more surprising that the game was coming to all major platforms, INCLUDING next gen platforms like the PS4, Xbox One, Wii U, in addition to the PC, Xbox 360 and PS3... Yikes.The short development period between this and Marvel seemed like a sign that this game was going to blow HARD... But then I played it, and it is probably my favorite Traveller's Tales Lego game of all time.STORY:The game follows the story of the movie down pat... Which might turn off those who haven't seen it yet. I suggest you see the movie before you play the game, but even if you don't, the game doesn't feature EVERY scene from the movie... Some of the scenes that are in the game have parts that were cut from the movie, most likely to keep from spoiling the movie for those who haven't seen it. I won't explain the story itself, because we have a movie for that, and I wouldn't want to spoil anything.PRESENTATION:The Lego games that have been developed by Traveller's Tales over the years have had a reputation of exceptional presentation, and this one is no different. The game is fully voiced, and either they got the celebrity voices from the movie to do the game, or they just got really, really good sound-alikes. If it's the latter, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference because the acting in this game is so damn good. As I said before, the story is presented through scenes from the movie, and while that may sound kind of cheap, you have to keep in mind the short period between the release of this and Marvel. Plus, the scenes look so good already that you won't mind at all. It kind of harkens back to the days of movie tie-ins on the Playstation, which generally used scenes from the movie for the cutscenes of the game. Anyone remember Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue? (also developed by Traveller's Tales) The game also makes use of a new animation style - The characters actually move like actual lego... No more bendy, stretchy lego limbs. This is probably done to stay true to the stop-motion style of the movie.GRAPHICS:The game looks amazing, as everything is made of Lego this time around. The game also runs really well on low-end machines like mine, and that's always a plus.SOUND:Everything is Awesome!GAMEPLAY:Here's where things get pretty iffy - The game itself is a mixed bag. While this is my favorite TT Lego title so far, I can't deny this game has some serious problems. Let's first talk about the character selection - There are over NINETY characters... NINETY CHARACTERS. Don't get too excited though, as most of the characters are either clones of existing characters, or very minor characters that no one cares about. Most of the characters are different suits for Emmet. Wild Style or Unikitty. There are some good ones in this game, such as Lord Business, Metalbeard, Batman, Super Man, The Green Lantern, Wonder Woman and even the Green Ninja from Lego Ninjago.Emmet himself is a pretty boring character as well. For the majority of the game, all he can really do is use instruction builds. He can't use master builds, and he doesn't have any interesting attacks or gimmicks. Most of the time, you'll be playing as Wild Style, Batman and Unikitty, switching to Emmet only when you need to use an instruction build. Eventually Emmet gets the ability to use Master Builds, but that's very late in the game.Next, let's talk about the gameplay. The game follows the same basic formula as any other TT Lego title before it - Go through the levels, collecting studs and accomplishing objectives with preset characters, then go back and play those levels as any character to find hidden unlockables - Only this time it's mixed with free-roaming hub worlds, and my GOD these are underwhelming. Compared to Lego City: Undercover and especially Lego Marvel Super Heroes, these free-roaming segments seem to be just an after-thought. They are very small and contained. Not very much fun.Next, let's talk about the levels for a minute. The levels are probably the best part of the game, with only a few stinkers here and there. The only problem is that many of them are very long, and when there's a bad level, there's a REALLY bad level. Each level is quite interesting, with its own gimmick and setpieces. There's an entire level that takes place on an under-constuction submarine that's careening down an ablaze Cloud Cuckoo Land. Many of the level designs are very inspired and smart, but they are quite long, and if you don't have a lot of time for one session, you're ♥♥♥♥ed. There are checkpoints placed around the levels that allow you to save your progress, but some of them are placed in areas where you really wouldn't notice them... oops.THE VERDICT:As a whole, however, The Lego Movie Video Game is quite solid, considering the short development period. There's a lot of content in here, and most of the levels are fun, if not a bit too long. I'm giving this game a 7.0 out of 10.			"

												Everything is awesome.  Ever wanted to be a lego person and run around doing lego stuff? Yes you have. This is as close as you can come to it.It's different from the other lego games, mainly because the entire world is lego and because it isn't based off an entire trilogy. The story is short and kind of pointless..you have seen the movie right? There isn't much to work with and the movie is already in lego, so there goes that angle. They have done a terrific job with what they had.The game is mostly smashing stuff and finding stuff, with a couple of awesome mini-games thrown in. You have to complete small tasks and usually build something. It doesn't play like all of the other lego games. This one is fun and different. All of the NPCs are funny - I laughed anyway :)I'm thinking that kids might not ""get"" this game...there's a lot of dad jokes and sly humour. This is easily my favourite lego game. Star Wars rates second.The graphics are massively improved from previous efforts. Don't be fooled by the default setting(which is an eyesore) - you have to actually start a game before you can change the graphics settings. Yeah, it's a terrible idea, get over it.Everything in the game is lego. There is a lot of detail. Very pretty.Awesome game.			"

												This has to be one of my favorite games! after all i love the lego movie! The Lego Movie Video Game is different in many ways compared to the other lego games. 1. All the movements of the characters is as if they are lego minifigures! 2.The levels are shorter but they give new gameplay such as swimming,Building instructions,and hacking! One more thing about the game is when your in a level its not like the other lego games and all you hear is the music. In this game Emmet,Wildstyle,Vitruvius,Batman,Benny All the character talk through the level! The game also follows the story very well!5 STARS!!!!			"

												First of all, this was my first Lego Game. I knew that they are very popular but i never had the chance to play one. So it was just a matter of time when i would buy the first. So thanks Summer sale ;)I recommend watching the movie first before playing the game but it sure works the other way round too. Soo ye, what to say about that game? Great, great and great. If you have a weak spot for Lego, why hesitate? Buy it! Now!  It got everything you'll need to enjoy couple of hours. The humor is hilarious (not just for kids, still funny for grown-ups), the gameplay and controls are awesome and the graphics lovely. I really love the details. You can basically destroy everything and gather so new characters with differnent attributes. And there are so many different characters (with different skill sets). Beginning from Emmet (the main guy) up to playing freakin' Batman! So if that doesn't bring you to buy this game, i don't know what would. I mean, there are some glitches sometimes, but not that bad or so often that i wouldn't recommend this game. So all in all i would give this game 9/10 (not finished yet, but i don't see anything that would lower that score!)Sooo, everything is awesoooome! "

												Just bought this game to the date of February 9th, and all I can say is wow. I think this is the best lego game that the publishers of all of the series have released. First of all, the graphics are very great with Light Flares, color correction (i think), and some light glow which is also part of light flares. Second, the gameplay, I haven't gotten stuck once or found ONE glitch in the game yet for playing for over 2-3 hours! The combat system is very fun ripping through blocky lego people, and the building aspect is not alot like the other ones while they introduce the part finding system which makes it easy for kids. This game is recommended by me for all ages and everyone who loves a good 3D, good gameplay, good graphics, lego game!			"

I'm encountering the occasional bugs though, none of them very major but some slightly annoying.1) When escaping cloud city, the 3rd silver object you have to get blown up wasn't exploding2) Sometimes a character is missing randomly (usually wildstyle)3) During the second 'Everything is awesome', I was getting ABXY instead of UpDownLeftRight which was confusing.4) Wildstyle doesn't always jump where I want her tooThese seem pretty straightforward to sort out so I'm sure they will be rectified. Very fun game altogether though :)			"

												I bought this game whenit was on sale for 4.99. That's how I bought all of lego games and I have a lot.This game has some new things - instead of the 10 minikits you have to get 5 gold manual instructions. You still have the red lego but instead of getting it on the levels you get it by doing ""mini-quests"" while in the open world. I liked this game and I praise it for not spoiling the movie. I played half the game and then watched the movie. Was not spoiled.It was a bit short, though. I played 19 hours and I'm really close to finish it. I only have 5 gold manual lefts. Comparing to lego star wars, I played 34 hours to get it to 100%.A must play if you like LEGO. Has a bunch of characters from other games and movies like Superman, Wonderwoman, Green Latern, Gandalf, Dumbledore, etc, etc.			"

												My kid likes most Lego games, this is the first one I got on PC instead of Xbox, and with the Xbox controller he's happy as pie playing it. From watching, it seems to be along the same lines as the rest of the Lego games, decent quality, although I personally liked the old format where they didn't talk, I thought the humor was better. However, I can see how younger players  would be happier with the current format, as the humor of the old formats without talking was more subtle.			"

												While not inherently a bad game per se, this is easily the worst of all the latest iteration of LEGO games (i.e. those with voice acting and an open-world-ish structure).  It's still a LEGO game, so it's still fun, but it suffers from major issues that other games in the series don't have (or don't have in such proportions):- The Hub worlds are pointless and confusing.  There's nothing to do save for a few easy puzzles that allow you to collect the prized red bricks.  Otherwise, there are no side-quest, no races, nothing else to do.  The highest challenge is to try to navigate their preposterous structure, for which the camera and aribtrary invisible walls will be a constant problem.  You'll hate Cloud Cuckooland the worse.- The two-hour movie is painfully padded to fit a 10-15 hour game (depending if you're hunting for achievements or not).  In consequence, if you haven't watched you'll soon forget what the story is about.  Terribly, a major plot twist of the film is absent from this game for no explanation, which renders the entire thing into a generic adventure.  Again, those who haven't watched the film will be at a loss.- Free Play is broken.  Even though the entire point of Free Play is to be able to breeze through a scene with any character of your choosing in order to get all the hidden items, many times you're forced to play entire parts the exact way you'd do it in normal play or the stage will lock and won't advance.- This is probably the buggiest of the LEGO games, and that's saying a lot, because they're all incredibly buggy.  Expect being forced to restart a stage or maybe even the entire game if you want to 100% it.  Speaking of which, if you're going for all achievements, expect to waste a lot of time doing stuff that's not fun, just repetitive.- The game is confusing in several areas besides camera movement.  Character unlocks happen without rhyme or reason.  Even with the proper red bricks unlocked you'll still have trouble trying to find all the secrets, since some of the arrows don't actually point at what you're supposed to do, or even at where the secret will appear.  The game doesn't bother to explain the point of the unlockable pants or how some abilities are used (and what characters have them).  There's a lot of trial and error.- This might be a nitpick, but the game's main theme music is completely uninspired.  While generally LEGO games beat you with a musical theme until you get sick of it, this one gets you sick of it almost as soon as it starts.Still, there are some good things.  Gameplay is as good as ever, with a lot of interesting new abilities.  Dialogue-wise, this is one of the funniest games in the series (and it retains the same voice cast from the film).  Instruction building is a neat way to get some money early in the game (though it quickly becomes a nuisance as soon as you got any multiplier red brick).So, despite all its flaws, I still recommend the game... provided it's at a hefty discount.  Don't even think to pay the current (as of this writing, $19.99) price.			"

												It's an OK game. Maybe, my mistake was to play it after LEGO Star Wars the FORCE Awakens. Kind of primitive, in a way, levels do not make me feel excited, except for the one in the clouds. That one was cool. Nothing special - just a regular LEGO game. I am saying MAYBE to this one but since there is no such thing - choosing YES for now.			"

												This game was actually pretty fun.  Enjoyed the game so much I had to watch the actual movie.  I played this game co-op (imo Lego games are more fun co-op), game play was great and I enjoyed the different hubs.  There's a lot of different characters in this one from different worlds, which is cool, and I got quite a few laughs out of it!			"

												This game is great. It's actually a lot longer than I thought It would be, and also pretty good for a video game remake of the movie. This game is perfect of you watched the movie a few times and want a little more depth and fun, because you as the player plays the story. Actually one of the most solid game remakes of a movie I've ever played. I have about 5 hours so far into the game and I'm around 10% complete. You should also buy the 2.99 DLC, It may only be pants but when you use Emmet's jackhammer you get gold nuggets by destroying objects. The game also isn't very demanding as a whole. Pretty solid overall would give a high 7 out of 10			"

												6/10Definitely one of the weaker Lego game offerings. There's a series of really small hub worlds that link out to the individual levels, so it's a step down in terms of exploration, would have been nicer to just have one big world a la Marvel/Batman 2/3 Lego style. Like all of the Lego games it still suffers from occasional bug, I ended up trapped in white space more than once. The 'bonus' room is my favourite across the series though. Worth buying at sales price, not full.			"

												My favourite games from this series will always be the Original Trilogy episodes of the Star Wars games. There was something simple and charming about those games that will always appeal to me more than the quagmire that a few of the later games sunk into, in my opinion. I felt later games disappeared into a hole of fiddly complexity regarding character abilities and level design that sucked the fun out of playing.  In saying that, The Lego Movie: The Game rises above a lot of the others I've played, giving you multiple open-world hubs to play around in, as well as some entertaining levels that expand competently upon the movie's premise and retain the sense of fun and variety that Lego embodies as a product. The voice acting is very good considering that the actors are mimicking the original stars, and it's rare that you feel like you're not ACTUALLY listening to the movie's actors. My only sizable criticism comes from that point when you realise that there isn't actually much gameplay in these games, and it mostly relies on your compulsive desire to keep collecting studs to keep you entertained. At that point I found myself wondering whether I was either playing a cheap cash-in, or whether I was playing a decent Lego game and it was just that the series is designed in such a way that, by exploited our completionist desires, they can squeeze the most amount of fun out of the least amount of effort. If it's the former, it's hard to tell, and if it's the latter, I feel like I have to applaud the developers for their ingenuity. Either way, I had fun while I was doing it, alhough I probably won't feel any reason to come back to this particular game after I've finished, as opposed to the Original Trilogy games, as my attachment to the Lego Movie was not great enough to make that a specific draw for me. One last criticism is that I found the music to be annoying as ♥♥♥♥. I'm not a fan of the ethereal electronic soundtrack, and in the film the Everything is Awesome song is supposed to be a satirical take on bland, emotionless, corporate-built pop that is intended to be an ear-worm in the most annoying possible way. So when the developers decided to slap it all over the place in this game and have it haunt the dreams of everyone who plays it, they either missed the point of the film entirely in that regard, or they're ♥♥♥♥ing with us.7/10			"

												First of all i love the lego games and even though they appear simple you can dump hours of gameplay into them so this is a hard one.this game 'feels' dated by this screen resoution ( no it cant be changed ) because the game comes with the movie played out at the end of the each lvl and was really hard to get into without a giant prebuild world with a very firm base to build off and i couldnt finish it. ill be going back to LOTR anyday, that game is massive and man for a dark looking game does it shine on a giant tv ( stream from main rig for casual is great ) but i just cant do that here. was a bit of a shame "

												One of the better LEGO games.  It has a lot of fun with the premise, and it's actually kind of fun to play in a LEGO game that is entirely composed of LEGO.The split-screen makes it a lot easier to play local co-op, though you occasionally can lose track of which side of the screen you're on, and there are rarely points where you kind of need to sit and figure out what you should be doing next.  Many scenes are quite fast-paced (the train is especially exciting).  Also, the puzzles are fun, though not too challenging.  One real nuisance as a color-blind person is that the little green studs we need to follow to get to the next instance look exactly the same as the little yellow studs.Basically, it's a very good effort.  It follows the movie *very* closely, so be aware that you won't feel like you're encountering new objects or LEGOfications of any of your favourite movies.  Sill, my kids and I enjoyed it.7.5/10			"

												As someone who LOVED the Lego Movie and loves Lego games, this game is proving to be a disappointment. It does not feel like it translated well from movie to game, although it probably did a better job than other games because it's Lego. Considering other Lego games it just doesn't feel like it can compete with ones such as The Lord of the Rings or Marvel Heroes. GoodCharacter movement is very similar to movements in the movie, helping with immersion. Movie voices are also in the game, not just cut-and-pasted out of the movie like they did for TLotR game.Princess Unikitty!!!!Bad CopBadCombat and building feel like they've been done better in previous Lego games. Easy character switching is delayed/non-existent/more difficult for no reason frequently when it's required.Game is more buggy than previous games.UglyThe cutscenes pulled straight from the movie. WHY? They don't have to look worse than the actual game. The Master Builder building animations. Buy if it's on sale and you really love Lego games and/or the movie.			"

												This is a first impression of the PC version, but I finished the PS3 version. The game follows the movie, duh, and unfortunately while the movie is brought forth in this really cool 90 minute flick, the game is a bit more like a boring chore. For a number of reasons. Firstly, if you saw the movie - this game is ALMOST the same thing. Even if you were a huge fan of the film, this might not exactly be worth your while; here is why I personally didn't enjoy this game as much as I should have. The scenes in the film which took like 2 minutes take like 30 minutes here, they just made the levels really drawn out and boring. I loved some missions, but overall it is a very mixed bag.It is pretty boring. While it is common knowledge that LEGO games are for kids, developer TT has shown us that they are capable of making an experience good for all ages. But this game has incredibly obvious puzzles, combat that sometimes doesn't even require you to do anything other than mash a button, and rather unpleasant graphics. I mean, it looks decent, but I think I've seen better. The game is about 7 to 8 hours long. Some missions are actually decent fun, and the cast and movie scenes are good and all, but it just isn't fun enough and won't last you long. I would say don't get it OR watch a great amount of gameplay on YouTube before making the purchase. Even at a really heavy discount I can't recommend this game, and especially over the movie. Get some of the other LEGO games if you feel like experiencing those. My personal recommendation would be any LEGO Star Wars game.			"

The levels were great and you're able to play co-op with a friend but I beleive it is only local since I haven't tested it out. Other than that its a great game to play with friends and family alike and was easily able to put in hours worth my time, but it is a bit short than other Lego games just to keep in mind.

												This is the shortest Lego game that I have played, by a long way. I really enjoyed that. The movie humour is present and very enjoyable but does not become tedious. There has been a lot of improvement in gameplay mechanics: the camera was great, the level length was just right, the free play areas were enjoyable and there were no frustrating 'jump just right' challenges. The graphics are a whole level above the graphics of other games because of the way they incorporated Lego scenery, and it's fantastic. The building minigame was too fast for me but was infrequent (unlike Lego Hobbit) and there were fewer collectibles of all sorts. Each level had 5 gold instruction manuals and one pair of pants (Honey, where are my pants?!). Gold bricks are not collected but represent your overall completion (there were 70, while Lego Marvel had 250). The variety of collectible characters is spot-on, there are relatively few, but they are all fun to play and can be unlocked easily (once you complete the appropriate level). The music within levels and in free play areas was never odious. Doing each level was fun - Lego games are often criticised for having no challenge to them, i.e., break stuff until you complete the level - but this game has the most variety (and least repetition) yet.In short, this is a really fun game to play. There is a lot of variety and humour; the game is colourful, the graphics are great and the levels are balanced. It's a lot shorter than other Lego games, and I have thus been able to completely finish it while still enjoying it.I'd say it's 'as good' as Lego Marvel, but there is a lot less of it. This game was released around the same time as Lego Hobbit, and this game is far better. I hope they continue with this style rather than Hobbit.Overall, I'd give this game a ... maybe 9 out of 10? [I'm having trouble figuring out why I shouldn't give it 10, though...]			"

												While the gameplay is good, unlike other LEGO games from 2010 onwards, (starting with LEGO Harry Potter 1-4), there isn't much to do in the hubs/free roam. For a 2014 game, there are only 75 gold bricks to collect, and even LEGO Harry Potter years 5-7, (which was made in 2011), has 125 more gold bricks than this game. So while everything is good about it, there is far less play time :( - The only thing in the hubs to collect are the red bricks.			"

												This game is pretty fun for local co-op 2 player. Me and my wife play it and it isn't too challenging and we have a lot of fun. The game itself is best with controllers (the keyboard bindings suck). The storyline follows the movie but the game play is enhanced in some areas to introduce more detailed action sequences. Highly recommend.			"

												I originally purchased this on the Xbox 360 shortly after it came back, I lent it to my nephew and never saw it again - so I saw the Lego collection (at the time) up for sale and purchased it, myself and my partner are now playing it on the PC and up to the point where we got on the Xbox 360 version.The game is fun, destructive and awesome, yes it follows the movie and you know how the story pans out but the whole dance routines you get to do, customise the trousers (pants for the USA), buy and play other lego characters.The only down side is, the texture is low quality and doesn't look right on the PC - also a few glitches with the Xbox One controller where a character that you're using will dart off to one side and get stuck, the only way round it is to change character and unplug your controller, the stuck character will then some how transport in to the middle of the level.

												So it's a Lego game. It's certainly a Lego game worth getting if you have the other games, but if you don't... this is sort of the middle of the road of them. It's got two problems:1: The movie it's based on is just a single movie, so there's rather a lot of filler involved. It's not Indiana Jones 2 level of filler, but there's a good few levels that are based off of very minor scenes in the movie.2: It doesn't feel as polished. The most obvious example is that it takes its cutscenes straight from the movie, rather than animating them in-game, and it really doesn't work so well. But there's other stuff too, like a bit more bugs than usual and the humour isn't as good as normal.On the flipside, unlike the other Lego games, EVERYTHING in this one is made of Lego! It does look really nifty!			"

												Cute, charming and LOADED with collectables, The LEGO Movie - Videogame offers players of any age an adventure through all your favorite moments from the film and lets you play as most of your favorite characters as well.  A handful of unique situations such as dancing, riding a motorcycle, etc help break up the platforming sections which make up the majority of the title.  Tons of things to collect will keep you coming back for more long after the campaign is over.  Recommended for kids and the young at heart.			"

												Another good LEGO game. Represents the movie quite good, though compared to almost any other LEGO games it does lack some wittyness and is a bit more linear. I didn't bother with completing the game (100%), since the story is everything that matters. That one however, due to the lovely rendered cutscenes as well as the worlds design consistinng 100% upon LEGO elements (contrary to most other LEGO games) makes it a wonderful experience especially for younger players. I'd absolutely recommend it, but I'd definitively recommend the latest other LEGO games above this one. MARVEL Superheroes and The Hobbit are better, game wise.			"

												It's a Lego game, you likely already know what to expect.  I enjoy them and so does my non-gamer wife.  As with all Lego games I also experienced a couple of crashes and a few progress stopping bugs.+ Local co-op+ Simple but fun gameplay and controls- Not many changes over the well established Lego format- Encountered a few crashes and progress stopping bugs (bugs went away with restart)- Still has that dreaded building mini-gamePlaytime: 15h (100% completion)8/10			"

												I love LEGO games. I loved LEGO the Movie. I feel, however, that this videogame is possibly the weakest entry in the series. It seems that it has been delegated to a ""B"" team - TT Fusion and it shows. Gone are delightful interactions, varied builds and awesome cutscenes. Instead - you get parts of the movie (with Star Wars characters blurred out) and repetitive gameplay.In most LEGO games you are required to mix a variety of ""skills"" and solve puzzles. In here, the element has been vastly simplified in favor of multiple ""setpieces"" where master builders build amazing huge things from 3 random elements on the screen. It is boring and happens over and over.Similarly, many characters always build the same thing (unikity builds the same ugly springboard 90% of the time she jumps into action).The game is also rather difficult to complete on free play mode as the way level triggers are set up tends to break if you have a character that allows you to bypass several story steps.If you are crazy for LEGO games and played all the others - give it a shot, but if you have other options - play those first. Personally I'd recommend LEGO Batman 3.			"

If you're looking for a good Lego game buy Lego Star Wars or Lego Batman! This might be fun for your kids if their a big Lego fan or just want to play somthing new, this would be the game for them. (if you have any) For me i would have to give this game 4 out of 10 stars!			"

												This has some lovely concepts and is a nice tie-in to the movie, but the only thing that matters to me right now is it's a buggy, glitchy mess and I've had to exit the game on average once per hour because of some game stopping issue like vital characters getting caught in scenery. Simply not good enough.			"

Product received for free
Imagine having a LEGO related videogames entirely made out of Legos.Well... The LEGO Movie - Videogame. I guess this is what you imagined. StoryNot gonna spoil too much, but I'd highly suggest you to watch The LEGO Movie first... It may look dull for me since I already watched it because it doesn't have some elements from the movie itself...This game will have some unexplained plots, for those who haven't watched the movie. Some of the key cutscenes that movie had were cut.Free PlayIf you played any TT Games' Lego game, then it's pretty much the same to be honest.GraphicsLike I've mentioned it beforeLEGOs... Clearly made out of LEGOs! Smoke, fire, water, explosions, even the cloud was made with LEGO bricks. Which makes it... Ahem... Special.That's it, acutally...I'd highly reccommend this to those who are dire fans of LEGO itself!			"

												I would like to only RECOMMEND this game for all. This game is ""awesome"".Only one thing on this game is what i hate most of all. Characters AI. They just stand on one place and watching you doing stuff but sometimes they fight. Maybe when enemies have agro on them. But if all enemies had agro on you and you see all those robots comming to kill you, you watching them and you are like. SERIOUSLY?! Nothing. But that's all. If you saw movie, you should play this game. Just for fun and killing time. ggBut *LEGO Star Wars The Force Awakens* is better in my opinion.			"

												I do enjoy this game, and highly recommend it to any fans of the LEGO video-game franchise. There's lots of similarities to some of the newest LEGO games as well as the older ones, such as high-jumping female characters, character selection wheels, and of course, buildable portions of levelsHowever, there are some major issues I have with the LEGO Movies' video-game partner:Firstly, the graphics. It seriously seems like LEGO thinks that the graphics for LEGO Worlds is the greatest thing in the whole world. In reality, it makes it look plain awful for a company well-known for making their games look and feel like you're actually in the world that the game is set in. It looks like the older LSW (LEGO Star Wars) games. It looks incredibly childish and doesn't do the LEGO video-game franchise anything.Second, a pre-determined story that is incredibly predictable when you've seen the movie itself. I get that LEGO wanted to incorporate the movie into the game, but a different storyline would have given it more ""oomph"", as they say.Third, I found the levels to be rather long. There's a certain length that the first LEGO Batman: The Video-game had for it's levels, and the last chapter in each of the three campaigns was always the longest and most action-packed parts, Plus about every level had a boss fight, with the exception of a few where the would-be boss had already been captured and taken back to Arkham Asylum during the villains' side of the story.I'm not saying that it's all-around bad,'but there's a lot to be desired with it. I highly encourage you to play this game yourself and decide whether it's worth it or not.			"

												For the most part, this game tells the story and uses gameplay in similar ways to many other lego games. However it seems to be a lot more unstable, willing to crash and enter situations which are bugged and require you to restart levels. I don' tthink you'll miss out by not playing this, as it doesn't really add much after the film. It also seems to lack actual building, which given the nature of the film story, you would expect to be present.			"

												Like all lego games it is filled with funny puns and weird characters. It is recomended to watch the movie before playing, that makes it more fun.Just break everything on your way and try to collect everything. That way you will get a ton of hours of gameplay ;)I just have one question: WHERE ARE MY PANTS?!			"

												In general this game is good. Nice story, music. And a gameplay that just manages to not be repetetive and boring. But fun enough to play. On the other hand though. The more I played it. The more annoyed I got. And in the ned I've convinced myself that this game haven't had any playtesters. The more I played the more bugs would I find. Along with some poor AI's. Meaning that sometimes the challenge was not to avoid the mobs. But to guide the mobs into what they are supposed to do rather than get stuck somewhere. Forcing you to reset the level and loose your progress. This come more and more appearent once you've completed the storyline and go back in free play to get all the extras. As you are now playing with charaters not meant to be on the level. Which just makes you ♥♥♥♥ up the game so much more and create so many more bugs. Again forcing you to reset and loose progress. I've played the storyline. And liked it. But although my plan was to ace this game. Then there are too many things ruining my experince to go back and find everything.			"

												This game isn't like most of the lego games out there, it has characters that can't build anything which can sometimes make the levels harder, but overall the game is very fun. I stayed up all night the day I got it it was just too much fun for me plus you never run out of stuff to do! The levels are very long but can teach you things about the story and what not.			"

												Too buggy; I'm amazed how many there are in this, including a game-breaking one early on if you're not aware of it (the cat/bench clash). At present, I'm at a point where a glitch in the animation prevents an event happening (silver tower over a river in Attack on Cloud Cuckoo Land) - despite trying it ten times, I get the glitch every time, meaning I cannot progress in a game. I'm only glad I got this in a 75% off sale, because if I'd paid full price, I'd be VERY upset.			"

												Glitchy and unplayable. Game seems to not respond to ANY keyboard or mouse input, right from the start screen. When it finally, and randomly, decided to accept a few keyboard commands, I tried to go to the options menu to see if there was anything I could do to prevent the input problem. NOPE! As soon as I entered the controller layout menu, it stopped accepting input again! Had to alt-tab out and manually crash myself to desktop to quit. The one time I FINALLY was able to start a game, it stopped accepting input as soon as gameplay started, so I stood there like a fat kid in gym class while enemies killed me over and over. Lastly, the game launches at a lower resolution than my native screen res (which, by the way, there seems to be NO way of changing from the options menu) and for a low-graphics game seem waaaaay too processor intensive.  TL;DR Hooray, another crappy port of a crappy console game! What a waste of money. Learn from my mistake! LEARN!			"

												In short:I do not recommend this game. Not even if you liked the actual movie. This feels like an utter and complete cash cow. I completed the story in less than 6 hours (no cutscenes were skipped), but didn't play it to 100%.In long:The game itself is as bad as usual - barely any practical options (not even fullscreen), a LOT of bugs, and like with the LEGO games from other franchises, if you don't know the franchise itself - in this case the story of the actual movie - you will most likely have trouble following all the way through. Oh, and it still changes the Windows 7 color scheme to the basic color scheme, for whatever reason. Seems familiar? This shouldn't even be an issue!The cutscenes were taken from the movie. While they were nice in the movie theater, it's rubbish in this game. Come on, you guys had the models from the game and even the sounds, would it have been too much to ask to animate it with proper 3D models and ""full"" framerate (as full as it gets in the recent LEGO games) instead of using the stop motion movie scenes? It doesn't fit in with the rest of the game! Aside from that, Milhouse was blurred out in one of the cutscenes. There is so much wrong with that!The gameplay is as repetitive and enjoyable as always. Contentwise this is barely a competition to other LEGO games. They don't even have the full skill wheel filled with skills!If this goes down to 10€/10$/something like that, get it, otherwise this probably won't satisfy you. Do not expect anything good, it's the old LEGO game formula reskinned, and nothing else. The minigames have been swapped for a pacman-like one, and a stupid reaction game, disguised as ""building by instruction"". You just pick the necessary part out of a list of 8 parts. much fun. wow.That being said: if I were a LEGO figure, I'd go for Lucy. So hot. <3			"

												I've played lego games since i was young, even before TT games came with their unique way of making lego games, and out of all lego games i've played, even early ones like Lego Racer this is by far the weakest of them all. With all the passion, love and detail the Lego Movie had put into it it would be near impossible to transfer that pace, that form of quality into game form without a really high budget and lots of time, something these people didn't have.I will say that i think the developers did all they could to make this game as good as possible but still make it playable and likable by children, problem is that it wasn't enough to impress the oldier audience. With lack-luster ideas, clunky animations and forced references  Like having the ""Everything is Awesome"" song be a collectible, by the time you're done with this game you'll never want to hear it.  The voice cast didn't return for the making of the game, so much of the dialogue is ripped from the movie, which makes tones they deliver lines in very unfitting, or downright absurd considering the scenario going on, the fact that they made the characters stick to the stop-motion style that was in the movie makes everything seem clunky and the fact that they made their cutscenes part of the movie really proves that this was just a cash-grab of a game. The cutscenes just aren't fitting since they'll swich you between the fast pacing of the movie and the slow♥♥♥♥♥pacing of this game.Of all lego games, this one is one you should skip if you're a older fan of lego games, if you're a kid. You probably won't be as picky.			"

												The game itself is very much like the other LEGO film adaptions, the difference is that ""The LEGO Movie"" already was a pretty silly movie to start with. If you already saw the movie, you will probably not find this game a great ""extra"".The controls of this game are terrible compared to the console controls, e.g. you do not use the mouse at all. This results in some terrible camera view and shooting mechanics.I would rate this game a 4 out of 10. PS If you really want this game, buy it on sale...			"

												I enjoyed many of the early LEGO titles, but not this one. They established a system of controls and gameplay in those early games that worked well. In this one, they changed it using different keys and gameplay, and of course, it is based on the LEGO Movie, which was a letdown in its own right. Especially if you liked the creative storytelling in the early games, you will be let down by this one, best to pass on it.			"

												Compared to LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, this game feels like a gigantic step backwards. First off, this game feels like a poor movie to video game adaptation compared to the previous LEGO games like LEGO Indiana Jones or Lord of the Rings. I think the issue is that the game shackles itself to the movie and tries to follow it too closely, which breaks the whole theme of the movie which is about being creative with LEGOs. I think the game would have been much better off if it had been a prequel or parallel story of some sort that could better utilize the potential presented by the world of the LEGO movie.This unsatisfying story is exacerbated by the rather pitiful overworld that is miniscule in comparison to other recent LEGO games like Lord of the Rings or Marvel Super Heroes. Bricksburg is all of two city blocks, the wild west is the town square, and cloud cuckoo land is two or three (small) clouds. There's a few side quests to do in these hubs, but they pale in comparison to the previously mentioned LEGO games and make this game about half as long in comparison.To add insult to injury, the game has a surprisingly decent selection of vehicles that can be built from the treasures found in the missions but they can only be used in the bonus room (i.e. a kid's bedroom) which is basically sterile and devoid of interesting things to smash. A huge letdown from the bonus areas of the previous LEGO games.This is all on top of the standard LEGO game bugs which required me to restart some of the missions partway through because a script wouldn't work and I would be stuck. The character creator is also fairly pitiful.The one highlight of this game is that it adds giant mechs that can be used in some of the missions. Those would have been fun if Bricksburg had been a proper city and if the game allowed vehicles to be spawn in the hubs.Overall I was disappointed by this LEGO game and wouldn't recommend it unless you're trying to collect all the LEGO games. Even if you liked the LEGO movie, I would say go play some of the older LEGO action games or find an old LEGO creator game instead. "

												While it is fun, I must say this game was pretty badly made. There's always some kind of issue whether it's with insane pop-in or with AI which is completely useless to say the least. For example, in Free Play after one of the game's end missions you have to escape a construction site but half the objects don't generate for several minutes making it barely playable. Your AI friendos don't even make an attempt to attack the enemy and instead just stand around and die. Meanwhile the enemy AI either swarms you and does nothing or swarms your team AI and dies.In terms of optimization this thing was terrible too. It took a while before this thing was even playable - It was locked at 1280x768 for crying out loud and you couldn't change it. And that isn't the only issue with the game's graphics, you have to make some major tweaks to make sure this game doesn't look blurry and fuzzy. Oh, and you can't access video options without actually starting the game. Character balancing is all over the place. Unikitty would be the only worthwhile character to play as if it weren't for the fact that the feline can't activate switches or climb certain ""girl sections"" such as jump walls and climbing walls. Metalbeard is extremely overpowered too. You really don't need to use anyone else after you find him because he kills everything, but if you want to move faster then your other option is Bad Cop who is nearly game-breaking. His laser straight-up instakills everything it touches making him extremely deadly. The gameplay is weird too, every now and then you get these puzzle sections which are just broken or badly thought out. For example, the enemy AI on the hacking game is TERRIBLE. They never accurately predict where to move and end up moving from one end of the map to the other. There is a ""brick matching"" minigame which requires ninja-esque reaction time to complete without losing studs and even then you will probably still lose some due to how unresponsive the game is. Lastly, there's the useless dancing sections. They are BROKEN. Broken, broken, broken. The opening one set in a construction site is barely responsive and the second, and last one is completely broken - You can't do anything but lose the game. They still haven't fixed that after quite a long time either.Lastly, this is a HUGE spoiler for The Lego Movie. It literally uses entire major scenes from The Lego Movie instead of real cutscenes and they're presented in a crappy aspect ratio which makes them barely watchable and therefore useless.Play it with your kids, they'll like it. It's long enough for them to be able to enjoy it but it's easy, has bad balancing, terrible optimization and bad puzzle design to match.			"

												If you haven't seen the movie go ahead and try it. The Lego Movie Video Game isn't the movie. I've gotten many adults and kids to watch it with me and it never gets old. The Lego Movie is my favorite movie and the game was well... let me explain why I dislike the game. First some elements of the story just weren't there and others were just completely extended to where you're wondering 'this isn't the movie' and also other things were added to extend the game  (like the stupid sub level) . The game itself is a standard Lego game and that makes it perfectly fine. It's as good as say Lego Batman The Video Game. So for that reason you should get it. But things like not being able to use your mouse or funky menu layout is kind of frustrating. You can't access the graphics settings unless you go into a level. Also like most other movie tie-ins The Lego Movie Game used lots of scenes from the Lego Movie itself (but both were made out of bricks so I think that's why they did it). The main reason I don't recommend it is that, The Lego Movie was great and I'm not saying the game isn't, I'm saying it's not as good. And really The Lego Movie Video Game is just a Lego Game.                   ^                    |(Honestly this doesn't matter because this is just personal opinion, also if you haven't watch the movie before you play the game. If you don't the game will ruin the movie.)			"

												It's like any other lego game, it should be it's own genre by now.I enjoy it to some degree just cause I like the style of gameplay but I wouldn't recommend this to everyone. The game has some issues with its cutscenes as well. If you've watched the movie you will hear a clear disconnect and lack of background sounds that were in the movie. It feels like they just cut out the dialogue from the characters and added stock sound effects to fill in the rest. Kinda strange, and disappointing, but that's how it is.			"

Basic Information:Title: Lego Jurassic WorldDeveloper: TT Fusion, Travellers TalesPublisher: Warner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentGenre: Action, AdventureGeneral Impression:The LEGO Movie - Videogame is a very poor entry into the LEGO videogame franchise and in my opinion, should only be purchased at a great discount or as part of a bundle. The game feels rushed, and lacks the lore which most LEGO games such as LEGO Star Wars and Marvel Super Heroes have. The problem is, where as most of other LEGO videogame series' have a few movies to create a story around, this game only has one. In terms of mechanics, they're okay, nothing special but no worse than the other games in the franchise, the developers didn't do a bad job, they just had bad source material, the gameplay itself is actually okay.

												On may 18th of 2014, I had my first date ever as it was the greatest day of my life. At first I was skeptical of actually getting out of my house and doing something other than play video games, but this girl really reached out for me. We went to our local movie theatre and watched The Notebook. We cuddled the whole time and shared all the happy and sad tears together. She was the most beautiful thing in the world. After that we went everywhere together from our houses to restaurants and the library. Everything in life was great. Every thought I had of suicide before I met this girl, seemed utterly stupid and rash. Every movie we watched together was just 10 times better than watching it alone. Everything was awesome. I said to myself. ""Everything is cool when you're part of a team."" Until one day I started to notice something. My items of value started to disappear. The first thing I noticed was my special fleshlight that I always kept in my secret shoebox and used whenever a girl would say hi to me at school. Of course I used it after and not during school because that would just be weird. Then my collection of Hentai magazines were gone and I thought I had misplaced them until I saw my girlfriend run across my yard with something suspicious rustling in her bag. I put on my 1000$ antique ninja suit and pursued her throughout out city. Using my superb cardio skills and gainz from the gym, I beat her to her house. I waited patiently in her bushes like I used to when I watched her change before school. As she arrived to her doorstep I leaped out of the bushes and clung onto her like an angry primeape and took off her bag and looked inside. Not only were my sexy kawaii anime figures and magazines in there, but something even more unforgivable. My 8th grade lego set my mother gave to me on my 13th birthday. She tried to explain, but my eyes were blurred with blood, rage, and tears; and a little bit of horniness. I unsheathed my 400$ mock Zanpakutō and stabbed her in the heart. After 5 minutes I had realized what I had done and collapsed to the ground. I awoke to the sound of an ER machine beeping. I was in a hospital with the doctor leaned over me with his rock hard♥♥♥♥♥♥ He spoke to mean and said, ""Sam i'm sorry to have to tell you this but you have been in a coma for 40 years. It's not all bad you still have Half of your Life left. It is when I heard that that I knew I had to play Lego® Movie the Videogame the videogame drama classic the videogame game movie game. video			"

												Is this a Lego game? -Yes,Is it worth to be played? -Not sure.This is a Lego game in all the traditions the lego games ate. This time the game is based on the ""Lego Movie"". It has the story line filled with humor that we know from the lego games. A lott of charakters from the ""Lego Movie' buatifull decorations, funny quests and tasks. But there ist still something wrong with this game.I very like to play the ""lego"" video games, it all started with ""lego star wars"" from 2005, since that passed a lot of time and a lot hase changed to the positiv side. The game have ""evolved"". But in this game they decided to remove a lot of things that made the lego game much comfotable, -and thats pretty sadly. This is a list of things that could be better.- There is no map for the openworld. So discovering everything in the world is very anoying, the locations are pretty large and you will need the help of internet to orient on it some times.-The background music, they used ""everything is awesome"" made different style covers from it. And thats all. so in the open world and in the most time of the missions you will just lissten to the same song... and if you want to play the whole game trhow and discover everyting it ist realy anoying after 10 hours of gameplay,-The game isnt so difficult as the games before, usualy you needed about 25-35 hours to discvoer everythin (lego lord of the rings, lego marvel super heroes) in this cause you will need no more tham 13-15 hours.I think its about 1-1,5 years since i played the game. But in the end i can say, that even tha I liked play the game, I would not play it again.			"

												I'm astonished to see I'm the only one don't like this game.In general:Go buy Lego Marvel Super Heroes or Lego Lord of the Ring if you want enjoy a great Lego game,and just watch the movie to feel the Lego culture.First of all:NEVER play this game before watch the movie,NEVER.The game is a awful spoiler of the movie,it cut off too many fun part from that.The combat system is backsliding from LMSH(Pretty good,although heavy firepower character like ironman is too OP),You'll find accurately melee enemy without hit air or other object is a hard job.Ah,mysterious locking system.Stage design repeating is one of this series' main problem,and LMV proved this.I have a strange feeling that maybe TT games forget how to reflect every character's difference,all you need is smash some brick and rebuild them with anyone.(Except Emmet,The only main character don't have master builder skill.Poor Emmie.)Collectible is simplified,that's OK.....Consideing I meet a darn bug in both LMSH(a gold brick missed) and LLotR(game said I collect 4 item in dead marsh and don't give me the mithril brick)'s first playthrough,I can't say this is bad.....Atleast I needn't open another save and waste another 30 hour to unlock the 100% achievement.I really like the movie and the whole series(Sorry to say I play Harry Potter,Star Wars,Indiana Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean with pirate version,I don't have too much free income when I was a student),and my save is 81.6% when writing this(I'll finish it),but I would never suggest my friend to buy this game.In my opinion,It's a game which only recommended for a big fan with a free 30 hours and 30 dollars.We always say""You can't spell ""ignorant""without ""IGN"""",but,this time,IGN and their 6.5 is right.

												This game is as much fun as the movie!  I just bought this yesterday and me and my daughter are addicted.  There isn't really much to say except that if you enjoyed the movie and if you enjoy Lego games, you will really enjoy this.  My only complaint is that on some of the building that Emmet does, when you have to choose the piece that goes with the plan, the controls are a little wonky when using a controller.  I wonder if I'm overlooking some sort of sensitivity control for it in the menu.  WIll have to check when we play again.			"

												This is a great game to play. Lots of characters to unlock, Gameplay does get repetative after a while however but it is still fun. Granted Superman is a prick in the game. Lots of laughs and some famous voice actors in it. How many games have the voices of Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, and Will Farrell? Worth buying and fun to play alone or with another. Only other downside is controls are a little hard to work.			"

												Everything is Awesome! Good game to play just for fun. No frags, crits, HS, multikills. Pure simple fun. Enjoy. Only downside is that its a little buggy. Say you are collecting the instructions and then leave the room to search for the other goodies. When you go back to original room you have to recollect instruction manuals and some of the stuff you have completed (which you have to do again else you cant get manuals) doesnt function. Overall though it bugs 5% of the time - its managable. Oh the dance options is not gear for pc. When you have to dance with the Robots X is H, Y is K and A is space :p			"

												You know that really cool film that came out, the one that was intended to motivate anyone to be creative ?Well this game... truly is not... that.I am a big LEGO fan and I have enjiyed multiple LEGO games, and to be honest, this one does not cut it. Maybe if you are younger than 12 and you liked the film, but for anyone older, definetly not the game to get. In this verison of  the LEGO movie, you aren't getting the good voices from the  film, but slightly similar voices. It does ad new building features, which are typically not included, yet they are better than most. Anyway, I have to say in the end it is pretty boring and felt more like a chore than a game. I enjoyed the film and expected way too much from this game, so as a conclusion, I'd wouldn't reccomend this game unless you are completely blown away by the LEGO movie. Just get LEGO Jurassic World, way better.			"

The last thing I am doing is reinstalling the game and asking WB Support, and I recommend you doing that too if you ever get those kind of problems. I give this a 3/10 because it has a lot of issues with launching on most modern computers now.Marc			"

												It's a nice game, as usual, but with more flaws than expected.First off, the story presentation is pretty bad. If you didn't watch the movie, you'd only understand bits of the story that made the film good. If you watched the movie, which you should, that's less of a problem, but a little bugging nonetheless.Speaking of 'bugging', this game is the worst in terms of bugs that I've seen in the series so far.Went an unexpected way with a character? Restart level. Event simply doesn't trigger? Restart level. Stuff doesn't happen? Hack around in a way that shouldn't be necessary in order to not have to restart the level.But all the bad things aside, the Lego games by Traveller's Tales never really disappoint. Relaxed play through the story and an hour or two of fun studs grinding in the end... that's 15 hours until 100% with all achievements here.So if you watched the movie and liked it, you can't really go wrong when this game is on sale for seven bucks.

												WATCH THE MOVIE FIRST!! There are many clips from the film throughout the game and if you don't want spoilers to the mania of the film then make sure you watch it first. The game is interesting. It shows parts of the film that were skipped over slightly and allows for exageration on the levels. The open world sector of the game doesn't do as much credit to the game as some of the others. It seems to have become a little meshed between the Marvel open world and the starwars style cantena. It offers different challenges such as finding the bonus bricks in the open world but also creating the builds.The building is not as good as previous games. I understand the need for the master builders and the instruction builds but the instruction builds with the enforced money timer and difficult to use reel of items can make it slightly infuriating to play.There are occasional times also i have found during playthrough where the commands were not being done or there are too many characters for an easy changeover, there was one point where my character could not get out of a vehicle they had entered.An interesting take on the movie. Not one of their better LEGO games but worth a play through if you enjoyed the film. Just get it when it is silly cheap!			"

Even characters who never showed up in the film have great lines. Big kudos to the writers here.As for the rest, gameplay is simple but fun, music is great, graphics are pretty good, minigames are good except for the one dancing minigame that displays Xbox buttons instead of keys. but it's ok if you figure out which keys correspond to which button.

												At this point in the franchise I would buy any LEGO game: LEGO European Court of Human Rights, LEGO self assessment tax return, LEGO watching paint dry, LEGO Justin Bieber...Okay so no quite any game but I did buy this game without any knowledge of the movie. I later decided it would be better to watch the movie first to ensure I could fully appreciate the game, however this is not necessary as you get to watch half the film anyway whilst playing the game. I would still recommend watching the film first because I think it would detract from watching the movie having played the game. Anyway to the actual game. The game is fun but it is missing something. I think one of the key elements to the success of the LEGO games is they take a film you love, renders it in LEGO and injects a lot of silly humour. The LEGO movie is already rendered in LEGO with a silly sense of humour so this game mostly feel like just playing through the movie. Also the graphics which looked fine in the other games appear worse because they can be directly compared graphics in the movie. So this is not the best LEGO game but still worth playing.			"

												7.4/10 Excellent game for a LEGO game, independent from the franchises.I do like this game purely because it doesn't rely on fandom from the franchises LEGO has been developing with recently, nor does it expect you to have watched the LEGO movie. My daughter plays this as her go-to game, and not inherrently because she likes LEGO more than anything else, but mainly because it's just fun. And it is, it's exactly that. It's easy to control, it provides cut-sceens from the movie that give you setups for the game level so you know what's going on, and other than the scripted scenes, it allows you to go and do whatever you want.You can chose who you want to play as for the open-world scenes, and for the missions you have a roster of characters that can peform certain abilities nessesary to progress the story. There is also a section where you can construct your own character and add them to your character set to use in-game.I would say that the game is designed with a certain balance that is very clever. My daughter (4) could do certain parts of the game easily and without prompt, however other areas she saw herself as completely stuck and required my help. Now as annoying as that might seem to some, it provided a nice family-game-night experience for us both. I would reccomend the game on that alone.Studs, you cannot collect them all. Fact.			"

												ive loved every lego game i played exept for this one. it didnt really feel like a lego game to me. the puzzle part of the game really never challenged me that much. The levels werent to interesting either. i know it was based off the movie, but a lot of the places felt sort of the same. like all the levels in cloud cooco land? or however that is spelled, they all felt like the same place. And it didnt have the same vibe when you fund the secrets, and the Multiple hubs were confusing. I prefered the old starwars hubs with all the neat easter eggs. Oh look at me! i compared lego games! Burn me on a stake. I have no idea how to end a review so ill just rate this game with cookies. I ate three of the ten cookies. 6/10. Shhh. i dont do math			"

												Definately not the best of Lego games, but it's pretty legit.Cons: The cutscenes' music is offbeat, and often ruins great scenes from the movie.The melee is pretty bad due to the fact that they are trying to make the minifigs as realistic as possible.EVERTHING IS AWESOME DDR MINIGAME. 100% TRUE.Pros:The graphics are by far the best I've seen in a Lego game. Pretty goodIn game music isn't the best, but it's pretty well done.It runs perfectly.It appears that they got actors like Will Ferrell and Chris Pratt to return to act during the game instead of reusing dialogue from the movie. I'm not talking about the cutscenes by the way.It's a Lego game.Emmet has a jackhammer. ;) Nuff saidGuns actually kill someone after one shot.Overall, it's not the best, but certainally not the worst.8/10 "

												ok when i saw this game at first i thought ""another lego game?this games are the same but diferent themes""but when it was on sale i buyed it and oh man i enjoyed it this game is different then the others.like any lego game it is a puzzle game where some times you need to switch carachters and the carachters have unique abilitys for example emmet can break blocks with cracks using its drill andhe can fix blue legos)unikitty can destroy and rebuild rainbow blocks etc wich is normal but a different thing that is in this game its the free play because in each level theres a new colectible the pants and the pants serve as things that you can wear and have abillitys.my favorite one is the dance ones "

												Although the game controls absolutely suck and the game dynamics need work (as do all Lego games for that matter), once i got my gamepad hooked up, the game was super fun to play and feels like the movie but in game form...i wonder y? sarcasm intended :p all joking aside though, you will want to invest time in watching all the graphically amazing cutscenes no matter how goofy the storyline gets. Also, sometimes the objective isnt directly laid out to you with green pieces so you will have mini puzzle that you might get stuck on but once you figure it out its just that much more gratifying when you finish the level :] over all the game isn't that difficult and its something that you can just play for a little while if you just want to sit back and enjoy a relaxing game without the stress of dying or whatever			"

It's LEGOs! How could you not love it!? The LEGO Moive Videogame is from the movie, The LEGO Movie.Singleplayer: You can do free play and story mode just like most of the legos games. This game is great and seems like it goes on forever. Multiplayer: You can do Local Co-op with means someone has to sit at your computer in order to play it with you. They can't be at their own computer for Co-op. I love using Co-op because it's almost like your in the movie with your friend.I rate this game 9/10. "

												Great game to pass the time :) I haven't played a LEGO game since star wars so it was a bit weird with all the features they've added since. Game runs mostly fine (Usually over 130fps), but there are moments where it drops to as low as 15fps for a second or two. It's distracting but not enough to put you off.			"

												At this point in the franchise I would buy any LEGO game: LEGO European Court of Human Rights, LEGO self assessment tax return, LEGO watching paint dry, LEGO Justin Bieber...Okay so no quite any game but I did buy this game without any knowledge of the movie. I later decided it would be better to watch the movie first to ensure I could fully appreciate the game, however this is not necessary as you get to watch half the film anyway whilst playing the game. I would still recommend watching the film first because I think it would detract from watching the movie having played the game. Anyway to the actual game. The game is fun but it is missing something. I think one of the key elements to the success of the LEGO games is they take a film you love, renders it in LEGO and injects a lot of silly humour. The LEGO movie is already rendered in LEGO with a silly sense of humour so this game mostly feel like just playing through the movie. Also the graphics which looked fine in the other games appear worse because they can be directly compared graphics in the movie. So this is not the best LEGO game but still worth playing.			"

												Not a bad game but... controls are quite tricky. It's not that easy make your character go just where you want to move it. Besides that, it's nice and funny. It recreates the spirit of the movie. Plus, it has got some good details and extras and the 3D runs quite smooothly. I recommend it only if you are a fan of the movie, or a LEGO fan in general. Otherwise it can be a very boring experience.			"

												A lot of game-breaking glitches. During the course of my gameplay, I had to restart at least 3 missions because of glitches (charachers gets stuck on the ground or begind an object or important scripted events would not trigger). Because of the glitches, do not explore the levels too much by flying and don't try to be wise or take shortcuts. Be sure to do what the game wants you to do. The game is fun otherwise, but clearly rushed and not finished. For this reason, i would not recomment. Maybe try other lego games instead ?			"

												Everything is Awesome! Good game to play just for fun. No frags, crits, HS, multikills. Pure simple fun. Enjoy. Only downside is that its a little buggy. Say you are collecting the instructions and then leave the room to search for the other goodies. When you go back to original room you have to recollect instruction manuals and some of the stuff you have completed (which you have to do again else you cant get manuals) doesnt function. Overall though it bugs 5% of the time - its managable. Oh the dance options is not gear for pc. When you have to dance with the Robots X is H, Y is K and A is space :p			"

												I have just completed the game and I would say the following.Well, I loved the movie, and the game feels like an extended cut.  It basically follows the movie, scene by scene and adds more content through gameplay.I will say some of the instructions were lost on me until the very end.  Like how unikitty, when enraged can destroy gold blocks with her fire attack.Batman, can I say more?  Also you will find yourself using batman all the time.  His long range attack will destroy any item and send the bits directly to your collection, saving on collection time. Also unikitty's long range attack can be used to cheat a bit, since she will ""jump"" to the target, so if there is a destroyable item over a chasm, you can use her to reach it.The menus are not very informative, except maybe a few will say (laser) or some other attribute, but unless you know ""Ice Cream Jo"" can put out fires, you don't know why to ever use her.It's simple to play and dying isn't a problem.  Your characters can get destroyed all day long and nothing bad will happen.			"

												This game is quite a lot of fun. However, I have had a few issues while playing. During the first level when you get to the dancing section, I have had issues twice with the game not progressing, I can't start the minigame and I have to exit. Not gamebreaking, but irritating nonetheless. The camera can get a bit wonky at times but luckily you can control it with P, L, ;, and '. Overall the game is very fun, I beat the campaign in about ten hours, but was only 30% or so through it. There are plenty of characters to unlock and a lot of pickups in every level, so if you'rein to hunting collectibles you won't be disappointed. There is a red brick powerup that locates some pickups, so if you want that you can make it a bit easier on yourself.			"

												The Lego Movie Game is, sadly, one of the worst Lego games to have come out for a while, on par with some of the first to be released. This game is first and foremost a movie tie-in, make no mistake. There is no original story, movie clips are used instead of in-game cutscenes, and don't expect any inivation beyond two bland mini-games.I've loved all the Lego games so far, and I got this one with the express purpose to play as Unikitty, and on that it delivered. What it didn't deliver is that scope that we've come to expect from modern Lego games, such as sprawling open worlds, a large cast of characters, and a host of special skills that are drip-fed to you throughout. Let's look at these in more detail:The character select screen may seem healthy, boasting 90-odd characters, but take a moment to consider who these characters are. Most are generic citizens who got mere seconds of screen time, or the mini-figured you find in the blind bags: Panda Man, Taco Tuesday Guy, and Larry the Barista are among the memorable characters you can play as, who only differ in apperance and the object they throw. The main character Emmet has not one, not three, but thirteen variations, all seperate (unlike most Lego games that stack variations of the same character on one spot) and all exactly the same, with two exceptions. Also, only the main characters have facial animations, and not even they get lip-synching when they talk.The world is divided into four areas and a bonus zone; Bricksburg, The Old West, Cloud Coocooland and the Octan Tower. These areas consist of more or less two rooms, with missions scattered around, with no central 'hub' to begin them. Characters are bought from the character select screen, as with the newer games, but the mini-figures can also be found scattered around to buy in-person, which is completely redundant. Within 10-hours of gameplay, taking my time, I have already finished the game, bought all the characters, and bought all the red blocks, making this the shortest Lego game I've ever played (and I've played most).The unique skills in this game are nothing mind-blowing: silver needs explosives, gold needs a laser, only construction-workers can repair, only women can be acrobatic (that's right, Batman cannot climb walls or jump around), only Master Builders can make objects, only Unikitty can use rainbow blocks, etc. etc. All very standard and mostly things we've seen before, too. Aside from Lord Buisness, who you get at the end of the game, most bonus obstacles can be cleared by the half-way point, let's say 6-hours in. It's a Lego game, so obviously you'll be going back and playing it all a second time in Free Play mode to unlock everything, but this certainly won't take anywhere near as long as the comparative colossus, Lego Batman 2.~In summation: This is a game for people who loved the movie. You'll get to see it all again and play with characters you probably won't otherwise get to, such as Unikitty. The gameplay is exactly as you'd expect, nothing breaks the formula, and anything new is few and far between. And you'd best hope you like the soundtrack, because you'll be hearing three particular songs an awful lot. In short: It's silly, short fun, but don't expect much more for you money beyond a playable advertisment. I recommend it because it is exactly what it is: It's not great, but it's not bad either, but it most certainly IS a movie tie-in game, and should be treated as such.			"

												I love lego and have loved lego since I was a very young person, so I bought this game expecting it to be like the others, I was wrong. It's totally different, and currently I am not sure if that is a good or a bad thing. It seems a lot more childish than the past games, I know a lot of 'lego' is aimed at younger children but the other games and a lot of lego products themselves are usualyl bought by older audiences. The fact that the cutscenes are from the movie kind of annoys me, I feel like the game was made very quickly without much testing or overlooking at all, I'm on level 2 and I have found a lot of bugs already. I've also found that the controls for this game are extremely annoying, mainly because I am used to being able to change them to be able to use the left click for the action button, sadly I am unable to do that in this game. Although most of this review has been 'bad', I would suggest buying this game for a younger audience other than an older audience like most of the other games. If they were to fix some bugs and allow me to change the 'action' button to left mouse click that would also make me very happy. I plan to play through the entire game, so this review may change in the future, but for now, this is my thoughts on the game.			"

												So, everyone of you who played a Lego videogame before probably know they are all good and fun.Also, it's pretty smooth riding collecting everything and you feel good doing so.This one is no different.Even though it is a game of a movie, they are usually bad aren't they?But this one does it right. It puts up sequences from the movie every now and then yet the story as a whole plays differently.Cause you know, some stuff was made for the big screen.Playability is good. Controls are smooth as you would expect from a Lego game.The difficulty is pretty balanced except for 1 or 2 spots where I had to start all over several times.Replayability value isn't as good as other Lego games though. Possibly because Emmet isn't the most impressive protagonist compared to some other Lego games.People who enjoyed the movie are sure to enjoy the game, also for people who enjoy Lego games and casuals out there.It's pretty easy yet pretty fun too.Give it a try and see.

												Now that my daughter is almost 7 years old we've played just about any and all LEGO games that have come out.  This one is by far is my favorite though.  If you're a fan of the movie you can appreciate the intertwining of the LEGO game world and the movie (cut scene) inclusion.  The game play is as great as any other Lego game but the incorporation of the movie immerses you into the story which you fell in love with.  If there's one Lego game that is a must buy this is the one.  It'll give you hours of great fun whether it's being played with or without the kids :). "

												This is the first LEGO game I have ever played, believe it or not, and I have to say I am impressed. I have heard a lot of negative reviews for some of the LEGO games and this one really knocked it out of the park, in my opinion. The levels are fun and the collectables make it worth replaying. If you are a fan of the movie this game is for you for sure. It is funny at times with some gags, for older players and fun and easy-to-play for younger gamers. Some of the mini-games can be frustrating such as the building mini-game, due to the number of times you will have to complete them during the game. All-in-all it was an enjoyable experience, and I would recommend to those who enjoy these kinds of games.			"

												This game is really nice, I wouldn't say its the best lego game out there, but its definitely a game you'll enjoy. The animations are astonishing, the graphics are beautiful, the characters are very likable, (if you like the movie) I could just go on about all the minor details that make this game great. The only real thing I don't like is the overworlds, yes there might be more than one, but they are kind of small and considering it's not really a long movie, there aren't many levels. I'm not saying the levels aren't awesome, (cause they are) it's just that when you complete a lego game and get all the characters, you really just look foward to playing the levels again, but since there isn't that many levels in this one, really you'll just end up screwing around in the overworlds. But believe me I still enjoy it, It's just ganna be a little while before you want to play it again after completing it. I give this game an 7.5/10 which in my opinion is a pretty apropriate rating for this game. Please excuse me for any mistakes in my english, I'm German. Deutschland ist genial!			"

												Every Thing Is Awsome! This game is great. My sister loves it. It may take cutscenes form the movie and then the levels have characters that are'nt in the cutscene like the opening level the cutscene only has Vitruvius but then when the level starts Shakespeare and Cleopatra are there too??? All the same this is a fun a game.			"

												As a kid lego was my childhood, ive played with lego and played Lego games all my life, even the classics like Lego island, Lego loco, lego racers, lego chess, legoland as well some more recent ones like Lego star wars and lego indiana jones.So i knew this would be good because all of the lego games ive played in the past have been awesome,this game is really good if you loved the movie and want to be taken back to your childhood of building whatever you wanted when you wanted, like a SPACESHIP!*cough *cough, anyway so if you liked the old lego games and loved the movie why not give it a go?after all......Everything is awesomeEverything is cool when you're part of a teamEverything is awesomeWhen you're livin' on our dreamEverything is better when we stick togetherSide by sideYou and IGonna win foreverLet's party foreverWe're the sameI'm like youYou're like meWe're all working in harmonyEverything is awesomeEverything is cool when you're part of a teamEverything is awesomeWhen we're living our dream			"

												Great game, fun characters, very colorful and lively. Even more fun if you have purchased a Lego Movie set that has a code inside to unlock secret characters. I have Emmet's Construct-O-Mech, which came with a code for unlocking Angry Kitty. Very fun to play as, especially when you consider that she gives early access to ""rainbow brick"" builds. (And the way she walks is simply adorable.)The only real problem I faced with this game is that it CRASHES MY ENTIRE COMPUTER EVERY TIME I ATTEMPT TO COMPLETE THE FIRST OBJECTIVE IN THE FIRST STAGE. The tutorial stage with Vitruvius, Cleopatra, and Shakespeare works fine, and I haven't run into any issues in the Bricksburg hub yet, even when playing as Angry Kitty, but in the stage ""Bricksburg Construction"" my screen turns pink and staticy every time I fix the ""delivery tube"" (or sometimes when I just get too close to it), which is literally the first objective in that stage. I am unable to switch programs or bring up a task manager when this happens, and attempting to wait it out results in my monitor becoming disconnected.In summary, great game with lots of fun characters and voice acting, if you don't mind not actually being able to play it.Edit: I managed to work around the bug, sort of. By maxing out the graphics options, I have moved the bug from a static location to random intervals. I can progress, but only a little bit at at time before the bug pops up and crashes my computer. What I have managed to play was fun, but I still can't recommend buying this bug-fest at full price.			"

There isn't really much to say except that if you enjoyed the movie and if you enjoy Lego games, you will really enjoy this.  My only complaint is that on some of the building that Emmet does, when you have to choose the piece that goes with the plan, the controls are a little wonky when using a controller.  I wonder if I'm overlooking some sort of sensitivity control for it in the menu.  WIll have to check when we play again.			"

This game is great and seems like it goes on forever. Multiplayer: You can do Local Co-op with means someone has to sit at your computer in order to play it with you. They can't be at their own computer for Co-op. I love using Co-op because it's almost like your in the movie with your friend.I rate this game 9/10. "

												- Do you enjoy restarting a level repeatedly because of a glitch?- Do you prefer spending time in the internet searching for solutions for the many game bugs rather than  playing the game? - Do you like not getting an achievement although you have done what had to be done to get it?If your answer is yes to the above questions, this is the right game for you.  In this game, only the ""Story Mode"" levels work well; ""Free Play"" and the ""Hub"" are full of bugs. This LEGO game is of much lower quality than the other LEGO games.			"

At 75% completion, I have enough to say about this game.I don't usually play Lego unless it's with my little brother but since I've seen the film, I gave it a shot. I love this game. Voices were excellent, graphics and visuals are stunning, lot of comedy. What more could you ask for. Don't pay for the DLC. Wait until it gets cheap because at £1.99 it's not worth it. For the game itself, I bought it for under £5 but saying that, I would defiantly pay £15 (or equivalent) for this game.Now back to the game ... 6 steam achievements left to earn			"

												Over all it's a great game, it's fun. however, its not properly made for windows, it looks like they just took the XBOX version and quickly made a pc version overnight. since at one point i had to use the XBOX controles instead of the keyboard ones, and sometimes the charaters would get stuck.   AI: 5/10,  Your allies wont fight the enemies most of the times, and if theres a single block between you and your ally, then your ally will get stuck. No graphical options, so you're stuck with 1024x768.It's got most of the key moments from the movie.Fun: 8/10Everything else: 7/10 Overall rating: 7/10			"

Its the bugs that come with the game, Its frusterating that you spend your money on game after 2 years of being out and you would think most or all bugs have been fixed but NO not this game. I've had bugs where I had to restart the level all over again because it bugged out and I couldn't go any further. Another commen bug is the x10 red brick unlock. By the time you get fed up with this buggy BS your 2 hours to get a refund is finshed be mindful many people dont have these issues so if your thinkng on buying this game be very aware on what your purchasing.

												Pick a favorite character from the LEGO MOVIE. Want to play as them? Now you can.I swear I'm gonna beat the game and then play EVERY SINGLE LEVEL AS UNIKITTY. Just because. Seriously though, I might need to see a psychatrist about my unikitty obsession. The keychain is one thing. Having her on my desktop wallpaper is okay too I guess. Having her as my ringtone, phone background, and three posters in my house is bad though. So are the unikitty plushes and blanket. Seriously. My daugher likes batman, but I'm the unikitty fan. I might have a problem.So yeah, get game, play as unikitty. Or batman. Or Spaceman Benny. Or Vetruvius if you are into that sorta thing. Good game all around though.Kinda wish they'd kept the movie soundtrack for video clips. Not enough awesome.Maybe too much. They have unikitty.Unikitty.Unikitty.Unikitty.			"

												Love the movie and love all the Lego games. I've read complaints about this one being too different.But aside from the few game stopping bugs, like getting stuck in spots with no way out but to quit the game and try again, this game is great.  It is also the first one my kids (4 & 6) can play together easily without my help.  Definitely geared toward a more mass audience / age group so it makes sense.  There is currently a frustrating bug if doing multiplayer.In story mode there are intermissions where you have to select correct lego pieces to progress in the story.For us, it would never let us select the top middle one and there's no way around.I found that we can select it if we pressed up on both controllers simultaneously.Is if you find yourself stuck, that is a solution that worked for us.Definitely a good game. Definitely recommend it if you're a lego movie fan.Its a little buggy and less polished than say, Lego Batman 3, etc.  But still great.			"

												A fun game that follows the plot of the movie. You'll recognize a lot of the characters, and many of the sub-missions feature background characters from the various locations.That said, this game is *incredibly* buggy. I haven't encountered anything game breaking or that required me to start a new save file, but I have had to restart levels that crashed, find workarounds for broken missions and so on. I'd still recommend it for fans of the LEGO games, just be aware that you might need to get creative and restart levels here and there.			"

												The LEGO games follow a strict formula: Take a franchise/movie, recreate it in the most amazingly silly way possible, and make the audience replay memorable scenes in beautifully designed set-pieces. Star Wars, Middle Earth, Batman, you name it- in each LEGO game you get what could best be described as an affectionate parody, with MiniFigs and an awful lot of brick.-smashing. And The LEGO Movie Videogame is just the same, with all the good and the bad this brings.The LMV follows the basic plot of the movie: Normal everyday construction worker Emmet is pulled into an ancient prophecy that claims him to be the only one to save the world from a doomsday weapon called ""The Kragle"". Despite being utterly unqualified for the job he does his best, and hilarity ensues.If you know the movie (and you should) you'll find it hard not to smile a few minutes into the game. The complete cast is there, the setpieces are amazing and occasionally outshine the movie, the voice acting is pitch perfect and the undiluted charme of giant scenery build out of LEGO is as ever-present as ever. The game looks amazing and pulls a lot of awesome scenes together to form a narrative that is pretty close to the movie.As per usual, you control a growing cast of characters, each with their own ability set. Emmet can build sturdy objects with the proper instructions, and can smash through special bricks with his drill. Wyldstyle has some extra agility and can jump and climb on certain ledges, Batman gets his ever-useful Batarangs and grappling ropes, and so on. Using and combining these abilities make the bulk of the level's challenge, and the game does a good job of adding layers to the formula as the cast expands.Controls, also as usual, are nice and tight enough. The keyboard is a bit inferior to a good gamepad, but both work in a pinch. Switching characters and pulling off their moves is easily learned, and the game goes the extra mile to pop up tooltips if you keep missing a hint. Despite the cheerful toy aesthetic children will probably be overwhelmed by the action. There is always somethign going on, there is always something to do, and while death is cheap (you only lose a couple of studs, which are the in-game currency for everything) there is a certain difficulty here, a tad bit too easy for older, experienced players and a tad bit too hard for someone who's just learning the ropes.With a ton of unlockable characters, mission and freeplay game modes, and downright over-the-top-awesomeness, the LMV should be easy to recommend: It is an awesome game and filled to the brim with charme and action.Still, I need to stress that this game makes not exactly much sense if you do not know the movie. And even IF you know the movie, you'll have a hard time following events, so much that the levels stop being a string of related missions and instead become little self-contained bits connected with (occasionally edited) movie footage. And this is odd, because the game clearly knows what it is doing. The movie has a bike chase, which is awesome. The game stretches this chase over a whole level, and adds to it, and makes it just twice as awesome because this time, it's you playing that scene. I would have loved to see the team make their own plot, with in-game rendered cutscenes, and maybe explore the LEGO world a bit more.Still, this is nitpicking. The fun is there, and chasing down all achievements and unlockables will take a while- and this is a game where you abseil into a LEGO chicken, get encased in a rainbow eggshell, have a unicorn-cat smash that eggshell and build a toy-mouse car out of the bricks, which you can then ride, as Batman, all the while grumbling how rainbows are soo corny.Need I say more?

												Absolutely worth it! Get it for 5€ on sale if ur not sure ;) Pretty long play time, very easy though which makes it easy to listen to music whilst playing this game! The graphics aren't the best but in my opinion are going to pleasure ur eyes if you are used to the old LEGO video games :)So: Get this game (even if you don't know the movie itself as me) for some calm gaming hours!

												A lot of game-breaking glitches. During the course of my gameplay, I had to restart at least 3 missions because of glitches (charachers gets stuck on the ground or begind an object or important scripted events would not trigger). Because of the glitches, do not explore the levels too much by flying and don't try to be wise or take shortcuts. Be sure to do what the game wants you to do. The game is fun otherwise, but clearly rushed and not finished. For this reason, i would not recomment. Maybe try other lego games instead ?			"

												I played this a lot when I had it on my Windows 7 and I was having a blast of a fun time with ''Honey, Where are my paaaants?'' But until now when I want to play it again on my gaming computer, it won't launch as it should. I've tried atleast 15 different things, but came out red-handed. The last thing I am doing is reinstalling the game and asking WB Support, and I recommend you doing that too if you ever get those kind of problems. I give this a 3/10 because it has a lot of issues with launching on most modern computers now.Marc			"

												I've kept my original below below but I'm updating this because my thoughts have changed a lot after playing lego Harry Potter 2. Overall, HP works because there is a lot of content and they can make a game where you experience the story through a lego story. The story of this game is the story of the lego movie but thats it. It has no charm and has no wit. HP had in jokes and references for fans and explained its story through a different medium but this game just repeats it. It's a lack of modification that made the game fun to play for a while but overall, I think made it boring and just not memorable. I'm still reccomending it because it's fun enough. But there is a certain air of ""movie tie in game"" where it's a game about a movie rather than a game ABOUT a movie that makes it seem cheap somehow. ORIGINAL REVIEW: It had it’s issues but it's fun enoughStory:The game story is the movie story pretty much. The advantage of this is that the movie rocked. Problem is that certain parts are stretched out and are entire levels (like the two seconds when you drop into the tunnels). The weird thing is that skips over the live action bits which means the point of the movie is skipped so it really feels like a movie videogame. Worst of all, it uses really badly compressed clips from the movie for cutscenes which look like absolute garbage.Gameplay:It’s another lego game. You walk around, collect studs, do minor puzzles, and collect a million other things. Unlike the HP games, the “progression” here is the introduction of new characters with different abilities. The characters are varied enough with a lot of different abilities so the gameplay is gradually opened up but unfortunately, you never control more than 5 at a time. Another issue is that there are a lot of shooting enemies and avoiding them is a ♥♥♥♥♥ because your ground speed is just not fast enough. Overall, I think because of the variety, the gameplay didn’t get as boring as Lego HP did but overall, there was less motivation to finish it. Initially, I was really annoyed of the concept of voice acting at all. I like the creativity you have to use to explain a complex plot via slapstick and it brings out humor. But it does have the problem of sounding really repetitive and annoying after 3 hours. Because of that reason, I warmed up to the concept of having voice acting but it’s just so bad. There are points where crowds need to talk and you’ll hear 4 voices. Plus, the voice actors sound like they’re doing it for a paycheck. It’s just terrible. Graphics/Performance: (with a 970, 4790K, 16GB of RAM, SSD)Locked to 60 for me but it crashed a bunch. Plus, you can’t change the resolution until you get into the actual game. The game itself looks good sort of. The shadows, reflections, and effects look really nice. But the color palette is muted sort of and some of the textures look like low resolution images scaled up. Final Thoughts:I really don’t know how to feel about the game. I liked the diversity of ability and levels but the voice acting and story were a disappointment. The gameplay itself was just normal lego stuff and overall, if you really like Lego games, try it out on sale.UNLESS YOU GO FOR THE 100%. GOOD LUCK WITH THAT♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I'm a huge fan of the Lego games. I've played both of the Harry Potter games as well as the Pirates of the Caribbean one on the wii. Having adored the movie I really wanted to try this game and I can say that I was not disapointed. It was my first time playing a Lego game on the computer and I found it much easier to play than on the wii. I haven't finished the game because I've just recently bought but I am hooked! It's really good and loads of fun. I highly recommend it! :) "

												Just as a preface, I've 100% this game.This is probably one of, if not the shortest LEGO games there is. I'm not sure how much of this game is accurate to the actual movie, but it seems to be the entire movie.The gameplay is basically like any other LEGO game, but this one definitely seems to be geared more towards little kids compared to other LEGO games (I imagine it's because of the movie). If you're buying this for your kids, they'll definitely have a good time. The gameplay is easy, It's got plenty of characters, it's got all the strange cutesy things that kids are into nowadays. And the music will probably make you want to off yourself because your kids will play it on repeat for the next 5 months.  If you're buying it for yourself as a 16+ year old, you'll probably enjoy going through the campaign, and netting yourself a few achievements along the way. You might even get a kick out of the music. If you're like me and buying it because you're a LEGO completionist. Do yourself a favor. Buy this game on sale, %100 it in a few hours. Shelf it. And never look at it again.Now we all know that LEGO games can be tedious, but this game for some reason seems like they cranked the tedium up to about 13. (I imagine to keep kids occupied). Getting %100 in this game was probably the worst experience I've ever had with a LEGO game. Just the mixture of the music, the cutesyness, and the overall fact that this particular LEGO game oozes the fact it's made specifically for little kids made me hate every second that I was playing for the %100.So in summary, if you have kids this game will be great for them.If you're a grown adult, unless you really want the %100, buy one of the other LEGO games and save yourself some sanity.

												Not a bad game but... controls are quite tricky. It's not that easy make your character go just where you want to move it. Besides that, it's nice and funny. It recreates the spirit of the movie. Plus, it has got some good details and extras and the 3D runs quite smooothly. I recommend it only if you are a fan of the movie, or a LEGO fan in general. Otherwise it can be a very boring experience.			"

												Although LEGO series is excellent, the game style is infinite, until you act something. That would mean, in some cases, the bad guys never ended their ammo, the train would go on and on forever and then accurately syncing its turn to your actions. Other than that, the game is well-designed, with a long storyline to follow. I'd recommend adding more realistic casual events that would happen naturally in real life. I rate it 5/7.			"

												Traveller's Tales has created another fantastic entry in the LEGO videogame universe.I have completed the entire game including the collectibles, and I must say, I am impressed. In this game the story adheres to the movie's story rather well, and uses cutscenes from the movie too, which is a nice touch. The game follows the same formula of platforming with action sequences and linear level designs that is common in other LEGO games, although the main quest was noticably shorter than the others I have played; it took me just under 30 hours to finish the story and go back through the levels to find the collectibles and unlock every achievement. I have also noticed there are less levels and they are dragged out to be longer than usual, which I personally didn't have an issue with. In some areas, things have changed a bit. The game's presented in a similar manner than that of the movie. The characters are modeled in what seems to be a more realistic form, and their movements match that of the movie's. In addition, almost everything is gorgeously rendered in LEGO form and is a marvel to analyze. Batman also provides some hilarious commentary at times. Fans of the movie should feel right at home.   Out of the LEGO series of games, I Loved:LEGO Batman 3: Beyond GothamLEGO Star Wars III: The Clone WarsThe LEGO Movie - VideogameLiked:LEGO BatmanLEGO MARVEL Super HeroesLEGO Star WarsLEGO Star Wars II: The Original TrilogyDisliked: LEGO Indiana Jones 2			"

												I hate to do this as it's a LEGO game, but it's so buggy as to be unplayable. I've had issues with LEGO games before, but nothing like this.According the the forums, many people have had this issue: during the first level, a cutscene plays then the game seems to loop a character animation. There is no way to get to the game menus or continue the game, the only way to exit being through ALT-TAB to Windows.TT games are well-known for their bugs and glitches, and the company's complete lack of interest in releasing patches to fix these problems. Too bad because it looks like it would be a fun game and very faithful to the movie which was great.			"

												I grew up with Lego as being one of the most constructive toys and am quite fond of it today. This game felt like a big, movie-inspired, digital Lego set. I loved it. Watch the movie before playing the game as it will turn the game into a more enjoyable and interactive double. This is the first Lego game I played which is an adaptation of something else (in this case Lego The Movie) and it has really startled my curiosity for other Lego titles.+ Fun, interactive hubs to explore+ Many characters, unlockables, achievements+ Puzzle-solving and fighting in a LEGO world+ Well defined details that bind the movie to the game+ Possiblity to save & quit anytime + Local Co-Op- Gameplay might seem repetitive- Took me a while to realize *how* to buy characters- No Trading Cards (Emotes/Backgrounds)Personal Ranking: 9/10 "

AI: 5/10,  Your allies wont fight the enemies most of the times, and if theres a single block between you and your ally, then your ally will get stuck.

												To start with, I must state that the single strongest point of the game, setting it apart fromother LEGO games - is that it actually has EVERYTHING made out of lego bricks (besides Worlds) - a huge step forward from the duller backdrops of the other games. Besides that, it is quite a basic in aspects of gameplay and mechanics, though the few tweaks, the instruction builds and the fact that only the so-called master builders are able to perform creative builds, are quite neat. Also, I really liked the hub worlds.But as I stated above, I was held in awe by the gorgeus lego-built world and the builds in it to such an extent, that if your heart isn't warmed by the sheer splendidness of it, then you'll probably find this game pretty average....otherwise, EVERYTHING IS AWESOME!!!

												Another brick in LEGO’s wall of games. In my opinion, The LEGO Movie Videogame is just another LEGO game; and thus has all the fun things you’d come to expect from one. Everything is good, well written and fun. The story is basically the same as the movie with a few minor changes to fit the game format. The gameplay is what you would expect, fun co-op, puzzle solving and of course, smashing everything in sight. The game has a semi-open world, that is very diverse, ranging from literal sunshines and rainbows to the desert heat of the wild west. The most defining feature of this game is the visual style, borrowed from the movie. Most LEGO games tend to have a mix of brick built objects and non-brick objects. However, this one stands out; due to being visually represented entirely by LEGO elements (save for the bonus level). Even the character animations are decisively LEGO, differing greatly from how characters move in other LEGO games. Unfortunately, aside from its distinct style, The LEGO Movie Videogame is just another LEGO game. It doesn’t change much from the formula and as such feels like an almost copy and paste from other previous games. There’s nothing wrong with the game, it’s just… average. There’s just not enough to make it stand out in the crowd of LEGO games. It’s not bad or below standard, just… average.  All in all, if you like LEGO games then, let’s face it, you’ve probably already bought this game. If you don’t mind the occasional LEGO game then there are better LEGO games to play. That’s not to say i don’t recommend getting this game, it still has its merit and is just as good as any LEGO game before it. So if you see it on sale, just give it a go; you won't be disappointed.

												I enjoyed the Lego Movie, and I enjoyed this game. Whilst the gameplay can get slightly repetitive (sometimes it feels like elements have been added just to pad out levels for the sake of it), the joy of playing in the Lego Movie universe usually tides you over. My children are big fans too.			"

												Another brick in LEGO’s wall of games. In my opinion, The LEGO Movie Videogame is just another LEGO game; and thus has all the fun things you’d come to expect from one. Everything is good, well written and fun. The story is basically the same as the movie with a few minor changes to fit the game format. The gameplay is what you would expect, fun co-op, puzzle solving and of course, smashing everything in sight. The game has a semi-open world, that is very diverse, ranging from literal sunshines and rainbows to the desert heat of the wild west. The most defining feature of this game is the visual style, borrowed from the movie. Most LEGO games tend to have a mix of brick built objects and non-brick objects. However, this one stands out; due to being visually represented entirely by LEGO elements (save for the bonus level). Even the character animations are decisively LEGO, differing greatly from how characters move in other LEGO games. Unfortunately, aside from its distinct style, The LEGO Movie Videogame is just another LEGO game. It doesn’t change much from the formula and as such feels like an almost copy and paste from other previous games. There’s nothing wrong with the game, it’s just… average. There’s just not enough to make it stand out in the crowd of LEGO games. It’s not bad or below standard, just… average.  All in all, if you like LEGO games then, let’s face it, you’ve probably already bought this game. If you don’t mind the occasional LEGO game then there are better LEGO games to play. That’s not to say i don’t recommend getting this game, it still has its merit and is just as good as any LEGO game before it. So if you see it on sale, just give it a go; you won't be disappointed.

												Bought on a sale. If you like the movie, you'll probably have fun playing the game in local coop mode with a friend, that's what I bought this for and it was fun.The main disapointments are the bugs and glitches all over. It's very easy to get stuck in a corner, specially annoying when it's actually an invisible corner with some invisible walls, there are far too many invisible walls. Vehicles get stuck all the time, just the curb is enough to get it stuck. Vehicle driving mechanics are different between the open world and the missions (Why the f***!? WHY!??).Still, fun story, same as the movie. OK gameplay.			"

												Lots of imagination, lots of fun turns and twists, but painfully short, with tiny play area and NO insentive to play again. One would say this is a tough choice, but only if their playing singleplayer with a standard keyboard and mouse.If you play the game with a standard keyboard and mouse, by yourself, you'll have no problems, but try to play with a controller or another person.

												Having played this game, I can safely say it's the most simple LEGO game ever. But for me, that's a good thing, as I can never seem to get very far with any of the other ones. This one makes it a bit easier for me, and I really enjoy the magic of this game. I would highly reccomend it to anyone who enjoys LEGO games and the LEGO movie.			"

												I've kept my original below below but I'm updating this because my thoughts have changed a lot after playing lego Harry Potter 2. Overall, HP works because there is a lot of content and they can make a game where you experience the story through a lego story. The story of this game is the story of the lego movie but thats it. It has no charm and has no wit. HP had in jokes and references for fans and explained its story through a different medium but this game just repeats it. It's a lack of modification that made the game fun to play for a while but overall, I think made it boring and just not memorable. I'm still reccomending it because it's fun enough. But there is a certain air of ""movie tie in game"" where it's a game about a movie rather than a game ABOUT a movie that makes it seem cheap somehow. ORIGINAL REVIEW: It had it’s issues but it's fun enoughStory:The game story is the movie story pretty much. The advantage of this is that the movie rocked. Problem is that certain parts are stretched out and are entire levels (like the two seconds when you drop into the tunnels). The weird thing is that skips over the live action bits which means the point of the movie is skipped so it really feels like a movie videogame. Worst of all, it uses really badly compressed clips from the movie for cutscenes which look like absolute garbage.Gameplay:It’s another lego game. You walk around, collect studs, do minor puzzles, and collect a million other things. Unlike the HP games, the “progression” here is the introduction of new characters with different abilities. The characters are varied enough with a lot of different abilities so the gameplay is gradually opened up but unfortunately, you never control more than 5 at a time. Another issue is that there are a lot of shooting enemies and avoiding them is a ♥♥♥♥♥ because your ground speed is just not fast enough. Overall, I think because of the variety, the gameplay didn’t get as boring as Lego HP did but overall, there was less motivation to finish it. Initially, I was really annoyed of the concept of voice acting at all. I like the creativity you have to use to explain a complex plot via slapstick and it brings out humor. But it does have the problem of sounding really repetitive and annoying after 3 hours. Because of that reason, I warmed up to the concept of having voice acting but it’s just so bad. There are points where crowds need to talk and you’ll hear 4 voices. Plus, the voice actors sound like they’re doing it for a paycheck. It’s just terrible. Graphics/Performance: (with a 970, 4790K, 16GB of RAM, SSD)Locked to 60 for me but it crashed a bunch. Plus, you can’t change the resolution until you get into the actual game. The game itself looks good sort of. The shadows, reflections, and effects look really nice. But the color palette is muted sort of and some of the textures look like low resolution images scaled up. Final Thoughts:I really don’t know how to feel about the game. I liked the diversity of ability and levels but the voice acting and story were a disappointment. The gameplay itself was just normal lego stuff and overall, if you really like Lego games, try it out on sale.UNLESS YOU GO FOR THE 100%. GOOD LUCK WITH THAT♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Just as a preface, I've 100% this game.This is probably one of, if not the shortest LEGO games there is. I'm not sure how much of this game is accurate to the actual movie, but it seems to be the entire movie.The gameplay is basically like any other LEGO game, but this one definitely seems to be geared more towards little kids compared to other LEGO games (I imagine it's because of the movie). If you're buying this for your kids, they'll definitely have a good time. The gameplay is easy, It's got plenty of characters, it's got all the strange cutesy things that kids are into nowadays. And the music will probably make you want to off yourself because your kids will play it on repeat for the next 5 months.  If you're buying it for yourself as a 16+ year old, you'll probably enjoy going through the campaign, and netting yourself a few achievements along the way. You might even get a kick out of the music. If you're like me and buying it because you're a LEGO completionist. Do yourself a favor. Buy this game on sale, %100 it in a few hours. Shelf it. And never look at it again.Now we all know that LEGO games can be tedious, but this game for some reason seems like they cranked the tedium up to about 13. (I imagine to keep kids occupied). Getting %100 in this game was probably the worst experience I've ever had with a LEGO game. Just the mixture of the music, the cutesyness, and the overall fact that this particular LEGO game oozes the fact it's made specifically for little kids made me hate every second that I was playing for the %100.So in summary, if you have kids this game will be great for them.If you're a grown adult, unless you really want the %100, buy one of the other LEGO games and save yourself some sanity.

												Love the movie and love all the Lego games. I've read complaints about this one being too different.But aside from the few game stopping bugs, like getting stuck in spots with no way out but to quit the game and try again, this game is great.  It is also the first one my kids (4 & 6) can play together easily without my help.  Definitely geared toward a more mass audience / age group so it makes sense.  There is currently a frustrating bug if doing multiplayer.In story mode there are intermissions where you have to select correct lego pieces to progress in the story.For us, it would never let us select the top middle one and there's no way around.I found that we can select it if we pressed up on both controllers simultaneously.Is if you find yourself stuck, that is a solution that worked for us.Definitely a good game. Definitely recommend it if you're a lego movie fan.Its a little buggy and less polished than say, Lego Batman 3, etc.  But still great.			"

												A fun game that follows the plot of the movie. You'll recognize a lot of the characters, and many of the sub-missions feature background characters from the various locations.That said, this game is *incredibly* buggy. I haven't encountered anything game breaking or that required me to start a new save file, but I have had to restart levels that crashed, find workarounds for broken missions and so on. I'd still recommend it for fans of the LEGO games, just be aware that you might need to get creative and restart levels here and there.			"

Voices were excellent, graphics and visuals are stunning, lot of comedy. What more could you ask for. Don't pay for the DLC. Wait until it gets cheap because at £1.99 it's not worth it.

												Cool Game!If you're doubting the game will be good, you should probably wait for a sale on it (like i did) and then see how it is. If it's not fun, i'd recommend refunding it!			"

												If I could recommend this game without any detail I'd say that it's too AWESOME to be a movie tie-in game.This is a lego game that is fun ,replayable .funny ,easy for the younger crowd to 100% and nearly everything is lego instead of the background (or anything not interacting with) being cheaply realistick.I do have flaws with the game it doesn't do anything with the story almost to the part where it's lazy so if you have not seen the lego movie yet you'll need too watch it before playing this game that's probably a dumb thing to say because who on earth has not seen the lego movie yet? ,also you know how I said that it's easy for the younger crowd to 100% well that means that the game is quite short aswell you can finish the story mode in less than a day and 100% completion should take about 3 to 6 days and lastly but more fuastratingly is the code system if you don't know lego games have a code system to unlock a secret item that can only be accessed by the codes in the lego products (the sets you'll need are 70813,70814,70815 and 70816) and the problem is the lego movie theme is discontinued and you'll have to pay extra if you want to get the codes.overall it's a very great game not the best lego game out there but it's certainly one of the best movie tie-in games out there!

 If you liked the movie you'll probably like this too. A great chill out game when you have a few minutes to spare. Not entirely sure on the open world sections between missions, but I was only interested in completing the story if I am honest. Graphics look nice once set properly & Emmett is awesome. On sale its great! 8/10 "

												So I give this game a 7 to 8 ratings. Reasons are there are way to many damn glitches, some that gave me a ""heart attack"" a.k.a those damn cats. Anyways, most gltiches were easy to get rid of. Now the second reason is that it was VERY SHORT for a lego game, Other games has like 100 to 300 gold bricks..... this has 70 GOLD BRICKS!!!!!??? That surprised me. Final reason is the ""the depth lvl"", first time playing it with no red bricks to help you is really tedious of sort. after that is ok, anyways tht is my review			"
