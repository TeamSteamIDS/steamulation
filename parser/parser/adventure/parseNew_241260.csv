												One of my favorite games from 2014, and probably my all time favorite detective game is this. Crimes and Punishment is a blast to play! The new engine offers breathtaking views and stunning textures, and the voice acting is fantastic. You have to make moral choices in this game, which affects the story.The cases are much more interesting in this game then the previous Sherlock games, thanks to great mission variation. Solve murders, investigate thefts and missing people. ""Will you follow the law or your moral?"", is the question you have to go by on every case.Every case is smart and well thought out. You always think you understand who did the crime, until it suddenly turns the other way around. When you finally complete a case you feel satisfied though. You will look around for a long time, just because you want to find every clue. If you get stuck you can get hints, look in your journal and ask doctor Watson.I think this game is very underrated. It's one of the most polished games released in 2014 and offers a great story with absolutely fantastic cases. If you haven't picked this game up yet, please consider doing it. I really hope Frogware will release more content for this game. DLC, expansion or sequel, because I adore the game and would really wish for more great and exciting cases to solve.Crimes and Punishment gets a warm recommendation from me.			"

												I took it upon myself to wait until I had received 100% of the achievements before making my review.Compared to The Testament of Sherlock Holmes, Frogwares and Focus Entertainment have come a VERY LONG WAY! From astoundingly beautiful graphics, to great plotlines and endless solutions, I was in awe the entire time. The one thing I loved the most was the way they improved on Sherlock Holmes's personality. Compared to Testament, Holmes in Crimes and Punishments has a more gentle and chivalrous side to him, which is something definitely found in the books. I'm an oldschool Sherlock Holmes fan, so this game was perfect!I am very excited to see possible sequels in the future.			"

												[SPOILER FREE]Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishment is a beautiful and impressive  adventure puzzle game starring a very popular detective  who players will enjoy playing as to solve crime and choosing  thier own choices in a case's outcome through deduction.First off, the graphics of the game use the unreal engine 3 and a step up for the series.The facial features of the characters such as pores, scars, and even the detail on the clothing.  Not only is the character  detailed but so are the aesthetics and details put into each of the maps that the players will traverse to solve crimes, which gives it a it more immersion.The music is appropriate for the game and kicks in at the right moment though the rest of the time the game is pretty quiet to letting concentrate and could use more to bring immersion. The voice acting is also decently done for most of the characters in the game and brings them to life in the game world.Players can  play the game with either a keyboard and mouse or with a game pad. Both are configured well and didn't include key binding, which isn't too bad since there aren't many keys to press for this type  of game genre. Players be able to play this game in first or 3rd person whichever choice you decide.  The controls may feel a bit stiff but overall it is not too bad at all.Each of the maps in this game is really focused on the area where the crime appears. You won't find yourself in unnecessary places or free roaming since it isn't that sort of game though it is something to suggest for a future sequel. The game uses a fast travel system to travel around the map with a push of a button. With a button click, players can  bring up a map and click on locations to travel where they need to go whenever you want. With each loading screen, Sherlock in the cab where the interface can also be brought up for the  menu to look over the clues, evidence, and deduction while they wait. The menu itself is very sleek and organized.The game play to Sherlock is to solve puzzles, gather evidence and to come up with deduction and solve crimes. The puzzles range from ordinary lock puzzles where you match locks to complicated puzzles where you rebuild molds, combine chemicals or find clues to fix certain situation, compare notes, Extreme arm wrestling and lots more variety to keep the game intriguing. There is a skip function for those that get frustrated or stuck at a puzzle but keep in mind that it is a puzzle game, and that self-satisfaction comes from solving by oneself.Sherlock is armed with an arsenal of tools to help him combine clues and solve puzzles. Focus will help him see things that he will miss at times such as small marks and such. Imagination is  when he gathers enough clues to solve a puzzle, he will be able to recreate the scenario in his mind to gather more clues and evidence and finally when he does get all this, he will be capable to go into deduction. In deduction mode, Sherlock can look over his facts and evidence, draw a line between them and form bubbles and by doing so created deductions. Sometimes there is only one deduction in a bubble but other times. There will be two totals. As players look through all these bubbles, they'll be able to draw and combine a conclusion to the case. If the case is a contradiction, it will tell you between the bubbles. If it combines there will be a larger bubble and there will be a choice to the entire  scenario. Either the person is guilty/innocent or an alternative choice route opened will be up to players to decide by finding enough clues and evidence.The game introduces five case scenario total and may take a player 12-15 hours total to complete depending on how good they are at gathering clues and puzzles. My opinion is that this is possibly the best puzzle/adventure game I have yet played. I enjoyed it though some of my cons are that the disguise function wasn't used as greatly as I thought and that the game hopefully will be even frequently more expansive with the deduction system in the future because that felt like the real meat of the game to me personally.Pros+ The graphic details are beautiful. You can see the details of the faces of characters, clothes, and the aesthetic to the background looks great with the Unreal 3 engine.+ The puzzles are brilliant+ The case themselves are very realistic  in a sense+ Brilliant story and cases. Especially the third case Blood Bath.+ The voice acting is decently done. Most of the characters sounded great.+ Deduction offers the players choices and replayability. Multiple choices on how to punish a crime or finish it off with another outcome.+ Game lasts 12-15 hours Cons- Though beautiful the maps were decently sized and it felt too closed in especially with parts blocked off. Hopefully we'll see even larger areas in the future.- Disguises weren't used as much in the game- There is a skip button that pops up everytime that just seems to invite players to push it. Should be something you can turn off- The online feature should take in more stats instead of just who chooses the choice or discovering it.Youtubet/Twitch- KenutySubscribe if you like my review and follow up on curator  search ""stream"".Video review -

												As a fan of adventure games i am always looking for new and entertaining adventure games to play. I‘m very picky and not every adventure game will satisfy my needs. I have stumbled on Sherlock Holmes Crimes and Punishment a while ago and added it to my wishlist. I bought it on summer sale and i don‘t regret it. I love the game.First thing what caughts  the eye is graphics. It is rare for an adventure game to have a really good graphics. Keep in mind that „technically good“ and „nice to the eye“ is different. A drawn 2D graphics can look much better than technically more advanced 3D graphics with poor 3D models. I remember when Broken Sword gone to 3D graphics, it looked awful, i was angry about that, i was disappointed that developers decided to go that way instead of just classical 2D graphics. It was a trend at that time and it was a bad trend. Sherlock Holmes Crimes and Punishment is one of those adventure games in full 3D where graphics looks really nice. Character face models are amazing. It lacks better animations like in Beyond two souls, Heavy rain or LA Noire, but i guess this game had much smaller budget, so it‘s really amazing what they had achieved in graphics department. Environments looks great too. You can take rally nice looking screenshots. The environments are different and pretty detailed. In short i don‘t have any complaints regarding graphics.The game consists from 6 chapters which are 2,5-3 hours long each. The gameplay consists from exploring the crime scene, taking notice of every detail, gathering evidence and talking to the witnesses and victims. After all these things are done you can start a deduction process where you must make connections between collected statements and evidence and get a conclusion. There are few outcomes in every case, there‘re always few suspects and you can wrongly accuse a person of doing a crime and condemned him. But most fun is to find out who‘s the real culprit is. Even when you find him you can absolve him or make him guilty so that he would receive his punishment. It‘s your moral choice at the end of the chapter.The game is not too hard but it‘s not easy either. You can be stuck at some point not knowing what to do. As always it‘s just some small thing you missed. There are some puzzles in the game. Each case has few of them. I like that puzzles are all different and are pretty logical and not too complicated except for lock hacking puzzles. They‘re in every case and sometimes you get more than one of it. But you can skip the puzzles, it doesn‘t have any impact to the story or outcome.All in all i recommend this game to everyone who loves adventure games, you will not be disappointed. This is one of those hidden gems (*cough* The Book of Unwritten Tales 2 *cough*) made by a small company which probably didn‘t pay back. "

												This is the perfect Sherlock Holmes game. In Crimes and Punishments, you have six cases to solve, and its completely up to you to deduce the facts, and bring about judgment. Oh there is so much goodness where to start? The game is gorgeous. Victorian England never looked so good. The amount of different places you get to visit is amazing, from beautiful mansions to seedy back alleys. The voice acting is superb. Also, the voice synch is perfect. What I really love about this game is that after finishing a case, you can always come back when you want to do another case, without worrying if they are connected in any way. Each case comes with so many different possibly outcomes, if you find the evidence and come to certain conclusions. How you sentence who you believe is guilty also influences how the public sees you. The in-game journal is wonderful in helping you keep track of who is involved in the case, what items can help you advance the case, or look back at a dialogue that may have a clue. So the good stuff in a nutshell: The Look, the writing and the acting, the Game Mechanics, and the Stories of each Case. The negatives: I can't find them. This is a great game to start with if you are interested in the Sherlock Holmes franchise. If you have already played through the catalog available of SH titles, I dare say you must play this because I think you'll find this to be arguably the best SH games to date.			"

""Be quiet Watson, I'm trying to concentrate.""As puzzle games go, Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments is fairly tame. As tedious as the achievement for reaching all conclusions is (if that matters), the game is worth the experience - well thought-out characters, realistic motivations and a chance to play at being the world's greatest detective.There are six individual cases, or chapters if you will, each with a unique crime for you to solve. Gameplay involves first gathering the evidence in the form of point-and-click / exploration. Suspects and other people are interviewed. During the course of doing this, sometimes additional information about clues you find can only be discovered by researching Holmes' archive, or by conducting an experiment, or even by chemical analysis. All of these actions combine to give you deductions, which take the form of facts floating around inside Holmes' brain, visualised by neurons firing between each other.The next part is what I find to be the most fun though. Just having these facts floating around inside your head isn't enough. You have to put them together. For example: a person needs a certain Strength Requirement to wield a harpoon properly, also you know the victim was Pinned to the Wall. Put them together, and you conclude the murderer must be physically strong. Put enough of the facts together and you'll be able to conclude who the guilty party is.It comes as no surprise that there are various conclusions for each chapter. Each of them makes its own kind of logical sense, and is fun to experiment with. There is even a 'correct' answer to each of the cases - and the opportunity to check whether you have the right one or not is entirely optional, meaning nothing is given away without your wanting it. The only problem I find with replaying for different endings is the necessity of starting the case over again from scratch - there is no option to simply replay your deductions from near the end of the case. This unfortunately makes for a bit of a grind as some cases have numerous location changes - many of which are for as little as a single item - meaning you will grow bored of seeing the interior of Holmes's carriage very quickly. One case has as many as six different endings.More on the gameplay. I've already mentioned finding objects, interrogation, drawing deductions. In addition, there is lockpicking (an interesting take on a concept rife in so many games today), imagination (a little-used idea that works well to break up other gameplay elements), and there are also conversation events whereby Sherlock catches people out in lies. Leaving people gaping like fish and floundering for words is very enjoyable.The cast for voice-acting is excellent, although I think it is soured by Robinson's aussie accent. There are two aussies in this game - while Lady Brackenstall sounds more genuine, Robinson sounds exaggerated, a bit too much like Steve Irwin for my liking. Perhaps for the time-period (1890s) this is accurate, and perhaps it adds to his character, but I just found it too over-the-top.The visuals are mildly impressive. While nothing stands out as particularly fantastic, the landscapes and rooms depicted are done well enough that you feel transported to late 19th Century England. Typewriters and the general hubbub of Scotland Yard offices is one of the better sounds.In closing, I should point out that the game is inspired by Arthur Conan Doyle's stories, and that Crime and Punishment is a reference to Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel of the same title - giving the gamer the opportunity to find the right culprit, and to make the moral choice of condemning or absolving their actions.

												This entry into Frogwares' Sherlock Holmes series is the biggest change since The Awakened.Frogwares' switch to the Unreal engine seems to have paid off, as this is by far their best looking SH game yet.The voice acting has also greatly improved, and together with improved character animations, C&P delivers a cinematic, high production value experience.The gameplay, on the other hand, is the simplest yet. C&P plays a bit more like an interactive movie such as Heavy Rain or The Walking Dead than a typical adventure game. But the experience is still rather enjoyable, and the change certainly makes C&P the most accessible title yet. The game also seems to borrow the ""observation text"" from the BBC Sherlock mini-series, which is a nice touch. I think there may be some inspiration taken from LA Noire as well.Although there are few puzzles to speak of, the most interesting feature is the ""conclusion system"". Even if you uncover all the clues (which is very easy to do), the player is able to deduce multiple conclusions. Only one conclusion is ""correct"", but it isn't always obvious which that is. The game requires you to pay attention and in some cases think rather carefully in order to come to the right conclusion.The game also appears to borrow from Telltale's TWD and Wolf Among Us in introducing episodic gameplay with a ""moral choice"" at the end of each case. There are 6 cases total, each lasting roughly 2-3 hours. In addition to deciding the conclusion of each case, you decide between two moral choices. This doesn't seem to have much impact aside from showing you a different ending sequence. Although saving is automatic, after finishing a particular case ending sequence, you can restart before you committed to the conclusion and moral choice. This conveniently allows you to see all possible endings, if you so desire, in one playthrough.Although the episodic gameplay introduces more variety than previously seen, the individual cases are not quite as compelling as the storylines of previous titles. Some cases are perhaps a bit too obvious, although there's still plenty of cleverness in the writing.As an ardent fan of Sherlock Holmes adaptations as well as the source material, I definitely recommend this title.It's also fairly easy to unlock 100% achievements. This is possible to do in one playthrough, although doing so without a walkthrough would be difficult. Unfortunately, most walkthroughs tend to spoil the plots of the cases. It is possible to replay any case after completing the game, though.			"

												Everything about this game is fantastic except for the arbitrary nature of the deduction system. There will typically be at least three solutions with separate suspects and different means of having committed the crime. The different clues which have been collected during the investigation must be arranged to form different deductions in order to single out the perpetrator. The system is genius except for the fact, that the developers have failed to make some deductions more correct or coherent than others. Thus you can never be sure your chosen solution - based on solid reasoning (what Sherlock Holmes is supposed to be all about!) - will be correct. Even if you have taken all things into considerations and logically chosen the most likely explanation. This have been incredibly frustrating and immersion breaking. To further explain what I mean by the solution being arbitrary, I will provide the following observation:Any case in  ""Crimes & Punishments"" will have established means, motives and opportunities for all suspects, if you diligently have found all the different clues. The problem as I see it is, that there should at least be some few things that makes one suspect more likely than the other, or deductions that stood out as far less sound, as they appeared to be in conflict with other circumstances like causality or the existence of contradictory evidence, but no. All the solutions are equal in likelihood and reasoning, and as Sherlock Holmes we are bound to make a decision on who we would most wish to see having committed the crime or who we intuitively believe did the crime based on knowledge of crime cliches. It seams the developers have constructed the clues, deductions and solutions in order to  fit the model of ""means, motives and opportunities"" as conditions in order to establish guilt as found in common law legal systems. This still only provides a dissatisfying experience, as this doesn't prove the actual guilt of the suspect, which in turn today nor in Victorian era Britain were enough to lift the needed burden of prof of having committed a crime. Establishing the presence of these three elements is not, in and of itself, sufficient to provide a conviction beyond reasonable doubt; the evidence must prove that an opportunity presented was indeed taken by the suspect and for the crime with which he or she is charged. In ""Crimes & Punishments"" the different solutions are entirely equal in probability, and this is the prime weakness of the system: If all the suspects can be reasoned to be equally as likely the ones who committed the crime, then they are all equally as unlikely to be guilty, and in a court of law this would actually make providing a conviction impossible. The conclusion simply  cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. It frustrates and saddens me, that the deduction system have been built in such a way as the solutions are wholly arbitrary and in total disconnect with the books of sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Mainly because if you can ignore this, then the game is fantastic. The atmosphere is fantastic and the locations and voice acting is great.			"

												-The gameplay for the most part keeps in line with the rest of the series, with only a few noteworthy departures. There's now a sort of ""detective vision"" that highlights examinable objects, and while it can be ignored most of the time, it is sometimes necessary to find things like scratches on a lock or markings on the floor. The game does bring up a prompt when it's required, however, so you can safely ignore it otherwise if you choose to for the sake of immersion or challenge. You also now have the ability to talk with suspects at jail, and can present evidence to them to disprove any lies they may be telling you. Finally, you can now access the wardrobe and disguise kit at any time by going to your apartment, and you can select from a small variety of hats, facial hairs, and suits to wear (which is sometimes required for the sake of disguising yourself). Aside from these changes, anyone who's played the previous entries will be right at home (and the game does give minor references to the previous games in the series); there are still more ""classic-style"" adventure game puzzles (though they're sometimes repeated, like this one lock puzzle that shows up around once per case), and things like Holmes's chemistry set are used once again. -The game does give you more freedom than the previous games, which I think adds a lot to the experience. To use the first case as an example, by the time you've collected all the clues and pieced them together (you do this on your own in a menu, rather than having Holmes explain everything away for you), you're left with three different suspects, which you then have to choose from on your own based on your evidence. You're free to arrest any of them, and the game doesn't actually tell you which one was correct unless you choose to reveal the ""spoiler"" at the end of the case. You also get to choose to either condemn or absolve the criminal, which seems to be more of a moral choice than an actual logical one. The game ultimately leaves a lot up to the player, but it does slightly hold your hand. If you have evidence that needs to be used, discussed with someone, or researched in the archive at your apartment, it'll have a small icon on it in the inventory menu that tells you that. The game also somewhat spoils you with the Objectives menu, in that it makes it difficult to not find all the evidence due to the game generally not removing a ""Investigate ____"" objective until you've found everything in a particular area. If there was one thing I could change about the game it would be the inclusion of a ""classic mode"" that removes the objectives menu and the icons, and I hope they will take this into consideration for further games.-One thing that bothered me is that there isn't much of a connection between the cases, and there doesn't seem to be any consequences for your choices. Whenever you choose to let the killer go free, Sherlock makes up an excuse to tell Scotland Yard and that's basically the end of it, with the only continuation of each case being receiving a letter from the culprit at the start of the next case thanking you and explaining what they're doing now. I don't think that this diminishes the effect very much, since on a by-case basis I do still care about the characters and I think just having a choice at all is a great step forward, but it'd be nice for them to put some sort of penalty on absolving people instead of condeming them so that it would be more difficult to just let everyone go free (which might end up happening a lot, since the culprits generally have at least a slightly element of moral grayness with some exceptions).-One of the cases is rather short, but aside from that outlier they're each somewhere around 3 hours long, and there are 6 of them in total. If you prefer games with a long-running narrative instead of 6 mostly unrelated smaller cases then you might be disappointed with this. The game's overall length is fine in my opinion, but on a by-case basis the cases are somewhat short.-This is a small feature, but one thing that I thought was really neat is that during the loading screens between areas it shows Holmes and whoever is travelling with you in a carriage and allows you to access your evidence to review the case or your deductions to link points together while the game loads, so that you aren't just sitting around waiting. The loading times aren't substantial enough to be irritating anyways in my experience, but it's a nice touch.-The graphics are extremely good, particularly in the character models. The characters' faces are very well-detailed and animated.-The characters all seem to have been at least slightly redesigned, though Watson mostly still resembles his old appearance. And I can't say for certain, but it seems like everyone has different voice actors now. They still sound close enough that it isn't jarring, and they've already grown on me after one case so it's not a problem, but it's something worth mentioning. Edit: I've noticed that Sherlock hasn't actually changed designs, it just looks that way because of his new default hairstyle. He does look slightly different than he did before facially, but when you use the wardrobe to put his old hat on (which happens automatically in the second case) he looks almost the same.-Creepy Watson does not appear to be in the game, despite the April Fools video giving hope that he might be back. RIP Creepy Watson 2008 - 2008Overall, if you're a fan of the game series or just enjoy Sherlock Holmes or mystery novels in general, you could make worse purchases than this. It's a strong mystery game overall, though there are a few things that I hope they do better with in later games.			"

												I picked up this game while looking for an old school point and click. It's not that at all. It's more like an interactive story with a few added  case solving mechanics and mini games. This will really annoy a lot of die hard fans of the old Sierra or LucasArts games so you should really look at a video walthrough of the first few minutes before getting it.  Usually I'd put myself in that class but I found  the sheer entertainment value of this game is one of the best I've come across.Best points: Excellent visuals and voice acting, Properly laugh out loud moments alongside the more serious plots.20-25 hours of gameplay. Worth the high price.Perfectly designed characters. Whoever scripted Watson is a genius.Interesting and fun mechanics for deduction analysis and a few other minigamesBad pointsVery little challenge in puzzles or deductionThe transfer time between locations is painfully slowNo save games. You can replay chapter endings but otherwise nothingSome minigames have horribly clunky interfaces.Some of the pathing is a bit irritating. Most often Watson gets in your way and its a fight to get aound him to where your next clue is. If you want a bit more detail...The only people who I would advise to stay away from this are those solely interested in puzzle based old school point and click games. The game is made up of 6 chapters, each based around an original Holmes story so they inherit some good writing. In each you walk Holmes around crime related scenes picking up clues, questioning suspects and doing research. This gives you thoughts which you have to link together correctly to make deductions that you tie together to solve a case.  It is a fun mechanic but the deductions are sometimes too obvious. o=One or two are nonsensical. There's a bit of embarrassingly bad science in some minigames too but if you can get over that then the dialogue, characters  and plot make this really good entertainment.			"

												I wasn't expecting much from this game,  but I have been consistently impressed by the quality of the writing, voice acting, and visuals. Playing as Sherlock Holmes is made interesting by way of a unique system for connecting deducations (represented as synapses in his brain) that creates different outcomes depending on how they are arranged.   You gain deductions by following up on clues,  which requires talking to people,  inspecting the environment, and playing a variety of mini games (everything from lock picking to arm wrestling, to chemistry).   The characters have incredibly good facial animation and well rendered skin (definitely the best use of sub surface scattering that i've seen in a game) which, combined with some truly stellar voice work, gives them an extremely 'human' quality.  All of this leads you to care about them,  and the stories they have.   That's a pretty important thing, because the bulk of the game is spent listening to them speak. If you are into adventure or puzzle games, or just someone who appreciates great visuals and attention to detail this is a game well worth picking up.  I would give this game 10/10 raging clues.			"

												I was thuroughly satisfied with this game. I enjoyed the movies, the books, and the BBC television show. It is only natural that I should try and enjoy the video game.PROS- Graphics are steller.- The logical deduction puts more of the solving power in your hands.- I liked the voice acting for the most part.- Super fun.CONS- The limited walking is that illusion of freedom in the hub-world. Which is fine, but distracting.- Recycled voice actors can be distracting.- While you can draw your own conclusions, and it does give you the option to choose a ""right way"" and a more honorable, merciful way -- the choices do not reflect game play long term.Overall: 8.5/10			"

												The closest I've yet seen to capturing the escense of playing the consulting detective. The stories are for the most part well written, and with good mechanics to help you explore the crimescenes fully. The most impressive mechanic here is the system set up to ""gather your thoughts"", where you combine clues to create a basis for deduction and those deductions lead you towards the truth of the matter. The mechanic in itself is ingenious, but what really satisfied me is how the storytellers have utilized it, to the point where you can actually legitimately deduce the ""wrong"" answer, allowing you to further imerse yourself by making the needed deductions in between to lead you on the right path.That being said, there is still room for improvement in how one investigates a crimescene, as this game as earlier games still carries the stigma of old point'n'click adventures where you don't find much outside of what is actually usefull. A bit of ""clutter"" when it comes to items would be a lovely way to let you do more of the detecting on your own.A minor gripe as this game is a huge leap in the right direction for detective games.

												+ Graphics (with facial animations in particular)+ 6 varied cases with different outcomes, depending on your research and choices+ Newly added gameplay mechanics make it even more fun to be a detective+ Lack of a bigger story also makes it more fun (there is one but not everything is connected with weird and awkward plot twists this time)+ Voice acting is mostly solid- Puzzle difficulty is still rather easy- Limited freedom- Would've loved to see more cases[Rating: 81/100]			"

												Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments is a game that consists of 6 playable mysterious cases of the world famous detective.Gameplay 8.5 of 10The game captures the feel of the Victorian London quite well, the whole environment design is really detailed, including tapestry, pictures on the wall, clothes and manner of speaking. You collect pieces of evidence and use Sherlock Holmes power of deduction to come to a reasonable conclusion and uncover the truth. But be aware, can you come to the right conclusion? Or are you going to verdict an innocent man? Sometimes you know quite fast who did the crime, but how can you prove it? Use all of your senses. Smell , vision and hearing and if you can't find the conclusion yourself , you can get help from Sherlock Holmes dog Toby and sometimes you can also switch characters ,so you can play as Watson. You can also reenact some crimes in your mind to see if the witness’s statements are conclusive.Graphics 8 of 10 The graphics are really good, you can even see dust particles in the air. The unreal engine really did do some good for the game. Especially the faces, when you're interrogating the witness's. You almost can’t tell they are game characters. They look so real.Sound 8 of 10 There is slight background music, a little mellow, but fitting the scenery perfect and sometimes it's adding suspense. The voice acting is top notch. The English actors are truly good and really make you feel like you are in England at that time.I played some of the other Sherlock Holmes games and this feels like it could be one of my favorites. So I would definitely recommend it to every adventure gamer who likes a good story and engaging puzzles.Even for gamers who are just starting out , this is a good way to start into adventures and point-and-click games.

												9/10genre : point and click adventure game in 3rd person Another Sherlock Holmes adventure game, where as the famous detective , you have to solve 6 varied cases such as thefts, murders and missing persons.+ Awesome presentation, best looking adventure game i have ever played, especially the character models are some of the best i have seen in gaming.+ The cases you have to solve are varied and the atmosphere is dark, grim at times, the writing and dialogues are excellent.+ Great soundtrack and voice acting.+ Gameplay wise you use the famous skills of Sherlock : collect clues, examine them, use your tools at Baker's street, interrogate suspects at crime scenes or at the Scotland Yard, reconstruct crime scenes and use intuition skills to discover hidden clues, use your loyal dog , use disguises and much more to collect all the evidence and from your deductions name the guilty parties. Apart from discovering who is guilty you have to make moral decisions as to what their fate will be and at the end of each case you get to see the percentage of other people's choices. There is great freedom of choice, since after gathering some evidence you can choose who is guilty or continue playing , since most of the times you have to go beyond the obvious and collect more clues to find the truth.+ Unless you do everything right in each case from the first time , there is some replayability, i had to replay 2 of the cases since i was biased the first time playing them .+ Good duration, over 15 hours to complete all cases.- Long loading times.- Some stiff animations.- I didn't like the lockpicking puzzle as mini-game, often skipped it. This is one of the most polished adventure games i have ever played, definitely the best adventure game of the year (although my heart still prefers the dreamfall chapters) and one of the best of the last years. I didn't want it to end but again i had to replay some cases since i missed some clues. It's on the easy side but it can get really hard at times to discover everything and come to the right conclusion. Highly recommended whether on sale or not.			"

												Compared to the last Sherlock Holmes game - The Tastement of Sherlock Holmes, this game is way over my expectation. The graphic is amazing, and looks nicer with warm colors (Oh, I hate the cold tone in TToSH so bad), The stories/cases are so interesting. Now I can choose how to punish/solve the cases - along with some cool actions. I love how they construct the Deduction in this game - way better and more like in criminal movies/series (who doesn't seek for neuron in those kinds of thriller/crime). In short, this is a game that I highly recommend for those who love Sherlock Holmes (like me, teehee, I know some of endings before they got inspired from the books - oops, spolier here). It's time to put those books down and live the action.			"

It is an excelent mystery with satisfying mini-games.  The biggest flaw is there is a loading screen between areas and gets rather obnoxious, especially towards the end of levels when your bouncing between locations trying to get the last of the clues.  Other than that the game is really enjoyable.  Would buy again.			"

Posted: October 12, 2014
												TL;DR: This game got a lot of positive reviews, so I feel my opinions may not apply to most gamers, but I found it dissapointing from a design standpoint, as a fan of adventure games, murder mysteries, and a Sherlock Holmes fan.The stories of Sherlock Holmes have been my favorite muder mysteries since the first time I saw the old BBC show. The level of intrigue cannot be topped. His use of pure deductive reasoning and keen observation can be truly astounding at times. However, none of the cases in this game gave me such a feeling. Actually, the cases often felt quite cut and dry. Perhaps having all the clues revealed to you the moment you find them ruins the climax--the moment where Sherlock reveals how all the pieces of the puzzle fit together. But often, the pieces don't even fit together and many outcomes (as many as six at a time) remain possible.Like Holmes always says: When you have eliminated the impossible, what you have left is guess-work.When you find a clue or learn a fact about the case, the game often suggests you hit the B key which brings you to a screen where the facts float about the screen and by clicking on two related facts, connecting them, Sherlock will make a deduction about them. Sometimes, multiple deductions can be made. For example ""it was an accident"" or ""he did it on purpose"". The right combination of deductions leads to more deductions, leads to a conclusion. While this demonstrates Holme's deductive reasoning in an interesting way, even after collecting every clue and making every deduction, many branches cannot be eliminated, and concluding who committed the crime without absolute certainty does not seem faithful to Doyle's writting.As simply and adventure game, Crimes and Punishments lacks well-drawn and interesting characters, difficult puzzles, good dialogue, and good story telling. Most cases can be solved in just an hour or two and the clues practically jump out at you, so as long as you don't skip entire sections of the map, you'll find most everything on your first go.Occasionally, you have to activate Sherlock's heigtened powers of observation (it'll tell you when) and the clue will glow yellow so you can't possibly miss it. In some cases, the clue is entirely invisible without this, and in others, even if you've spotted the clue (which I challenged myself to do), Holmes won't examine it. It would have been more immersive if they just had him take out a magnifying glass.This is by no means a bad game--despite my complaints, it is perhaps more disappointment over several design decisions than anything else. It's just not a great game, and for the price they're asking, I think you can find a better game to play, at least in the adventure genre (The Longest Journy?), although I don't know many in the crime genre and this very well could be the best.

												What an amazing game! I think this is probably the best game I've played in over a year.Why?The graphics are very good, it's easy to manoeuvre in the game and even I as an amateur detective can solve and enjoy the cases, but I also made some mistakes, so the game isn't super easy -- yet anyone can play this, I'm sure!What makes this game stand out and go from solid to phenomenal, is the stories. There's six stories (cases) in all. Great dialogue and the game leads you from step to step. It's fairly easy to find clues, but the smart part is that YOU, the player, get to interpret the clues. To give you an example, you find clues that the rails are removed  near a lake and near a cave. You're looking for a disappearing train. What do you deduce? You need further evidence to make the correct deduction. If you do this well and interpret the clues correctly, they will lead you to the correct conclusion. But if you make errors, you can reach a wrong conclusion and send an innocent man to prison or the noose! Brilliantly done!You really feel you're back in Sherlock Holmes' day and age, with gas lamps and coaches. It is so well done, I even started reading a book with Sherlock Holmes stories after finishing this ~27-hour game. Turns out the stories in the game could VERY WELL HAVE BEEN WRITTEN DOWN in the form of a book. So this game plays great for Sherlock Holmes enthusiasts as well as for SH rookies. Big thumbs up!			"

												As someone who has played many Sherlock Holmes games, I was delighted by the updated interface, and puzzles. While not perfect ( a few graphics glitches) it is quite the improvement from earlier releases. Pros- New puzzle styles offer different ways of arriving at conclusions- Deduction board allows you to come to wrong conclusions- Special skills allow you to ""see"" the world as Sherlock Holmes does- Moral choice at the end of each case to see how you want to handle thingsCons:- Loading time can be excruciating, but they do allow you to review your casebook and deduction board which helps to mitigate the pain- Price is a bit steep, so I waited until the game was on sale			"

												The game is visually stunning and manages to capture the atmosphere of late 19th century London and the surrounds extraordinarily well. The visuals themselves are most definitely the greatest part of the game, and as a series of sequences of eye-candy the game tends to work rather well. Where the game falls down is the actual gameplay, however. It is rather fun initially to run around sniffing out clues and talking to people, however this becomes repetitive rather quickly. There's very little available to actually challenge the player, as it's more or less a point-and-click to find the clues then these clues simply describe and fit themselves into the overall puzzle. There were an entire range of different aspects that I would have rather focused on in each of the cases if it was a more free-world kind of game, however the game simply guides you towards conclusions. As a mental exercise the game is therefore practically worthless, which is a pity considering it is about one of the more intellectually gifted characters of the modern world. The inability of the player to actually go wrong anywhere except in the final conclusion does rather reduce the level of reward the game can offer.As a relaxing little piece of visuals flitting across your screen the game works well. However at $40 the price is rather steep. I would price the value of this game at about $15-$25, depending on what you're looking for. If you're more interested in nice visuals and atmospheric gameplay then you might be willing to fork out a bit. If you're more interested in strong gameplay and a mental challenge rather pick up one of Paradox Intereactive's games for half the price, wait for this to go on sale (like, 50%-75%), or play a game of chess.

The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes series developed by Frogwares has been going on for more than a decade now. It’s had its ups and downs, but the general tendency was upwards. After Frogwares reached their peak in the previous game, The Testament of Sherlock Holmes, they decided it was time for a general refurbishment of the series. So they picked the last two games and put them into a mixer, along with The Walking Dead (by Telltale), The Cave and L.A. Noire. Can the result live up to this legacy? If you bear with me for a moment, then I will tell you.The first choice by Frogware was to ditch their in-house engine for the Unreal Engine 3. The result is jaw-dropping graphics. I was really astonished. Take a look at the user screenshots, this is the best-looking adventure game I have played so far.However, the advertising screenshots and videos are slightly misleading. With two exceptions, all the locations are quite depopulated.The second choice was to switch to an episodic model like The Walking Dead and other games, except that the six episodes were all released at once and are almost completely disconnected from each other, so there isn’t really such a thing as a progressive storyline. However, the game fits into the canon of the series.Frankly, with the episodic model and a storyline unclosed because it was never really opened, the game has this smell of possible upcoming DLC about it. I wouldn't be surprised at all if one or two DLC episodes popped up.Individually, the six episodes are like well-written short stories. The cases are interesting and well-written, conceivable and logically constructed with some very neat ideas and quite unusual locations. But only the last episode has something that resembles a progressing story, the other cases consist of little more than the whodunit.There also is a moral choice aspect which is misunderstood by many critics. It is not a moral choice system in the sense of The Walking Dead, but more in the sense of The Cave. The Cave had a moral choice aspect you might ask? Well, for each character there was a bad ending and a hidden good ending, go look it up. Which ending you got hinged entirely upon a decision at the very end of the game. Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments is similar. For each case, there are between three and six possible conclusions. You can pick one and choose if you want to punish the prosecuted party with the full force of the law or if you want to handle the case more softly. And after you watched/played your particular ending sequence, a very bright design choice comes to life: you can return to the point of your choice and try another ending. So unlike other games with moral choice systems which have to be played multiple times, you only need to play the game once and may see all the possible endings in a single playthrough.But as we have learned half a year ago from NOCLIP – The Game (also known as Murdered: Soul Suspect, read my review), good graphics with the Unreal Engine and a decent story cannot hold up a game if the gameplay almost completely sucks. Be relieved, Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments does not make the same mistake. Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments is not exactly a Point-and-Click adventure. You investigate the crime scenes and look for clues. Many of them are tied to minigames, most of which are skippable. You also collect items and information and talk to witnesses and suspects. Occasionally you will catch someone in a lie and have to present evidence of the lie, just like L.A. Noire.The clues you found are presented on the very fancy deduction screen, where you have to combine them into facts. And out of the facts, you draw conclusions. This game mechanic has replaced the inventory puzzles. The aforementioned jaw-dropping graphics come at a price, and that price is loading times. The game needs to load for quite a while between every single scene transition (and there are many of them), so Frogwares made that commute less dull by A) making this particular loading screen not look boring after five seconds and B) letting you consult your notes and the deduction screen.But the game also loads briefly before every dialogue and before many of the minigames and QTE-scenes, which messes with the pacing when the bad guy draws a gun and you are supposed to resolve this situation in a QTE, but inbetween you have to stare at a black screen with a spinning circle for fifteen seconds. Other than that, the game flow works very well. You can always look up what tasks are left to do, so you never really get stuck and there is little reason to consult a walkthrough. Maybe it has become a little too easy, but the challenge lies in finding the correct conclusion.Concerning the playability, I have been playing the release version and found a couple of minor glitches, but nothing remotely significant or gamebreaking. Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments introduces many new borrowed ideas, but only few of them can unfold to their potential. It is not without criticism and some of its potential is lost. The game took a step back from classic Point-and-Click adventures and made a step towards interactive movies, but without falling into the pit of irrelevant gameplay like NOCLIP - The Game, which I mentioned earlier. This time, I can recommend to actually play the game instead of just watching a walkthrough. And given the length and the very good quality of the game, I would say that the experience was worth 40€.			"

												Frogwares has been on a very long roll with their Sherlock Holmes games for a very long time. This game is no exception.Pros:Gameplay. Amazing, feels more explorative than a few of the earlier titles. Love being able to look for clues myself instead of being pointed to everything. Dialogue feels more choice based than previous as well.Choices. The deductions you can make are nuts. You can get things wrong, cause people's deaths, put away the wrong suspect. It's limited, but then, these titles are smaller than other companies' and what they are doing in terms of choice is still pretty incredible.Story. A mix of canon and new cases makes the game pretty enjoable, and not as predictable as it would have been if they'd had cases from the story at every turn.Visuals. BEAUTIFUL. Although lacking in a few areas, so many of the enviornments were very pretty and immersive. It was great to look around at the scenary while progressing.Voice acting. The best so far in the series, I think. Loved Holmes' actor.Cons:Choices. Limited. Want more hands on ability. But obviously we're getting there.Exploration. The worlds felt very alive and very cool, and being able to miss clues makes me want to go out further to explore things. The day we get an open-world Holmes day will be amazing.Story. The short cases were great. However, it lacked a story on the whole as the previous games had one. I missed that. Working to an end goal of a larger mystery while tying up these litttle problems would have been incredible.Pros and cons aside, this game is defnitely worth playing if you like the title, and if you're into seeing how mystery games are progressing. Looking forward to seeing more.			"

												★★★★★ - ""Do not miss this game"" PROS:- The best detective experience I've had since LA Noire- Attention to detail is incredible, from the clues  to the evidence you collect- Options! You decide, you link clues, you decide who did it, you decide their fate and you don't even need to make the right choice, the game will let you fail and only tell you if you want it too.- Both the graphics and character features are amazing, a huge step for the Frogware Sherlock franchise- 6 individual cases, you can play the cases at your own pace and are almost episodic in the sense that if you want a break you can, theres a subtle backstory between them also and the game doesn't forget your past decisions- You can revisit your clues and decisions before moving on, this is great if you want to know if you made the right choice then wish to rectify it with a different ending.- Varied, the cases are each unique and involve different mini puzzles including lock picking, chemistry, research together with interrogation, exploration in different sized areas, using your animal companion and visualising scenes, just to name a few. The puzzles are skippable too.- 1st person? 3rd person? You decide!CONS:- Move Watson, he can get in the way but doesn't break immersion.- Waiting times between map areas, this can be forgiven though as the game is vast and enables you to use your notebook in this time.VERDICT? Ironically, this game is criminally underrated and is a hugely fun game that anyone can enjoy. Cannot recommend it enough.			"

I haven't played the previous games in the series so my only references are other games, but this one in particular is very close to what Telltale does. There are six cases, each roughly two or three hours in length.If you like adventure games of either the point and click variety or Telltale's modern franchises, this is an easy recommendation.			"

												Playing Crimes and Punishments forces you to think, and place yourself in the place of Sherlock Holmes. Unlike most linear adventure games, this game only guides you to enough clues to form a few very possible conclusions; afterwards, you must use your own judgement to decide between them.Let me give you an example:Upon recovering all the clues in the first story, I was left with three possible solutions, two of which were more possible than the first. Instead of allowing you to follow up on those suspects, the game flat out refuses to allow you to investigate further and essentially tells you: ""That's enough, its time for you to think like Sherlock Holmes and figure it out yourself""The game sets up the cases such that the solutions are possible, so you'll have to make a judgement call and establish what posulations are plausible and which solutions to commit to. It was quite nerve wraking at first.Admitedly, the gameplay is not perfect. There are frequent load pages (though you are able to review your deductions and notes on these pages, which is nice) and there's an element of pixel hunting. It's also a slow and methodical game except for the occassional minigame or Quick Time Event.All in all, I would recommend this to someone who enjoys a slow puzzle. Perhaps someone who might enjoy a game like ""The Vanishing of Ethan Carter"". Since the game is rather methodical and slow, I would really aim to recommend it to a specific sect of puzzle loving adventure fans, whose main draw to adventure games isn't the comedy (if you love Sam and Max because of Sam and Max, this probably isn't for you).

												This is detective adventure game with six independent chapters. I must say that this is one of the best adventure games I have played in last few years. Pros: + Length: It took me 22 hours to finish the game (I am experianced player) + Story: The storytelling is catching and interested me from the beginning at each chapter + Puzzles: I would say that they were quite adequate and even if player has trouble with them, there is always possibility to skip them, the game is obviously centered at story and detective part and most puzzles reflect that + English humour - I loved it! No further comment needed :D + Characters: The people in the game are alive and real, at least that it is like it seemed to me. + Decisions: The decisions do not have impact on the game itself, but still they felt important and interesting to me. I liked the possibility to look at the statistics of the other players decisions, which is a nice feature.Cons:  - Cannot think of any. Some of the puzzles were a bit obscure, but as I said, there is always possibility to skip them.Conclusion: If you are into detective stories and adventure games with a lot of story and characters, this is a obligatory game for you.

												After I played The Testament of Sherlock Holmes, I immediately thought that the game was gonna be a benchmark for more and better Sherlock Holmes games to come - They truly delivered with Crimes and Punishments.The game is even more engaging, with even better mechanics of controlling the characters. There's even more scenarios where you have to use different characters, and a few addition of investigative modes.Having said that, the game is tad bit easier than Testament, whereby the puzzles are less complex and it is really more straightforwardly guided with more obvious hints and leads you where you should go. However, at the end of each cases, you will have to make a decision based on your collected clues and you would be shown the answers - don't be surprised if you get it wrong, because it can happen, and you would be able to continue as is.Whilst the puzzles are simpler, they make up for it with longer cases and stretched storyline, just nicely suited and not dragging it. The cases are all separated and are not connected to each other, but the fun of investigating is all the same.  It makes me want more cases. More deaths. More things to investigate. Oh dear, I have been Sherlocked.			"

The writing is decent and I learned a lot new words and phrases like ensconse, ""Vox populi, Vox Dei"", ""acting intelligently sometimes requires more than intelligence""...  The first 2 cases are a bit slow and a lot of the game is figuring out what the game wants you to do rather than figuring out the case (i.e. Did I click on that random mostly irrelevant thing in the corner of the room so the game knows I'm ready for the next cut scene?). But overall it's entertaining enough that you will finish it, which is more than I can say for 98% of my steam library.			"

												TL;DR Version:The game can be a little too hand-holdy, but it occasionally succeeded at tricking me into thinking I was much smarter than I am.  It was enjoyable and I want to see more.Long Version:It was okay.  If you like tracking down clues with Telltale Games-ish point-and-click mechanics, but need a bit of hand-holding when it comes to anything more arduous than looking at people, then this one's for you.  The moral choice system is a bit shallow since the only real choices are at the end of each case as you're about to name your killer: ""will you condemn the villain most harshly, or let them off easy this time?""  Mind you, that choice can be a lot harder than it sounds, and it's more satisfying than the usual ""good or evil"" option that pollutes choice-based games these days, but there were no lasting consequences either way; when a case was over, the slate was wiped and everything was back to normal, so the moral choices, which were actually quite difficult, were reduced to something less intense.  Good game, nonetheless, and I hope to see more, even better entries from the studio in the future.			"

												This game is a strictily episodic detective game with (almost) no overarching storyline other than the expected interactions between characters of the holmes universe. That being said, it's capturing and the individual cases are pretty well thought out. It's not a hard game tho. In terms of length, expect around 10-12 hrs of gameplay in total, broken up nicely in 2hr segments per case. There's some replayability options to check out various outcomes, but that won't lengthen the game past 14hrs.The graphics are superb visually. The english voice work is outstanding and carries the game well.Overall I'm happy I bought it, it's an enjoyable detective game. I do however wish they'd be working on DLC for this. (Never thought I'd actually say something like this.) It would work great for the episodic format. However at the time of writing this the developers said that no DLC is planned. :(			"

												""Crimes and Punishments"" is a classic adventure that let's you solve a handful of murder cases as Sherlock Holmes. It's a highly polished game with good graphics and (mostly) excellent voice acting. And it does a good job of capturing the essence and the quirks of the Greatest Detective, making it a good buy for fans of the famous character.But what really makes this game stand out amongst other adventures: ""Crimes and Punishments"" actually gives you a chance to fail without reprimanding you for it. You will form your own deductions based on the clues that you find. Evidence will be ambiguous, leading to various possible outcomes of each case. The correct solution is not always obvious. And if you accuse the wrong person of comitting a crime, the game follows through. No ""You failed"", no ""Reload and try again"". This notion of non-linearity is somewhat of a novelty for adventure games which I thoroughly enjoyed.My only criticism would be the lack of an overarching, meaningful story to tie it all together. The game tries to get a bit of closure during the last case, but feels way too rushed and too contrived, resulting in a rather bland anticlimax.			"

												Very Good,if your a Sherlock Fan.Pretty good cases to solve and some unique actions and skills to usePuzzles are fairly straight forward but if your sloppy you can miss critical information and get the wrong conculsion.Acting,Atmosphere and Gameplay are all pretty good overall.maybe a tad too easy or predictable mid game.Six cases to solve,which are all quite interestingOne of the cases is a bit of a stretch even for Sherlock but its no game breaker.you can skip the puzzles if you wantbut the reinactments are worth doing and quite well done.and there are some reaction quicktime events that can catch you out,if your not on the ball.generally you can predict when these will occur.My only minor complaint was the ending,it is was a bit ambiguous . 8/10 Sherlock fans +1			"

I also really liked that the load time between locations can by occupied by reviewing your notes or drawing conclusions about the case. I highly recommend this game!			"

												I got this game on sale for about $10 and was thoroughly enjoying the first case...a lot. Felt the game had great acting, a very interesting story (as I understand the cases in the game are all taken from actual Sherlock Holmes stories) and some neat puzzles that were neither too hard, nor super easy, and also were varied and integrated well with the object, challenge or environment.Then I got to the end. And I'm not sure if this is the fault of the game or the actual story, but if you are feeling like you are trying to really solve the case - it feels like there is always something purposely left out that you have to make a leap of faith to make the pieces fit.SPOILERS BELOW An example of this is in the first case. You don't meet the killer until the VERY last action / location / person of the game. It is contrived. If you would have immediately searched for other sailors at the very start (if the game let you, which it doesn't) - you'd essentially have exactly the same amount of facts and clues to pass judgement on his guilt as you do at the very end of the game.  The main thread is the killer saw the victim kill a guy when they were both on a boat many years ago and disliked each other. The killer came to see the guy to ask for money since the (to be) killer was a down and out of work spearman and a fight broke out and death by the killer defending himself from the drunken victim ensued in the victims cabin. You don't need *any* of the other facts you wasted your time on for the case as they are all superfluous. In fact, they are all there as a distraction. To me, that just feels lame. Even if you have all the facts at the end, you still need to make a leap in picking the right killer as it's never a fact/proven/known that the killer went to the victims cabin for money at the night of the murder until you pick a final conclusion.  In fact, the fact that his pouch was there doesn't prove he was there ..at all. It's just as plausible that it was stolen as it was that he dropped it there - so why would we have to assume he was there instead of the other plausible (but not as perfect fits to the contrived story)? It is noted the killer was poor and out of work, but in fact, everything the game / story relates to you about him would define him as an honest, hard working, non begging individual...he did a hard job at sea, never attacked, ratted on the victim when he saw him many years prior kill a man, never tried to bribe him, was trying to earn money (not beg) at the pub via armwrestling and was genuinely thrilled when Holmes lies to him about the possibility of getting a spearman job with 'Capt Ahab'.  Also, although he disliked the victim, it was noted the victim lived in a fairly remote part of town and nowhere was it every noted/implied/hinted that the killer ever spoke to the victim any.  Even if they both got drunk at the same pub - that gives even more reason why the killer wouldn't go to his far away shack to ask for a few silver coins if he had access to him at the pub regularly (and also more credence to the possibility of a stolen pouch). It's a leap. You don't get any of his story until the very last thing you do and even then - the more plausible answer (which is wrong) is for the other suspects to be involved. When the case comes together and you see the conclusion after you pick the killer (who by the way comes to the address given to him by Holmes as the possible location to meet 'Capt Ahab' about some hard work), you wonder why killer (a supposedly honest, hard working sailor) would go beg for a few silver, then kill the victim instead of turning the other cheek and leave like he did many years ago on his boat. In fact, nothing shows him to be a violent person, and even one of the endings has him suddenly raging out with a fist fight..wha?  For every fact given to you as a reason for the final outcome to have happened - you could come up with a set number of equally plausible counter actions that would have rendered the outcome differently. Sadly, none of the actions are tied to any real facts. The killer could just have easily not gone to beg for silver and the other 2 guys could have been attacked by the drunken victim and speared him. The killer could have also as easily ran away when the victim drew a knife on him and ran out the shack. It's all too contrived and not based strongly on anything you actually do so makes it feel really shallow. I'm not sure this is the fault of the game or the story itself - regardless - the end enjoyment (or frustration) is there if you really think your going to be able to logically deduce the conclusion. There's just assumptions you'd have to make (which isn't very scientific, nor flawless) when you make your final decision that make the whole thing slightly more than educated guesswork. It's bound to be fun to read and say ""ah ha!"" when you read the ending, but it's not nearly as enjoyable if you are playing out the character and looking forward to the challenge when you are certainly not given all the pieces (or have to accept random actions unknown to you as what actually happened).As far as my game played time - yes, i stopped after the first case. I read somewhere some folks also had issues with the logic on the 2nd case - and the desire to play any more cases vanished after the mechanics of the first played out. That would tend to speak volumes towards the value I found for the game if I stopped after the first case.Could be tons of fun - just knowing the amount of logic leaps make it less so.			"

Sherlock Holmes: Crimes And Punishments			* 7/10Sherlock Holmes is back with this new chapter but now Frogware tried a different approach. The game presents itself in a similar way to its predecessor, The Testament of Sherlock Holmes, so the interface and basic actions are the same, so we're about to move sherlock as a third person action, but let's start with the news.This chapter still uses the always good Unreal Engine, but this time Frogware made a step forward from v3 to v4. They designed some ambients with great care for details, other ambients are simply magnificent landscapes while other ambiences are a little below these standards, yet nothing that makes the game unwatchable. As a matter of fact this leap with the game Engine made the game a bit more demanding in terms of GPU as I'm no longer able to play on my laptop with a decent framerate so I had to switch to my Desktop Gaming PC.However the Biggest change in the game is in the story: There's no story! This new chapter consists of six separate, unrelated and independent cases to solve. So you won't have a back story leading the way and linking all the cases, and considering the previous chapter I really believe this is a big loss. But this doesn't mean the game is not fun to play with because this new structure perfectly fits the new deduction system: as you speak with characters, find clues and solve riddles you will gather them in a screen, so you can link a couple or more clues together to get to one or two possible deductions. If you are given a choice this will affect the successive clues and once you get all the clues, link them and choose your deductions they will lead you to a conclusion which might be or not be a correct conclusion. Hence you might point the right or wrong person as the culprit. And after that you have to select a moral choice, which most of the times is just ""call the police"" or ""not"", but might change for very peculiar cases.About the sound part I have something to say as I'm quite disappointed about voice acting, but not because they've been doing a bad job, they actually did a good job as usual. The fact is I'm a bit sad thay have replaced Sherlock and Watson's, now, historical voice actors. At the very least the new actors did a very good job, anyways. Another thing that left me a bit disappointed is the game's soundtrack: it's mostly made of few recycled themes from Testament of Sherlock Holmes. The fact those tracks are simply great is irrelevant, the fact that matters is that if those tunes are not being played then you just won't have a great tune that plays during your investigations or you will have tunes that do not reach the quality of Testament of Sherlock Holmes.Anyways even though this chapter doesn't have the depth of a great involving story as the previous chapter I consider this one a big step forward in Gameplay considering the new deductions system, the other little news such as the character portraits and the ""imagination mode"" ( in certain situations you can use your imagination to see the consequences of your interactons with items or to reconstruct facts that already happened), not to mention the entertainment provided by the cases themselves.+++PROs+++ GAMEPLAY. Crimes and Punishment impements the 3rd person interface introduced in Testament Of Sherlock Holmes and improves the gameplay with a great deduction system where you can get to your own conclusions according to the clues you've found and this can lead you to the right or wrong culprit. Simply great. ENGINE. Crimes and Punishment uses the always good Unreal Engine 4, which has been used for great landscapes, very nice ambiences built with care for details, and a good variety of other different places.---CONs--- NO STORY. To me this is an important loss, you face 6 different and unrelated cases, but there's not a story behind linking all of them together. Anyways I can understand how difficult it might be trying to write down a story that can fit into six different cases and at the same time it can fit all the different deductions and moral choices. VOICES & MUSIC. Considering the historical voice actors I wasn't expecting new actors for Holmes and Watson. Fortunately they all did a very good job anyways. Different story for the music scores as they mostly consist of very few tunes from The Testament of Sherlock Holmes, but the level is still lower considering they didn't use all the tracks, neither has been created anything new as pleasant as in the Testament of Sherlock HolmesI barely played this game on this machine:Laptop Lenovo Z50Intel Core i5-4210U8Gb RAM DDR3GeForce 840M/Intel HD Graphics 4400Windows 10 Home x64And perfectly on this Machine:Intel Core i7-497016Gb RAM DDR3GeForce GTX 660Windows 10 Professional x64 "

Review - Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments""Incredible, Stupendous and Remarkable!""Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments is definitely one of the best detective games out there. The backstories for each case is unique and solid. I'm not a Sherlock Holmes fan but after palying this game, I am now. This is my first Sherlock Holmes game and by far, I have enjoyed every minute of it. From the first case to the last case, my mind was boggled and amazed. Some of the cases maybe rather obvious but there are also some where you get to really think who was culprit or how he/she did it. The game also has a lot of minigames from interrogation to looking for clues to special cutscenes that require player interaction.Pros:+ Great Graphics+ Great Soundtracks+ Great Voiceovers+ Interesting characters and cases+ Has a lot of gameplay (a lot of minigames)+ The mind boggling marale choices at the end of each case+ A choice of whether you play on 3rd Person POint of view or FPSCons:+ Long loading screens (well, actually it's in the form of travelling from place to place)I haven't played the other Sherlock Holmes games but for newbies to the genre, it's a good experience to start with this. I highly recommend this game to those who are really a big fan of Sherlock Holmes and to those who love detective games that does not only involve point n' click find the object game but other gameplay as well.

												Some thoughts on Sherlock: Crimes and PunishmentsThe advertising for this is probably a bit misleading, what with the lead characters dressed in modern attire and some sort of darker trailers. But make no mistake, this is a pretty classical Sherlock game set in the original time period (the modern clothes are just an unlockable) and a sequel to Frogware's other adventures with the character. I don't have too much experience with the older games, finding them a bit obtuse and clunky at times. Crimes and Punishments is their attempt to get the series some broader appeal, and it largely works. Controls are simplified but without sacrificing too much of the formula.The game takes place over six cases, all mostly standalone so it has a pretty episodic feel to it. There's a small running plotline about a ""terrorist"" group called the Merry Men that runs throughout but is mostly just background filler. I've lamented on here about how there's not many games that actually make you feel like a detective, and this game is one that does. For starters, every case has multiple suspects, and you can actually draw the wrong conclusions and condemn an innocent person if you're not careful. Each suspect you choose also has variations on how you handle their fate. A cold blooded murderer you might want to send to the gallows, while someone acting in self defense you might be kinder too. The actual murder weapons and motives can play into these endings too if you get them wrong, so each case has at least like 6 endings. That is where the title comes in, their crimes, your punishments.The games does clearly try to ape the modern BBC series a bit, with a focus on profiling characters from the fact they have callused or danity hands, or a telegram sticking out of their pocket. It actually does a good job of making you think like Holmes, and you start to actually be able to guess what he learns from these profiles before he says it. That's actually I think one of the best accomplishments of the game. It kind of immerses you in the minutiae. Using Holmes' analysis table on Baker Street is kind of a laborious affair, often having puzzles that in most games would probably include half the steps. But I'll be darned if they didn't manage to sucker me in with the use of pipettes to test various chemicals. You will also need to browse Holmes' large collection of newspapers, research, and encyclopedias when you see or hear about say, a robbery in 1889 rather than just asking someone about it.  You'll even get to control Watson and his dog Toby at various points in the game.There are couple minigames that are busts, often ones requiring aiming or precision, which is not a surprise given the developer's pedigree. Most of the voice acting is well done, if a bit theatrical (Sherlock himself gets pretty hammy at times, but it is largely amusing). Some of the stories are a bit basic, even if they provide a good mystery at first. Graphics are pretty great for the most part, thought that's largely thanks to most areas being pretty small. You can ""customize"" Sherlock but those options are actually pretty limited. Most of the options are only available when the story gives an option to disguise yourself to get information, which are pretty rare.Anyways, if you like adventure games, snag this when you can. Much better than I anticipated.			"

												I'm not a Sherlock Holmes fan in the sense that I've never read the books, but the characters always felt interesting to me. That aside, this is a detective game done right. Every case does NOT give you the answer after giving you all the clues, you have to read through the clues you've gathered and the conversation logs to make the deduction YOURSELF. That to me, was awesome. No other game did something as brilliant as that.The only thing I can complain about this game is being 6 cases only, I'd play 50 of this brilliantly crafted game.			"

												Recommended...with reservations. SH:C&P is a great casual detective game. However, it's a terrible Sherlock Holmes game. THE BAD FIRSTAs a major Holmes fan (of both the original books and the new series), I was terribly disappointed by the out-of-character portrayal of Holmes and by the lack of true detective work that you need to do in this game. Clues are practically spoon fed to you on every case and the conclusion can be terribly obvious for certain cases, not requiring much brainwork. Not much world-building as you are confined to certain sets and there's not much character-building as well - they're all fairly cookie-cutter.THE GOODDon't play this as a Sherlock Holmes game. Play this as a casual detective game with Sherlockian elements and you won't be disappointed. Kudos for good attempts at building atmosphere and decent storylines (with great voice acting). The series of mini-games in multiple cases keeps you from  becoming bored and allows you to break the game in parts without losing your place in it. You do have to use *some* effort to reach the correct conclusion for all six cases, though it's not up to Sherlock Holmes standard. Looking back at the end of the game, after I tempered my expectations, I did actually enjoy the gameplay a lot.[Bought during Steam Summer Sale for $15]			"

												If you've played The Testament of Sherlock Holmes you need to play this.  This is the best Sherlock game, actually the best crime/mystery game I've played.  The game isn't one big storyline.  There's 6 crime cases in the game.  This is good if you like to have stopping points to take a break.  Crimes and Punishments plays a lot like Testament but better.  It's not a point and click game.  You can control Sherlock in 3rd and 1st person view.  You get to question suspects and look for clues.  Sherlock can use his instincts to find hidden clues and visualize what might have happened at the crime scene.  You can go back to Baker Street (Holmes' home and lab) to do experiments and research.   After you get enough clues you make deductions to form a possible answer.  The game allows you to freely gather clues, talk to people and travel to different locations.  It nudges you in the right directions but you have to think sometimes.  If you get at a tough spot just Google a walkthrough.  Crimes and Punishments is a fun and easy game to play.  If you like murder mysteries and especially a Sherlock fan, you need this game!Pros:+6 different cases+Well developed game and written storyline+Ability to freely investigate+Holmes can change disguises+Graphics+Voice actingCons:-Some of the quick-time events can be challenging but you can always try again if you fail.  There's very few QTEs but since I hate QTEs I say it's a con.  But they don't make the game bad.-I wish some of the cut scenes could be replayed.  If you're playing the game and say the phone rings, if you didn't pay attention, well tough luck.(Note: I advise you play The Testament of Sherlock Holmes before playing Crimes and Punishments.  This game is a sequel but not to the storyline.  But some of the characters appear in both games.  It just helps make sense of certain characters.) "

												I have just finished the last case and I must say: this is my Game of the Year so far! This game really impressed me.To be honest, I haven't played much of the other Sherlock Holmes game yet (I'll do so soon) so I cannot compare this to its prequels. So I simply say what I think of this game standing on its own.The typical adventure elements (combining items, etc.) are reduced, it's all about the case and how you proceed. Finding clues, talking to people, doing experiments to test theories, check your archives - that's all you do in order to solve the case.There are six different cases in total which are not connected, although there is a small side story line that will resolve in the finale (Don't worry, I won't spoil more) You play as Sherlock, occasionally as Dr. Watson and as their dog Toby.Each case has its own unique characters, its own story and background information. From Baker Street to Scotland Yard and the crime scenes you  visit a lot of different locations which are all very well designed. This game sure has one of the best level designs I've ever seen - you really feel the heart the developers put in each location. The character design is outstanding as well - just look at the faces. Choosing Unreal Engine 3 was the right decision.Well, what else to say? If you like adventure games, cinematic games like TellTale's games (The Walking Dead, Wolf among us) with more actual gameplay and logical thinking this game is just meant for you. As a Sherlock Holmes fan this is a must-buy game anyway. It is elementary to buy this game I'd say!			"

												The best Sherlock Holmes game i've played.  Doesn't spoon feed you the answers and let's you gather the clues and make your own decisions about who are the perpetrators.  Each story is unique and has a real mystery to each case that makes them worthy of Sherlock Holmes.Highly recommended for Detective and/or Mystery fans!			"

												A must for Sherlock fans. As an avid reader and fanboy of Sir Arthur himself. This game has been a pleasure to play. Although not perfect, Crimes and Punishment offers a engaging detective game with mutiple conclusions to each case. As it should be, as murder cases should not be as straightforward like in most other detective games. What makes this game stand out from the other crime solvers is that YOU must figure who did it and why. There are muiltiple suspects in each case, all with good reason and evidence to suggest they did it. once you believe you found the true culprit, you can then choose to CONDEMN or ABSOLVE them. Do you believe that cold blooded murderers deserve to get hanged? Or do you feel sorry for them and just give them a slap on the wrist and tell them not to do it again? Its a purely moral choice and its up to you. Don't worry though, its not hard. if you pay attention and use a bit of logic, it should be easy to deduce who did it.Pros:+6 cases, all based on original Doyle works, but changed around to fit theme and story. No overarching plot. Purely episodic.+Easy to use UI. The journal is easy to navigate and the deduction menu is the most interesting part of the game.+Heavily detailed environments to explore. Good use of the unreal 3 engine. Atmosphere is good at times. Areas sometimes a bit lacking but cool to navigate.+Classic Sherlock. This is Sherlock through and through, Eccentric and cunning. Awkward but stern. A cold hearted detective with near no emotion but a brillant mind in deduction nonetheless. Solves crime his own way, even to break the law himself, and causes Watson to be baffled by his nonsense. Get inside the mind of a rather dark character.+Mutiple suspects means mutiple conclusions. You have to find out and choose who did it. Cons:- Can be poorly optimised at times. framedrops and occasional freezing happens sometimes. But not too much to interupt gameplay.- Cases are too relaxing. There is no tension whatsoever. It seems though that after a murder happened, everyone sitsback and relaxes. Even Sherlock and Watson seem like their really on holiday instead of solving a murder.-Visual options on launcher instead of in game.-No fov slider. Narrow fov can be dizzy to some. I got used to it quick, but I do wish it can be wider.-Annoying mouse acceleration. My camera can spazz out and sometimes it hard to precisely control my camera.-Useless 3rd-person camera. I always used the 1st-person view. You need to looking close for clues.-Watson can you get out of my way! Watson can block you in doorways. Hitboxes awkwardly made.-Some cases are too short.-In game puzzles are too simple and straightforward. however, I really don't mind, all i care about is finding clues and solving the case. I don't care about a matching game or a lockpicking minigame.Despite its flaws, its a game worthy of the Holmes name itself. The gameplay is quite solid, allowing you to collect clues and deduce, but doesn't give too much away to make it too obvious. Makes you think.			"

												Bought this a few days ago, massive massive fan of Sherlock Holmes and didn't even notice that this game was out until a few days ago. Bought it immediately and love it so far! Love the character portraits you do and the style in which you do them (similar to the Sherlock BBC series in terms of editing). The London Baths case took an eternity to do near the end but it was good being challenged. GREAT graphics and a 10/10 for me.			"

												Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments was my fifth Sherlock Holmes game. One of the first things that I noticed about this game was the new engine. It is beautiful and mostly smooth (with slight stuttering). It is much more demanding in terms of resources. I have an Intel i7 4770k and an Nvidia GTX 660 OC. The only real time it would stutter would be during some cutscenes. Other than that, it worked perfectly. Although, I will note that there are few options for video settings.I found the gameplay to be fun. You mostly look around a particular area, waiting for the prompt to pop up, indicating a clue. I know that sounds a little too easy, but the challenge comes when you attempt to build your case through the deduction system. It is important that you pay attention to what a suspect says because some clues are not recorded. It is up to you to remember it. This is important, because when you attempt to build a case through the deduction system, there are some clues that have more than one branching possiblilty. So, you cannot rely entirely off of the game deduction system, but rather you need to do some deductions of your own. This is common when you hear testimony from multiple people who offer contradicting stories.In this game, it is possible to punish someone who is completely innocent, although you won't know it at the time. This forces you to actually pay attention to every small detail. Sherlock will not hold your hand in this game. It gets more interesting when you consider the fact that it is also possible to convict the right suspect, but be wrong about how he committed the crime. This happened to me once, but I was right about the other five cases. But at least I never convicted someone who was innocent.Another thing that I loved about this game is the freedom that is offered to you. You can use a fast travel system to go to any place that is relevent to the case at any time. Do you think you might have missed something? Then go back. Sherlock will not tell you that you missed something, adding to the feel of performing your own investigation.All in all, I would say that I really liked this game. It does not have a grand plot, as all six cases are unrelated, but the story that is there and the acting is good. For a Sherlock Holmes game, that is. I don't feel that I can go into any more detail without giving it all away, so I say pick this game up when you get a chance. It took me about 12-13 hours to complete, with cases being around 2-3 hours each.8.5/10			"

												Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments(All of this are my personal thoughts on the game, keep in mind that other people that have played the game may disagree with me.)I first saw this game through a video of the Youtuber Dodger, member of Polaris and was immediately fascinated by its mechanics and wanted to play it myself.I don't have to say that this is a game about investigating crimes as Sherlock Holmes.The mechanics that fascinated me are the Deduction space, the Imagination mode and the Sherlock Talent.The Deduction space is a screen where all your clues and thoughts can be combine together to obtain a deduction that will help you reach a conclusion for the case. There are multiple conclusions to the cases which only one is the correct one. When you chose a conclusion you get to select a moral choice that is either condemn or absolve the culprit.The Imagination mode lets you reconstruct an event that happened in the scene, it contains a minigame where you choose the order of events.The Sherlock Talent is a mode where you can notice stuff that normally you can't, it's only a way to let you obtain new clues simulating the fact that Sherlock don't overlook anything and see every detail that the police miss.There's only a bad thing about these modes: the game tells you exactly in which area you should use them, making the game quite easy. I know that lots of people is going to be upset about this.Of course in the game you get to interrogate witnesses and suspects and when you do you get to analyze them and find information about them that you can, occasionally, use against them if they lie. This was pretty cool too.I loved the characters of the game, especially Sherlock. The cases are curious, but if you're looking for a deep story you're not going to find it.You're often followed by your friend, Watson. Our doctor may be a nuisance, since he has the bad habit to follow you in every narrow path blocking your way if you decide to turn back. His AI goes offline in huge halls so you don't have to worry if you have to examinate stuff in big rooms.The game has minigames such as picking locks, examinating stuff, doing experiments and so forth. Some of them are really easy, other are ok and one is terrible ( the rope bridge ).Sadly the game is fairly easy and it's nearly impossible to get stuck, thinking what to do next, so the challenge drops a lot. That is unless I'm some sort of genius that gets all the puzzles quite fast, and somewhat I doubt that...I would have liked the game not holding my hand through all the game and offer me some more puzzles to solve, but for me was a enjoyable experience nonetheless.I reccomend this game if you enjoy Investigative games and like Sherlock Holmes.

												This is just the clear difinition, of a well made Sherlock Holmes game. Far the best Shelock Holmes game I've ever played. The puzzles in this game are ingenious, the mechanics are really good, the clues to the cases quite subtle, and as a bonus there are quite alot of ways to conclude the cases but only one of them is actually true. As a Sherlock fan I can highly recommend this game to everyone that likes adventure, mystery, alot of puzzles and obscure gentleman humor. Vox populi vox dei!Rating: 8/10			"

												I purchased this game in a bundle with The Testament of Sherlock Holmes.  After playing through the testament, I was very pleased with the experience.  The puzzles were varied and thought provoking, and aside from the occasional ""hunt awkward item that is not easily found"" problem that comes with most adventure games of this ilk, I very much enjoyed the experience.  What impressed me most in that game was the overarching storyline.  Sadly, this was not the case for Crimes and Punishments.  The puzzles were overly easy, the overarching storyline was all but nonexistent, with some hint of it during the first case and the only other thought of it at the very end of the last case.  The puzzles weren't that impressive.  Whereas in the testament every lock was a different puzzle, in this game every lock was the same mini game.  The entire game held your hand, providing you with icons for when to use different modes (imagination or heightened senses).  I became actually very bored halfway through the second to last case, and that boredom continued on.  I had hoped that I was simply playing a bunch of opening cases before I got to the meats and bones of the game, with a drawn out series of cases that didn't hold your hand.  Overall, I was very disappointed in this game.  The graphics and sounds were amazing, but that is all.  If you enjoy adventure games with a lot of mind twisting puzzles and an interesting storyline that carries through the entire game, this is not it.			"

												Intriguing, amazing textures -- some of the best I've seen! -- a variety of investigative gameplay that bears some resemblance to L.A. Noire, and a variety of clothing and disguises to select, with the humor of Holmes and Watson, of course, present. However, the result of your investigations feels almost unrewarding, considering you can opt to retry your decision of who you convict, see each outcome, and who was actually the culprit, leaving your long endured, pain-staking decision meaningless; though, you can ignore the option to retry! Having been immersed with the first investigation, I had spent several hours during my day struggling to decide who to convict, and to my despair, I was presented with a disappointing short cutscene and an option to retry my decision. This had ultimately led me to lose immersion with the game, and my eager anticipation to later replay the investigation, discover anything I had missed, and see what impact these decisions -- and decisions from future investigations -- would have on the game. Albeit, the option to retry those outcomes is NOT mandatory and can be ignored, thankfully, should you desire to ignore them; immersion doesn't have to be totally broken.Overall, it's an interesting gander into the world of Sherlock Holmes; finally being able to explore his home on Baker Street, and investigating with Watson in the original time period, as though you were visually interacting with the books themselves. Fans of interesting story games, and Holmes fans, especially, will enjoy this title!Is it worth a buy? That's up to you, but, in my opinion, for a good deal, why not.			"

												Not really an exciting experience, since this game is unfortunately for me based on short stories by sir Arthur Conan-Doyle. And ridiculously sadly you realise that you know all the cases 'cause you've read them all along. So there was no interest playing this game for me. Не очень интересно. Игра сделана на основе рассказов, т.е. ты их уже прочитал, а теперь игра предлагает тебе в это сыграть, интрига? Смехотворно. Могли бы заморочиться и придумать что-нибудь своё, а не копипастить сэра Артура.			"

												Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments is a detective game that you in Sherlock Holmes' skin try to solve cases.Pros:-Good cases-If you don't pay attention on the clues you may get wrong conclusions, so you have to think a lot.-You can choose the punishment of the culprits.-The atmosphere and the development of the characters are amazing.Cons:-I dislike some puzzles, they aren't difficult or something, but some of them are boring. Not all of them.-The loading when you travel places are annoying.Conclusion: I really liked this game a lot, since this is a good game with some good cases to solve (My favorites are the second ""Riddle on the rails"" and the last ""A half moon walk"") and I really like mystery games.So, if you like detective games, I really recommend you to buy this.

												This game is good im most ways; the graphics are good, plot lines interesting and some features, such as the creating character profiles through observation, are very good. The appearances of the characters and most of the speech and actions are true to the book- I love the Sherlock Holmes stories and this game is a pretty good representation. However, the loading times aren't brilliant, though they do allow acess to casebook during loading screens which is good.Some of the objectives are unclear, but it is up to you as a player I suppose, to logically think of what to do next.Overall a good game, would reccomend.

												One of the best Sherlock Holmes games around, and the best gameplay-wise. The deduction system is just brilliant. You can actually solve all the six cases wrong, or at least get the murder method wrong in some of the cases. They went easy on the puzzles this time and focused more on the cases themselves, which is a good decision, in my opinion.What's a little bit annoying though, is that each case has multiple suspects, and most of them have strong evidence against them, but mostly there's that little detail that gives the correct conclusion away, except for one case that was just convoluted. (Read below for more details. Expect spoilers, of course!)The Kew Gardens Drama nonsense:Why are the plants located at the syndicate when they never stole them? Margaret White placed them there? It seemed like random people could waltz in, place or remove three large plants from there with ease.The misleading recording description that flat out stated that she didn't leave the lab!Although she seemed like the probable accomplice, she had a lot of jewelry that she could sell for financial support. I remember Sherlock saying that it's worth a lot. "

												I strongly recommend this game to every Sherlock Holmes fan.Pros* amazing voice acting of superb quality* unique, detailed and amazing environments; I cannot stress enough how well made they are* interesting and mysterious cases* great, believable characters with fleshed out personalities (Lestrade's version is especially entertaining)* the cases are not obvious and require thinking and observation (mostly the latter :D)* great balance between information digested by Sherlock (the game) and information left to be processed by us* suprisingly unobtrusive UI* deduction space (!)* Toby and its nose* The secret police division of Baker Street* doing interesting analyses/experiments where you have to think and observe as wellalmost Cons* some minigames* lock-pickingThese are almost cons. Actually each type of minigame is interesting the first time but annoying when you are replaying chapters. Lock-picking gets repetitive quicker. Fortunately, you can skip most minigames and lock-picking. I only wish the option didn't appear after 15-20 seconds and istead was immediately available.I've briefly played one of the previous Frogwares Sherlock games - something about Chthulu - and I don't remember it being that good. I don't expect this game to be topped anytime soon in terms of authentic Sherlock experience.			"

												This episodic adventure game shines through its love for detail and fleshed out characters. 6 cases offer different very atmospheric environments and lots of well written dialogue. Cases are solved by collecting clues, questioning witnesses and suspects, and solving occasional puzzles (nothing too difficult) that are then combined in a ""clue screen"" that allows for different choices in conclusions, that finally add up to a (not necessarily correct) solving of the case.Beautiful graphics, great voice acting, highly detailed environments result in great immersion.Very recommended for fans of adventure games and gamers who like their stories, but not necessarily the gameplay, to be challenging.

												A fantastic detective game, I would say this game is just as fun as LA Noire. Interactive environments, solving cases that sometimes lead to more questions and segments. If you are looking for a game to shoot bad guys like LA Noire that isn't this game, this game requires patience, careful calculation about finding suspects and clues and sometimes it has a mini-game that allows you to throw things or even shoot things. There are some funny moments and one odd thing which is a telescope aimed at a window with an obese lady staring back smiling. 9/10The only thing that's down is the annoying map that pops up constantly when you venture slightly out of the area.

Posted: August 13, 2016
												The definitive Sherlock Holmes experience, without a doubt.This game plays like an episodic serie, where cases are seemingly unrelated to one another..  and by the end, the cases themselves aren't, the ""main"" story is apparently one you barely notice.  Each of the six cases will take from two to 3 hours to complete and is completely unique.  Besides Sherlock's appartment and Scotland Yard, every location is its own theme, music, the attention to detail to the level I cannot remember in another game before or since.Gameplay :  Like in the previous installments of the serie, you can switch between third and first person views.  This is strictly up to preferences but I found that third person view was easier to notice details..  but then again I played the last game, Testament, on first, so whichever feels more comfortable to you.  There are still mini games and puzzles but they come far more naturally than those of the previous title from the serie.  There are fewer of them too, as the focus is on investigations instead of pulling your hair trying to understand how to solve a specific puzzle.Presentation :  Unlike the previous titles where you simply need to put one piece after the other, this game is all about deductions.  You could even be wrong and still ""win"" your case.  You need to put logical deductions.  Hey that guy was found with the murder weapon and hated the victim.  Here's why he's guilty.  Did he actually do it?  Now that's your job, mister.  There are even cases where you can quickly tell who's guilty but you can't prove it.  The Gardens case was my favorite because the murder was so clever it was a genuine challenge.Humor :  Yes, anyone who actually bothered reading or watching old Sherlock series know that Sherlock is a massive jerk and the gentleman is Watson.  There is a dry humor permeating the whole game.  For example, Toby, the valiant dog, is present in Sherlock's appartment and in every case, does something canine...  snacking on Watson's tennis shoes, eating his latest essay..  the great detective doesn't miss commenting on these.Music :  Atmospheric, nice and barely noticeable.  The sounds are all spot on, little birds chirping outside in the yard, people bickering near the streets, the score isn't epic but it does its job.Graphics :  When was the last time you played a game and thought it didn't just look good, it was beautiful?  The character models are simply amazing.  Even the loading screens were attractive, where Sherlock would read a book, you'd see the appropriate scenery nearby, if Toby's there he'll he on a seat.  You're even encouraged to check your notes during loading.What could have been better?  Well, there are very cool ""imagination"" and ""instinct"" parts where you need to piece things and notice details others have missed.  They're amazing and fun but the game always tells you when you start using these.  I would have liked an option to turn these off to find them myself...  but at the same time, the stages are so large and these are used once, sometimes twice per episodes, it might have been really frustrating...Verdict :  96%.  Highly recommended for any fans of detective work and a must have for Sherlock fans!			"

												8.5/10Pros-voice actingsound workvisuals to an extent (Toby doesn't look quite right)case storiespuzzlesmini gamesinteresting real world facts in some casesimagination modecons-load times = long wait times for travelinga lot of back and forth traveling, which wouldn't be so bad except for the load timesbeing forced to use the detection ability, even when some clues are pretty obviousrepetative use of the lock picking mini gameMycroft is an annoying, egotistical, preachy, self entitled, judgemental, rude, butt.On one case, my decision at the end was entirely influenced by my desire to say f-u to Mycroft.I own the Sherlock Holmes collection and have played Nemesis, Jack the Ripper, and Testament so far. All of which I have enjoyed. I was really looking forward to Crimes and Punishments and immediately bought it once it was released.I can happily say I do not regret this decision.Another person commented that ""the whole game plays like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's 'The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes'"" and with that I can agree. None of the cases are solidly connected with an over arching plot, but there are some slight connections and references here and there. Including some throwbacks to the older games.The quick time events are actually well incorperated in my opinion, and come at relatively appropriate times. They really help to add to the feeling of using Sherlock's skills.The cases are enjoyable and some have large deduction trees, which makes for an even more fun final conclusion. Sometimes you can gather enough clues and evidence to make an immediate deduction, but without all the evidence, there is a possibility that deduction might be wrong.I think I would have enjoyed being able to play as Toby a little more. I also feel the disguise system was under utilized and somewhat limited in the promised freedom of choice.Lastly, I agree with Watson. Fyodor Dostoyevsky's ""Crime and Punishment"" was a very hard book to understand. It took me almost 6 months to finish it and that was because near the end, I dreaded having to pick up the book.Also, Mycroft is an♥♥♥♥♥and he insulted me personally with what he said to Watson about understanding the book.

												Overall - recommendationGraphics - good. Maybe my expectations were just lowered but it's a genuinely pretty game with a strong art style. I particularly like the attention to faces. Also the first person mode means that you feel a lot more immersed in the world.Writing - solid. If you're a fan of the stories you'll enjoy the mysteries here as they're not only pretty interesting in their own write, but they also feel very much like something Doyle would have written himself.Mechanics - fun. They can feel a touch contrived at times (press F for imagination) but they're free flowing enough to make you feel like a detective. It's worth emphasising that for the most part the mechanics compliment your own thinking and puzzle solving, rather than just doing it all for you.Misc - voice acting is.... peculiar, it is often wooden, and over affected. The game would benefit massively from more talented voice actors, especially because you have to listen to people talk so much. It's not game ruining, but it feels like a missed opportunity for a game that works so hard to immerse you in its world. For the most part, it's not game ruining, but it damages the game's otherwise strong effort at immersion. Final thoughts - Fancy a story driven game? But you're bored of shooting people in deserts/sewers/deserted cities? Yet you still want the good graphics and immersive perspective typical of the AAA genres? This is a good choice. Especially if you're a fan of Holmes.  "

												So what to say about this game:It is a detecitve game (suprise), where you are involved into different cases,their theme is mostly murder in some way. So it first you play the clue-finding part of the game, that means you go around and search for clues and connections. You do so by searching the environment, analysing things you found in your laboratory, reconstruction of a scene, searching your archieve and so on. Some if the evidence geathering is connected to different mini games, which i don't want to spoil, but in my opinion they are always very cool and suit the different cases well (there are different techniques of gathering evidence introduced in the different cases).You have to do this, until you found enough evidence to make a judgment. However. for that you don't have to finde all the clues a case has, just only enough so that it is possible to go to the judgment part of the game (which is done in Sherlocks Brain, you pick different possibilities there which might indicate a suspect is guilty or innocent, and if your assumptions are consistent and you made enough you are able to condemn a suspect). That means, you can end a case without searching for all evidence and thus comdemn an innocent. However, even when you found all evidence present, you will in most cases never be realy sure who commited the crime. There are always several suspects, motives or sometimes even weapons to choose from. When you are sure you found the criminal you always get two options to choose from, one which is the strict appliance of the law, the other a lenient sentence (which might go as for as to let a the person go because he acted out of selve defense in your opinion). This is pretty cool (Sherlock can do so because he is not directly employed by Scotland Yards) and when making your judgment you have to consider all the clues you found like articels in newspapers, letters or what other persons told you.  Based on your coise there will be different solutions and endings to a case (which person you confront and how you do it)So this is what the game is mostly about: geathering evidence and creating a picture of what has happened and afterwads making a judgment based or the clues you found. All in all the game offers:6 different cases (which are not realy connected to each other, but after you finised a case you can read a letter about the outcome) However, in some cases you get to know someting about a group called ""Merry Man"" and they will influence your very last decition in the game, which I found very cool (kind of fight club like :P )It took me 13,7 h to do so, I colleted all the clues and finished every case 100 %However there are several Endings, which depend on the choise you make in the judgment section of the game, and I only did one for each case, which i though fits the game best. So you might add some minutes here if you watch all the different endings (but for me that was not the point of the game).So would I recommend this game? And is it worth the 40 Euros I payed for it?Short answer: I would totally recommend this game. It is the first I played of this kind, and I enjoyed every minute of it! "

												Now *this* is a detective game! Unlike many others in the genre, there are multiple paths. (That said, Tex Murphy is a gem as well with multiple paths.) In this game, you find the clues, but it's up to you to deduce who is guilty, or even if multiple people conspired together, based upon the raw facts in the case! I haven't completed it, but I hear there are 6 different cases, and there is replayability to try to second guess what you thought was the truth. There is also an option to find out at the end of each case whether you found all the clues, and whether you made the right deduction (just a yes/no...the game won't tell you what the right deduction was if you got it wrong). Very clever!			"

												Eίναι περισσότερο εμφανές από ποτέ ότι η Frogwares δε σταματά να “πειράζει” το περιεχόμενο και τον χαρακτήρα των παιχνιδιών της, προσπαθώντας να οδηγήσει στην αποδοχή τους από μία όσο το δυνατόν μεγαλύτερη μερίδα gamers. Το “Crimes and Punishments” είναι ένα εξαιρετικό παιχνίδι, ένας από τους τίτλους εκείνους που κάθεσαι με ηρεμία το απόγευμα, το βράδυ ή όποτε άλλοτε προτιμάς κι ασχολείσαι αρκετές ώρες μαζί τους, μέχρι να φτάσεις στο φινάλε.Δε θέτει δυσκολίες διότι δε θέλει να το κάνει, πατάει όμως στις ηθικές επιλογές που μας δίνει, στο replayability που έχει, στο σύγχρονο και πολύ εντυπωσιακό οπτικοακουστική πακέτο που προσφέρει και στη συνήθη πολύ υψηλή ποιότητα παραγωγής του. Είμαι βέβαιος πάντως ότι, αναλόγως και της εμπορικής πορείας του παρόντος, θα δούμε τουλάχιστον ένα ακόμη παιχνίδι της σειράς που θα έχει πανομοιότυπη δομή με το “Crimes and Punishments”, κάτι σαν sequel αυτού. Aφού πω ότι αποδεικνύεται περίτρανα ότι το “Testament of Sherlock Holmes” έχει φορτώσει με πολύ δύσκολη αποστολή τους απογόνους του, εξακολουθώ ν’ αναρωτιέμαι:  Ο ίδιος ο Holmes, που ως γνωστόν αρέσκεται στα δύσκολα, θα ήθελε να λύνονται με τόση ευκολία οι υποθέσεις του;Crimes and Punishments is a nearly excellent game, one of those anybody enjoys playing calmly every afternoon / night, until he reaches its end. It brings many innovations to the franchise, such as moral choices, conclusions about various characters' possible guilt and heavy use of deduction boards. The only thing I just can't stop wondering about is if Holmes himself would like his cases to be so simplified and easy to solve. http://www.ragequit.gr/reviews/item/sherlock-holmes-crimes-and-punishments-pc-review "

												After a good long while of meaning to play this game, I finally got around to it - and it did not disappoint. First off, the gameplay elements.Crimes and Punishments is my second Sherlock Holmes game by Frogware and it is a vast improvement on The Awakened. Splitting the game up into six self contained cases rather than one big case was a brilliant idea - you can complete each case in a few hours play, say an evening. This makes the game easy to pick up and drop as you feel like playing as there is no requirement to remember all the previous hours of game play. Your case book is also a lot better organised and is easy to use, indicating where you need to further investigate a clue. The deductions screen is also very cool, and there are no penalties for making a wrong choice at this stage which is useful for when things get a bit ambiguous (The railway and roman bath cases spring to mind!)Playing in 3rd person, while allowing you to get a good look at the entire scene, makes it a bit more difficult to pinpoint those 'clues'. I played the first 2 cases entirely in 3rd person and switched to 1st in the 3rd case. I found it a lot easier to spot things in 1st person.Annoyingly, sometimes you must find or deduce things in the 'correct order' before the game will allow you to continue. I suppose this comes down to the fact that as the player we can see things we might need (by nature of the fact we're playing a mystery game and know we'll need to work around problems) before Sherlock himself realises he needs them. This isn't too much of a problem, if not slightly irritating at first. Just try to think like you're really in the situation, not playing a game.I only found one of the cases (Kew Gardens, the 5th case) to be a tedious, though it's ending was by far one of the more interesting ones so it gained back some brownie points for that.This game suffers slightly from the mistake of Awakened where Sherlock often makes medical assumptions/observations when Watson is right there - as someone who dislikes the 'bumbling idiot' portrayal of Watson this wound me up when it happened but it didn't impact much on my experience except for passing annoyance.On the hardware side, the game has ages okay. The graphics hold up fairly well, the controls are a little clunky but fine once you get used to them. I'm not sure why, but I experienced lag throughout the game when I have a machine capable of running current (2016) AAA titles. I experienced the same problem with The Awakened which is even older so maybe it's steam's ports or Frogware's engine but something to keep in mind if the occassional jitter is something that would bother you.All in all, I'd give this game a solid 7/10 in today's market. Enjoyable, and definitely worth the price if you can get it on sale like I did. Good for a few evenings entertainment and has replay value in solving each case with the alternate ending to what you picked the first time.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Sherlock Homes: Crimes and Punishments or simply Crimes and Punishments is a game developed by Frogwares and published by Focus Home Interactive and continues the Frogwares' Sherlock Holmes game franchise after The Testament of Sherlock HomesAfter I played The Testament of Sherlock Holmes, I immediately thought that the game was gonna be a benchmark for more and better Sherlock Holmes games to come and honestly, Frogwares and Focus Home Interactive truly delivered with Crimes and PunishmentsThe game is even more engaging, with even better mechanics of controlling the characters. There's even more scenarios where you have to use different characters, and a few addition of investigative modesHaving said that, the game is tad bit easier then The Testament of Sherlock Homes, whereby the puzzles are less complex and it is really more straightforwardly guided with more obvious hints and leads you where you should go. However, at the end of each cases, you will have to make a decision based on your collected clues and you would be shown the answers - don't be surprised if you get it wrong, because it can happen, and you would be able to continue as isWhilst the puzzles are simpler, they make up for it with longer cases and stretched storyline, just nicely suited and not dragging it. The cases are all separated and are not connected to each other, but the fun of investigating is all the same It makes me want more cases, more deaths and more things to investigate!  RECOMMENDED :)  "

												If you'r a fan of any of the original works such as 'The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes', then this game is for you. Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments plays out much like one of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original stories, and is a genuine pleasure to play. The positive notes of the gam are that ambience of the game is on point, and the cases kep you interested through to the conclusion. The negatives are that, firstly,  the game controls feel a bit clumsy at times, most notably when investigating some clues,  and secondly, that the puzzles themselves are not particularily challenging. A third drawback can also be argued in that it has next to no replay value, but this is more an inherent flaw in the genre of mystery games as a whole than a reflection on this game in particular.In short, if you have $35 and a weekend to yourself, and are a fan of Sherlock Holmes or even just a good mystery, pick up this game. you won't regret it.Immersion: 4/5Ambience: 5/5Controls: 4/5Replay Value: 2/5 "

												This was the most beautiful one yet of the Sherlock Holmes games. Sadly also the least challenging.It felt like I was just along for the ride as Sherlock solved everything by himself, and my main choice was to agree or not agree with his deductions. I loved the customization option, but it would have been more fun if it was unlocked throughout the game and not only ""the right disguise"" for that time.A worthy experience for fans, though you hardly need much brainpower. The controls did not feel natural to me, felt like I was lugging a corpse around really. Oh and Watson is always in the way! With the added personality of a tired fat toad he makes you wanna punch him in the face.My feelings are mixed on this one, but I still reccomend it. Its gorgous and its Sherlock innit!			"

												First off.... I will say that the load times are WAY too long. Quite often in each chapter you will be treveling between each area at least 15+ times which combined can take up a hell of alot of time. Aside from that this game is very fun to play if you are familliar with the other Sherlock Holmes games. I highly recommend it though there isnt really any great build-up to the end like in the last game, just case after case with a tiny moral choice at the end....it is in a way very minor sequel bait.I also got to mention that its great to finally have a choice in the case of who is the guilty party, you can in fact arrest the wrong person/people so dont take the deduction board for granted when it seems like things match up. You can go back if you made a wrong choice though so dont worry. The puzzles/minigames while solving cases can sometimes be a literal pain in the butt, like the time where you got to arm-wrestle a geezer which was not fun :c But its nice of the developers to allow you to skip every single one of the puzzles/events though you will not get the achivment if you do this.Overall this game is really pretty and fun to play...just the loading times being a literal nightmare brings it down a bit but I recommend this game if you are a patient person.

												This is the first game ever to make me actually want to buy a DLC (Which I don't know exists).The graphics are beautiful, and gameplay's great, if a little easy at times.I really like the new deduction mechanic, and the new profiling mechanic.The cases are interesting and varied, and feel like they naturally belong in a ""Sherlock Holmes world"".Figuring out the conclusion of every case is very nice because it makes sure you don't just click around without actually understanding what's going on. Some of the cases are harder than others, sometimes the conclusion is pretty obvious and sometimes it's really hard to figure out, I got it wrong in one of the 6 cases. I like that the possible conclusions keep changing with new evidence.Would have been more challenging if you had to pick which item to use when you need ""an object of interest"" instead of the game just giving you the right option. Also would have been more challenging if the game didn't tell you when to use the ""Sherlock Talent"" and the ""Sherlock Imagination"" abilities.The environments are beautiful, would have loved to try this in VR. I spent some of the time just looking around and enjoying the scenery. Voice acting is very nice in my opinion; a historian friend of mine noted that Sherlock's accent didn't sound right, but I had no problem with it.Overall a very fun experience for me, I enjoy games that make you think, and this is much better than just a regular adventure game. Would love to play many more cases, but the game is definitely worth buying ""just"" for those 6, every case is more than an hour of very interesting content.			"

												TL;DR: A strong recommendation. Might not be everyone's cup of tea, but especially for any Sherlock Holmes fan out there, this shouldn't be missed.Longer one:The best one in the series. Frogwares has really managed to capture the oldschool holmes vibe and once again did something a bit different to break their formula - something I respect a lot. The production values have also gone up a notch once again, as did the writing of the cases. I also really, REALLY liked the deduction space in this one and the possibility to do totally wrong deductions and even accuse the false party (something I also enjoyed a lot in for example LA Noire). This one wasn't that much about the puzzles, but really capturing the essence of Holmes. It's easy to see how much the team loves the title character (and I also bet the old BBC adaptation of the Holmes cases :) ).The ONLY real nag from me is the hand holding nature of the ""inspector-mode"". Why on Earth have they decided to not put the hinting icon for switching into inspector-mode (and re-enactment also) as an OPTION, in beyond my understanding. IMO this game would've been even better, if that could've been turned off and let for the player to figure out when to use it.Can't wait the next one in the series, as Frogwares have better themselves on every instalment.

												I like Detective/Murder/Mystery type games and am quite a fan of Sherlock Holmes in general, so it was no surprise that I enjoyed my time playing through this game. After having played through most of the Sherlock Holmes games I also like the direction the developers seem to be taking this series. This last installment is certainly my favorite of all I've played so far, but it is of course not without its issues.First, I want to mention that the graphics are quite gorgeous in this game, and in several instances I found myself just gazing on the terrifically detailed and beautiful locales. Also the characters themselves are highly detailed and I sit left quite impressed. I did however find most areas a bit ""foggy"" and also animations not equally impressive. Close up of faces looks stunning, but feel stiff and lifeless.As with the previous game, the voice acting is top notch and every character you play and meet are believable. I had a bit of trouble hearing the voices of our Baker Street duo in the beginning as voices seemed to be set quite low, but it was easily adjusted through the options screen. Music and sound effects throughout the game seemed very good.All those things are good to have and helps the immersion and the general enjoyment of the game, but it all comes down to how the game plays. I know that this won't be a game for everyone. It is slow paced, dialog heavy and a lot of traveling back and forth, and for people who like their action a bit revved up this game will have a hard time to convince that it is worth their time. However, if you are into good story telling, enjoy having to think a little and don't mind lots of dialog then this right here is quite a gem. It will of course help if you share my interest in Detective/Murder/Mystery previously mentioned.The game is seperated into six seperate cases of a little varied lengths and difficulty. They are all interesting mysteries with added twists and appear in well varied and interesting locales. They are truly seperate cases and are not smaller parts of a bigger scheme. I like that setup. It feels like they were going for an episode based game but you get all of it in one dash. Felt good to end one case one day, and then start a fresh new one the next. Kept it constantly interesting.It is not a particularly difficult or challenging game. It felt more like a guided experience where you in the end decide who the culprit is and his or her fate. You do this through a deduction minigame that you constantly add to as you uncover clues and statements. In the end you can be totally wrong and have an innocent person thrown in jail. So you need to pay attention.The game has a few various puzzle mini games and quick time events that give good variation to the gameplay even though the QTE's feel a bit out of place. You also have some ""super"" abilities that you need to use certain places. But don't worry you will not miss anything as you will always be notified when you need to use them.I like that they put in some references to previous games in the series and also a nod to other things. The Calvin & Hobbes reference was particularly enjoyable :o)Because the game is split up the way it is it seemed like a lengthy game for an adventure type game and I spent about 18 hrs to play through it. Even though it felt too easy and too guided I feel like I really got my money's worth in entertainment from this game.The biggest complaint I have is that they have reduced Dr. Watson to a walking, talking obstacle that just seems to be in the way, and contributes nothing. Surely there would be ways to include him in various ways for a fuller experience?In the end I have to say that I would easily recommend this game to all Sherlock fans, adventure game fans, murder/mystery fans and similar gamers.I give this game a 8/10Happy gaming!J3ST3R			"

												I'm generally sour on adventure games, because the ""I'm stumped"" moments are always linked to having to guess some nonsensical way to proceed. C&P doesn't hide any of the process from you; it's a slow accumulation of clues, associated by deduction to arrive at conclusions. To me this is the pure essence of what a detective game should be.The puzzle sections, and yes, even the dog sequences, are lightly sprinkled throughout and give a nice sense of pacing. None of them are very hard, but they are good speed bumps to break up what would otherwise be monolithic walls of text. These sections are always at least marginally sensible, and make me feel like I'm doing something to earn my clues ... even when it's a straightforward series of operations like ""pick up eyedropper, drop acid onto metal, observe results"". Some of them are bona fide puzzles requiring moderately crunchy brain work, but if you are looking for hardcore gameplay challenges, this may not be for you.The really wonderful thing about the game is that the deduction system lets you be wrong. There's no mechanical penalty whatsoever to screwing up - you can finish the whole game and never get a right answer. The game provides numerous red herrings and false conclusions to pursue, and if you're simply bashing through like an action gamer, trying to ""win"" as quickly as possible, you probably will ... and you'll probably be wrong. As you collect the clues, though, you are given a great deal of ""soft"" information that will lead you to the correct solution. It's demanding my attention in a way no game has before. You will find enough evidence to reach a conclusion; it is probable, though not guaranteed, that you'll accumulate all available clues, and by testing deductive permutations, unlock all available solutions ... but even then, arriving at the correct one requires thoughtful consideration.If Frogwares keeps this system for future games, they've earned a new regular customer.

												Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments is pretty good and I commend it to the attention of anyone who likes mysteries or adventure games.I bought it a year ago based on the unexpectedly strong praise of PC Gamer and then let it languish in my Steam library until this weekend. It turns out I should have gotten around to it sooner; it's not the budget title I expected, but a serious and earnest attempt to do the mystery genre real justice (so to speak) in games.FIrst, I should note that the presentation is solid; although it's not an AAA title and never will be, the environments are detailed, the people are expressive, and the voice acting is uniformly solid and engaging. Everything related to storytelling clearly got priority. The stuff that isn't up to snuff are the things that are secondary to that experience, like the somewhat sluggish mouse controls or the kind of janky running. These things are minor annoyances sometimes, not dealbreakers, and have nothing to do with the real meat of the game.And the meat of the game is this: every single mystery has multiple suspects with plausible motives and multiple ways events could have gone down. Simulating ""solving a mystery"" is one of the absolute hardest things to do in a videogame and it's why so many ""mystery"" games (including this one, to a degree) are really adventure games with puzzles as stand-ins for actual reasoning. Thankfully, while there are some minigames and jigsaw-puzzle-solving and connect-the-dots and so forth, Crimes and Punishments mostly consists of accumulating real clues and listening to real testimony and it's committed to letting you miss things or draw the wrong conclusions and even accuse the wrong people (at which point the game just keeps going!). It's a great design approach and I hope anyone attempting mystery games in the future takes note.John Walker at RPS hated it but reading his review it becomes clear that he kindasorta didn't solve a lot of the cases. Like, he talks about how case such-and-such has a nonsensical out-of-left-field ending and I'm pretty sure it's because he didn't collect all the evidence and didn't come up with the right picture of the crime.And it made me realize that that's always going to be a problem with the genre, even when the games aren't low-budget titles from France - if a mystery game plays fair and doesn't railroad you and gives you real chances to succeed based on your intuition and deduction, that means it's also giving you real chances to fail, and a lot of people are going to fail and just think the mystery is dumb or the game is stupid, regardless of its actual quality.If you understand that, and you're willing to accept that this game represents - to possibly the greatest degree yet achieved in a videogame - an actual test of your reasoning skills, I think you'll be in for a lot of fun.

Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments Genre/Style: Adventure, Third/First Person Single-Player Release Date: September 30, 2014 Purchase Date: May 31, 2015 Buy/Pass: BuyReviewI've always loved reading Sherlock Holmes novels, both as a kid and adult. I've watched ""Sherlock"" on BBC and loved every minute of it. That's why, not long after delving into this game, I knew I was definitely 'Sherlocked.'This installment of Sherlock Holmes is different than others in the series in that it unfolds in a set of mini-mysteries instead of one connected plot. This makes the game easier to digest in that you can play through a crime in one extended sitting rather than pick it up the next day forgetting what piece of the puzzle you last solved.The game looks beautiful. The attention to detail is especially apparent when interviewing suspects, as the camera is positioned about one foot from their face during most conversations (it does pan around some, so it's not claustrophobic). This tiny adjustment really allows you to feel like the Great Detective by studying every inch of a person's face to determine whether there is more to their words. The music is subdued and tasteful for the environment, and the ambient noises are pleasant as well. The game really allows you to focus in relative silence, and that is classic Sherlock material. The voice-acting is great, and really sells the characters' faces and mannerisms.

As I mentioned earlier, the game is a set of mini-mysteries, each with their own level of difficult and plot. The title of the game is a reference to Dostoyevsky's ""Crime and Punishment,"" and centers around identifying the right criminal and punishing them according to your own judgment. Your apartment at 221B Baker Street acts as your base of operations, where you can research, perform lab experiments, and change your appearance (somewhat limited based on the case) to progress the case. Most of your time will be spent walking around locations creating Character profiles, discovering clues and putting them all together to reach a ""Deduction."" The game allows you to connect clues to reach your own conclusions, and then shows you what other players chose (reference The Walking Dead by Telltale), even allowing you to see the correct choice after your deductions are complete. I did not experience any glitches with the game, although while in first-person view sometimes clues are not easy to discover. I ran the game in windowed mode with Borderless Gaming and had a lot of screen tearing from time to time, but it didn't impact the playability. You can see my system specs[pastebin.com] to help evaluate your system vs mine as far as what I experienced.In summary, I'd highly recommend this game to any mystery fan and say it's a ""must-own"" for any Sherlock fan. The combination of visuals, plot, and gameplay make it addictive and relaxing for the mystery enthusiast. It's arguably the best of its kind.If you enjoyed this review, check out my curator page for more. "

 Crimes and Punishments is an adequate rom thru late 1800’s London and the surrounding areas that both pushes the adventure genre in some new and interesting directions. Each case plays out like a short story on a book; they aren’t necessary related to one another but new cases aren’t unlock until the previous one is completed. Though the mysteries themselves don’t become more complex, the mini games like lock picking and puzzles to unlock clues do become more difficult. The games starts off on the right foot with a wonderful grizzle murder mystery with the victim impaled on the wall by his own wailing harpoon. It’s the perfect way to introduce players to the games interviewing puzzle mechanics. Interviewing suspects and witnesses lead to new clues, but physical clues in the environments or by inspecting what NPC’s are wearing and how they hold themselves can help catch someone in a lie or in a contradiction. This quick inspection of what each characters wearing is clearly inspired by BBC series and it works well in the videogame setting. But clues aren’t all found by grilling witnesses, a large portion of the game involves searching the environment. As clues and stories start to piece together, Crimes and Punishments opens up the synapse deduction system which chains the collaborating stories and physical clues and brings them to a logical conclusion. Each case has multiple outcomes, all of which have solid evidence to backups your suspicions. Once you come to a personally satisfactory conclusion as to who you think guilty is and you then ask whether or not that person is morally at fault. So you can find someone guilty of murder but choose not to testify with your evidence, because you feel they were within their right. The game never comes forward and says “definitively, you’re right or you’re wrong with your decisions” This open ended sort of victory is oddly satisfying. It’s not the game’s version of correct, it’s my version of correct! But it’s a version of correct that made me second guess myself? On the other hand, some cases lack of real sense of closure no matter what verdict do you render. You may deduce where a final piece of evidence is or where some bodies maybe buried, but you never find out for sure and in that regard it can be maddening. For the most part, the cases are fun little mysteries in features some fantastic writing. Out of the seven, five of them captivated me and the remaining two however, fell so flat that I felt no need to explore any other possible outcomes that might have come from them. The mini games and puzzles within crimes and punishments are pretty satisfying! There are few particularly the “arm wrestling and rope bridge crossing” mini games that are infuriating but for the most part; puzzles, mini games and finding new clues all follow path of logic. There are no absurd solutions to simple problems and thankfully the game doesn’t turn into daunting pixel hunt. Don’t be mistaken, there will be times when you’ll have to hunt thru the environment just to find one little item to progress the story. The game might also force players to make deduction a bit prematurely just to advance the case. One of CNP’s biggest setbacks is its misused or disused of available resources. The custom and disguise system couldn’t be utilize to a greater effect but sadly it only comes in to play twice throughout the entire game. And Watson who should be brimming with personality and insight, largely plays a background role throughout the entire experience. He remains inhumanly upright silence and on occasion when he does talk, he doesn’t act like a capable doctor and former soldier that it should be. The game also has more that it fair share of an invisible walls and junkie environmental exploration. But who exactly is Crimes and Punishments for? I’d say that anyone who’s interested in Sherlock Holmes whether the classis version or even the new modern literation’s of the character, will enjoy themselves with Crimes and Punishments. It’s not gonna rock anyone’s world but it will certainly entertain for a while. I’d also recommend for anyone whose new adventure genre after being introduced by Telltale Games “The Walking Dead Series” but want something requiring a little more brainpower. I would not recommended to people who haven’t spent much time with an adventure genre nor to gamers only play faster paced shooter or action games. But truly, I enjoyed my time with Crimes and Punishments. The morality, judgment and deductions systems worked amazingly well for the adventure genre. The stories entertained me and I felt the sense of accomplishment when I finished the game. But the flows of the game has might be too much for more demanding gamers. At $40 Crimes and Punishments feels adequately priced especially for quality of the writing and the length of time that took me to complete it. It’s a good move in a right direction for the series and the genre, it’s just not as refined as it could be. It’s definitely a serviceable game worthy of the time of the curious and its directly targeted audience. On sale, I considered as done deal!  "

												While gameplay can sometimes be summarized as ""hug every nook and cranny with mouse cursor"", there's a few puzzles here and there that make for some fun times.The real winner here is the eye candy. This probably the prettiest UE3 game you'll ever play. Get the game if only for that.I should note that the voice acting is superb.			"

												Wonderful game. If you like Sherlock Holmes you will love this. Interesting cases, easy to medium level of puzzle difficulty, cool mechanics, great voices, ok music, beautiful graphics.The game does not let you miss clues and you will not get stuck in any puzzle. You don't need to overthink stuff and that means you never reach frustration levels. As a result, the game gets very enjoyable and makes you want to come back until you complete its 6 cases.Get it, especially if you enjoy Sherlock Holmes or adventure games that are not very hard.IMPORTANT: Play it in first person because its 3d person has very awkward controls.FOR THE DEVELOPERS: I am expecting a continuation. Improve on the already cool mechanics and your gameplay, find interesting stories to tell and you have gold on your hands.			"

												After finishing the game, I believe Sherlock Holmes: Crimes & Punishments to be the greatest detective game to date. It feels like an authentic Conan Doyle -written Holmes experience; the setting looks fantastic, the music lifts the atmosphere, the voice acting is convincing, and before all else, the cases are unique and intriguing.The gameplay consists of three different main parts: finding clues, interrogating suspects and questioning witnesses, and deducing the solution to the case from all gathered information. The game very generously helps with the first two parts, and you can always check Holmes' notebook to see what to do next in case you forget. Finding the clues is for the most part fun: altough the game follows point & click traditions, finding objects isn't a tedious pixel hunt, everything you can interact with is clearly higlighted when you are close enough to them. There is a plenty of minigames and puzzles, and while for example doing chemical experiments is fun and interesting, the lockpicking does get old by the end of the game.The interrogation and questioning is mostly quite straightforward, but whenever meeting a new person of interest you can stop time and observe minute details about the person, such as a missing wedding band or a peculiar tattoo. These details make up a profile of the person, and after a while you start to piece together the persons background in your own mind, as Holmes would do.The last part is in my opinion the most interesting one in the game. All the facts about the case are laid out in front of the player, and there are many different possible solutions to the case, but it is up to the player to figure out how things actually happened. After coming to a conclusion the player still has a choice: to either condemn or absolve the culprit(s). In one case in particular I had a lot of trouble with this moral choice, and still don't know if what I did was the right thing to do, which wonderfully highlights the games theme of morality.In conclusion, no other game has made me use my brain for deduction as well as Crimes & Punishments. It truly made me think, really use that gray matter of mine. While suffering from a few less than stellar minigames here and there, the rest of the game, especially the deducing, shines so brightly that those few misshaps can easily be forgiven. I fully recommend this game to anyone that is interested in detective stories, and having their deductive powers tested, or just about anyone in need of a polished game that excells at what it does.

  Score 8 / 10 A great and wanted (personally) change for the Sherlock Holmes series.It does however take out the difficulty of the puzzles a tad to much, while i HATE some of the previous puzzles, they could have gone to a Medium instead of going from Hard to Easy. They did however substitute the lack of hard puzzles with the the conclusion puzzle where you have to puzzle together the events of the case. Best thing about this is that you may actually end up with the wrong conclusion (ofc you can replay the ending) and will be shown so at the end of each case. It also includes a moral choice that introduced a real brain ♥♥♥♥ in my head when i was the one to determine if i find the crime harsh enough to be hung or just serve jail time etc.It doesn't really have any bugs that i could find, but some annoyances like the at best medium quality mouth/voice animations, (sometimes seeming out of sync) though you quickly forget about it. More so the annoying horse in your right hear when at the Analytic table, where you may end up spending some time on puzzles, i ended up turning of 7.1 to rest my right ear lol. And more than else the FOV, which you cannot turn up at all and might make you a little dizzy with its narrow view.Some cases might be too simple but some actually requires you to think a little, ofc that might just be me. Some might find it all easy, and some really hard.Seems to be a lot of negative stuff i wrote, but it's a really great game, well deserving of your money!All i can say when facing the conclusions is the following..Remove your ""correct"" answer from your head, and pretend the ""wrong"" scenario is the only possible one. Is it as wrong as you thought, or does it suddenly seem like your previous correct answer, is now the wrong one?			"

												I was just in the mood for Sherlock one day and started reading the books as I had not read any of them since school. About a week after that I noticed this game on sale and I thought I'd give it a try..... Initially, I was a bit taken back by the minimalist approach but as the game went on it became something I not only understand but totally love. It has this ""wide linear"" feel about the whole game that keeps you focused on the task at hand while also giving you a relative amount of freedom. Definately a refreshing game if you have been playing ""quick twitch, headshot, find next target"" type games and want something different. Overall, this game is one that should not be missed by anyone who has read, watched, or listened any Sherlock Holmes related story before. Even if not, this game is a great entry point into Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson's adventures.   9/10			"

												10/14/2014I have been playing this for a while, but just now feel comfortable giving my opinion on the game so far. As a disclaimer, I have not played any of the other Sherlock Holmes games. This is my first, there fore I can not comment on how it compares to any of them.Let me first say that I absolutely love this game. I am almost half way through, and every case feels very well designed. I have not once felt like I was simply going through the motions in order to advance the story. I constantly find myself looking around for more clues and piecing together events in my own head, let alone the in game ""deduction"" system, to see how fast I can deduce the guilty party.My favorite parts of the game revolve around the deduction system, which actually allows you to make mistakes and is very well designed, and the fantastic little mini games that can take some time and skill to complete. In order to not spoil anything, I will only say that although they give you the option to skip mini games in order to move on with the story, not once have I ever felt the desire to do so.So far I have found it to be an incredibly fun game to play, and look forward to completing the remaining cases. I will update my review when I finish them to give my opinion on the story as a whole.			"

												My favourite game in the franchise so far, it has solid roots in the previous chapters but is improved in the overall gameplay, not to mention the graphics. The gameplay becomes more holmes-like since many deduction elements were included, and not having a locked course in solving the cases proves to be very enjoyable. There are less mindless puzzles, and it comes to be really appreciated. A must buy if you are into the genre or simply into Sherlock Holmes.			"

												I'm an avid player of mystery games, and liked my first experience with this series despite odd logic, questionable voice acting and meme-worthy Creepy Watson. It really grew on me, so I gave this one a go. It started slow, but having just reached the conclusion of this installment:  ♥♥♥♥ing incredible. This game gave me my very favorite iteration of Holmes, even if their Watson borders too much on a Dumb as Toast incarnation. The narrative, while irritatingly episodic at times because that is it's nature, was very solidly united thematically. The settings had me in awe, and one of them (the frigidarium) replaced longstanding Mad Max artwork as my desktop background; that's right, it's so pretty i want to look at it every damn day.  This game inspired me to write my first review and I have had to stop myself from talking about it to my coworkers because I'm still trying to fool them into thinking I'm a regular person and not one who composes long essays in my head comparing the finer points  Crime and Punishment to, well, this.The puzzles are challenging but not so much that I had to skip any, I found myself staying well past the completion of the puzzles and case just to take in the scenery and the details put into this game. so many nods and hysterical moments for fans of other Sherlock incarnations, you can tell this was made by people who love the stories, the characters (except maybe Watson, give him some brain cells), and criminology. Yes, there are a few glitches and Watson always seems to know how to be in the way, but I'm still going to force my friends to try it out. Literally just bought the newest Sherlock game without it even being on sale right after finishing this one.			"

												My rating: 8.5/10This game is beautiful and has far exceeded my standards. I expected a game that only involved looking at the environments to gather clues, maybe aska few questions here and there. Oh what am I saying, this is SHERLOCK HOLMES the game! Pros:Ranging from reenacting the scene using Sherlock's imagination, looking into the very fine details of objects, the gameplay is fantastic. It showed me how the mind of the world's greatest detective works, and now I can understand why some of the demands he makes can be eccentric, and yet is actually part of the research that is required. it is extremely amusing to see Watson struggling to catch up with Sherlock and sometimes he finds Sherlock absurd, and the interactions between him and Sherlock definitely made me laugh aloud a few times.What astounded me the most were the character portraits, whereby you observe the details of the person that you are currently talking to to get his/her background. It strongly resembles the way Sherlock in the BBC TV series observes people.The mini-games, or puzzles to be exact, involve dabbling in a bit of chemistry, researching in your archives, and finding locations using your map. Even though it may sound boring in this review, they are both interesting and intriguing. You are given a choice to skip most of these puzzles, but more often than not, I never actually do, because such puzzles are actually unique and I have never came accross such mini games in all the time I play other games.This game shows you how Sherlock's mind works. How he processes and gains vital information from the littlest of things. From there, he does his deductions. Is it person A that murdered him or person B? Is it so sure that there is only one culprit? At some point in time, you will find that some deductions conflict with the others, and from there you must gather even more evidence to decide whether or not that deduction is accurate. The ultimate conclusion is up to you.You are also given moral choices at the end of each sequence. Are you an emphathiser or justice seeker? It is up to choose what fate you want to give to the culprit.Also, your gameplay is not limited to Sherlock and ONLY Sherlock. I will not say the rest due to spoilers.Cons:Voice acting - Voice acting can certainly improve. Although I find it rather alright at most points of the game, there are moments whereby I cringe at it. Reused default lines - Every time you talk to a police man... ""Mr Hooooolmes.""Invisible walls. Everywhere- This is not a sandbox game. You are expected to only walk around a certain area. Although I can understand, this disappointed me as there are parts whereby it looked like you can explore further, but then the map pops up whenever you go past a certain line, and your POV is suddenly switch 180 degrees around. Rather annoying and confusing at times.Watson not sufficiently involved in cases - Apart from 1 or 2 times whereby he was crucial to the storyline, he is pretty much useless most of the time. During cases I usually try to talk to him to gain some insights or his opinions, but most of the time he just gives me the default answers and follows me around. There is no difference whether or not he decides to accompany you on a case or not, because he doesn't do anything. Period. It would have been nice if he would give personal opinions like ""This suicide seems highly suspicious Mr Holmes."". Or if there were options where you could ask him to examine the victim and therefore give important clues as to how he died, which will then add on to the details that you gather from the autopsy. All these would have given him far more character.  But no. It doesn't work that way here.Overall, great game. I had a fun time finishing it. But I feel like it is only good for playing through once. Replaying it would be the last of my thought.			"

												This game is quite different from its predecessors! I'm not really sure what to think of it to be honest. Positive are the interesting stories and that I didn't have to use any walkthrough for it at all. Also, I like the details of the game. It is really well made. The control is quite easy but I haven't played it in 3rd person so far, so that might be different. It's fun to dress Sherlock up but that's about it.I have a lot more to say about the negative things. At first I started playing playing it on my laptop which just and just fulfils the requirements to run this game and it didn't work well at all. It was bumpy and the loading screen between the scenes was on for ages. It was really more loading than playing and that was quite annoying. Then I continued playing on my gaming pc and luckily didn't have any problems anymore with the graphics. But I have to say that the game is not made for playing it a long time. I wasn't able to play more than one case a day because I found it hard to concentrate on the dialogues and important stuff they might say. It was easier in the earlier sherlock games because you always had other things to do which took your mind off from the dialogues (like finding a way to somehwere and puzzling, etc.). The lack of puzzles really disturbed me in this game and I missed the ability to pick things up, combining it with something and/or use it for something. The more it gets to the end the more boring it gets because you always do the same. Another annoying thing is how easy the game is. Sherlock basically tells you all the time what to do and how to do it. There is no room for trying different things, get stuck somewhere and find a way yourself. Everything is pretty clear. A little bit like a telltale game. So, I clearly prefer the ""old style"" of the series and wouldn't recommend this one to people who have difficulties concentrating for a longer time. But because it takes you into a beautifully created world in which you get easily absorbed I still give a thumbs up.			"

												An excellent adventure game. Each case is interesting, and the deduction system is really fun to use and play around with. The gameplay of searching around for clues does fall short in that you just need to walk up and interact with every interactable entity that you come across to gather all the evidence you need (which you'll know when every clickable thing has a green icon over it), but I enjoy the fun of the process. I look forward to the upcoming sequel a lot; six cases is a fair amount, but there's limited replayability so once you're done you probably won't get the same enjoyment from playing the same cases again unless you wait a year or so to play again.

												This is perhaps the only video game out there where you actually solve cases in your head as opposed to being told you solved it through the games' narrative. It allows for you to condemn the wrong suspect, making you feel like your choices do matter in a video game for once. There are obvious problems with it, like every other Frogwares game ever made. But, this is without question their best game to date, and probably the best detective game I've ever played.			"

												Probably the closest experience you can get to a Sherlock Holmes novel. For those who don't know the serie it is like a third person 3d point and click with conversasions, some very light puzzles and deduction. Don't expect hardcore 90s point and click puzzles tough; whilst not at the walking dead level it has more an emphasis on the story, which personally suits me better. This seems to have been a late change in the gameplay as bits of mini games gameplay with time based response or choices are still there but frustrating consequences look like they have been removed to get a more fluid experience.    The game is split in several stories which are the size of a Sherlock Holmes novel, maybe an hour or two each. A very good format for spending an evening on a story or two. The novels are inspired by actual novels. I don't know if it is the case for all but I had personally already red 2 or 3 of them a while ago, which somehow spoiled a bit the story. If not technically stunning compared to a AAA, the game leverages on a few effects unreal engine. Maps are small (and sometimes even unoptimised on a GTx970). The artistic direction really deserves to be noted with some gorgeous textures and moody lightning. It is really good at setting the atmosphere ""as if you were in the book"". The main menu animation simply sets the feeling.If you like a good Sherlock Holmes story in a gorgeous poised Conan Doyle atmosphere, go for it. I'm personally forward to what the studio can do with the Call Of Cthulhu license.			"

												I was worried I had overrated the game myself when I bought it on only a small discount, since I enjoy detective genre so much. Did enjoy the * hearts * out of this game. You play Sherlock Holmes in 1st or 3rd person depending on what you pick (can be changed with the push of a button). The full story has 6 cases, each independent. So independent the game deleted your save files when you move onto the next case. This is really only a problem if you missed some achievement on your first playthrough. I thought the game would have a clear answer to every case, but not so. You have to guesstimate from the clues you're found. You can then make a conclusion out of several possible clue-paths you want to go with. You -can- check if you're gone with the correct solution if you really need to and want the achievement for getting all right.There's also a moral-meter depending on if you want to condemn or absolve the murderer. Either way does not seem to matter for the game experience other than that the condemned/absolved person will write you a letter.You also have the option to not play a case through completely, just conclude with a few clues to end the case quickly, if you for some reason should choose to do so.Graphics are pretty decent, the environment looks amazing and the people look realistic enough to look like wax-figures, sound and music are decent and I liked all the voice actors for their roles. A few nuisances with ""GTFO MY WAY, WATSON"" as he's mostly always following you and if you walk in somewhere and re-decide and want out, Watson will be there blocking your way. If you run into him he will look surprised for a second, then slowly take one step back and you'll have to run into him again for another step back until you can move out. Luckily most areas where this might happen have two exits so you'll never be completely stuck, but the other exit will probably not be a shortcut. Achievement are easy to 100% though it might take you more than one playthrough unless you really tryhard with an achievement guide as you play.Replay value is low, though it does exist should you want to come to another conclusion to a case, because you need the achievements, or you want to♥♥♥♥♥♥off some suspects or Mycroft and read their letters afterwards.Important: HOLD SHIFT TO RUN. Took me too long to realize. Control maps are for noobs.			"

												The latest from Frogwares' Sherlock Holmes series really raises the bar on the most famous detective in history.  Sherlock Holmes is back with six cases of varying lengths and complexity that are sure to tingle some neurons in people's brains in an all-new absolutely fantastic continuation of this particular game series.  With all-new recently-inspired gameplay ideas that add an even deeper level of intrigue, any fan of Sherlock would hate to miss this.As the brain of Baker Street himself, you must solve six cases all of which are unrelated and just another field day's work for Holmes from odd puzzles to figuring out people.  Whilst the puzzles are still tricky but much more well-designed on a level akin to Testaments' work, the forensic aspect of the game has jumped HUGELY in quality.Holmes can now gather clues from various places and even return back to original places to compare some new clues with old findings ranging from footprints in the mud to wheel tracks in the loch beach.  The game takes very clearly a lot of inspiration from LA Noire in terms of studying and investigating things which certainly works for its favour, allowing you to compile a bunch of clues in order to come to one of many conclusions.All six cases have several conclusions you can reach and judge for yourself on who the real killer is.  But only one conclusion is actually right and the game does allow you to either be confident in your conclusion, or actually tell you after everything's said and done if you made a mistake and would like to try again for a different conclusion.  It's surprisingly forgiving that way but also allowing you to come to your own sense of judgement.Another wonderful thing of the game is the new Sherlock Scan ability as I have unofficially named it stealing off from TV Tropes.  Taking blatant inspiration from the recent BBC series of Sherlock, you can now scan potential suspects of particular abnormalities that they exhibit allowing you to compile a portrait of them so you can gleam more information out of them.  This is fantastic and frankly the best thing in the entire game for true Holmesian fans.So let me just rundown the pile on the good and bad of the game.= Pros* First of all, the graphics look absolutely wonderful and well-nourished with a much better design on characters for a reason that will come up later.  Holmes looks less ""Sheldon Cooper"" than he did in Testaments and is a lot more elegantly handsome of a more true descript to the original design from the stories.  The environments are incredibly lush for Victorian London with much better lighting work than even the previous game.* The gameplay is absolutely fantastic, completely rehauled to be quite different from Testaments but in a much more involving manner, giving you the feeling that you are doing just as much as YOU want to investigate.  You want to actually scan people, do so!  You want to bother going back to the crime scene to compare notes, go ahead!  There's very little the game actually forces you to do and in the end all that is driving you is your own sense of curiosity.  You can even finish the case quite shoddily without finding everything and still come to a conclusion (that may not be right) but the fact it has the freedom to let you, is quite impressive.* Puzzle skipping returns for those who are too taxed by some of the puzzles, but for me I never had a problem with any of them and I daresay they are better designed than even Testaments' ones were.= Cons* Unfortunately, despite the wonderful presentation of the game, none of the music is actually made for the game itself and has been taken largely from a free library courtesy of Kevin MacLeod.  Not that the music is any BAD, it's actually quite good and very fitting but the fact there is no real original music for the game just sours me a tiny bit as an enthusiast of videogame music.  But that is just a tiny smidge against the work of this game and really only something to nitpick.* The real problem I have with the game is the fact there is no overarching storyline.  All of the cases are individual and while they themselves are still interesting by themselves, there is not the same sort of interesting drive as the other games did when it was all one big case.  I speak only of this because, without going into too much detail, the PRETENCE of an overarching storyline is most egregious when it comes towards an ending.  And there is one, but it seems very out-of-nowhere and unrelated and not even really trying to connect to anything.  Which just makes me shrug wearily.Regardless of this, you should definitely buy this game if you appreciate Sherlock Holmes.  It's smooth, it's funny, it's incredibly deep in its gameplay possibility, there are a lot of outcomes you can take very easily, the puzzles are fantastic, the voicework is definitely a lot better than previous works and overall they just really keep raising up the bar as I said.  See for yourself what conclusions you come to, you won't regret it.			"

												i just finish the game before writing this review, finished 11 hours with 80% achievement[spoiler alert....probably]i love it, theres lot of improvement they made from previous game, The Testament of Sherlock Holmes, especially on graphics, voice acting and character=graphics=the graphics impressive, they did a really good job here, they not only improving the model, texture and lighting, but also animation, now the animation much more smooth and natural, level design really good, especially on manor and on cult's ruins=voice acting=voice acting now more believable,  each character sgot its own personality, and the voice actor did a really great job to present it=gameplay=typical sherlock games, point and click and puzzle, some old feature like timeline and crime scene reconstruction (with dfferent format) are bring back here, they not freely accessible unfortunately, only on some cases, but still it give some variation on the gameplaythe puzzles here are too simple and too easy in my opinion, its not ruin the game of course, but it'll be nice if they put some more challanging puzzles, at least to make the player really thinking to solve itthe game design unfortunately not open world (i use open world here loosely), you can't walking around whitechapel area like the previous, its shame, i love to see street of london in this time with this kind of graphics.=Story=the story fold quite nicely in each case, theres 6 cases which as far as i aware not connected at all with each other, although....like the testament of sherlock holmes, the ending case here quite meh, very to the point, easily predictable, and end with a case that we not even touch at all on the entire game, its just dissapointing= Additional bad things =this game suffers from lot and long loading screens, with this kind of game, you will do lot of back tracking, and loading screen here is the worse, and its only me, i googled and found lot of people suffers with the same problemthe dev smart enough to compensate the player from waiting for the loading with a scene where sherlock and watson inside a cab, while player wait, player can open deduction board, or open notebook, nice idea, but if they can make the loading faster with only a static picture it'll be much better= Additional rant =for some reason, i don't feel like the ""brain cell/cell"" deduction board for sherlock suit him, regular notebook or paper+thread probably more suitable, but if Frogwares make Hercule Poirot game, the ""brain cell/cell"" deduction board will suit him perfectly, as Poirot famous for his ""grey cells""= Verdict=The final verdict is *drums roll* solid 8/10i love it despite of some problem it has, and i am highly reccomend this for everybody, i really can't wait for its next sequel, even though some people said this game suffers from copy/paste practice, well....thats what always occur on game with many sequelshopefully frogwares will made a worthy sequel with a new story, new puzzles, and more improvement			"

												And so finally, developer Frogwares achieve what they set out to do; make a kickass adventure game about Sherlock Holmes. It has taken many attempts, and though a few - such as 2004’s ‘The Case of the Silver Earring’ and the most recent iteration; ‘The Testament of Sherlock Holmes’ - weren’t terrible by any means, they still fell for a lot of antiquated adventure game trappings. They were awfully slow paced and the puzzles just felt obtuse and drawn out. Well, that is in the past. With the oddly (yet aptly) titled ‘Crimes And Punishments’’, Frogwares truly outdo themselves. It’s akin to Testament in that it’s not a straight up point & click game, but more of a third person adventure game with point & click mechanics. But where Testament felt stiff and unwieldy, Crimes is anything but. The gameplay is fluid and the pacing is much more efficient. You’ll be exploring a lot of environments, studying a lot of items up close and reading a lot of faces to find people’s dirty little secrets - so it’s good that Frogwares are one step ahead for once. The visual fidelity is impeccable, and few adventure games can profess to look better. Sure, you’ll find the rare oversight and texture pop-in here and there, but it’s still a beautiful game, and the locations you visit are all distinctly different. You will, of course, be doing a lot of the same work in all of them, but the puzzle-variety is actually quite decent too.I think I can safely attest that this is just about the best Sherlock Holmes game made to this day. Does that mean it’s perfect though? Sadly, no. For a game that focuses on the incredibly perceptive Sherlock Holmes of all people, a person who can figure out your entire lineage by glancing at a scar on your nose, Crimes feels way too easy. You’ll rarely find yourself even remotely stuck with a puzzle. Games can cater to new players and  veterans alike. But too often, it feels like Crimes completely forgets about the latter group. Take the special vision mode you can enter by pressing T, for instance. It’s okay that new players have this to more easily spot clues in the terrain that they might’ve missed, but it becomes a problem when you’re forced to activate it in order to spot certain clues that are otherwise invisible. I want to explore! Not press a button and let the game do all the work! In closing, I think Crimes And Punishments is a game about giving you the feeling of being the genius detective Sherlock Holmes - and it does so quite well for the most part, being a very faithful gamification of sir Conan Doyle’s literature. But if you were anticipating a game that would challenge your mind to reach the levels of the master detective himself, then you’ll find yourself disappointed. Even so, there is still more than sufficient amounts of fun to be had, pretending to be mr. Holmes for the 10-12 hours it’ll take you to complete all the cases. Even if he’d scoff at the amount of hand-holding and the lack of challenge found within, had he played the game himself.4/5			"

												The definative Sherlock Holmes experiance that has similarities to LA Noire though not as black and white and not as easy to guess the culprit.Playing as Holmes you must explore crimes scenes, talk to witnesses, use your keen eye to notice small details in people and the environment, and finally put it all together in a deduction mind game where you link the the facts and make an accusation.Not one crime is black and white and every crime has many suspects and modus operandi.One of the more harder cases has 3 prime suspects and 2 similar weapons but the different weapons change the way the crime went down drastically.I highly recommend this game to fans of Sherlock Holmes, adventure games and games that make you think heavily about decisions.

""Here is the case that...didn't end as i was expecting..""This game is amazing!The story was really good and voice actors were really good!I think the sherlock voice actor suited for his role really well, and liked his voice as sherlock!I also like a lot of the Morale System what game has, like do i really have found all the clues?Is this the right person, is this the killer?And that do i arrest the suspect or do I give suspect on go free?It was always hard but it was rewarding.This game has lots and lots of puzzles, some of themn are really hard to undestand.Luckily game makers have put the skip option for it, which dont give you penalty for doing it(this will take the frustration element away)and yes game is slowpace, keep that mind.But still!I recomend this game to all!

												A really polished and fun Sherlock experience, probably the best in the series. The cases are episodic, like little short stories. This makes for new and interesting plot elements and characters throughout the game. Some of these locations really stand out, like the Roman Baths and Kew Gardens.Graphically, it's leagues above the Sherlock games that came before. The voice acting is quite good, and the character models are really quite nice; I only wish more time was put into the facial animation.The 'detecting' component is probably easier than the previous games, which is too bad. Finding clues tends to be fairly easy, and I had no trouble finding every clue for every case. Harder is putting the clues together to form a coherent theory. On at least two occassions, I accused the wrong person or deduced an incorrect method. You can choose how to punish (or not) the people involved in each case, though this has no bearing on the overall story arc.The puzzles are somewhat hit or miss. I didn't have to skip any, which suggests that they may be easier than previous games. At least one puzzle involving test tubes was overly frustrating, however. A lockpicking puzzle is reused multiple times, which begins to lose its appeal.I would recommend this game to Sherlock fans, and for those interested in a story-heavy, slower-paced, adventure game.

												This game is doing a great job at story telling. Every case feels unique and offers interesting and well-written dialogues and deduction phases. The character design and overall graphics are amazing. I really hope the creators will release a bunch of DLCs in the near future, so we can continue our investigations beyond the 10 hours of the original game in the Victorian London and the surrounding areas.

												Sherlock Holmes Crimes & Punishments is a solid adventure game that offers a compelling experience thanks to its freedom of movement and perfectly tuned interface. Holmes is a likeable character although somewhat predictable in that he never truly gets stumped simply because the game does a fair bit of hand holding along the way. That said, if you’ve never been interested in point and click adventures then this format is certainly much more agreeable and therefore makes for a good distraction from your normal haunts. For the asking price, the game might feel a bit lacking if you’re a one play gamer, but for those who want to see and do everything then there’s an agreeable number of hours worth on offer.Score 8/10 – Review by Robert Cram

												I bought this on sale, because I love Sherlock Holmes, and solving mysteries.This game is great in that sense. It's a lot of fun to play, and dig into the cases.I do not recommend this game because:1) It lacks even the most rudimentary regular save system, and instead relies on checkpoints2) It does not inform you if you have reached a checkpoint, so you have no idea how far you have to go back if you need to quit to go do something else3) It frequently deletes your checkpoint saves, requiring you to repeat whole cases over and over.I had to repeat most of case 1 (starting over) due to failure of the checkpoint system.After solving case 1, I went to the main menu and had a ""continue"" option now, to start case 2, which was great. I figured my progress was saved, so I exited the game. When I opened it up 3 days later, my save had been deleted, and I could only start a new game. So now I have a three-way choice - 1) play case 1 for a third time, and hope it somehow remembers my progress when I close the program2) play the game entirely through in one sitting so their failed save mechanic doesn't keep me from finishing it3) give up until the developers figure out how to institute a save mechanic.Checkpoint save systems don't work unless there are frequent checkpoints, you know when you've reached one, and the game actually stores your checkpoint progress in a way that can later be retrieved. This game fails with both of these criteria.			"

Nonexistent, I couldn't find any at all, absolutely polished.I honestly feel this is worth a try, and I'm one of those people that just says their opinion about it and leaves it or the reader to decide, unless it's a bad game then stay from it at all costs.

												I bought this game along with the previous Sherlock games, A Testament to Sherlock Holmes. I really enjoyed the last game, and this game is more of the same but much more beautiful. The scenes in this game are magnificently beautiful, the people look lifelike and the shadows and lighting are goregous. The compromise to this is the excessive loading times. This can be a annoying when you only need to visit a scene for 1 clue, which may take but a few seconds, and then it loads for a couple of mins to get there. The game is difficult but there doesnt seem like a way to truly mess up. You are always guided by Holmes and Watson. I would like more of a sense of failure, which may alter the play of the game. However, this doesnt change the enjoyment of the game. I would really recommend this game to people who enjoy a good mystery, but do check out the previous game too.			"

4/10 - eh...I've played and enjoyed most of the past Sherlock titles.  Testament was the best of these, atmospheric and tense, engaging puzzles, good characters.  Crimes and Punishments is none of those things.  This game is a series of mystery mini-games to solve little drama pieces that aren't really interesting, nor do they do much for any characterization.  The new featurues added to this title in the series are not new at all, either.  The facial ticks for truth vs. lies is lifted straight off of L.A. Noire.  The head-to-toe scan of interviewees is not interactive and is just a linear point A to point B checklist to reach a cutscene.  Lastly the Watson character was nothing more than a one-liner side show, not an integral part of the story like in the other games.Many other reviewers have commented on nice graphics.  I have to assume that these are reports from Nvidia equipped machines, especially given the prominent PhysX ad in the introduction of the game...but my R9 290 equipped machine gave different results.  There was screen tearing.  Not in the conventional vertical sync fashion, but horizontal screen tearing.  How does that even happen?  Anti-aliasing had jaggies everywhere on character and environment shadows.  Building textures were not as crisp as in Testament.  And finally, possibly most importantly, the loading screens were excessive and even the animations in them were choppy.  My machine generally performs well, even when faced with high demand games.  Without stating conclusions, that result did not happen with this game.			"

												First Impression/ First Case: Long load screens. Load screens for load screens. Load screen just to get to the main menu. Otherwise the game's a really good playing experience with a top-notch moral choice system that has no right or wrong answer, that will bug the hell out of you till you finally pick someone to charge with the crime, and that you hope the choice is sound and doesn't come to bite you in the♥♥♥♥♥later. Great for replayability provided you don't click the option that tells you the ""correct"" answer because, well, what fun is that?EDIT Final Impression: It is old fashion adventure game fun, playing Sherlock and figuring out who committed a crime.The carriage scene load screens take up too much time spent in the game and take away from the experience. The moral choice system doesn't affect much except a letter or refernece later on in the game suggesting you choose correctly or inncorrectly. Replayability isn't a must except to gain some achievement stat you missed or see a different ending, which doesn't matter since each case is different and there is no thread connecting them all......Which is fine. Each case is it's own experience, it's own adventure, like the original stories. I applaud the creators for writing and designing such stories that mimic the feel of a true Sherlock adventure, despite the flaws in execution.7/10			"

												This game reminds me of why I spent hours playing Nancy Drew games when I was younger. I love mystery type games where you have to search for clues but this game is a bit more than that. You get to make choices and moral decisions with different possible outcomes. There's not a set path that eventually leads you to one conclusion. It's possible to reach multiple conclusions and find different characters guilty. You have to choose whether you will condemn or absolve them and that has its own outcomes too. It is possible to reach a wrong conclusion! Also, you can reach the correct conclusion but mess up during a mini-game at the end and not receive your acheivement. (You can replay the endings though.)The scenery is pretty awesome and I especially love the atmosphere in some of the places. The Blood Bath case is my favorite so far with all the different places to explore and clues to find. There are a few somewhat creepy-feeling places in this case too which I love. :)My only complaint is that there are long loading screens and lots of them. There is a black loading screen before you get to the carriage loading scene. A loading screen for a loading screen is a little frustrating. But at least during the carriage loading screen you can open up your casebook or check deductions so it's not too bad.Overall I would defintiely recommend Crimes and Punishments, especially if you are a Sherlock fan, and I'm definitely going to be checking out the other Sherlock games after I finish this one.

												Captures the feel of being the most known fictional detectives in history and lets you feel like you are investigating, deducing and solving a series of crimes with style and finess. Interesting, fun, sometimes challenging in areas and even though it is not perfect, Crimes and Punishment is a good puzzle/detective game.:Spoiler alert:If you like the sound of this so far and plan to buy it, do NOT read the next bit as it contains spoilers which may spoil your enjoyment completely. What I would say is never check your results until the very end of the game.Spoiler:The crimes do not have an incorrect answer. Each possibility is 'correct' as if you pick it, even if the game decides it is not the 'true' correct answer, the accused culprit admits everything, the evidence all checks out and everything plays out as if you were correct... all except for that small note if you check your decision which says ""oops, this wasn't the TRUE correct answer, but good job anyway"". This kinda spoils it for me and I stopped playing once I had one of these messages. If the game said ""whoops! You had a good theory, but it was wrong and some things didn't quite check out which affected Sherlocks reputation and therefore your end score""... THAT would be acceptable. Villains admitting doing things that the game says is wrong just makes it feel like it's trying to make you win regardless of what you do, which turns this into a rail-puzzler. Solve the pre-set puzzles, pick whichever answer you like and BAM! Job done.Overall, good. Recommended for anyone who will never check their score until the end or someone who loves this kind of game! :D			"

												They really need to remove all these silly minigames and add something of value instead. And I do hope they've cut down on loading times between the scenes in the sequel. Otherwise, it's a good Holmes game, if you've ready to forgive a couple of inconsistencies in the evidence, like ""The cylinder recorded by Miss White appears to be quite lengthy, thereby proving that she remained in her laboratory on the day of the crime."" in the Kew Gardens case..

I heard this was the best one yet, so I wanted to make sure I'd like it.  I will probably backtrack and play some of the previous games, hoping they are at least similar to this one.

												Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishment is the latest chapter of Sherlock Holmes Games from Frogware, and they are slowly perfecting the formula and seems they are closer than ever. Playing as Sherlock Holmes, you will tackle six different cases, some from the classic Sir Arthur Conan Doyle stories, others written fresh for the game. What makes this game unique from the previous iterations is the ability to accuse the WRONG person... and make it stick. You see, in every case there are multiple suspects, and if you did your investigation wrong the evidence may lead you the wrong way. However, you are the great Sherlock Holmes, so nobody will question your decision... except yourself. And even after you have made the accusation, you can decide to either throw the book at the perp (to the gallows!)... or intervene and help him (or her) with the law to ensure the outcome ""for the best of all involved"". You will travel back and forth amongst several locations, usually your Baker St residence, Scotland Yard, then various leads and scene of crime and such, and there are often things to do at each, as you examine things that needs to be examined, and perhaps do a few things to ""open up"" further avenues of investigation, and perhaps interrogate suspects for further leads after you uncover a few... contradictions. The interface is optimized much from previous iterations. Research is now a matter of going back to Baker St. and access the archives, which are composed of various old newspapers, encyclopedia entries, and Holmes' own missives, i.e. multiple choice. To travel to a location you merely bring up case book / location, then click on a location. To run tests on a piece of evidence, you go to Baker st and play with Holmes' exam table.  Interrogation, evidence, and autopsy are now concentrated at Scotland Yard, as is Lestrade's office. There are a lot of mini-games now including the puzzles. Most ""locks"" now require the ""concentric cylinders to line-up"" puzzle where you can rotate individual cylinders but you can't see all of them or some may be ""joined"" or ""separated"" at higher difficulty levels. There are other games including a ""climbing"" game where you need to quick click, then press A or D as prompted. There were a ""skeet shoot"" where you need to shoot someone before they shoot you. There is also a rope bridge segment (don't fall off as you try to negotiate this windy rope bridge) and more. All in all there are over 45 different minigames, and there are achievements for doing all of them. Good thing is they don't require too much reflexes, merely some ""timing"", but some of those can get quite annoying as they are not that forgiving. The game borrowed liberally from all the previous iterations as well as from TV series, and other games. For example, there is now a ""SherlockVision"" mode where you can see things other people can't see, with words that pop up that shows your observations and deductions just like the BBC Sherlock series. There's also a ""hypothesis / re-enactment"" mode where you try to virtually piece together a sequence of events that may account for some actions of witnesses or suspects. Each suspect or witness you encounter also gets a mini-game where you try to observe him or her about details which lets you deduce background. Ring means married. Expensive but patched cloths means formerly rich, now poor. Brooch of certain design suggests immigrant from out of the country, and so on.  You need to make all observations to ""pass"" the minigame, and they weren't always obvious. What's best, ALL minigames can be skipped, if you failed too many times. You simply don't get the ""did not skip"" achievement. The time travelling between locations can be used to review your casebook and/or make deductions using your virtual deduction board, which now resembles neurons connecting in your brain, leading to further conclusions or such, and that really makes you FEEL that loading time is a lot less. Graphics are good, with only occasional texture oops. All the characters are very detailed. Frogware chose to model the Sherlock Holmes and Watson after the Jeremy Brett version. On the other hand they had to tweak the characters a bit to make sure they don't TOO closely resemble the actors in the 1960's Sherlock Holmes TV series. Voice acting is excellent, as they all sound authentic British to this untrained ear. The only problem I feel can detract from the game is the game sometimes hid the clues a little too well, and if you miss those clues you will end up with NOWHERE to search or continue!  For example, in the missing train case, there are some hidden documents that I never found in a particular station, which would not have shown up UNLESS I engage SherlockVision. As a result, I missed 2 clues out of 24.  In another example, I was completed stuck in The case in the garden also had a moment where I missed a clue, which got me stuck completely, as I literally had NOTHING else to investigate, and I was going nuts trying to figure out what I missed, and again, I missed a section of SherlockVision in an office.  So if you have problems, you may want to check every room and see if you need to engage Sherlock Vision (T key), and if it says you should, you're clearly missing something there. Some of the cases are pretty straightforward, and even followed the stories much. Others are more interesting as you don't know what to expect, as there are many red herrings. However, my favorite would have to be the final case, which involved not just one but TWO moral choices, and let's just say, your ""instinct"" will be severely put to the test. All in all, this game is great, as you do have to make decisions based on the clues you gathered, and if you made the wrong choice, well, you'll have to live with it. Enjoy this great little puzzle adventure game. You should love it.  "

												Developer Frogwares alongside publisher Focus Home Interactive have pushed out the latest game in the Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes series. This latest entry, titled Sherlock Holmes: Crimes & Punishments, has launched on almost all non-Nintendo platforms including PC, PS3, PS4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One. Crimes & Punishments is Sherlock’s first appearance on our new current gen systems, and what an awesome experience it is.Crimes & Punishments plays out over the course of six different cases. Each case will take roughly two to three hours to complete and are each unique in their own way. The cases can range from solving murders to uncovering thefts to investigating burglaries. You are Sherlock Holmes: the greatest detective around. Crimes & Punishments places you in charge of uncovering all of the clues, using the clues to create deductions, and eventually using the deductions to solve your case. The gameplay is played out in a way very similar to that of L.A. Noire. Though Crimes & Punishments isn’t quite as open world as L.A. Noire was, it’s still open, enabling you to freely roam any of the available locations for that case. You’re free to look around for clues, talk with people and interact with items scattered about all to help uncover new information. This formula is one that really succeeds. In Crimes & Punishments all locations are well designed and fun to explore, and while most clues are in plain sight, it’s still quite nice running through such different locations on the hunt to finding some clues. Occasionally you will even get to switch out from playing as Holmes and get to enjoy playing as Dr. Watson, and even their dog, Toby. Dr. Watson may not have actually changed gameplay much, but it was always nice to find clues while following scent trails as a dog.Crimes & Punishments is also filled with plenty of mini games and puzzles. From cracking into a safe, or lock picking a door, to building molds, to doing chemistry there are mini games all over. Most are relatively simple to solve, though I did often encounter an issue. When connecting lines, in uncovering an image or picking a door lock, the lines would need to line up perfectly. If the lines weren’t perfectly straight the game would not set through as completed. This can get very frustrating at times, but the developers had a fix right there. If you’re stuck on a puzzle or simply don’t want to bother doing it you can press a skip button which will automatically do the puzzle for you. This feature was a life saver because when a puzzle got too frustrating I’d have the ability to just say “screw it” and move on with the case.Crimes & Punishments is also an incredibly beautiful game, and one that really feels like it belongs on the current gen platforms. All characters look incredible and are given amazing little details like light bruising, scratches and other unique traits. Obviously these are helpful in learning about people in the actual case, but in a sense the differentiations and great design of each character is a real accomplishment. They not only look amazing but they truly feel different. The characters are not alone in their beauty though. The environments are all very well designed and are absolutely gorgeous. The vast detailing that went into each location stands out and the environments cannot help but feel like real life locations, either currently lived in or abandoned.It seems to be the small things that really make the game work. From small details on the skin of the character to smaller more unknown features. Crimes & Punishments gives the user the ability to switch between first and third person modes whenever they want to. Additionally, a user can use a sixth sense type mode in which certain locations, or during certain events, should the player activate it they can play out what happened, helping to put clues together. At the end of a case, once you’ve uncover the truth, you are also given the ability to make a moral choice of how to handle the situation. Turn someone in to the police, knowing they will be hanged, or was their crime not that bad and let them off the hook? The choice is yours and it actually adds a lot to the experience.Overall, I went in to Sherlock Holmes: Crimes & Punishments with very low expectations, and I was extremely surprised. Crimes & Punishments is a very good looking game, and a very fun playing game. It’s really a case of all the care and small details its developer put in working together to create an amazing experience that players will enjoy and will end up finishing the game only to want more.9/10PROS• Beautiful Graphics• Fun and rewarding game play• Various types of cases• Entertaining mini games give an option to skip them should you not be able to completeCONS• Police and Dr. Watson often come across unreasonably stupid or get in the way "

												This game is not only great because of its interesting gameplay, but also for the simple reason of Sherlock's and Watson's comments and dialogue. I'm no adventure fan by any means, but the devs hav put so much effort into detail that even I dig it. Definite recommendation!Also, make sure to set ""-dx9"" as launch command or else you'll have horribly long loading times. And I own an SSD.  "

												Great game.  It isnt as difficult as you would think a Sherlock Holmes game would be.  Having owned the previous one, this one is a nice improvement.  Its full of mini games and quick time events throughout the cases to change things up a bit and keep it entertaining.  Theres nice little prompts that will help you know when you have found all the clues you are looking for, or if you still need to find 1 or 2 more, which is great so you are not standing around for an hour trying to figure out if you still need to find something or not.  Watson is a lot more usefull than previously lol, And as always theres a nice variety of Victorian Era scenery and a variety of people to talk to.			"

												Great sequel to the series! A few thoughts:+ several smaller cases (rather than one big one like in the previous titles) add a lot of variety+ great visuals, from the staging of crime scenes to details to the environment+ improved interface and deduction system+ possibility to solve the case in different ways (wrong) and adding a moral choice- excessive use of fades and loading areas- would have liked to decide on the moral choices after hearing out the suspect- clues and deductions feel spoon-fed at times (e.g. no need to show where to use concentration skills)Overall I was glad to notice the attention to detail and improvements the devs went for. I hope they continue the series and look forward to more cases in this format (DLCs would fit very well here).			"

												I really enjoyed 'Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments'. While the acting and the writing may be seem a bit dry at first, the characters and the cheesy 'funny' moments do grow on you over time. The game also looks really good, with very detailed environments and characters.The gameplay feels more like a CSI show where you talk to people and look for clues, and the game (usually via Holmes' expositions) will tell you what to do, or explain what was really happening the entire time. It's really hard to make the player feel like they solved the game through their own wits, and this game like many others falls short in that regard, but I still enjoyed the procedural gameplay, the quirky cases, and the colourful characters.

												Crimes and Punishments is simpler than previous games in the series when it comes to puzzles. It   makes sure the player never forgets anything and is always able to keep track if something is missing, which makes things a bit too easy. Nevertheless, i found the experience very enjoyable. The deduction system is the best it's ever been and the cases are, overall, fairly interesting. The game is looking great and the mechanics hold no mystery, everything is intuitive.Something a bit annoying are the loadings. There's plenty of them and they aren't that fast. While it isn't a major complaint, it's a nuisance.As game the progresses on a case-by-case basis it leaves room for expansions containing more and i really hope Frogwares is thinking about it. I could play some more cases!So, if you are a fan of the series you will probably enjoy more Sherlock Holmes. If you are new to the series, this instalment is the most beginner friendly and might pull people to the series. For me, it's recommended.			"

												Comparing Crimes & Punishment to Testament of Sherlock Holmes:As there are enough reviews going into gameplay details I will present a short overview in comparing the two games.Testament has the more complex and interesting puzzles and an enthralling dramatic plot. Controls are sometimes clunky and not as smooth and well impemented as in C&P. Same goes with graphics. Deduction system: In Testament there is one way to put the clues together. In C&P some criticize that you can evaluate the hints to deduct different solutions without making it clear which solution leads to the real bad guy. You can easily arrest the wrong one. I see that as a strenght of the game as it depicts analytic thinking and its various traps. You do your job and as in every job mistakes can happen and you have to live with that.  Ok there is a problem. Everyone arrested confesses, that is a weak point in the game I can accept. The unjustified accused should say so in the end.Crimes is a little too easy to play but has fantastic flow in gameplay and exceptional architectural  leveldesign. It depictures 19th century London just beautiful. Playing C&P is like a wonderful effortless walk in the garden. It may be the best adventure of all time in terms of gameflow. Testament is more of a gritty dungeon crawling experience and with some puzzles you really get mad at the game, can`t stop thinking about it, coming back an hour or day later solving it and go on and on. In this regard Testament is true to the classic 90`s adventure era. In the end I`d say Crimes is the more complete  adventure where all elements form an  addictive connection that transcends into an alltime top 5 adventure. I don`t like the whole narrative with these ugly children in Testament. It kind of ruins the immersion sometimes. Without them it would be better, but even with these little brats Testament greatly succeeds in storytelling and puzzle implementation.Both are top of the line adventures. If you just finished Crimes you will need maybe 1h to adapt to Testament because it has a very distinct feel to itself, you have to work more to enjoy it. I loved it so much that I finished a second playthrough and got all trophies just because it is that good. I normally don`t do that.  If you start with C&P, well just walk through the looking-glass and get captivated in this  unique beguiling experience . Nothing else to say. It is that good.			"

A well-executed and immersive deduction game that belongs in your library.MY RATING | 5 out of 5WORTH THE FULL PRICE? | Yes, but I would recommend getting it on a discount to offset the lack of replayability.----------------------------------------------------------------------Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments is an absolutely beautiful strategy game where the player's choices ACTUALLY matter. It is simply a must-have for any strategy game junkie.What It Does Well: Engaging cases to work on Strikes a balance between casual gameplay and a challenging experience Mechanics that ""just feel right"" BEAUTIFUL graphics that allow for true immersion Just enough ambiguity on who committed the crime to keep you engaged Player's choices ACTUALLY matter Maintains the game's momentumWhat I loved most about Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments (SHCP) is that it is everything that I want in a deducation game: interesting work, a bit of a challenge, a beautiful experience, and the feeling that the game isn't trying to force-feed you the right answer. The cases that you work on are distinct and memorable; there are no two cases that share similarities. As you work through the cases, SHCP offers just the right amount of hand-holding to keep the momentum and to really allow the player to feel like Sherlock Holmes. If you were to constantly be getting stuck, it would be easy to fall out of character. Finally, the true hallmark of a great deducation game was the fact that I felt compelled on multiple cases to hold off on accussing someone because I wanted to go revisit the locations, the evidence, and the documents. THAT'S what I want in a game like this an SHCP delivered.Something SHCP uniquely provides is the opportunity for the player to make a wrong accusation and the game continues on. There's no ""game going back in time"" so you can't fix it, or even the game preventing you from making that decision. You are ALLOWED to make mistakes and it will not penalize you for it. This really allows it to feel as close to reality as possible.----------------------------------------------------------------------Where It Lacked: Replayability Disjointed ""story line"" that connected each case Missed OpportunitiesAlthough I'm a huge fan of this game, there were some aspects that could have been better. Replayability for this type of game is unlikely- it's just the genre. However, I figured I would call it out for the buyers who may take this into consideration when buying. In SHCP, there is a very small story line that connects each case. It is so small that I actually forgot about it until the end. It seemed like an after-thought and could have probably been left out. Finally, there was one large missed opportunity to make the game even better. There is a mechanic to call out inconsistencies during conversation which is a real treat. However, if someone says something questionable the game makes it very obvious by slowing down time so Sherlock can speak up. I wish that wasn't the case. The small bits of information you gain from those integral parts should only be award to the people who noticed the lie (just like real life!)			"

												A fun and interesting experience so far. Good characters, beautiful locations, and unique story lines make this a must for any fan or the genre. Although, as a fan of all the Sherlock Holmes games I do find Crimes and Punishments to be ridiculously easy. I remember Nemesis being a real challenge and this was what got me hooked on the releases to follow. This current title feels more like the game model employed by Telltale in ""The Walking Dead"". That is, supplementing any challenge with rolling story. It is still a good experience, but their lacks a ""sense of achievement"" which you would recieve with the other titles. Another problem I have with this latest installment is that of travel. You frequently visit locations, do one thing, and then travel back to a previously visited location via horse and cart. There can be times when you're literally staring at a loading screen 80% of the time, to spend 1 minute at a location before moving on to another. This is the biggest problem with the game in my opinion as it reminds me of surfing the web on a 56k connection in order to read one sentence from various websites. I miss how Sherlock Holmes vs Jack the Ripper had you walking around albeit a small part of London and how there was no ""press t to find everything"" mode (That cannot be disabled)Overall a good game but not without its frustrations 7/10.

												A very good game, and I'm glad I got it. The facial textures and expressions are nothing short of absolutely astounding. Who ever worked on that, good job. The puzzles aren't too difficult, and the ""lockpicking"" is a bit repetitive, but the game makes up for that in the moral choices and the reasoning you have to use to make a final decision as to who committed a crime.Despite all the evidence you collect, at the end of many cases you can still be left scratching your head as to who committed the crime. This is pretty awesome because I had to review all the evidence I collected, and really take into consideration details that on the outside might seem trivial. These very small details made all the difference. In this sense, the game is very true to the Sherlock Holmes experience you would expect.I do have one gripe though, and it is a very small one. The outfits that you can wear are almost always locked. I honestly would have liked to have worn the unbuttoned shirt and scruffy facial hair to look a bit more like Dr. House. I was actually hoping that once I beat the game all of the outfits would be unlocked, but sadly that didn't happen.If you like the adventure genre, this is one to have in your library.			"

												[No spoilers .... I think :P]Adventures aren´t dead!...especially when developers put some effort into their work.Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishment is an interesting approach to the genre of adventure-games ... and it´s well done.The game mechanics are ´fresh´, new and innovative, ""forcing"" the player to listen and think instead of clicking random everythings and skip dialogues. Talking about the dialogues: They are very well done: Lovely british accents, good voice actors and a general high level of quality make it a pleasure to listen. The graphics in this (on the hardware side very humble) game are beautiful and atmospheric. Also, the authors of the game seem to be fans of Doyle´s stories. The first case (The murder of ´Black Peter´) are a 1:1 copy from the original story and can be understood as some kind of tutorial to old Holmes-fans.The system of deduction is typical and interesting. The further you get with your case, the more theories build up for the play to combine and analyse. That brings in some skills and thinking instead of random clicking. The cases and puzzles are logical, the minigames are good, not too many and skipable, if the player does not like them. However, ""C&P"" is a game that´s fun to play and a worthy continuation of Holmes´ life. ----Gameplay-> 9/10 (It might be a bit too easy for experienced ´adventurers´, due to Holmes´ skills)Authenticity -> 10/10 (Lovely voices, believable characters and places (.... only Mycroft is not as fat as he should be :P)Graphics/Animations -> 9/10 (It is not perfect, but still an eyecatcher)""Size""->9/10 (3rd of 6 cases, 6 hours .... it should take around 10 hours to finish the game ... Maybe some DLCs will follow)Bite-my-keyboard-factor->10/10 (No crashes or major bugs, no frustration so far)Value-> 8.5/10 (It is not particularly cheap, but not overpriced. If you are not sure about the purchase, wait for a 10 or 20% sale)So far ... case closed,have fun with the game. ;) "

												this games makes you feel like Sherlock Holmes at times. If you are a fan of this seires this is the best game.  My only real complaint is that i would have liked more cases. So run and buy if you want to be Sherlock Holmes. If you want to be an alien hunter this is not for you.			"

												A very good game, and I'm glad I got it. The facial textures and expressions are nothing short of absolutely astounding. Who ever worked on that, good job. The puzzles aren't too difficult, and the ""lockpicking"" is a bit repetitive, but the game makes up for that in the moral choices and the reasoning you have to use to make a final decision as to who committed a crime.Despite all the evidence you collect, at the end of many cases you can still be left scratching your head as to who committed the crime. This is pretty awesome because I had to review all the evidence I collected, and really take into consideration details that on the outside might seem trivial. These very small details made all the difference. In this sense, the game is very true to the Sherlock Holmes experience you would expect.I do have one gripe though, and it is a very small one. The outfits that you can wear are almost always locked. I honestly would have liked to have worn the unbuttoned shirt and scruffy facial hair to look a bit more like Dr. House. I was actually hoping that once I beat the game all of the outfits would be unlocked, but sadly that didn't happen.If you like the adventure genre, this is one to have in your library.			"

												Looks fantastic in 1440p. I thouroughly enjoyed the game and it ran well on my pc. The puzzles and gameplay were done well, with a nice mix of challenge and involvement. The story however, seemed scattered. The game is broken up into different cases, with no relationship between them. The ending also shares in this problem by seeming random and out of place, with all the choices available in the previous cases, like whether to absolve or condemn the perp, proving relatively pointless in the end. All in all i enjoyed it and look forward to additional cases being released as DLC. The length of the game was good, i finished it over a weekend and it felt like just the right lenght.			"

												I decided to not read, or watch, anything about this game before buying it and playing it myself. Then it didn't work, thankfully Frogwares managed to do a fix for the majority of players and we could finally step into the shoes of Sherlock Holmes.Wow, the faces have improved heavily from Testament, Sherlock's lip synch is almost spot on, other peoples, um, not so much, but still it's an improvement! The scenery is fantastic, even the loading scene is pretty, epsecially the background through the window of the carriage, it gives you a little idea of the area that you are going into.The cases themselves were great, nice and varied, I actually found the first case to be more difficult that the rest, this might be to do with the OTE in it, where I wouldn't have been able to match them up, unlike Sherlock. The fact that you could solve it in different ways, come to different conclusions was outstanding! I enjoyed seeing how many % of other players also chose that option, very TWD! "

												Crimes and Punishments is simpler than previous games in the series when it comes to puzzles. It   makes sure the player never forgets anything and is always able to keep track if something is missing, which makes things a bit too easy. Nevertheless, i found the experience very enjoyable. The deduction system is the best it's ever been and the cases are, overall, fairly interesting. The game is looking great and the mechanics hold no mystery, everything is intuitive.Something a bit annoying are the loadings. There's plenty of them and they aren't that fast. While it isn't a major complaint, it's a nuisance.As game the progresses on a case-by-case basis it leaves room for expansions containing more and i really hope Frogwares is thinking about it. I could play some more cases!So, if you are a fan of the series you will probably enjoy more Sherlock Holmes. If you are new to the series, this instalment is the most beginner friendly and might pull people to the series. For me, it's recommended.			"

												A fun and interesting experience so far. Good characters, beautiful locations, and unique story lines make this a must for any fan or the genre. Although, as a fan of all the Sherlock Holmes games I do find Crimes and Punishments to be ridiculously easy. I remember Nemesis being a real challenge and this was what got me hooked on the releases to follow. This current title feels more like the game model employed by Telltale in ""The Walking Dead"". That is, supplementing any challenge with rolling story. It is still a good experience, but their lacks a ""sense of achievement"" which you would recieve with the other titles. Another problem I have with this latest installment is that of travel. You frequently visit locations, do one thing, and then travel back to a previously visited location via horse and cart. There can be times when you're literally staring at a loading screen 80% of the time, to spend 1 minute at a location before moving on to another. This is the biggest problem with the game in my opinion as it reminds me of surfing the web on a 56k connection in order to read one sentence from various websites. I miss how Sherlock Holmes vs Jack the Ripper had you walking around albeit a small part of London and how there was no ""press t to find everything"" mode (That cannot be disabled)Overall a good game but not without its frustrations 7/10.

												[No spoilers .... I think :P]Adventures aren´t dead!...especially when developers put some effort into their work.Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishment is an interesting approach to the genre of adventure-games ... and it´s well done.The game mechanics are ´fresh´, new and innovative, ""forcing"" the player to listen and think instead of clicking random everythings and skip dialogues. Talking about the dialogues: They are very well done: Lovely british accents, good voice actors and a general high level of quality make it a pleasure to listen. The graphics in this (on the hardware side very humble) game are beautiful and atmospheric. Also, the authors of the game seem to be fans of Doyle´s stories. The first case (The murder of ´Black Peter´) are a 1:1 copy from the original story and can be understood as some kind of tutorial to old Holmes-fans.The system of deduction is typical and interesting. The further you get with your case, the more theories build up for the play to combine and analyse. That brings in some skills and thinking instead of random clicking. The cases and puzzles are logical, the minigames are good, not too many and skipable, if the player does not like them. However, ""C&P"" is a game that´s fun to play and a worthy continuation of Holmes´ life. ----Gameplay-> 9/10 (It might be a bit too easy for experienced ´adventurers´, due to Holmes´ skills)Authenticity -> 10/10 (Lovely voices, believable characters and places (.... only Mycroft is not as fat as he should be :P)Graphics/Animations -> 9/10 (It is not perfect, but still an eyecatcher)""Size""->9/10 (3rd of 6 cases, 6 hours .... it should take around 10 hours to finish the game ... Maybe some DLCs will follow)Bite-my-keyboard-factor->10/10 (No crashes or major bugs, no frustration so far)Value-> 8.5/10 (It is not particularly cheap, but not overpriced. If you are not sure about the purchase, wait for a 10 or 20% sale)So far ... case closed,have fun with the game. ;) "

												Brilliant new installment in the Sherlock series and this is probably the most beautiful yet. The visuals are stunning - the level of detail poured into every scene is breathtaking and oozes Victorian charm. The closeups of peoples' faces is unbelievable, seeing every pore on their skin and every emotion being conveyed in terrific detail. The voice acting is top notch with very few poor moments that only give creedance to the storylines that develop throughout. And to the story, which in fact there are 6 of them, are for the most part all solid and rich. Only the 4th chapter was a bit short and obvious but the others utilise the Sherlock world to its fullest. As this game did have the consoles in mind there is some limitation with the puzzles at times but the variety of conversational puzzles and deductions more than made up for any control constraints. Finishing the game, I felt satified with the experience and I cannot wait for more in the future :)			"

												Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments is the first sherlock holmes game i've ever played.This game is a modern point and click, with some exploration, kinda.I'm a huge fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's works, although i haven't read all of them.In this game, you play as Sherlock Holmes... or not.You can play it the way you want, whether it skipping mini games, investigation and just jump into conclusions (Which contrary to popular beliefs, Sherlock never does)Or you could carefully examine every inch of crime scene and gather all of the evidence to find the right culprit.So you can play it.. Sherlock of Sherlock, or Sherlock of your Sherlock.There are 6 different cases, and each of the case itself is interesting.While the case itself is interesting, some cases suffered from flawed conclusions because the game let you deduct the culprit early, yet the true criminal itself appear at the very end of the case so it's rather obvious. And sometimes the culprit doesn't even make sense.Within each case there are several unique minigames, some are great like the chemistry experiment.And it let you skip it in case it's too hard. (it really isn't)This game let you play as first person or third person camera. while the first person is smooth and responsive, the third persona camera isn't.And then there's also this beautiful graphic things but who cares?Overall the game is a blast to play and you should play it if you like Sherlock holmes and Point and click.You're a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sherlock holmes, why would anyone question your deduction?

												Investigate mysteries!  Solve crimes!  Be a dog!  Booby trap a house!  Do chemistry!  It's all in here!I'm a lifelong Sherlock Holmes fan who's played around with a few of the Frogwares games.  They're some pretty solid point and click adventures that do a decent job of respecting the source material.  Unfortunately, as with any adaptation, some of the deviations just don't flow well.  The majority of the content was pretty solid. There's a lot about this game I like.  There's a blend of Doyle and new cases.  The game implements different features in the different cases.   There's a ""right"" conclusion to every case, but the player is encouraged to draw their own conclusions.  There are occasionally different outcomes that conclude a case successfully without being the ""right"" answer.  There's definitely some replay value.The library page says it can be used with the controller or keyboard/mouse, but I found normal gameplay flowed much better with keyboard/mouse.  When examining certain objects, the controller just didn't have the right response.  Unfortuntely, there are a few puzzles that heavily favor controller use and are extremely difficult on the keyboard.  If you don't have a controller, they can be skipped if you find them too frustrating.  I'd strongly advocate keyboard/mouse use.One thing I have mixed feelings about is how heavily this game was inspired by the BBC series Sherlock.  The dev team is very fond of the ""mind palace"" mechanic from the show.  I like how they implemented it, as it is the vehicle that lets you reach multiple conclusions to each case.  The writing picked up a lot of the Sherlock vs. Mycroft attitude of the show, and I feel that it caused the plot to suffer a bit.  That was a completely unneccessary addition.On the whole, it's a good, solid game and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I highly recommend it for anyone into P&C adventures or Sherlock Holmes.			"

												In Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments you play as the famous detective in a Victorian era England, counting on the help of your faithful assistant Dr. Watson.  Instead of one big plot line, you actually need to solve multiple cases which aren't connected. For each one, you have to explore the crime scenes, interrogate persons of interest and make experiments. Instead of having a linear conclusion, you can form different deductions by connecting the clues and end up charging whoever you believe is the culprit. After making your mind, you will also need to make a moral choice by absolving or condemning the person in question. This means each case has multiple endings.  The presentation is fantastic as the time period feels authentic and the graphics are very good, while the sound is on par, with all characters being well voiced. Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments could have been a standard and dull point and click game, but ended up being pretty good and refreshing.			"

												Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson went on a camping trip. After a good meal and a bottle of wine they lay down for the night, and went to sleep. Some hours later, Holmes awoke and nudged his faithful friend.""Watson, look up at the sky and tell me what you see."" Watson replied, ""I see millions and millions of stars."" ""What does that tell you?"" Watson pondered for a minute. ""Astronomically, it tells me that there are millions of galaxies and potentially billions of planets. Astrologically, I observe that Saturn is in Leo. Horologically, I deduce that the time is approximately a quarter past three. Philosophically, I can see that universe is massive and that we are small and insignificant. Meteorologically, I suspect that we will have a beautiful day tomorrow. What does it tell you?” Holmes was silent for a minute, then spoke. ""Watson, someone has stolen our tent!""			"

												'You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear.'That is a perfect description of how I felt when playing this game. All the small details Holmes aquires in this game make or break each case and often the simple answers are the most important. The cases make it so you have equal suspicion of who commited the crime until you get that one clue which puts all the pieces together. I have never felt more stupid for selecting the wrong choice in a game in quite awhile and all the reasons why the actual person commit the crime makes so much sense it makes me feel even more stupid for not realising it earlier. 'There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.' Which is so true in this game.But when I got to 'The Kew Gardens Drama' the 5th case in the game I began to understand and started to piece together the clues and created a 'theory based on facts and not facts based on theories' and i turned out to be right giving me the greatest feeling of satisfaction.This game has 6 great cases that are all unique with multiple endings, deceptive characters and great graphics. This is a massive step up from The Testament of Sherlock Holmes which was also a really good game and this is a game I would play again to experience the other endings I could have chosen.			"

												Overall amazing Sherlock Holmes game. The original universe of the detective is respected, with the quirky nature of Sherlock being accompanied by Watson's serious temperament. Crimes & Punishments follows the inspector through six cases interrogating, inspecting and solving, and each case has something interresting about it.The game has a good life-span (around 10-12 hours) and the replayability isn't too bad because you can replay past cases while changing your conclusions. The puzzle mini-games are really fun, even though the picklocking gets pretty old before the end of the game. My only real problem with the game is the lack of open world. ALL I WANT IS TO ROAM THE STREETS OF LONDON AS SHERLOCK HOLMES!! Honestly, I would have prefered this 100x over the stupid loading screens hidden behind carriage rides. In the end, I still fully recommend this to any fan of detective games or fans of the Sherlock Holmes character. The game is pretty and the case solving is amongst some of the most fun i've ever played.			"

												This game is beautiful. The previous game was a massive leap in comparison to the ones before that and this one takes it to the next level.There is a lot of inspiration from the BBC series ""Sherlock"" in this game. Words pop up when examining people for example. It makes the game feel fresh.The puzzles are pretty easy and even if they become too troublesome, you can skip them if you fail enough. The game does a good job of making you feel like a detective, it's a pretty unique experience, and I think it's worth a purchase just for that.In this game you're able to convict other people, depending on how you interpret the evidence. In my opinion, that part of it doesn't really pan out. Conclusions can feel very wishy washy.The cases can feel way too open ended, the evidence not conclusive enough and there are red herrings everywhere. The ""deductions system"" is hard to use. I usually make it to the end of a case with all of the available clues and someone I think is guilty. However, ""lining up"" the clues so that I ""deduce"" that person is declared guilty is way harder than it needs to be. I usually end up aligning the clues so that I actually get to any conclusion instead of just being... stuck.Even after declaring the person you think is guilty and with the game confirming that he is in fact guilty (by giving you an achievement), you're still not 100% sure.The conclusions never seem rock solid.Most cases take around an hour to solve. Case 4 is a weird outlyer that only took 20 minutes to solve, had one location to visit and only one outcome (I did enjoy the case itself though).TIP FOR DEVELOPERS: You're able to skip pieces of dialogue even if the text isn't completely displayed on the screen. Please make sure in the future that all text is displayed onscreen before being able to skip it, thanks.TIP FOR DEVELOPERS 2: The trailer lied!			"

												It's a really great game you can immerse into. It challenges your deductive thinking, offers a variety of mini-games and a nice dramaturgy with some eureka moments.The only negative thing I found were the long loading times between the places to visit. If you can live with that, this game is definitely worth buying.			"

												This game is beautiful. The previous game was a massive leap in comparison to the ones before that and this one takes it to the next level.There is a lot of inspiration from the BBC series ""Sherlock"" in this game. Words pop up when examining people for example. It makes the game feel fresh.The puzzles are pretty easy and even if they become too troublesome, you can skip them if you fail enough. The game does a good job of making you feel like a detective, it's a pretty unique experience, and I think it's worth a purchase just for that.In this game you're able to convict other people, depending on how you interpret the evidence. In my opinion, that part of it doesn't really pan out. Conclusions can feel very wishy washy.The cases can feel way too open ended, the evidence not conclusive enough and there are red herrings everywhere. The ""deductions system"" is hard to use. I usually make it to the end of a case with all of the available clues and someone I think is guilty. However, ""lining up"" the clues so that I ""deduce"" that person is declared guilty is way harder than it needs to be. I usually end up aligning the clues so that I actually get to any conclusion instead of just being... stuck.Even after declaring the person you think is guilty and with the game confirming that he is in fact guilty (by giving you an achievement), you're still not 100% sure.The conclusions never seem rock solid.Most cases take around an hour to solve. Case 4 is a weird outlyer that only took 20 minutes to solve, had one location to visit and only one outcome (I did enjoy the case itself though).TIP FOR DEVELOPERS: You're able to skip pieces of dialogue even if the text isn't completely displayed on the screen. Please make sure in the future that all text is displayed onscreen before being able to skip it, thanks.TIP FOR DEVELOPERS 2: The trailer lied!			"

												Pros:- Fantastic graphics, beautiful areas- Lifelike character models- Ability to make your own deductions and determine the outcome of the case- Lists all the tasks you have to complete, meaning less forgetting what you have to do- Puzzles didn't seem forced- An enjoyable game, despite all its flaws- Trying to use the measuring tape is just as annoying as in the rest of the seriesCons:- Way too easy- For some reason Frogwares decided to get rid of the inventory system featured in the previous 4 games, which seemed fine to me (having inventory mixed in with the clues didn't make sense to me at all and was confusing to adjust to)- Watson is now a side character instead of a main one, and an extremely stupid one at that. This is a big contrast from the previous games, especially Testament, where he's shown to be just as competent as Holmes.- Is so different it feels like a standalone game, not part of the Frogwares series- Made up of a bunch of miniplots that don't have any relation to one another (this is a little truer to Holmes canon, just imo doesn't suit an adventure game very well). This may be a pro for some people, but it bored me as I didn't find any of the cases all that compelling- Did I mention they completely butchered Watson?Despite my criticisms, I did enjoy the game. Just don't expect this to be Testament but better because it isn't by any means. If you're a hardcore Holmes fanatic, expect to be slightly disappointed (and pick it up on sale at some point, all the same). If you just like detective games, you'll probably like this a lot.			"

												I am 3 cases in to this game and have really enjoyed it so far.  The puzzles/minigames can be skipped for those who may find them tedious, the voice acting is great and the range of conclusions you can come to at the end of a case make it a lot more challenging and interesting to get it right the first time you try.It seems like there is a lot more of this game to go, and to me it is definitely worth the money.  Replayability may be the only issue, but if you don't check whether you were correct at the end of a case, you could do them again and come to a different conclusion.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys detective games!			"

												Crimes and Punishments is the detective game that I've been waiting for. It does a really great job making you feel like a detective, namely Sherlock Holmes of course, and its focus on exploration, dialogue, and deduction really enhance the feeling. It genuinely feels like you're playing a Sherlock Holmes story. Unlike many other games that have tried this game does not hold your hand and you can actually completely screw up and make the wrong verdict on a case. The majority of the puzzles make logical sense and fit with the investigation, though there are some pretty awful QTE segments and a few bad puzzles though they can be skipped. The game has long loading times, but this alleviated some by being able to review your casebook during it.  Despite any flaws Crime and Punishments is a damn fine game and what other adventure games should strive to be. I'm really looking forward to what Frogwares does from here. Highly recommended for detective story/Sherlock Holmes and adventure game fans.			"

												This game was so a great accomplishment, that I'm taking my time to write my first review.But to avoid a TL;DR reaction, I'll just get to the point.Pros:- Best graphics of any Sherlock game...ever-The ability to have Sherlock profile a character is AWESOME and is what makes the interrogations in this game better than L.A. Noire- The deduction system in the game makes this game (and this is no exaggeration) the BEST detective game EVER MADE because you actually have to solve the case.  They don't force you to make the right conclusion.  If Frogwares keeps improving that system they will have mastered the detective genre for video games-The ability to review you ""notepad"" and ""deductions"" during loads is AWESOME particularly-The ability to have moral choices is very cool and adds another layer to the Sherlock experience but...look at the Cons- The Imagine ability is really cool though I hope that the company fleshes it out more in future Sherlock gamesNeutral:- The dialog is at time very engaging (particularly between Sherlock and Watson), but at times it is very stiffCons:- Moral choices don't affect the gameplay as every case is an isolated event- Some of the level layout it poorly done, particularly when they face you in the wrong direction when an area loads			"

												This game surprised me, I played The Testament of Sherlock Holmes and I hated it, but this game, this game is awesome! I've read all of the Sherlock Holmes books and I listen too them frequently while driving and this game really feels like the Sherlock I imagine in my head. I love being able to do one of his introspective glances and gather information from the persons appearance. The deduction mode and branching ability makes things interesting because you could end up choosing the wrong person should you have insufficient evidence. The exploring of the crime scenes is excellent. All in all this is a fantastic game and I would recommend it at full price, the only flaw I can find is that I find the controls a little clunky at times but other than that this game is my new crack.11/10 will buy a pipe.

												I fully recommend this game. Not a single bug. Great content. Adequate technology. I want more, more, more!Ready to dive into and explore your own corrupted self and eccentricity? Look no further!Six cases of varying complexity are waiting for you to be investigated in this game, which involve premeditated homicide, manslaughter, theft, betrayal, false accusations, extortion, bribery, as well as cases of plain self-defense, suicide attempts and planned and unplanned post crime cover-ups, all that spiced with a good deal of deception and despair coming from all sides.You will have to collect clues at the crime scenes, interrogate victims and witnesses, make experiments, even conduct a post-mortem examination and re-enact different possible progressions of events. The game is freshly designed without any need for pen and paper to master the complexities of the cases and without any repititive save-and-load-game-chores in the more difficult situations, which are usually involved in this type of game. Instead a British bloodhound is at your service, when needed, not forgetting Dr Waton's energetic support in any time of need.You think you would realize when people lie straight to your face? You like to condemn people to the gallows, without having unmistakable evidence, or do you prefer to put the reliability of your thinking to a test? Maybe you're even not endorsing the death sentence out of categorical or philosophical considerations? The cases are too complex for just guessing and the game offers a really nifty interface apart from the authentic british weather and furniture atmopshere created by the Unreal engine during gameplay, not only to review all collected evidence, support material and relevant dialogues, but also to rethink the countless possibilities of ""what-ifs?"" involved in the deductions in a systematic and comprehensible way.With all this freedom and your foreknowledge, that you accumulate by working on the cases, also comes the responsibility for selecting which information you will forward to Lestrade and the Yard and which parts you rather keep to yourself and Dr Watson. Even with your deductions executed flawlessly, the evidence rarely gets unmistakable and there's always still room for interpretation, afterthoughts or last moment surprises. Even if you get a confession from an alleged culprit, there might still be lies involved and you will need to handle probabilities just as well as you need to handle undeniable facts versus uncertainties.Playing this game is like reading six really well written and highly diversified ""whodunit"" crime novels in a row, while not only being given the opportunity to engage in the process of deduction yourself, but here you will have to also justify the decisions in front of yourself, because they will affect the continued fate of the culprits, other people involved and your reputation as Sherlock Holmes. You will have to make those decisions, that are usually a given in crime novels or simpler games, that will ultimately climax in the revelations of the cases coming to their finale. Are you worthy to call yourself Sherlock Holmes? I remember well the sweat on my brow, when I had to make these decisions while playing this game to its end.As far as I remember Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novels, which I've read as a young lad, the game is fully respecting the heritage of this great author in its entire variety and is a valid advancement in matters of crime fiction as a genre on its own.I had 36 hours of wonderful gameplay with this title. I'm very thankful for the good design, the obviously highly accurate quality assurance during production and I can only wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone interested.I wasn't playing any computer games for about twelve years at all, and I had a single spot in the game, where I was just too stupid and not persistent enough, failing to acquire a single specific clue. There is an official walkthrough available in text form, the discussions on Steam for your guilt ridden or still puzzled afterthoughts, as well as countless videos on YouTube, which you can consult in the case you would ever get stuck in this fine game. But when you're taking the time the game is asking for, no help at all should be required to solve the cases.EDIT: This is a very subjective review of my own experience playing this game. If you prefer a more objective and concise review I recommend this review by user ""ros"": http://steamcommunity.com/id/ros1981/recommended/241260/I fully endorse the review of user ""ros"" and just marked it as helpful. It's the most accurate I've read so far, based on finishing the game myself. I find this review much better written than my own, because it is not as subjective as mine and both more concise and more accurately describing the few potential downsides of the game, which I perceived in a similar way, but didn't mention in my review - just because I found them irrelevant to me personally. However, with the responsibility of writing a review for other Steam users, it's of course better, more credible and finally more objective mentioning them accurately and without judging them, like it's done here so well, in order to prevent potential disappointment due to unfounded expectations or personal preferences. However, many press reviews I've read about it previous to my own purchase I found quite inaccurate and biased. The ""video walkthroughs"" user ros mentions in the beginning of his review can be found on the well known video platforms of the Internet without problems and also finally convinced me that this game is worth a try, which I don't regret and still think give a valid impression of the game experience, while of course are being spoilers, too. Accolades where accolades are due! Again, a great game! Just bought it another time, this time as a gift.However, let me clarify the following differences/additions I have to the review of user ""ros"":1. No save games: they aren't needed, due to game design, hard to understand, huh? Agreed. Well, you'll see you won't need them. Still they can be found easily in the filesystem as a file (PC).2. very little challenge in deductions: the clues you find do not let you make unmistakable deductions, the sheer mass of clues found I consider quite challenging and comparable to a written novel and the deductions themselves are not the difficult part, but deciding which of them are probably the correct ones is the brain-teaser! Managing the sheer mass of clues is well implemented in the game.To put the last part into other words: you can miss clues by not exploring the crime scenes enough and by not talking thoroughly enough to the crime NPCs involved (witnesses, potential culprits, ...), which then can lead you to false conclusions.. I found that to be quite an additional challenge to the decisions which of the deductions are the correct ones and that is what this game is about for me.The minigames or puzzles might indeed not very challenging, as user ""ros"" is telling, however they can all be skipped, when you don't like them. I skipped some of them, because they're really not what I was looking for originally, but I also didn't find them disturbing or too easy. "

												This game was surprisingly easier compared to The Testament of Sherlock Holmes. I still enjoyed it nevertheless.For me, there were fewer puzzles to complete and a lot of the information was given to you basically on a silver platter. It was very rare that I had to remember an important details or event, as they were always wrote down in your journal and I was always told what to do next, which I didn't enjoy (as I prefer to figure it out for myself).On the flip side, I thoroughly enjoyed the fact that you have to make your own conclusions, and you could even make the wrong decision if you don't have enough clues or missed some dialogue (specifically the silver vs ice dagger dilemma I had). However as mentioned above, the game basically tells you if you're missing a clue so I didn't really have the problem of not having enough evidence. The characters were interesting and unique, and the cases kept me enthralled (although I found myself losing interest in the second case in which a train goes missing, much prefer the brutal murders and autopsies).I did enjoy this game, however it did not leave me feeling angry, frustrated, or wondering how to solve something, which is what I really wanted. There were no ""Eureka"" moments, or basically impossible puzzles to drain my brainpower. I can understand not everyone wants that, but I would have loved a puzzle in which I feel the strong urge to smash my head against my desk instead of an armwrestling game...			"

There are not enough puzzles compared to the previous games, or enough interaction with Watson,but the characters are memorable and doesn't resemble each other too much, and it some cases you start cheering for a suspect, hoping they aren't the murderer.Sadly, though, it didn't have as good a story, overall, as the previous games. The whole ""Merry Men"" thing, was a bit of a weird one.But all things considered, it was a Sherlock Holmes game, through and through, and I'd recommend it to any fan of the books, movies, tv series or the older games.

												Here is my review of the game.You are playing as the famous detective Sherlock Holmes, accompanied by his loyal allies, Dr.Watson and Toby. The games have 6 cases for you to solve. Some of them do feel alot simple compared to the others, but they are quite original and enjoyable. The puzzles in this game as would say our friend Holmes are quite ""elementary"", so for someone who has played the previous games may find them to be easy, but someone new to the serie might find them difficult at time. Sadly, some of the puzzles felt repetitive. Visually the game is beautiful, the visual expression and the details of the characters are amazing, the environment of the places you discover are well detailed and they are worth exploring. The controls are clunky at times, especially when your are walking in smalls corridors because Dr.Watson can block your way back since he is following you most of the time. Overall Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments is a game worth buying for fans of the serie or those who wants to get into Dectective/Puzzle games. I would reccomend to buy it when it is on sale.

												Great game but too short only 12 hours of gameplay. The hardest part in the game was to make the right conclusions about who the murderer is and then to make the moral choice. The puzzels were made for children except for few that took a bit more time to realize but if you are used to puzzle solving you should have no problem with them. I really liked the game, how it looks and how it makes you feel that you were actually part of the older Sherlock Holmes adventures.  Also the cases are old Holmes stories so if you know them, then it might be boring when you know how the case ends, even though the cases are simplified from the original stories quite a bit.  The voice acting felt quite forced in some places but wasn't that bad but it could have been better. Even though I allready completed the game in one run trough only getting one case wrong I still want to see the other conclusions and how the game chances when you make different choices. So yes I recommend this for those who like Holmes.			"

 6/10 TL;DR: Great visuals, very immersive soundtrack, unique detective concepts. No main-storyline, no ending. Puzzles were way too easy. Cases are predictable. This game honestly took a huge step back from The Testament in terms of storyline, but a huge leap forward in gameplay.Great visuals, Baker Street/Whitechapel has greatly improved over The Testament. Voice acting is well done (accents), but lip-syncing is pretty disappointing for next-gen gaming. Very unique game mechanics with new interesting concepts like Imagination and Sherlock Talent. The only downside to these is that the game tells you directly where your targets are, which just kills the fun. It'd be better if the Sherlock Talent just gave the game a filter or texture that makes it easier to see objects of interest, rather than make them glow.6 in-depth very intriguing, however, very predictable cases. It's a great improvement over The Testament, which was more like an interactive movie. This game allows you to not only make your own deductions, but make your own conclusions, choose your own guilty party and make your own moral choices as to how you will covict them. No main storyline (except for  The Merry Men terrorist group  ), which is HUGELY disappointing, especially in a Sherlock adaptation. I loved how The Testament was all one case and was full of plot twists and in depth dialogue and story. Overall, this game feels half-finished but  is definitely worth your time  if you are into the more thinking-based games that require your full attention/patience.			"

If you take the best of the great previous games - Testament, Nemisis etc and used the better graphics from this one, you'd have a classic.			"

												A very nice mystery puzzle game. Great graphics and fun cases make this game totally worthwhile. While each case is somewhat ""railroaded"", there are several alternate endings which you can pursue depending on which suspect you decide to accuse. In many of the cases, the correct outcome is not very obvious, and it's actually quite fun going through the clues and making your final decision. Choose carefully! Throughout each case, there are varied and fun puzzles which keep the gameplay interesting (though it starts to get somewhat more predictable and repetitive towards the end).My only wish is that more DLC was available for this game. It feels a bit sad when you reach the end.			"

												First game I've played in the Sherlock series; this game emulates the BBC show, sans the modern setting. While each case has a ""right"" answer, it's not always clear, and sometimes completely coincidental. Moral choices leave something to be desired, but a fun take on a point-and-click style deduction game.			"

Posted: January 2, 2015
												For the record I am a pretty big fan of Sherlock Holmes. I consider him to be one of the greatest fictional characters ever written and in many ways he was a significant role model to me, as I grew up. I have read all of the Conan Doyle stories (including the ones that were of admittedly lesser quality).As with Frogwares' previous efforts, the love of Conan Doyle's stories shines through. As with The Testament of Sherlock Holmes (which I enoyed) there are references galore. For a fan like me, the lovingly crafted art design and atmosphere cannot help but bring a large apprieciative smile.However, while I enjoyed Testament as well, Crimes & Punishment is a much stronger game. The gameplay is smoother and less clunky.You will take on the role of Sherlock Holmes in investigating six distinct cases, many of which are references to Conan Doyle's stories. The way in which you go about gathering clues and connecting them is undoubtedly the game's greatest asset. Especially since it--to an extent, allows you to form your own theories and make conclusions based on the evidence that are not necessarily correct. Each case features several different possible endings and outcomes, and even if you miss the ""official"" outcome, the one you have chosen may well prove equally satisfying. It is done very well and most of the time it feels true to Holmes' character, which I feel is the highest compliment I can give to the game.If you are a Holmes fan like myself, I would consider this to be a must buy. It has been one of the most enjoyable games of 2014 for me. Even if you are not--but possess an appreciation for narratively driven games or crime thrillers, I can confidently recommend it.I very much look forward to seeing what Frogwares has in store for Sherlock Holmes in the future.""The game is afoot""			"

Each case is of a different kind and has its own settings. Its even fun to play this game with a partner and to discuss the clues and leads. The only weak points are some of the mini games (lock picking..) and loading times between scenes. All in all highly recommended!			"

												I recieved Crimes and Punishment as a gift for Christmas, and as my experience with the previous game had brought me so much joy, I downloaded it immediately, and began my brand new adventure. Though not as challenging as previously in the Frogwares series of Sherlock Holmes games, it provided me with a thrilling story, beautiful visuals, and relatively relatable motives and characters. This game is able to trick you into thinking that you're a master detective, and even if I've realized it was all a ruse, I can still appreciate being given a little bit of my childhood dream. The puzzles are somewhat less puzzling, and the deduction portion is exponentially simpler than in Testament, I believe that it was well worth my friends money, and I will continue to enjoy solving the crimes in different ways for a long time to come.

												Frogwares are constantly improving their craft - this is obvious for anyone who played their previous Holmes games in the past, and though hiccups occur upon occasion, this one is a very obvious, very noteworthy improvement upon their craft.The storylines are superb, though some of them are glaringly obvious in terms of their full solution. But that's only for some, and they generally work out much like Doyle's short stories - varied, complex, and often incredibly surprising.The world is richly showcased, with the player being easily drawn into the 19th century London locales, and the superb writing and voice-acting only help to cement this achievement. The system of gathering clues and putting them to use in a logic system is improved, perfected, and now stands as a testament of what investigation/adventure games ought to go for. Varied choices, conclusions, and consequences.It is here that my one complaint of the game comes up - it holds your hand, often a tad too much. Items and locations that have a deeper meaning are immediately noted as such when you spot them, meaning that if you didn't use them, you *know* that something was missed.And yet, considering that certain game paths don't open at all unless you reach them as a logical conclusion, I still bow in thanks for the experience.

												This is an unbelieveably great game! At first a was indifferent to buying it, but now I'm glad I did. What I really like about this game is that even if you were to know where everything is, you would still need 1.5 to 2 hours of gameplay per case.  Also everyone knows, that none of us gamers will ever come close to Sherlock's cognitive skills, but the game does a very, very good job at letting us do a lot of the thinking. To clarify, this is the first game of the Sherlock Holmes series I've played and I will definitely get the earlier ones and will keep on buying the new ones, if they are going to make any new ones, which I hope so!

												It's a very sloppy made game with a very good written story and the outstanding writing.The game does looks fine as it's on the market of the adventure games. But this product is made badly as for a game which is was made on UE3 (at it's dusk). These  people had no idea how to work with the engine. The developer can use any engine and it will be still a♥♥♥♥♥♥ Because of that I would recommend for the team to hire the proper division of the programmers and the designers. Apparently the hungry students can't do much. This game shouldn't be in the price line as an AAA product. The above average indie product at most.Despite the fact, I'm afraid you will not be able to find on the market another game with a such good written dialogues. It's not a eye candy, but you would like the taste.$0.01-20.00 - Buy it! You will not regret. Anything above is a challenge.I'm going to try the rest of their Sherlock's games now.			"

												This is boring and way too easy.You can also just skip missions by pressing the spacebar key, which is lame.I expected better, to be honest. I am a big fan of Sherlock stories, but this game didn't really do it for me.I'm not that far into the game yet, but it's way too slow. I think L.A. Noire is more action packed, plus it's an open world game, while this game is slow and boring.			"

												This is personally the closest thing to a “Detective Video Game” I’ve ever played, and although Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments stumbles a bit both in execution and presentation (along with having a really long title that I constantly mess up saying) it stays standing and stands proud. It isn’t something I would recommend to everyone, but it is definitely worth playing if you’re interested in being The Great Detective, or if you like playing point-and-clicks and other games of that nature.

												Written review below the pros - consPROS- well used unreal engine- many different interesting locations- dialogues not boring at all- not too long- case solving technique (synapse style)CONS- facial expression should have been a bit better overall- sometimes the 'right' solution for a case is the least expected and not very plausibleVERDICT:Beautiful and immersive. If you like Sherlock Holmes's fictional character (books) you will like the game. If you never read a book, you will start to read one after this game.---------------Very nice detective experience. I agree with some other reviewers: best detective experience after L.A. Noire. I would not count The Vanishing of Ethan Carter because it was in my opinion more focused on exploration rather than case solving....This sherlock holmes offers very nice graphics, incredibly suited humour, challenges cases to solve, and almost perfect gameplay mechanics (the whole synapse - case solving - crackfest).How the unreal engine performs in this game is splendid. You can find its limits (facial expression in primis) but the game is super smooth with enough graphic settings to satisfy a PC gamer. It runs ok in ultrawide although you can't make the FOV really high but is not needed, it is high enough.To be honest some cases are weird: the solution (the game tells which solution is the real right one) is not what you expect it to be rationally, and would rather be a little too exaggerated, too impossible in real life. Only one case I found like this though. The other cases may appear weird as well to some players but that is only because they didn't find or interprete enough clues. Everything makes sense in this game.Here some screens from the game:http://steamcommunity.com/id/rogermorse/screenshots/?appid=241260&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall "

												A brillinant game. The graphics are reasonable, the voice acting and dialouge was alright and mini games kept the game interesting and allowed change (although they get stale by the last case). Each story is about two hours long so there is quite a bit of game time. The cases themselve are clevearly constructed leaving you asking questions to the end of each one but you don't need years of investigative experince because with Dr Watson as your comparison and the skills of Sherlock Holmes solving each case is... Elementary.			"

I am really  looking forward to see a few more old characters like ""the woman"" and M in the sequel !			"

												Let me just start off by saying this is one of the best mystery games I've played, comparable to the likes of L. A. Noire.  As such, I do recommend it...but I must mention that I do so with reservations.Pros:>Atmosphere: Every case takes place in vastly diverse settings and each one is a piece of high quality design and detail. Whether on the London streets, in a mansion, or traveling along the railway, each and every one breathes late-19th century Britain and the world feels authentic and lived in. Little nuances like walking down a street and realizing that the pub window you just walked by is actually looking into a fully rendered and populated room gives a reality that few games achieve.>Gameplay: The game is divided into 6 intriguing cases. For each one you will find yourself doing the typical Holmes-esque activities of questioning witnesses, scouring scenes for clues, looking for tell-tale signs on individuals to determine their pasts, testing materials in your laboratory, and just being an all-around super sleuth. There are a variety of minigames to open locks, wrestle with opponents, and piece together clues. These can be skipped if wanted, but they aren't too difficult and they provide a pleasant change of scene. The game is very smart in how it allows you to access your case book during its loading sequences, allowing even its ""down time"" to be busy getting each piece properly fitted into the developing puzzle.>Writing/Acting: Much of the writing is directly from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's richly-crafted short stories and the lines that aren't fit in perfectly with the rest to make a cohesive and engrossing narrative. The characters are all distinct from one another and brought to life by the talented actors portraying them. There are the occasional awkward elements but they are not the norm and are easily forgiven.Cons:>Conclusions. The journey is so excellent that it makes the lackluster conclusions at the end stick out like a sore thumb. You're progressing along, pairing clues together to make deductions, the whole picture starts coming together and you think you finally have some solid theories. At this point you, like any self-respecting investigator, you'll probably want to formulate a couple tests that will systematically prove or disprove the validity of each theory until only the true one remains. That would be the logical and scientific thing to do, which is what Sherlock Holmes is all about after all. But no. At this point the game artificially cuts you short, tells you that there is nothing more you can do, and you simply have to guess between the valid conclusions. Occasionally there was a case where only one answer made use of ALL the acquired evidence, but more often than not the ending was completely (and intentionally) ambiguous. In L. A. Noire this sort of uncertainty played directly into the theme of harsh realities in investigations that it was trying to convey, but it's not fitting here where you are meant to be the great Sherlock Holmes. Honestly I finished these levels feeling like a cheat, as if Sherlock had no idea of the truth, but had simply gotten good at spinning yarns that will convince people to believe in his random guesswork.>Loading. The game takes a long time to load the settings and it does a lot of it. You'll frequently have to travel back and forth between areas and every time you do you'll have to sit through a lengthy loading sequence. To make matters worse, often you'll load an area just to have another loading screen, this one to prepare a cutscene for that location.In conclusion, this Sherlock Holmes game is flawed, but it wasn't such as to ruin my entire experience. Frogwares has absolutely nailed atmosphere, faithful recreation of Doyle's stories, and basic gameplay. I have high hopes that in their next outing they can rectify its few (but serious) remaining issues for a truly sublime experience.			"

												Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments is the latest and allegedly penultimate instalment of Frogware`s series about Arthur Conan Doyle`s famous creation. SH:C&P consists of six separate cases, each taking approximately two hours or thereabouts. Two of these cases, namely, Black Peter and Abbey Grange are from the original Holmesian canon and if you are a `loyalist`, so to speak, you may follow the same line of reasoning in the original stories. SH:C&P, however, has no `wrong` paths in the game - each story features multiple leads and these are supported by various types of evidence. When you observe a fact, it is displayed on your `Deduction Board` which, this time, is an image of myriad neurons and nodes in Holmes` brain (presumably). Everytime you come up with a piece of information, there are two deductions you may derive from it, which in turn corresponds to other such deductions. Furthermore, in the end of each case, you are asked to decide whether you`d arrest or absolve the culprits. When looked at the right light, each case has an equal weight about such actions and thus, there are no clear-cut moral choices. This translates into a good deal of replayability.SH:C&P gameplay consists of 1st / 3rd person navigation as well as `sixth sense` type of perception, which highlights various clues around Sherlock Holmes. A good deal of the game revolves around dialogues, which may become more resourceful if you manage to collect more clues pertaining to your interlocutor. One rule-of-thumb may be using the portrait icon below the dialogue options before starting an interview. This allows the player to observe the interviewee and pick up on various details upon their person, such as missing buttons, dirty fingernails and other such details that Sherlock Holmes is known to be attentive about. The benefit of this becomes apparent in the Quick Time Events (QTEs) in dialogues - if a character makes a statement about which you have a rebuttal (e.g. catching their lies etc.) your prior observations may provide the correct answer.Occasionally, Holmes is required to conjure a setting, in which he imagiens how a certain chain of events has occurred. This works similar to the sixth sense feature and one needs to reconstruct the chain of events by following the possible routes in the scene at hand.Overall, the game is remarkable in its design, setting and challenges. The only drawback is perhaps its rather disappointing length. However considering the replayability it offers, this can easily be disregarded.9 / 10			"

												There's a slight low-budget feel, and by the end they lean a little heavily on the lockpick mechanic, but otherwise this is a very enjoyable and surprisingly funny game.  The story is very loose, it's basically just six unrelated crimes that Sherlock Holmes sets about solving for various different reasons, but that allows you to just concentrate on the actual fun of solving the crimes instead of worrying about what little plot there is.  Each crime is well constructed and allows you a lot of leeway in terms of how you go about solving it, and plenty of freedom to make all the wrong choices/deductions/conclusions etc.  The biggest downside is probably the frequent dashing back and forth between locations, necessitating loading screens of Holmes and Watson sitting reading in their carriage.  You can review the crimes during this period but I imagine most players would probably just sit waiting for the ""click to continue"" button.At the end of each case you can replay it and see how things could have worked out different based on making different deductions from the clues you gather.  While there is always a ""correct"" answer, you get freedom in what you do with that information, and one of the funnest parts of the game is agonizing over whether to condemn a suspect, let them get away with it, or do your best to reduce the severity of their punishment.  A very fun game, very recommended.			"

												There's a section when you play as Toby, Sherlock's basset hound.  10/10 would sniff againBut seriously though, I've been searching high and low for a good detective mystery game, and this scratches that itch so perfectly.  My only complaint is that, in one of the cases, I knew the right answer in the first minute of the case, but it took a long, winding, at times frustrating road to eventually get there.The controls can be a little awkward at times, but that's fine because nothing (outside of a few skippable mini-games) is timed, so it's a good game to sit back, get completely engrossed, and solve a mystery.  Highly recommended for fans of the genre and/or everything Sherlock.			"

												This is a very good adventure / detective game reminiscent of LA Noir. As the legendary detective, Sherlock Holmes, you go around 19th century London solving crimes for the police. The graphics and the art style render 1890's London very well. All of the location that you visit on each case are very detailed and believable. The voice acting is superb throughout the game, and the music and ambient sounds set the mood very well.Throughout the game you'll have to question all of the people involved in the particular case and gather all of the evidence that you can find. Then using Holmes' deductive powers, you'll have to link all of the pieces together and accuse somebody of committing the crime. All of the cases have multiple suspects and multiple conclusions, and you can easily convict an innocent man if you are not paying attention.If you enjoy adventure games, this one is a no brainer.

												This is the best Sherlock Holmes you can get. Forget BBCs 'sociopath' for dummies or RDJs 'Mr Cool'. (But not Sir Ian McKellen, he was wicked)Pros: - graphics. the look and atmosphere are the there - cases, there is six and the first three were a delight.       from murder to vanishing trains, it's diverse and entertaining - finding the cuplrit. you have to put the clues together and decide who will face the law - disguises, well, kind of - little minigames to further the investigation - pig carcass testing!! - Cameos from nearly everyone, Mycroft, Lestrade, Watson (duh) and othersCons: - loading times. way too many, way too long - stiff animations - some times wooden voice acting - not the best performanceVerdict:For fans of P&Cs and adventure games, Crime and Punishment surely is a treat.Dense stories and thrilling mysteries make it easy to forget the often lifeless performances.Become Holmes and detect, deduct and conclude, all in your hand.If you are bored or put off by the recent big and small screen exploits of Sherlock Holmes, then here you might find a more mature and focused take on the character.

												Frogwares has focused on Sherlock Holmes Games for over 10 yrs,that's what makes u think they indeed did pretty well on them,yah? but after playing the testament of SH,I nearly lost all of my interest on Frogwares. When I saw this game, I decided to trust it one more time,and it completerly surprised me. I used 15hrs to finish all six cases. Although I don't know how long it takes to finish for other players(i think 15hrs will be better than most of others), I really enjoyed the game because of its fantanstic graphics and some interesting detecting skills which Holmes uses. The price of this game is a little bit expensive,so I know when you will be confused whether you should buy it or not, here is my advice---you don't need to be worried, you can just buy it when it's discounted, like around $20 or $30. Truly, $5 for each case is not a bad deal. I are sure you will love it.			"

												I sure am impressed by this game. The graphics look really nice with detailed backgrounds and plenty of figures populating them. The developers really did a lovely job of bringing Victorian London to life. The voice overs are also quite good.The game does a good job of making you feel like you are a detective. The puzzles are perhaps a little simple (opening locks, finding patterns, mixing reagents, etc.) but the cases themselves require some thought and have several possible outcomes, including accusing an innocent suspect. The cases run in a faily linear fashion. You usually have one or two tasks to complete at any one time and the game triggers new events and offers new tasks when you've completed the previous ones. As the detective you do control which sites you (re)visit and what evidence and clues you want to collect before talking with the witnesses and suspects. The game then lets you connect the clues in a map until you arrive at a suspect to accuse. Successfully connecting clues also opens up new tasks and associated puzzles or minigames. A very nice touch is how you can look at the people in detail and pick up on the hints Holmes needs so he can deduce things about the person. The detailed character models really shine here.If you enjoy adventure games and light puzzling, then this is the game for you.			"

Now about the game.It was fun to play and solve the crimes. Deductions and conclusions are nicely done and the thing that, all these cases are from the books which is perfect.Animations, graphics etc are acceptable. To be honest, i have never found myself thinking about the graphics since i was so into the cases.If you like crime solving games and have a good story too its a bargain. 7.5/10 "

												I basically joined steam because I was on a big Sherlock kick (reading the books) and the gamer boyfriend told me the Sherlock games were on sale. I am a VERY casual gamer, usually stick to generic console games and DS because I SUCK at button mashing. I had not been introduced to the world of point and click games that were puzzle based, and I gotta say they're now my favourite genre. These types of games are great for people like me who enjoy rich stories, great graphics, and interesting puzzles... but maybe aren't so good with reaction times, or the first person shooters. ;) The voice actor for Sherlock is super interesting. I could listen to him narrate and talk all day! The puzzles were a good range from easy to challenging, and there was the option to opt out if you were stuck. (though I wouldn't do that, just look up a tutorial!)You occasionally play as Watson or the dog Toby and that's pretty cool. The controls are fairly simple. This game is different than the other Sherlock games. Not only is the movement and graphics better, but the world itself is very rich. It's almost like a choose your own adventure. You draw up your OWN conclusions and there are multiple outcomes for a case. Which I found really interesting because it shows you the percentage of people who played the game and got the same outcome as you!It's tricky to get all the achievements and likely needs do be played 2-3 times due to all the possible outcomes. This game is LARGE however. It's not one story like the previous games, but several. Something you can really sink your teeth into. Some of the actions can get a bit reptitive, and it would be nice if there was one common storyline linking everything together. But I still really enjoyed it and am super happy to hear they're making another!!!			"

												Any Sherlock fans must buy this game immediately.  I wish I didn't even buy it during the sale to encourage the publishers to continue their brilliant work.  It allows you to step into the mind of the great detective and solve the cases yourself.  My only complaint was that some of the case conclusions were a bit too easy, but otherwise the difficulty was perfect in that it wasn't too mind numbing but not a breeze either.  Thank you for taking the time to portray Sherlock and Watson faithfully to Arthur Conan Doyle's creation.			"

												Trailers are good, and the music in them. But no only that I have a lot of experience in this. I didn't have this on steam before but I did a manual install from a disc. But this game is excellent and i just figured out you can take the serial code and put it on steam. Its out right hilarious sometimes. The deductive work you do in this game is fun. It takes time you can't just skip through it and do your own thing.The case that you do are hard, challenging and ultimately challenge your mind. I honestly think this is better then  L.A Noire which was of course a huge hit. Of course i would understand why. But thank you for this game you guys did a great job. I recommend this to anyone interested in detective work. Or just to take up time and figure out stuff and put your brain to the test. Good Luck ;)			"

												Only finished the first case till now. Here are my thoughts on the game.Excellent investigation/mystery solving game especially for fans of Sherlock Holmes stories. However all cases are murder mysteries. There could have been other types of mysteries (for example: Robbery, Accidents and Disappearances). I do recommend this game but only in sale (50% - 70% off). An expansion for the game will be a good news. Furthermore some cases should be linked in order to form a complex plot/ story. Proffesor Moriarty would be a welcome rival add to the atmosphere of the game.			"

												I've played many, many point-and-click mystery games, and many games based on Sherlock Holmes. This is, by far, one of the best I've ever encountered. It's seamlessly designed, beautifully crafted, amusing, intriguing, and unique. So, full and absolute recommendation.The true moment where this game shines above all other Sherlock-ian homages is in the final moments of each case. Once you've collected all the evidence and pieced together the puzzle, you're presented with multiple ""conclusions,"" that is, multiple theories of the crime that can fit the facts and evidence. While collecting all the evidence isn't too difficult, figuring out which theory is correct relies entirely on the player interpreting the facts, leaving you, and you alone, to make that final decision.What's more, even once you've made your decision, you're given yet another choice: how will you close the case? And here, there's no correct, or incorrect, answer, leaving the ending of each story entirely up to the player, dependent on what you believe is the appropriate moral choice.The combination of strict deductive methods and a very true-to-the-source portrayal of Holmes with this moral ambiguity actually got me to care about what I was doing in the game, to pay attention to the dialogue and plots moreso than just to solve the case. That, to me, is the best win a mystery series could accomplish.However - PARTIAL SPOILER ALERT BELOW - - NO REALLY THIS MAY RUIN A REVEAL FOR YOU - - LAST CHANCE - I have one caveat, concerning one, single scene, which happens to be the penultimate scene of the game and not actually associated with any of the individual cases.There's ... some attempt at an overarching plot thread that lurks in the background of the cases and cumulates in a final confrontation after the last case is solved. You end up sitting through a cutscene that involves a militant revolutionary group explaining their motivations, which is very anti-aristocracy. If you lean left, you might call it a group of Victorian-era ""99%"" protesters. If you lean right, you might call them communist terrorists.Either way it comes across as more than a little preachy, especially since, no matter what option you pick, you can't actually arrest them. (I could be wrong, because I haven't replayed the game with every alternate moral choice path to see if being a hard case could change that last scene, but I highly doubt it would. If you can arrest them, it's still weird, though, see below.) It's not because the game forces you to sympathize with them: it's stated, if you decide against the group, that Holmes lets them go because he's irritated at the person who needs to deal with them. Still, the fact that you sit through the leader's heated defense of his cause and then can't have them all arrested, and the wording choice in the final scene, indicates a very strong political preference on the part of the game designers.Normally I would shrug and move on. It's their game; if I had fun playing it, and was engaged by the story, then a political or philosophical message is just an interesting element of the experience. The problem here is that the rest of the game is SO very wonderful by comparison, and so very well crafted to give the player that control over moral choice. Being given this ultimate choice that doesn't really represent a moral choice undermined the entire system.Morover, Holmes is a very anti-political character. Anyone who's read the original stories will tell you that Holmes is the kind of man who has memorized the law and lives by it, and doesn't give a damn about politics. Much as modern interpretations might give him depth of feelings or awarenesses, the classic Holmes, which this game was trying very much to emulate, would never allow a group of people who admitted to planning and organizing a large-scale violent act to flee in order to potentially commit more violent crimes.FINAL VERDICT - Fantastic game that I loved deeply and could not stop playing, though I really wish the last two scenes just didn't exist because they kind of ruin it.

												So I finished this game...and I don`t know I must recommend it or not.But I know exactly that chapter worse than ""The Testament of Sherlock Holmes"".-Firstly the puzzles became much easier and it`s very sad because without difficult puzzles this game can`t be called "" Sherlock Holmes:XXX"".WARNING! In this game you can ONLY open the same locks and no more puzzles!!!!!- Secondly when you need to search documents in encyclopedia you need just read title and NO more.For example in "" SH: Nemesis"" you need to guess ciphered in the name of book riddle and then you`ll can find the right book. -Thirdly in this game you can investigate 6 different crimes and they really short.I got used to long story and it`s very good and interesting but here...-Fourthly. Watson is very useless in this game.It`s really unright. He is doctor and he has piece of knowledge of Sherlock Holmes and he use nothing at all.-The next problem. You always have the list of tasks and you know what you need to do everywhere and everytime. It makes game very very easy.About advantages.+Graphics looks nice but could be better.+The piece of the last crime is good because it`s connected with ""SH:Jack the Ripper"" and i remembered about good time in that game.My opinion 7/10. No more.			"

												this game is the closest game to make u have the feeling that u are sherlock holmes if u love sherlock holmes or puzzle games u will love this it does suffer from making u go back a forth alot but thats a issue with most puzzle games and it doesnt take u out the experience or stops u from solving the case so its forgiveable and in later cases u can accuse the wrong person which makes the game intresting and makes u feel like u have a output in the way the game plays out heres my full review

												Nothing in this game really excels, I wouldn't say that it was a bad experience, I had fun and enjoyed experiencing the game. But the flaws in the game are very noticeable, clunky controls, very linear and easily solvable cases, pointless filler action to make you feel like you are doing something when the game is just holding your hand through the experience. I don't feel mad though, I think that the developer is just caught in this awkward phase in gaming where certain aspects are expected of a game like detailed background environments, realistic character models, three dimensional environments that really felt superficial in this game. I'm sure this took a substantial amount of effort from the development team to make, but I feel it caused them to lose focus on the core aspects of the game like having truly branching case conclusions, clues as well as false leads and impactful endings to the cases themselves.You can find the full review over here on the Mouse & Controller blog: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2016/05/sherlock-holmes-crimes-and-punishments.html.

												So far I've played 3 cases and I must say this is one of the best mystery games I've ever played. The Testaments of Sherlock Holmes had a more of an adventure/puzzle feel while this one had a detective/adventure feel. The cases had a lot of areas where you can explore and find things that could be relevant to the case or irrelevant which makes the game amazing as a detective game, where you could overlook some very important clues and miss a possibility. There are many choices that you can make in your deductions and it requires thinking and retracing what you saw when you visited certain areas. After solving a case you can hit spacebar and find out if you were right or wrong and shows how many other players that solved the case like you did which I think it's fantastic. Overall I liked it much more than the last one and the graphics are amazing, really looking forward to the next one. :D			"

												Even though I didn't like ""Sherlock Holmes:  Crimes and Punishments,"" I'm going to recommend it.  As long as you like a fairly simple, point-and-click, detectiving-type of game, maybe you'll like it (the graphics and general production values are excellent).  The problem I had with it is that the sleuthing is pretty much buried under all the pointless, non-related mini-games you have to go through to get through the game (yes, you can skip them -- but, what's the point?).  I just couldn't accept that to figure out whodunnit, I'd have to figure out how to throw a harpoon correctly or push the right buttons at the right time to beat someone at arm-wrestling (that's where I quit).  Now, with that at-best-lukewarm recommendation out of the way, I'd also say that if you're going to buy it, get it on sale.  I'm a bit upset that I spent $10 (the current historic low price according to IsThereAnyDeal) on this and didn't like it.  I'd have been really upset if I'd paid anywhere near the list price of about $40 (especially considering that according to Steamspy, the average play time is about 14 hours).			"

												A positive thumbs down, but a thumbs down all the same. I didn't find the cases or locales very interesting and there was no  real mysteriousness or overarching plot to bring it together (why even include the merry men?). I also found the voice acting stiff, the unnecessary travel tedious with long load times every time and the game holds your hand in every aspect requiring almost no problem solving on your part.I didn't mind the deduction system because the vagueness is how the books work as well, but it's not really a positive either.

Graphically this game it's delightful, the details and the ambientation are wonderful. Only two cons, the game it's not very long (I finished in 20+ Hours) and the difficulty it's not too high. But if i'm sincere this is what you expect from an adventure game like this.			"

												This is to Sherlock Holmes as Arkham Asylum was to Batman.  It captures all the nuances of Sherlock Holmes PERFECTLY from his keen skills of perception and ability to piece together seemingly unimportant details down to his interactions with Watson.  You'll don disguises, perform ballistics experiments, and engage in fisticuffs every now and then as you solve 6 different mysteries based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's writings.  As a fan of this great literary character, I can't heap enough praise on this game.  This is the first game in this series I have played, and though I'm not expecting it's predecessors to be quite as advanced, I'm definitely looking forward to playing them to see how this series evolved to result in this masterpiece.

												The game makes you feel as though you are Sherlock Holmes, and does a good job of creating the character from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novels and writings of Sherlock Holmes. The many mini games are enjoyable, yet skippable, so you are not forced to play them. However in the game there are some clues (sometimes small) which are vital to the case that will not always be noted down as 'evidence', in Sherlock's journal. But this can help the game in a sense, because it ensures that you pay more attention to the little details. For some people though this may be a problem.It is very enjoyable, but there is ofcourse not a large amount of replay value, unless you want to see what happens when you convict the other suspects.

												Enjoyable piece of broken tosh.This is a first impression and I'll keep spoilers on story as low as possible.I'm sorry for the harsh entry but after over 3 months they still did not manage to weed out the crash problems. For what the forums say it's almost completely arbitrary which systems experience crashes and which do not aside from some unsupported Intel HD graphics cards or some weird controller issues.Aside from that the game is actually very enjoyable although that statement is highly subjective to be honest. At least if you are into detective games or a fan of Holmes, especially of the new movies (which Crimes and Punishemts orients itself to), the chances that you'll like this game are pretty high. The game looks good and even though it was developed with a controller in mind it plays quite well with mouse & keyboard BUT controlls are not rebindable, graphical options are very limited and not adjustable in-game. In fact you have to return to the main menu, go to the options menu, change whatever options you want changed and then manually restart the game. Dear devs, that's just lazy and unnessecary. Oh.. and the framerate is all over the place. Mostly stable at 60 but it drops frequently below 40 in some in-game menus, conversations and cutscenes which really puts you off.What really lets me not personally recommend this game though are the crashes. I experienced two in the first murder case. The first I could avoid by skipping the ""mini-game"" affected, the second though is not avoidable for me so far and prevents progression by continously crashing right after the interrogation of an important suspect. Therefore I am currently not able to provide more in-depth impressions.Once they fix their unstable mess of an otherwise reasonably good game I will gladly rework my First Impressions but until that happens consider this a carefull warning.Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments might or might not run on your system due to obviously bad optimizing. Even though I'm running this on a notebook my rig isn't all that exotic and I'm usually able to run even the most abysmal console ports as well as these things tend to run that is..Maybe worth mentioning is that there exist worakrounds for some crashes though the lack of specific error codes in my case makes troubleshooting kinda troublesome to say the least.So long,MeVriS			"

												Game has horrible loading times between each scene. In fact, after the loading screen, the game gives you a few more seconds of loading before you can finally play! You may find yourself waiting for a minute, then playing one, then waiting again. Loading is not just between scenes, but also every single time you initiate a dialogue or start a mini-game. While you may think that it won't be too bad, I can assure you that large parts of the game mainly feel like waiting for the loading screen to finish. I had to play games on my phone or Alt-Tab out of the game to browse the web. The waiting times completely break the immersion, especially as you are often forced the change scenes frequently.Overall, this game needs several more months of optimisation and bug fixing. I encountered several crashes and a game-breaking bug that forced me to replay a whole chapter. It is worth noting that you are not free to save anywhere, but are forced into an autosave system that will save the game even when a game-breaking bug has occured.Sadly, the game sufferes from the addition of mini-games, apparently to extend game time. While you can skip them, you will miss the achievements associated with them. It may also be worth noting that several of the achievements force you into certain moral choices or force you to replay the whole game (unless you look up spoilers beforehand) just to get the achievement.

On top of that their descriptions have been completely nonsensical so far and had nothing to do with the solution.Witness: Soul Suspect is a better detective game than this. A lot better. Because there you are actually doing detective job for 90% of the game. Hell, Deus Ex HR and MD have more ""detective"" gameplay than this.			"

												Cannot recommend this game for the price of 30 bucks. The murder stories are just.. a slight grips. There is no red line going through the whole game. Plus it's just a game written on the base of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novels so I cannot see why the price is so high: The script is already there. I would have wished a game where there original murder cases that would also allow a little bit... more deepness. Like... I didn't ""care"" for anyone. I didn't know their stories - well a little bit but not... you know what I mean.So ya.. I bought it for 15 bucks in the summer sale - still not recommendeble. Get it for 10 or don't get it at all.

												I wanted so much to enjoy this game, but it's almost jaw-droppingly awful. It feels like a watered-down, poor imitation of LA Noire, without the worldbuilding or possibility of failure. It is not possible to lose this game, and so every action feels - and is - meaningless. The scenery, character details and environments are beautiful. But the mechanics, writing, deductions, and flow are just...terrible.The cases themselves are familiar and - with the exception of the Kew Gardens case - mind-numbingly dull. The amount of puzzle mini-games is vastly reduced, which is lucky, because when they do pop up, they feel clumsy and frustratingly pointless. Supposedly ""ambiguous"" conclusions are anything but; by the end of each investigation, you have been pointed almost irresistably toward the correct answer, and your moral choices have ZERO EFFECT on the game as a whole. Zero. This is not The Walking Dead Game, where your decisions will come back to haunt you. The wasted potential here is incredibly frustrating.By far the worst aspect of the game are the interminable load times. If it takes you an hour to solve a case, at least 40 minutes of that hour will be spent staring at Holmes as he sits in his carriage, or trying vainly to distract yourself in his 'brain space' while you wait. This is made worse by the fact that the game loves nothing better than to send you back and forth to different locations to perform a single action, then back and forth again to analyze your results, and so on. Most disappointing of all is the utter laziness of the writing. The cases are entirely unconnected to each other. Writers, a few lines of dialogue scattered between opening sequences and then cooked into a baffling, completely irrelevent ending scene does not make for a satisfying conclusion. The final conversation before the end credits is just...what? Is it meant to foreshadow a future game? I'd rather have an explanation of what just occured in THIS one. As much as I love the Sherlock Holmes stories in all their formats, this just wasn't enjoyable. If you're looking for something clever and diverting, the Testament of Sherlock Holmes was miles beyond this installment. Time to hire some new writers and raise your expectations, Frogware. What a mess.			"

												I wish there was an inbetween choice. Thumbs flat? Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments is not a bad game; it's just incredibly repetetive. I found the deductions to be quite fun, piecing together clues to come to a conclusion, and choosing to absolve to condemn the guilty party. Unfortunately, there aren't enough combinations for how you can solve a case, which is limiting, and the game lacks the ability for conversations to go the wrong way, like in L.A. Noire. Everything is set out for you in this game.While it is kind of tempting to play through the game again to witness every morale decision, it's the kind of game which was boring halfway through, and due to how linear the game is, it provides very little replayability.

												Dreadful. This game takes everything that was bad about its Darker&Edgier predecessor, and dials it up to 11:- The game has no narrative backbone. It is a collection of unconnected mini-cases of no grander significance. Holmes could have easily have ignored them and the world would have kept spinning as before.- The engine is technologically inferior. The locations are very small and underwhelming, and yet you still have super long and disruptive loading screens. Most adventure and action games of this era blow it out of the water.- The plot departs fundamentally from the Holmesian, scientific, deductive way of solving cases. All the solutions feature heavy guesswork. More like Poirot than Holmes really.- The game holds your hand so much, it's almost impossible to miss anything. It's downright patronizing at times.- Watson is completely useless. Even Lestrade seems more intelligent and grounded.			"

The atmosphere for the game is great. The graphics, settings, and ambient music all help to immerse yourself into the story and world of Sherlock Holmes. The voice acting is also well done, in particular for Holmes and Watson. My first complaint is with a core mechanic of the game; gathering and organizing clues. Often, gathering clues is relegated to simply clicking wherever the game will allow you to. For example, when scanning a person’s body/clothing for clues about their personality, you simply click wherever your cursor turns blue. Similarly, organizing the information you get can be a “Click until you get it right” affair. For example, you pair pieces of evidence together to draw conclusions. You can simply click randomly over and over until the pieces match up. There is no logic or puzzle solving skills needed.However, as you begin gathering evidence, you will need to take that evidence you’ve been given and figure out whodunit.  This is, in my opinion, the best part of the game and where you really do feel like Sherlock Holmes. You put together different pieces of evidence to visually map out different possible conclusions. Evaluating all the evidence and figuring out what actually happened can be very engaging and rewarding.You must also make moral choices. Are you sympathetic to the guilty party due to their circumstances? Do you let them go or force them to face the full wrath of the law? Like The  Walking Dead, the game will compare the logical and moral choices you make with other players.For my fellow Sherlock Holmes fans, I’d definitely suggest picking this up. If you are into investigation games/books, I think it’s worth considering. However, if you aren’t a fan of the genre at all I don’t think that this game is going to change your mind.			"

												Sadly, was very disappointed with this game. Being the first Shelock Holmes game I have played, it left much t obe desired.  I was only able to get through the first mission of the game due to the bland content of the mission and the slow pace of the game.  I was able to predict what certain clues would lead you too, but the slow load screens and barbaric travelling system made the mission drag on. The long cutscenes were boring as well delivering less and less excite as you saw more. Below are Pros and Cons of Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments:Pros:-The ability to conclude the wrong suspect.-The ability to go back and play through to find the right suspect.-Graphics and artCons:-Price: $40 is a rip off for a game such as this, wait for a big sale as I assume it will come shortly.-Controls-Load Screens/ Cut scene length-Bland opening mission, that has caused me to no longer play the game.-The lack of the game ability to keep up with the players thoughts.

												An interesting and enjoyable, if a bit rough, investigation game that actually allows you to do the investigation, rather then following the scripted sequence. Environments and characters are beautiful and rich, while still holding quite firmly to their setting. the suspect profile mechanic is well suited to the game and shows off the obvious care that has been put into both in the polygons and in the planning. So well constructed are the models that it comes as a shock when Sherlock's pet basset hound, Toby, is added as a mechanic in later cases and is modelled somewhat inexpertly, leaving him with a model that is merely good among a cast of great.The ""deduction"" system that acts as part hint system, part progress meter and part inventory system for clues is a unique addition to the genera. It's fortunately flexible enough to allow you to follow the case in your own route, revealing enough information to grease the mechanics, without washing away all the challenge. The imagination system is a rich concept that is tragically underutilized. This unique mechanic allows Sherlock to simulate events and see how they would fit the facts. The 2 or 3 times it's used to it's fullest effect, it's dead-on in terms of tone, style and function, but it's often not utilized, utilized only minimally, or outright replaced by other, similar, less well polished mechanics. suffers a little bit from adventure game syndrome, but a lot less than many other games; there were only 3 places where I felt a puzzle was contrived for progress reasons or arbitrarily gated, and most of those could have been easily lamp-shaded away with some dialogue exposing the in-universe explanation.  The path based lock-picking mechanic is a bit weird, but it's nice to have something other then literal bumping or rotational hotspot systems, and it works with the narrative of Sherlock ""deducting"" the lock open.There are some technical issues as well. One puzzle was simply impossible to complete due to a crash to desktop, and I’ve seen reports of others seeing similar issues with other puzzles. Fortunately, these aren't game-blocking, thanks to the developers including a no-guilt skip button on nearly every puzzle, acting as a pressure valve on frustrating puzzles (and the rare crashy sequence). the major complaint that I have is that there is clearly a ""right"" answer to every case, but the cases are structured so many of the different solutions fit just as tightly. the discovery of the ""right"" solution in some of the cases is partially trial and error, and partially jumping on the train of thought of the designer; in one case, quite literally. I often felt less like a masterful Sherlock, and more bumbling Watson, when it came to wrapping the case, comparing two or three equally explanatory, equally comprehensive, and sometimes equally incomplete, explanations for the same set of facts and clues. of additional frustration, the punishment phase of every case includes a ""moral choice"" to absolve or punish the suspect. while there is no ""right"" answer, the choice is a false one, as which choice you make doesn't affect the ending of the case very much, but affects the epilogue substantially in non-obvious ways. the designers clearly had a ""right"" ending in mind and In a game all about the freedom to follow the clues and act upon the evidence, the decision to base the final ending upon unrelated choices from unrelated situations seems discordant and atonal. In all, it's a highly polished, well built and interesting take on an area of culture that is largely absent from gaming.  At ~12 hours and ~US$30, it's well worth the little bit of frustration for the feeling of being the Great Sherlock Homes.			"

Each episode has its own look and feel with a different theme: Roman baths, elaborate gardens, wealthy estates, etc. The dialogue and voice acting are excellent.The puzzles aren't hard, so the game moves along at a pleasingly quick pace. I only had to consult a walkthrough once. This would be a really nice game to try out as a first foray into the adventure genre.It's very fun to try and put the clues together at the end of the case to make the right decision. I actually decided incorrectly on one of the cases, so it's not always a completely obvious foregone conclusion. You do have to think.			"

												A very pleasant surprise. This game surprised me by having a pretty sophisticated way that events can chain and collide to produce many different results. For fans of the stories, it's a great reimagining. I can't say for sure if it will impress those who aren't familiar with Doyle's books but simply like adventure games, but I think it ought to work for both kinds of players.As with any adventure game, there are occasional snags where you think the elements are uncovered but the game requires one more tiny nudge to prove that you've understood. Those rare occasions can be a little frustrating, but aside from that it's a very polished indie game with a lot to recommend it. Some people have complained that they weren't entirely sure if they'd got the right man/woman at the end of each case - if that happens to you, you probably haven't solved the crime correctly. I think it's good that the game allows you to get it wrong without telling you plainly, and only shows you that you were right if you were right, but not everyone will see that as a strength.			"

												Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments ReviewYes Watson, it is elementary.... we have a very solid 3rd person Detective game here.It is certainly an improvement on the previous instalment of the series with better gameplay, better graphics, better deduction system, but still some room for improvement.I won't be doing a detailed review on this one as it will inevitably create spoilers. I will however note that each case has several possible conclusion (wrong and correct ones) and it is possible to get carried away by a wrong version or uncertainty. If however you are paying attention to all clues (which are not that hard to find) and apply common logic you would not have issues with this game, you will enjoy it.Time wise, if you go slow and read through all the in-game materials you are looking at 15-17 hours of gameplay.On the negative side I can say that once you get hold of it the game becomes easy, controls are a bit glitchy, and there is a lack of British humour (there is some, but could have been more).All in all this is a solid detective game that flows in an interactive story of each individual case you work on. 7/10For more reviews join my group - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ogrreview/  "

												Offers pretty much everything you'd expect from a Sherlock Holmes game.The first four cases in particular are outstanding, almost flawless even. The avid Sherlock Holmes reader will find at least two of them quite easy to solve, though.Unfortunately the last two cases feel very rushed, lacking the detail and depth that the first four cases offered. I guess it's safe to assume that a deadline was the culprit here.All in all, even with the disappointing ending (33% of cases, maybe closer to 20-25% of play time), this game can still be recommended. A Sherlock Holmes fan will most likely not regret buying the game at full price, it's the best SH adventure yet and the production quality is simply amazing, at a discounted price this is a must buy/play for everyone who enjoys adventure games.

												In my opinion, this Sherlock Holmes game is the best Frogwares has created to date. I found myself fully engaged and as a Sherlock Holmes' fan, utterly delighted.Pros: -Shorter cases. I enjoyed the longer cases in previous games, but felt the shorter cases were easier to wrap my mind around and get a complete sense of the whole mystery. It was also easier then to sift through evidence and come to a sound conclusion.-Getting to come to your own conclusion. In the previous games, Holmes guided you through. In these games, you ARE the detective. And you can get it wrong. It makes the game all that more intense since I know I can lose.-The ease of assessing information. The file system makes it easy to look over all the information you have gathered. The deduction board was is an ingenious way to put the clues together. You make links between different information and evidence to form conclusions and there can be multiple conclusions.-The mysteries are solvable. I do not like it when a mystery game's answer comes out of nowhere and you feel that you never had a chance to solve it. The mysteries in this game are all solvable. If you go over the clues, review evidence, reread dialogue and think about it, you can get the right answer. I got all but one of them correct. I had determined to go over all the evidence thoroughly before deciding on a final answer and that helped. But still, pressing the button to launch my conclusion always had me nervous! I looked back over all the evidence of the one mystery I solved incorrectly and realized what erroneous conclusions I had drawn.-In my opinion, the best addition is the morality choices. In Conan Doyle's stories, Holmes often makes moral decisions concerning the fate of the culprits. He does not consider himself necessarily bound by conventional law. The morality choices were an added layer that made the game all the more real and like the Holmes stories.-Two of the stories are Conan Doyle stories. They were modified a little, but not enough to take away Conan Doyle's original plots. I am a Conan Doyle fan and so enjoyed getting to play his own stories. One was an obscure enough story that I recognized it, but didn't remember much about it and so had to figure it out along with all the other mysteries. The other I knew very well and flew through the case, but it was still fun to be in the story.-The variety of the cases. Nothing was redundant. Each case was unique and completely held my interest.-Telescope easter egg. So funny.Cons: -As someone who adores the Conan Doyle stories, I didn't like the characterization of Mycroft. It seems the thing these days in recreated Holmes stories and shows to make Sherlock and his brother antagonists. They just are not like this in Conan Doyle's stories. At one point, Sherlock tells Watson in one of the Conan Doyle stories that he has gone to Mycroft at times for help. And if Mycroft were to show up asking Sherlock for help, he would not be indifferent.-The characterizations of Watson and Holmes also suffer a little. Watson is turned more towards the bumbling idiot Watson. Sherlock is made more aloof and cold than in previous games.-In one of the mysteries, a clue is worded in such a way that it can lead the player to an incorrect conclusion. I decided to ignore the wording in light of other evidence and that led me to the right answer, but I was worried it would be incorrect because of the clue wording.-There is less freedom to explore your environment than in previous games.  The game boxes you into an area and if you wander to the edge throws the map in your face. That was a little off putting and reminded me I was playing a game. I would have rather Holmes had said something like, ""There is nothing interesting over there.""-Final screen. Once you've finished the whole game it seems like there is going to be a cut scene, but nothing happens.			"

												I really enjoyed this game. The graphics are beautiful and the Victorian settings look and feel realistic without any noticeable anachronisms. Each episode has its own look and feel with a different theme: Roman baths, elaborate gardens, wealthy estates, etc. The dialogue and voice acting are excellent.The puzzles aren't hard, so the game moves along at a pleasingly quick pace. I only had to consult a walkthrough once. This would be a really nice game to try out as a first foray into the adventure genre.It's very fun to try and put the clues together at the end of the case to make the right decision. I actually decided incorrectly on one of the cases, so it's not always a completely obvious foregone conclusion. You do have to think.			"

												Offers pretty much everything you'd expect from a Sherlock Holmes game.The first four cases in particular are outstanding, almost flawless even. The avid Sherlock Holmes reader will find at least two of them quite easy to solve, though.Unfortunately the last two cases feel very rushed, lacking the detail and depth that the first four cases offered. I guess it's safe to assume that a deadline was the culprit here.All in all, even with the disappointing ending (33% of cases, maybe closer to 20-25% of play time), this game can still be recommended. A Sherlock Holmes fan will most likely not regret buying the game at full price, it's the best SH adventure yet and the production quality is simply amazing, at a discounted price this is a must buy/play for everyone who enjoys adventure games.

												Great investigation game, far superior to the previous one since it takes all the interesting parts [investigating cases] while discarding the rest [pointless minigames, quiestionable playability and weird plot]. There's a lot of handholding in the form of the ""task list"" but then you don't really have to look at it.For boargame fans, it feels similar to Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective, with some additional handholding and fewer characters in each case.

												       I'm a big fan of Sherlock Holmes games. I have almost all of Focus' (with the exception of maybe one) games. We all know that a few of their games are not all that....great, but I've enjoyed watching them grow as a company and seeing how they've evolved. And Crime and Punishments is a huge testament to what they've accomplished. I think this a very well put together game. The story is fantastic, The visuals are great, and if you really are having a super hard time with a puzzle, you can skip it. I'm glad they kept the original voice actors, cause otherwise I don't think it would have been the same for me. I wouldn't give a high replayability (you've played the game once, it doesn't really change from there) but I haven't played for about a year now so since I was cracking it open once again I thought I owed them a review for all the time I've enjoyed with it. I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Sherlock Holmes and point and clicks (while it's not a point n' click per say it does have the level of ""use this with that to make this"" and such). I wouldn't recommend the logic to much as it is honestly quite easy but it does make you feel envolved. And for being the price that it is if you're not desperate for it (as I was when it first came out) then I'd wait for it to go on sale, it always does during the summer and winter sales.                                                                                                                           -Brandi			"

												This is, without a shadow of a doubt, my favourite Sherlock Holmes game yet. The deduction system which allows for multiple conclusions gives the game great depth in comparison to the previous installations. Another interesting feature is the ability to read people by freezing time and studying details about clothing, expressions and appearance which gives unique dialogue options. Additionally, the graphics allow for fantastic immersion and clearer view of the objects around you, which makes clue-finding more natural. This is something that always bugged me in the older Sherlock games (I still have nightmares about Mystery of the Mummy). The voice acting is a lot better this time around, but it's nothing exceptional.The only issue I have with Crimes and Punishments is its longevity, as a full completion of the game clocks at about 15 hours if played slowly, with a total of 6 great cases of varied difficulty. Would I like to play more? Yes. Is it still worth the money? Definitely yes.			"

												Simply put, Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments is one of the finer adventure/crime solving games I've played. The writing is excellent, and each case will intrigue. The lack of a coherent overarching storyline is a tad disappointing, but that's simply not the focus of the game. It follows Sherlock Holmes doing what he does best - solving crimes and administering punishments.The atmosphere and overall presentation are quite on point as well. Some of the animation can be stiff, but the overall attention to detail is commendable nonetheless. If someone has a limp, you can guarantee that they'll actually walk with a limp in the game. The texture and general location quality is also of note. While the game isn't taxing by any means, it looks gorgeous cranked up to maximum settings with detailed recreations of Ye Olde London. There isn't much music, but it's used to good effect when it pops up, and helps set a much darker tone and feeling than most Sherlock Holmes properties.Finally, the detective and puzzle gameplay itself. It's quite good! The puzzles never become extraordinarily difficult, but they strike a nice balance between needing actual thought and not being so complex as to slow down the pace of the story. There's good variety here, as well, with a number of small, mini-game esque challenges to beat (though they can be skipped if that's not your thing), interrogations, autopsies, crime reconstructions and even a few notable sequences of trying to rebuild the sequence of events in Holmes' imagination. You won't need a membership in Mensa to make progress here, but it will challenge just enough to make you feel like Sherlock Holmes himself. Ultimately, given that the game has his name on it, that's probably the biggest praise I can give this.			"

												Wonderful game overall, nice asthetics and visuals, sometimes the voice acting and lip syncing was questionable. Cases were interesting and unique from one another, and the methods in which you solved cases was really neat. The unfortunate downside to this title is the lack of a story, sure each case it's own story but there wasn't anything holding them together, I would have preferred the kind of story ideas and tone they had played with in the Pretty Little Crimes trailer. I also would have liked a more open area to explore, rather than just a courtyard or a small street.     +graphics     +unique case solving methods     +multiple endings/possibilities per case     +classic sherlock humor      -lip syncing     -lack of deep story/connection     -restricted/small explorable areas throughout the game     -long loading screens     8.5/10			"

												If you are a fan of Sherlock Holmes - play it! This one's better than The Testament of SH. Beautiful scenes and enjoyable voice acting. As it happens, Watson is so dumb it's annoying but nevertheless the character of SH himself makes this game. The cases mainly evolve around murders and have multiple outcomings (which you might not always guess right during the first search of clues).Some weaknesses are the difficulty (too many UI hints, ""use vision now!"") and in some cases the jumps from location to location if you only need to pick up an ""object of interest"" you could have taken with you the last time you were there but the game did not let you.I am still not sure if I liked the ending. I don't see SH wanting to be involved in higher politics and making those decisions. "

												Amazing visuals, like a postcard from Victorian England or a screenshot from Masterpiece Theatre. I keep wanting to reach out and touch the skin textures. The deduction board allows the game to avoid the linear inevitability that most mystery games end up offering, and it really helped me think through things. At the end of the first case I felt 90% sure, yet still hesitated at my conclusion, wondering whether I had paid enough attention. It really does make you think without letting you reach your conclusions too far ahead. It also shows you what % of your fellow gamers reached the same conclusion.For those inclined to actual puzzles, there are ad hoc puzzles sprinkled throughout each case like lockpicking, which you can try to solve or mercifully skip when your brain is tired.These developers deserve a shot at an LA Noire-sized production. Would love to see a more open world, and the same LA Noire facial motion capture applied to these gorgeous models and textures.			"

												PROS:Amazing and fun game.  There are 6 cases all are super fun with a bunch of different outcomes.  At the end of the case you can see global stats on how people finshed them and choose to see the ""correct"" ending.  Althou that can spoil the replay value if you wanted to do the case again but it's very tempting to check and see if you did it correctly haha.I love this game so much that I just purchased the previous sherlock holmes game that came out made by the same company a couple years prior which is pretty identical in terms of gameplay.If you like mystery sort of things or games this is a must buy.CON:My only thing I'm kinda disappointed with is that from what I have read they don't plan on doing any DLC (more cases).  This is the sort of game that seems like they could make a fortune adding more cases over time but I guess maybe they wanna put their efforts totally into their next sherlock holmes game which is fine by me.

												Story:Ok (1/3)=============Graphics/Sounds:Great (3/3)=============Gameplay:Good (2/3)=============Replay Value:Low (0/1)=============Total:Fare (6/10)=============As a huge fan of the original stories, I always end up being disappointed in one way or another every time Frogwares makes a new Sherlock Holmes game. It is almost always the same experience: The games start great! You immediately find yourself at an enigmatic crime scene and get excited with all the newly added features and enhanced graphics and fall in love with the game within the first few minutes. However, Frogwares always successfully manages to let you down with a combination of inconsistencies in the plot, idiotic puzzles and graphical glitches. Fortunately Crimes and Punishments has a reasonably low number of these issues which makes it the least disappointing game in the series so far.Crimes and Punishments has a different structure compared to the previous Sherlock Holmes games. It consists of 6 different cases with different possible endings. Two of the cases are from the original series and are very nicely implemented. For each case you need to collect some evidence and make conclusions based on your discoveries. The main problem with the story is that in most of these cases there is not much that you can do wrong, in other words, as long as you click on every object that you stumble upon and don't miss any evidence, it is always pretty obvious who the criminal is. This makes the alternate endings of each case superfluous and lowers the replay value of the game.Both story and gameplay do not allow you to be very creative. There are two new vision modes added to the game. One allows Sherlock to notice subtleties that other people might miss and the other allows him to use his imagination and go back in time at the crime scene. These are supposed to be game-changing innovations that take the game to the ""next-level"", but they fail to elevate from a mere visual effect that you need to turn on every time the game asks you to do so. The problem is that the game will automatically tell you when you need to use your powers. If the vision icons are not on the left corner of the screen, you will know that you are not going to discover anything new by using your vision modes anyway. So every time you use these abilities it feels like you are following orders instead of being smart. This might have been acceptable if you could turn these ""hints"" off, or if this was an action FPS game, but in the adventure world you need to allow the players to be adventurous.There are a few technical issues in the game, such as long and unnecessary loading screens, Watson getting in your way in small rooms or corridors and etc. which could have been easily avoided but I think the amazing graphics and sound acting make up for these annoying bugs and make the overall gameplay experience enjoyable. If you are a Sherlock Holmes fan I absolutely recommend this game, but I would wait for it to go on sale first. "

												If you enjoy classic Sherlock Holmes, you will enjoy this game. The meat and potatoes of this game is the deduction system where you combine relevant clues together to find inferences, which allow for 1 of 2 interpretations that ultimately lead to different conclusions for the case. Its an enjoyable mechanic that makes you think and is supplemented by the ability to do character profiles of the suspects (rather simple) and QTE counters when the suspect is lying about a point based on the evidence you have. There are also puzzles but only a few are tricky.In terms of length, the game is fairly long for its type. Six cases, about 3-4 hours each. You get your money's worth.Graphically-speaking, this game is a definite improvement from its predecessors. I've played the older games and Frogware has come a long way. It still has its quirks- Watson was submerged halfway into the floor in one case and there are some occassional spelling errors in Sherlock's casebook.As a whole, a great game for what it is. The individual cases work better than perhaps one overly long story found in previous games in the series. Hopefully there are more games in the future with better polish.			"

												Simply put, Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments is one of the finer adventure/crime solving games I've played. The writing is excellent, and each case will intrigue. The lack of a coherent overarching storyline is a tad disappointing, but that's simply not the focus of the game. It follows Sherlock Holmes doing what he does best - solving crimes and administering punishments.The atmosphere and overall presentation are quite on point as well. Some of the animation can be stiff, but the overall attention to detail is commendable nonetheless. If someone has a limp, you can guarantee that they'll actually walk with a limp in the game. The texture and general location quality is also of note. While the game isn't taxing by any means, it looks gorgeous cranked up to maximum settings with detailed recreations of Ye Olde London. There isn't much music, but it's used to good effect when it pops up, and helps set a much darker tone and feeling than most Sherlock Holmes properties.Finally, the detective and puzzle gameplay itself. It's quite good! The puzzles never become extraordinarily difficult, but they strike a nice balance between needing actual thought and not being so complex as to slow down the pace of the story. There's good variety here, as well, with a number of small, mini-game esque challenges to beat (though they can be skipped if that's not your thing), interrogations, autopsies, crime reconstructions and even a few notable sequences of trying to rebuild the sequence of events in Holmes' imagination. You won't need a membership in Mensa to make progress here, but it will challenge just enough to make you feel like Sherlock Holmes himself. Ultimately, given that the game has his name on it, that's probably the biggest praise I can give this.			"

												I simply love the lock puzzles!The avarege player may find the stories cleaver. Puzzles are interesting and doesn't punish you for mistakes. None are luck based, which makes them possible.Characters are spot on if you don't base them on the novel but on the TV version of sherlock homes.Graphics are really nice.What I hate about this game is the long loading time, which is understanable by the size of the maps.

												Really excellent game. For me, it captured the fun of being Sherlock Holmes and the essence of a Victorian setting. The game lets you explore the maps and draw your own conclusions. It's a lot of fun to look for clues and make deductions.You shouldn't consider this game to be a real mental challenge, there's a lot of hand-holding, but that's not a bad thing. Sometimes I get stuck in these puzzle games on the most obscure clue and it's infuriating. The same goes for the mini-games, they're not very hard either but an appropriate level of fun (and you can always skip them). In an age where I've got like 10 unplayed games in my Steam library, I don't really feel like taking a lot of time to click the mouse in the *exact* right position or whatever.The graphics are really great too, and you can really tell that the devs put in a phenomenal effort to make a great game. There is a lot of depth here that you may not always expect.One gripe: the movement system is a little wonky, could be improved. Sometimes it's hard to know where/how to walk through a map.			"

												As a Criminal Justice student and a person who is working to be a detective. I adore this game. It really helps with deductive reasoning and judgement skills. There are multiple endings to a case, which can hurt your head as it did me because real tatics would let you question a person more often and do a professional interview with a person and see if they cave. When you get to the end of a case and you must make a decesion. BUT, you can replay to the ending of a case which lets you pick a different guility party until you have it right.I reccomend this to someone who wants to do investigation for a future, not really a CoD person, and remember: It takes motive and opertunity to make a person break the law, not just one with the other.

												I LOVED this iteration of Sherlock Holmes. They took a page out of Jeremy Brett's Sherlock whom I adored and it really shows through the snappy dialogue between Holmes and Watson. This is one of the best looking adventure games I've played and it helps immerse you into each case you play. The game also lets you choose how to solve each case depending on how you piece the eveidence together. There will be times where the evidence will point to several suspects, and you will have to decide who is the culprit. This is a great game if you love linear games with a strong narrative.			"

												An interesting and enjoyable, if a bit rough, investigation game that actually allows you to do the investigation, rather then following the scripted sequence. Environments and characters are beautiful and rich, while still holding quite firmly to their setting. the suspect profile mechanic is well suited to the game and shows off the obvious care that has been put into both in the polygons and in the planning. So well constructed are the models that it comes as a shock when Sherlock's pet basset hound, Toby, is added as a mechanic in later cases and is modelled somewhat inexpertly, leaving him with a model that is merely good among a cast of great.The ""deduction"" system that acts as part hint system, part progress meter and part inventory system for clues is a unique addition to the genera. It's fortunately flexible enough to allow you to follow the case in your own route, revealing enough information to grease the mechanics, without washing away all the challenge. The imagination system is a rich concept that is tragically underutilized. This unique mechanic allows Sherlock to simulate events and see how they would fit the facts. The 2 or 3 times it's used to it's fullest effect, it's dead-on in terms of tone, style and function, but it's often not utilized, utilized only minimally, or outright replaced by other, similar, less well polished mechanics. suffers a little bit from adventure game syndrome, but a lot less than many other games; there were only 3 places where I felt a puzzle was contrived for progress reasons or arbitrarily gated, and most of those could have been easily lamp-shaded away with some dialogue exposing the in-universe explanation.  The path based lock-picking mechanic is a bit weird, but it's nice to have something other then literal bumping or rotational hotspot systems, and it works with the narrative of Sherlock ""deducting"" the lock open.There are some technical issues as well. One puzzle was simply impossible to complete due to a crash to desktop, and I’ve seen reports of others seeing similar issues with other puzzles. Fortunately, these aren't game-blocking, thanks to the developers including a no-guilt skip button on nearly every puzzle, acting as a pressure valve on frustrating puzzles (and the rare crashy sequence). the major complaint that I have is that there is clearly a ""right"" answer to every case, but the cases are structured so many of the different solutions fit just as tightly. the discovery of the ""right"" solution in some of the cases is partially trial and error, and partially jumping on the train of thought of the designer; in one case, quite literally. I often felt less like a masterful Sherlock, and more bumbling Watson, when it came to wrapping the case, comparing two or three equally explanatory, equally comprehensive, and sometimes equally incomplete, explanations for the same set of facts and clues. of additional frustration, the punishment phase of every case includes a ""moral choice"" to absolve or punish the suspect. while there is no ""right"" answer, the choice is a false one, as which choice you make doesn't affect the ending of the case very much, but affects the epilogue substantially in non-obvious ways. the designers clearly had a ""right"" ending in mind and In a game all about the freedom to follow the clues and act upon the evidence, the decision to base the final ending upon unrelated choices from unrelated situations seems discordant and atonal. In all, it's a highly polished, well built and interesting take on an area of culture that is largely absent from gaming.  At ~12 hours and ~US$30, it's well worth the little bit of frustration for the feeling of being the Great Sherlock Homes.			"

												First thing, I must confess that I haven't played many games about Sherlock Holmes. Still, it's hard for me to imagine that there is any other game on the market that managed to capture the essence of Sr. Conan Doyle's story so well.This game is not just another adventure game based on a famous franchise, nor is it a game of search and puzzle. It's more than that. It's a real detective game, in which you need to gather the clues and create the deductions to reach the conclusions, one of which is true.I wouldn't say that it's extremely challenging. After all, it's not too hard to reach at the right conclusion, if you manage to find all the clues and stay attentive. Besides, two of the six cases were taken straught out of the books, which makes them so much easier to solve. But does it subtract from the enjoyment? Not at all.You also have some puzzles and mini-games as a welcome distraction from the process of gathering the clues.The only complaint I have with the developers is that they used the same facial features for multiple characters, which may be a bit confusing for some. I guess, it was done due to the low budget.All in all, a very welcome interpretation of the adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. Highly recommended.			"

												As what has become a tradition of this franchise, Frogware keeps pumping new ideas and working with different concepts with each release. This time Frogware opted to try its hand on the slightly more open ended investigations of LA Noire, where you can accuse any of the suspects, so long as you have a viable rationale. Parallel to this mechanic is the development of Holmes's morality, mirrored conveniently by his reading Dostoevsky's classic novel.While some puzzles are little more than interacting with the right item, the overall experience will still have its challenges. In regards to the characters, Holmes continues to be a major ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and Watson a airhead; Toby also makes a comeback --woof			"

There are lots of minor puzzles in the game, which all can be skipped if you wish so and the game never seems to waste the player's time, which is something I appreciate. (although I didn't really skip anything)Some of the cases are a little too simple. The main offenders being case 4 and 6, which both had pretty obvious conclusions.

												From the couple of hours of playing (ok not that much yet!) I think for now at least this looks quite nice Sherlock Holmes game. Last time I played this well made ""Sherlock game"" was probably the old Spectrum game called, just Sherlock :)Put the old BBC series theme there in the background (with Jeremy Brett) and everything is just fine and mysteries are there to be solved with a nice feeling:)At least now as on sale, I think this is a good buy. It does not seem very open world game, but still you seem to be able to go back and forth places like your home and others. Voice acting is ok, not best, not worst, but to me they work just fine. I can play with the highest settings and the faces look quite well made. You actually many times ""need to"" look closely and there it, well looks great.Just on my first case so this is not a so called ""real review"".Anyway already now, for like 20e as it is now, I have no regrets.Cheers...

												First Time ImpressionsGreat Game 9/10Solving crimes while in a first person perspective is a nice step up from the previous Sherlock Holmes games that I have recently played.Seeing as how most folks may even struggle with some Puzzles or actions or events to properly solve the Mystery's your also given the option to skip the events if you simply can't figure out the puzzles or actions required to progress the game so your not completely stumped.I often times found myself solving a mystery that just didn't allow all the right peices to fit into place but the replay option allows you to try out different scenario's before finilizing your deductions.I would recommend this game to any one that enjoy's Mysteries because this allows you to literally walk around in the shoes of Sherlock Holmes and attempt to look for clues and forces you into figuring out how all the pieces fit together for the mystery. You can revisit locations and explore crime scenes or locations of interest; you also get to conduct the interegations.The gameplay progresses on no matter how hard you attempt to fail the mystery; but they do attempt to assist you with conclusions your able to piece together from your current deduction of all the clues gathered.

												This game was definetely a step in the right direction for the Sherlock Holmes franchise though it was by no means perfect. What made this game stand out the most was the way you were actually compelled to see through Sherlock's eyes, a tactic that BBC's Sherlock uses by instead of Sherlock constantly telling us what he observes, we are given descriptive words next to clues and characters. This game also made a good use of the way players can connect clues and form their own opinions of who was responsible for the many cases and even what form of judgement to pass.This game is perfect for those people that are sick of being tied down to the strict plot set by most detective/search games such as previous Sherlock Holmes or even Nancy Drew games. The players are given some level of freedom in deciding what certain clue associations mean and for some cases are given the option to sentance a person, without informing the player that there are more clues yet to be found. I actually found myself completely imersed in this game and was impressed with the graphics.There were a few downsides to this game, mostly the overall plot. I understand that this game was to focus on smaller cases but at the same time the writers attempted to make us care about this underlying issue involving a group of anarchists who threatened Great Britian's stability. However the group was not referenced for me to pay much attention and when the group finally became of some importance to one of the cases. I couldnt have cared less.Another downside was the third person view though the first person view was waaaay better than the previous games. The third person view was clunky and awkward and I actually got kind of dizzy playing through the first case in this view. The camera angles just didn't support the game very well.Lastly, this is something that doesn't really affect the overall game experience but after I played through the game I couldn't help but feel what the point of having Watson was except to have someone to tag along, occasionally get in the way, and for one or two cases actually lend some form of assistance. In many cases and locations Watson would actually stand off to the side and would not follow Sherlock, which anyone playing the previous games would understand why (Watson is always behind Sherlock). However, what made the Sherlock Holmes mysteries and series so great was not only his view and how he solved cases but how Watson percieved Sherlock. It just felt like the one missing element. "

												First Time ImpressionsGreat Game 9/10Solving crimes while in a first person perspective is a nice step up from the previous Sherlock Holmes games that I have recently played.Seeing as how most folks may even struggle with some Puzzles or actions or events to properly solve the Mystery's your also given the option to skip the events if you simply can't figure out the puzzles or actions required to progress the game so your not completely stumped.I often times found myself solving a mystery that just didn't allow all the right peices to fit into place but the replay option allows you to try out different scenario's before finilizing your deductions.I would recommend this game to any one that enjoy's Mysteries because this allows you to literally walk around in the shoes of Sherlock Holmes and attempt to look for clues and forces you into figuring out how all the pieces fit together for the mystery. You can revisit locations and explore crime scenes or locations of interest; you also get to conduct the interegations.The gameplay progresses on no matter how hard you attempt to fail the mystery; but they do attempt to assist you with conclusions your able to piece together from your current deduction of all the clues gathered.

												I am really enjoying this game. I usually don't like point-and-click adventures, but the genre is perfect for a detective stroy. the usual frustration of looking for that one stupid thing I need just to advance the story translates better in a game where the whole point is being observant and finding the elusive clue.The setting is perfect. I can really get into being there in the stories. It makes me wish it were an open world I could just go adventure in, but the limited location sizes do help keep me focused on the task at hand.The story line is the usual tangled-linear path of a point-and-click, but it really feels like you could make a bad decision every step of the way. There are lots of minigames, and they are easy enough to not be frustrating or inhibit the story, yet challenging enough that they don't seem entirely pointless.The game is broken up into several shorter stories, which allows you to go from start to finish, and get a sense of accomplishment, without feeling like things are dragging on. The stories tend to follow the typical formula of a classic Holmes story as well (Think, ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,"" if you've read it), so they are familiar and enjoyable.If you enjoy the writing of Arthur Conan Doyle, you will really enjoy this game.

												Having played all the Sherlock Holmes games, this is by far the easiest one. It is more like an interactive movie than a ""thinking"" man's game.  The areas are quite limited, so you don't really get lost and the game basically tells you all the time what to do. The puzzles are pretty simple and none of them were what I would call hard. The graphics are real improvement from the previous game and the game itself oozes atmosphere. I liked this game a lot and I'm waiting the next Sherlock Holmes game eagerly.			"

												Really excellent game. For me, it captured the fun of being Sherlock Holmes and the essence of a Victorian setting. The game lets you explore the maps and draw your own conclusions. It's a lot of fun to look for clues and make deductions.You shouldn't consider this game to be a real mental challenge, there's a lot of hand-holding, but that's not a bad thing. Sometimes I get stuck in these puzzle games on the most obscure clue and it's infuriating. The same goes for the mini-games, they're not very hard either but an appropriate level of fun (and you can always skip them). In an age where I've got like 10 unplayed games in my Steam library, I don't really feel like taking a lot of time to click the mouse in the *exact* right position or whatever.The graphics are really great too, and you can really tell that the devs put in a phenomenal effort to make a great game. There is a lot of depth here that you may not always expect.One gripe: the movement system is a little wonky, could be improved. Sometimes it's hard to know where/how to walk through a map.			"

												A worthwhile venture into the shoes of Mr. Sherlock Holmes. For those not familiar with this genre of games, think L.A. Noire without the gunplay. You go from location to location gathering clues, using your imagination (yes, a real game mechanic) and Holmes' worldly wisdom to piece together the how and why of each crime scenario. Interview suspects and witnesses and re-enact events, all to get the best possible conclusion. With all of the clues spread before you, will you point out the true culprit or finger an innocent man? And once you're sure of who's to blame, will you let the iron gavel of justice fall on their heads, or let them slip off with only their guilt to punish them?I really enjoyed this game because it challenged my deductive reasoning. Even with all the clues, some of the cases weren't clear cut. I only wish that there had been more than six to solve. Maybe in future games, the developers can do something more open-world that leaves room for smaller cases in between the big ones.Since it is a short game, I would recommend getting it on sale. But if you do pay full price, the visual quality is well worth it. Character and environment details are incredible. I wanted to wash Wiggins' face so bad, the soot and smudges just seem so real. This was the first Frogwares game I've played, and I'm already a fan of their work and look forward to trying the others. Thumb's up from me.			"

												I can highly recommend the game if you are into adventure games and especially if you like the Sherlock Holmes world. The gamepaly itself is not revolutionary but gives you the feeling of a real inspector's work. Clues have to be found and combined. Mostly, they are not too hard to solve and the puzzles are also just short minigames. You can hardly screw up the game if possible in any way.The graphics are nice, the sound is amazing. Especially the dialoges turn the stories to intense short adventures in the 19th century London. Only the controls are annyoing at some points. Watson loves to block the way in smaller rooms and cannot be pushed away.All in all a great buy for some entertaining hours!			"

The story for this game follows Sherlock as he solves crimes across Britain in the Victorian era the industrial age where machines are on the rise and the train is becoming bigger than ever. I at this game is worth buying on sale at least 25% off or more is a reasonable price to post for a good looking and enjoyable puzzle/mystery crime solver.			"

												I LOVE this game and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a game with puzzle elements.The game consists of cases in which a crime must be solved. In every case, there are clues that could help you reach a final conclusion. It is up to the player to choose in what way he will interpret a certain clue. Through interpreting clues in a different way, you can end every case with a different conclusion, which makes you question everything you've seen or heard in a specific case.I, personally, had to get used to the controls and different menu's you can use, playing the game. I think I got a hang of it after the first case - approximately 1.5 hours of playing the game. One thing that stood out was that I ended every case (except the first one) correctly, which makes you question the difficulty of the game. I don't know whether I was that good at the game or if game was just too easy. I personally think I was, in a way, just lucky. Every possible conclusion that I made, was logical, but at some times it took me half an hour of re-reading dialogue and clues in order to reach a conclusion. After every case you have a Moral Choice. You can basically be 'the good guy' and lock the criminal up or you can let the criminal go, because he can help you in some random way (I can't remember). I don't really understand why they added this feature, since it doesn't really change anything in the game itself. It just changes a percentage or your moral level, or something like that.Summarizing.Pros:- Great game if you like puzzle.- It can be hard and you have read every tiny detail in order to solve a crime correctly.Cons:- Use of different menu's is strange, but you get used to it.- Moral choices are just plain stupid.

												I am of the opinion that this is the best Frogwares Sherlock game yet. Why?First of all, the way you actually solve the mysteries has been revamped. They removed the ""hint"" button (which I personally thought was silly anyway, but some people like it) and instead have given Sherlock vision (which needed to be used more), a wonderful deduction system, and the ability to make the wrong decision. I know people maybe don't like the idea of being able to improperly solve the mystery, but I would argue that knowing that somewhere down the line you'll get everything one hundred percent correct takes away the mystery aspect.Anyway, I'm getting a bit off the subject and just ranting. Let me simplify:Pros:-Deduction system. You have to put together the clues and solve the mystery. There are multiple paths you can take and solutions you can achieve.-Improved graphics. The game looks really good. Too bad my computer is♥♥♥♥♥♥and can barely run it on the lowest specs. -Multiple cases. I love the other games, don't get me wrong, but I felt like I was getting much more this time because there are multiple cases. Hell, two of them (Black Peter and Abbey Grange) are based off canon stories. -Cool hansom cab rides and journal. Between locations, you can ride in a hansom cab, and during this time you can pull up a journal and read about your case, the characters, review evidence, and make deductions. You can access the journal at anytime, don't worry! It's just cool that you can do this while the game loads. By the way...-The journal. Sweet mother of jesus, I love it. It looks so much better than Watson's suitcase. I also like having the task list right there - helps keep me on track.Cons:-Having cases from the canon. Okay, so I like having multiple cases. I also love the idea of cases from the canon. But the big issue is that if you've read the cases, you know exactly how it plays out (or almost exactly). Same suspects and same ending. On the one hand, it was exciting to play out Black Peter, but on the other hand, I kind of wished that I was playing something I didn't know the ending to. But this varies person to person.-Some of the deductions were a little odd. Can't remember exact ones, but there were times I couldn't quite grasp the logic of something. And that leads me to...-Case #3 is the weakest of the game that's not the canon cases. The ending to this one? There seems to be no difference. All suspects had a good motive and the weapon doesn't particularly matter. No distinctions means it took three tries to get it ""right"". If someone can prove me wrong and tell me exactly why it was that one dude, please do.There are probably more pros than cons than I can think of right now, but I'm also just here to buy more games and decided to finally review this beauty of a game a year after buying it. This is long and I'm sorry. If you're in a hurry, here's the bottom line:It's a truly solid game that will log you about 30 hours of gameplay (maybe less, depending on what you do) and will probably be fun, especially if you like Sherlock Holmes. I recommend it.			"

												Each Sherlock Holmes game from Frogwares is a noticeable improvement over it's predecessor and this particular iteration is a noticeably large jump in quality. The graphics are fantastic; the detail in the environment and character faces is unparalled. Animations are still a little stiff and slow but not so much as to detract from the experience.The gameplay itself is a step up from the recent walking simulator entries (Vanishing Of Ethan Carter, etc.) but it's not terribly challenging. There are 6 cases to solve (you face each case 1 at a time) and each one is nearly long enough to be considered an episode among Telltale's various episodic games. All in all I can't recommend this game enough if you like Sherlock Holmes, playing detective, or crime / murder thrillers.			"

												For some reason this game does not feel as long as the last one. Maybe it is because of those lockpicking bits being more commonly used in place of what might normally have been a different type of puzzle. Either way, this game was a lot harder to stop playing than prior versions. Short and sweet plots for all 6 cases. Although I must admit one nameless case smacked me very hard with nostaliga for the previous game. This scratches the itch.			"

												In brief, the game is formidable. Spectacular cases (thanks to the author), fascinating mini-games, good graphics, from time to time puzzling situations, diverse characters and their statements, testimonies, a great range of different clues. Yes, I liked the game. If you're a great fan of Sherlock Holmes or detectives in general the answer is clear - it's worth it. However, there are some drawbacks. The list of cases is tiny (just 6 of them) and I wish the game were harder, more sophisticated. Unfortunately, sometimes it seems to be rather simple.			"

There's a lot of handholding in the form of the ""task list"" but then you don't really have to look at it.For boargame fans, it feels similar to Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective, with some additional handholding and fewer characters in each case.

												I really enjoyed this game. The graphics are beautiful and the Victorian settings look and feel realistic without any noticeable anachronisms. Each episode has its own look and feel with a different theme: Roman baths, elaborate gardens, wealthy estates, etc. The dialogue and voice acting are excellent.The puzzles aren't hard, so the game moves along at a pleasingly quick pace. I only had to consult a walkthrough once. This would be a really nice game to try out as a first foray into the adventure genre.It's very fun to try and put the clues together at the end of the case to make the right decision. I actually decided incorrectly on one of the cases, so it's not always a completely obvious foregone conclusion. You do have to think.			"

												A very pleasant surprise. This game surprised me by having a pretty sophisticated way that events can chain and collide to produce many different results. For fans of the stories, it's a great reimagining. I can't say for sure if it will impress those who aren't familiar with Doyle's books but simply like adventure games, but I think it ought to work for both kinds of players.As with any adventure game, there are occasional snags where you think the elements are uncovered but the game requires one more tiny nudge to prove that you've understood. Those rare occasions can be a little frustrating, but aside from that it's a very polished indie game with a lot to recommend it. Some people have complained that they weren't entirely sure if they'd got the right man/woman at the end of each case - if that happens to you, you probably haven't solved the crime correctly. I think it's good that the game allows you to get it wrong without telling you plainly, and only shows you that you were right if you were right, but not everyone will see that as a strength.			"

												I LOVED this iteration of Sherlock Holmes. They took a page out of Jeremy Brett's Sherlock whom I adored and it really shows through the snappy dialogue between Holmes and Watson. This is one of the best looking adventure games I've played and it helps immerse you into each case you play. The game also lets you choose how to solve each case depending on how you piece the eveidence together. There will be times where the evidence will point to several suspects, and you will have to decide who is the culprit. This is a great game if you love linear games with a strong narrative.			"

												In my opinion, this Sherlock Holmes game is the best Frogwares has created to date. I found myself fully engaged and as a Sherlock Holmes' fan, utterly delighted.Pros: -Shorter cases. I enjoyed the longer cases in previous games, but felt the shorter cases were easier to wrap my mind around and get a complete sense of the whole mystery. It was also easier then to sift through evidence and come to a sound conclusion.-Getting to come to your own conclusion. In the previous games, Holmes guided you through. In these games, you ARE the detective. And you can get it wrong. It makes the game all that more intense since I know I can lose.-The ease of assessing information. The file system makes it easy to look over all the information you have gathered. The deduction board was is an ingenious way to put the clues together. You make links between different information and evidence to form conclusions and there can be multiple conclusions.-The mysteries are solvable. I do not like it when a mystery game's answer comes out of nowhere and you feel that you never had a chance to solve it. The mysteries in this game are all solvable. If you go over the clues, review evidence, reread dialogue and think about it, you can get the right answer. I got all but one of them correct. I had determined to go over all the evidence thoroughly before deciding on a final answer and that helped. But still, pressing the button to launch my conclusion always had me nervous! I looked back over all the evidence of the one mystery I solved incorrectly and realized what erroneous conclusions I had drawn.-In my opinion, the best addition is the morality choices. In Conan Doyle's stories, Holmes often makes moral decisions concerning the fate of the culprits. He does not consider himself necessarily bound by conventional law. The morality choices were an added layer that made the game all the more real and like the Holmes stories.-Two of the stories are Conan Doyle stories. They were modified a little, but not enough to take away Conan Doyle's original plots. I am a Conan Doyle fan and so enjoyed getting to play his own stories. One was an obscure enough story that I recognized it, but didn't remember much about it and so had to figure it out along with all the other mysteries. The other I knew very well and flew through the case, but it was still fun to be in the story.-The variety of the cases. Nothing was redundant. Each case was unique and completely held my interest.-Telescope easter egg. So funny.Cons: -As someone who adores the Conan Doyle stories, I didn't like the characterization of Mycroft. It seems the thing these days in recreated Holmes stories and shows to make Sherlock and his brother antagonists. They just are not like this in Conan Doyle's stories. At one point, Sherlock tells Watson in one of the Conan Doyle stories that he has gone to Mycroft at times for help. And if Mycroft were to show up asking Sherlock for help, he would not be indifferent.-The characterizations of Watson and Holmes also suffer a little. Watson is turned more towards the bumbling idiot Watson. Sherlock is made more aloof and cold than in previous games.-In one of the mysteries, a clue is worded in such a way that it can lead the player to an incorrect conclusion. I decided to ignore the wording in light of other evidence and that led me to the right answer, but I was worried it would be incorrect because of the clue wording.-There is less freedom to explore your environment than in previous games.  The game boxes you into an area and if you wander to the edge throws the map in your face. That was a little off putting and reminded me I was playing a game. I would have rather Holmes had said something like, ""There is nothing interesting over there.""-Final screen. Once you've finished the whole game it seems like there is going to be a cut scene, but nothing happens.			"

												Offers pretty much everything you'd expect from a Sherlock Holmes game.The first four cases in particular are outstanding, almost flawless even. The avid Sherlock Holmes reader will find at least two of them quite easy to solve, though.Unfortunately the last two cases feel very rushed, lacking the detail and depth that the first four cases offered. I guess it's safe to assume that a deadline was the culprit here.All in all, even with the disappointing ending (33% of cases, maybe closer to 20-25% of play time), this game can still be recommended. A Sherlock Holmes fan will most likely not regret buying the game at full price, it's the best SH adventure yet and the production quality is simply amazing, at a discounted price this is a must buy/play for everyone who enjoys adventure games.

The plot was intigruing for the majority of the cases and the possibility of multiple endings and solutions were a nice touch. However, despite this, it felt as though the game was leading me to my conclusions, rather than me making my own. This is my only negative comment about the game, as the mechanics, graphics, dialogue etc. are all excellent. I look forward to what Frogware will come up with next.			"

												Wow, great game! The graphics are superb, best I have seen in a 2014 game. The facial expressions and details close up on the faces are VERY lifelike, so much so that it is freaky. Reflections off eyes etc. The sound is superb too, right down to the hum of gas lights overhead and sounds great in dolby 5.1. The game is much more than a point and click. It does well to give you the feeling of being open world, many clues to discover and easy to miss things. Holmes has two talents that he uses to find clues and reconstruct events. This was my first Holmes game and I loved it. Very unique experience for me. I ended up convicting the wrong person 2x, fooled me. Gameplay takes a good amount of time if you dont rush, I got 24 hours out of it. The voice acting is good as well as the stories/script. You can solve the mysteries for different conclusions but there is only one correct, you also have a moral decision at the end to make. There are mini games for things like picking locks in the main game and it even gives you the option to skip it and move through it so you dont get stuck. I personally found the mini games fun, I only skipped one.The only trouble I had was the case at the botanical garden where I missed picking up a single note that a suspect had. Missing that one note made it impossible for me to make my conclusion, so I wasted about 30 minutes or more trying to figure out what the heck I missed.If you like the idea of solving mysteries then this is a must have game. At the end of each case I had a good sense of accomplishment that I had done the right thing, even when I was wrong!			"

												I've always been a fan of the ""vibe"" that Frogwares has created with their Sherlock Holmes games. This game continues the trend of mentally transporting you back into the late 19th century but has taken another step in the beautification of the graphics. I also appreciate that the game is broken up into multiple ""stories"", some of which reference the original stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. If you're a fan of Sherlock Holmes I feel like you'll approve of the way he and Watson have been represented in this game.			"

The production values are much higher than you'd expect with really strong voice acting and character models and it's refreshing that the stories and crimes you're solving are relatively small in scale compared to most games.Doesn't quite scratch that Ace Attorney itch, but it's damned close.

												I was pretty impressed with this. I was recommended this game after finishing L.A. Noire and was looking for something similar. If you liked that game, you'll probably like this game. There are very few action sequences however, and all of the travel is done with load screens between each area.   I wasnt totally satisfied with the 'interrogation' sequences. You can't get an answer wrong. If you choose the wrong evidence, the game just tells you to try it again. You can't mess it up.   The game has some beautiful enviroments and really detailed textures and lighting (a beauty for the time it was released).I'd recommend the game although it's to be noted that the gameplay and story are almost completely linear (aside from the final case). Before that, any desicions you make dont have that huge of an impact or outcome.7/10			"

												Really good detective game. Couple of the cases, Black Peter and Abbey Grange Affair, come right from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s stories. Good: Great gameplay, challenging at times, great visual scenes, realistic adult dialogue (not melodramatic or poorly written), and various case conclusions to make you carefully consider your accusation and moral choice. Game avoids the modern adaptations that depicts Holmes as an action hero. Holmes was a good boxer, and practiced ""Baritsu,"" but was known for his detective skills. Understandably, some gamers might not appreciate that. Bad: Some of the mini-games are disappointing, and Blood Bath halfway through makes you feel like a dull version of Indiana Jones, not Holmes. Perhaps a little misleading advertising? One cinematic trailer makes you believe there are more cut scenes that display interesting interactions that are never seen in the game. I have the PC version, maybe it’s on the consoles?			"

												I enjoy a good murder mystery. I really like reading and watching mysteries and solving them before the big reveal.  This game is great at everything I enjoy about sluething: Finding clues, interviewing suspects and witnesses and putting all the pieces together to come to the conclusion.  Some people have argued that based on the clues they found investigating some of the cases, they came to the wrong conclusion at the end of the cases, claiming that in the end it is really a guessing game in the duduction screen.  To a degree I agree with these folks, but if you really pay attention to what was said in the conversations with your suspects, you will generally find there was enough info provided to make a highly educated guess.  The game occasionally crashes, and that is annoying, but overall everything about this game is enjoyable enough so that I can still recommend it to those who enjoy solving mysteries, especially when its on sale.  If you want an action game, then I would skip this game if I were you.			"

												I love this game! Running around, looking for clues and trying to solve crimes. What more could you want? I love the look of the game and I thought the gameplay was very fun. I'll admit at the end of the first case, I was a little confused. I thought it was going to be a game that boiled down to one clear conclusion and you didn't get to pick. And while it is true to some extent, you still get to pick your own ending and decide the culprit's fate. I ended up liking that part of the game a lot. It made it feel a little less linear.The length of the game and the mysteries was nice too. While I would like a hundred more cases to solve, this game didn't feel like it was over too quickly. I'm familiar with the original Sherlock Holmes stories, so there was one case I recognized right from the start. Luckily for me, that case was actually one of the quicker ones and I liked the sequence with Toby, so I didn't have to just go through the motions just to hurry up and move on.I believe there's another Sherlock game in this series (they referenced a previous Jack the Ripper case which would be amazing, I'm sure). If so, I will definitely have to seek it out.			"

												It's a great game! But I have a few comments:1.Very strong color saturation and high contrast in scenes.2. Constant flashing of many textures (some parts of the objects are black, and some parts are normal), perhaps due to my graphics card AMD Radeon HD 7800 Series.3. Poor quality of many textures. Tree textures, picture frames, furniture, most Kew Gardens textures are terrible! Often the texture of high quality and low quality are located next to each other. In the excavations in Saint Albans, some standing next to the each other textures differs in brightness.The graphic style of this game reminded me of No One Lives Forever 2. Textures need the ""Bump Offset"". The game needs pastel colors. The color palette of British homes and gardens are more complex and refined. It needs a subtle color harmony (here can help Adobe Kuler).4. You do not need to prompt the player every time he need to press the ""T"" or ""F"". It's enough to make it one time in the beginning. The player must guess when he need to press the button. In such places enough to show a quite small glare on objects, flashing dots or Holmes might say ""hmm ..."". In any adventure game should be the ""pixel hunting"".5. The game need ""inventory"" with items. The player must guess which of them need to be combined. There may be unexpected combinations, which are difficult to guess.In any quest there must be the moments when you need to apply a certain item at a certain place in a one second. The player must catch the moment.6. Dialogs are too simple. The player must choose the right words to make the suspect to cooperate. There should be a specific sequence of replicas.Not many people with whom you can talk. It facilitates the process of investigation. It may be better to make more people with whom you can talk, but they should not help. The player must choose the right person from a crowd.7. All cases in the game are too simple. Everywhere there are hints, clues and evidence. This is a job for an ordinary detective, but not for a Sherlock Holmes!For example, a difficult case for Sherlock Holmes (!I saw this story in Russian movie!): naked body of the man was found in a closed inside an empty room in the apartment house. No evidence, no clues there. Sherlock and the police are confused! In an empty room there is nothing that could catch the trail of the killer. This room was not rented for a long time. How this man appeared there- it's a mystery! An autopsy showed that the man was not poisoned, not been shot. But he drank some coffee shortly before his death. Sherlock is looking for cafes, in which he could drink coffee before death. There are many cafes around this place. After some time of searching, intuition tells Sherlock to pay attention to a man who differ from the crowd of people in this quarter, in one of the cafes. Suspicious man drinking coffee in the cafe and looks like a scientist. Sherlock decided to follow him. The waiter in the cafe does not know anything about this person. In pursuit of this scientist Sherlock gradually learns that the victim had taken a wife of this scientist. The scientist was professor of psychiatry, an experienced hypnotist. The wife of the scientist was in love with the victim.When the doctor found out about it, he called opponent on a conversation in an outdoor cafe, where they together drank coffee and arguing who gets the beloved woman. The doctor hypnotized his opponent and tells him about a hired killer. Doctor said, that a killer is chasing this man! Killer knows how the victim looks like. In addition, the doctor persuaded the poor guy to hide himself from the people and lock in the room, otherwise he will be in extreme danger!The poor fellow was so frightened that he quietly stole the key from a room in the nearest apartment house, locked himself in this room, undressed and threw the clothes in the window where it was successfully stolen. A few days after lying on the floor with a wild sense of fear, despair, hunger and thirst, the man died. A few days later the body was found.Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson investigates a case of mafia cartels. On the way from the crime scene to the Scotland Yard the cab flips and breaks up. Holmes and Watson knocked out by three murderers. When Sherlock waked up, he saw a huge pit from which it is difficult to get out. Watson tied to a chair and waiting for interrogating from a strange man, trying to find out what they know about a crime scene, where they have been earlier. Finally have not ascertained anything from Watson, the man goes to the window to see where Holmes are. During this short time Watson should find on the table an acid or something sharp to cut the rope. When the offender is moving away from the window and fills a syringe with some substance, Watson unties the rope. The man brings syringe to Watson, and Watson knocks the syringe from the hand of criminal. Then he strikes a bottle on the man's head and knocks him out. In this case, player need to quickly perform actions, cleverly hide from offenders and maybe even shoot.In addition, the game needs a mission on the London Eye or Tower Bridge.The game needs a mission with encrypted letters or inscriptions on the wall.Thank you for your attention and wish You good luck!

												This game really feels real. Story is realistic. The plot makes you really think hard about the connection between events and evidences which makes it very fun and enjoyable.			"

												A great improvment on the last game in this series. The games control interface is now much smoother to operate and graphics look incredible on character close ups. Lots of mini cases this time around instead of a long continuous story, and solving them sure is fun. I played this from beginning to end with no other games inbetween, and theres not that many games out there that can hold my attention for that long.Its also very British, and so gets a big white gloved thumbs up from yours truly!

												8/10 - Game of His name with quite interesting cases (6 + 1 ;) ). However, some of them are just to simple and could easily grow into something like ""Just click on every object in this room, connect Sherlock's ideas and chose THIS statment.Some advice - CapsLock - to♥♥♥♥♥Sherlock to move his *** faster.This should be our The ""I am the justice!"" award!After playing you are either feeling super smart or ultra dumb.

												Great game! Great storylines/cases. Looks beautiful. Plays well. You do need a good graphics card to get the most out of it but definitely recommended!			"

												Best detective game I've ever played !The art is amazing, great music & voice acting, and the stories/setting are amazing.Was really dissapointed by their previous sherlock games, but the dev team has learned a lot.However the game is not perfect, 2-3 of the cases felt too easy and weren't really possible to get wrong.It must be hard to balance this kind of games, but I really wish those cases had more possible conclusions, to get more sense of accomplishment like the good cases.

												Easily the best detective game I've played. It lets you collect evidence/clues and form your own conclusions and then you can pick a culprit and motive. You are also able to do experiments to verify which of your findings are physically or chemically possible.			"

												Compared to the previous entries, it's quite repetitive, as you are given the same tasks in order to advance: check archives, talk to people and do stuff at the ""lab"". Then again, previous games, unlike this one, focused on linking crimes together to form one story. Also, there is no inventory so in order to progress, Sherlock needs to have knowledge of certain things instead of seemingly knowing or already having figured out everything because he's a genius, you can't exactly do what Holmes wants, it really feels like HE is doing what THE GAME wants. But overall, it isn't a bad game, the cases  are interesring, lots of cool characters, great soundtrack, and from time to time you get to choose how you wanna do things. 7/10			"

Pros:+Improved graphics and animations compared to the previous games+Much improved control scheme (third person or first person)+Voice acting is really good, especially Sherlock+Cool new deduction system that branches off, you can even jail the wrong suspect+Character inspections (similar to the BBC Sherlock series)Cons:-The game is pretty easy overall, if you have all the clues you can easily deduce who did it.Two of the six cases are lifted straight from the books with minimal differences.-Lots of loading into areas, SSD helps but it's still significant-Some dialogues/cutscenes are unskippable when replaying cases.Overall:Best Sherlock Holmes game to date, with 6 separate cases around 80-100 minutes each (one exception is the abbey grange case which is 30-40minutes long).9/10			"

												I did not care for the interface/controls on this game and it took me a while to get used to it. I actually almost gave up and stopped playing as it was nearly the end of the first case before I started to get the hang of it.  That being said, the story was really engrossing and I wanted to at least play the first one to the end. Once I finished the first, I was intrigued enough to keep going and glad I did. Dislikes: Interface/controls; repetive & very simple mini-puzzles, lag time to 'fast-travel' to locationsLikes: Great mysteries/cases, deductions & conclusions, skip feature for min-puzzlesThe best part of the game really is the way deductions & conclusions are done...you are allowed to put clues together and essentially draw your own conclusions, right or wrong. You also get to see how many others solved the case the same way and you can go back and do the endings differently if you'd like. I would recommend and I would purchase more titles from same line.

												It was really nice have so many cases to solve instead of one storyline. The cases were challenging, but not so difficult that I couldn't figure it out. (The hints WERE pulled out a few times, but not annoyingly often.) This is yet another fantastic game in the franchise. Really enjoyed it!			"

												Absolutely amazing game. I am a big fan of Sherlock Holmes, even though I don't know much about the mytho. However, with what I know, I can see this game is very true to the source material. I deeply believe this is the best Sherlock game ever made.   Pros   Original gameplay, blending puzzle solving with mini games and perfectly recreating the ""how would Sherlock act"" feel. Good playtime amount. Amazing variety in cases. Cases are original, very well thought and fun to play. Multiple choices for how to resolve every case, all based on your own conclusions. Minigames are fun. Nice portrayal of the characters (including voice acting, which is superb). Graphics are nice.   Cons   Poorly optimized (Unreal Engine 3 game). Sometimes you have to stay in the exact spot for the interact button to appear. I sometimes missed key clues because of this. Crashed 3 times throughout my playthrough (not a serious problem given the game auto saves every once in a while). Sometimes you'll have multiple places to go, but when you decide to go to one you'll only find some things that will be marked as ""object of interest"". After doing some other things you'll unlock the event in that you'll need said objects, and then you'll need to come back to that place to get the objects. This feels like a bit of a waste of time that wouldn't be necessary if you knew exactly what place to go first. Some bad achievements. "
