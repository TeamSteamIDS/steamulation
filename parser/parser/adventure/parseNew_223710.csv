												Cry of Fear is a Psychological First Person Shooter Survival Horror game.Cry of Fear is my 2nd favorite game of all time. It only gets beaten by S.T.A.L.K.E.R. I love Cry of Fear so much because of the atmosphere, the sick and twisted horror or it might be because, and I can assure you that,  it is one of the best survival horror games I ever played for not being triple A. The atmosphere is one of the best ever accomplished in a video game as well. Only Silent Hill and Condemned or Amnesia being much higher on the ranking,, but what makes this games environment stand out is the brutal emptiness of the swedish city nightsky, the lonliness, the monsters and the madness playing around simon, the protagonist. It´s depressing, oppressing, evil and obscure, something very unique even if nothing compared to condemned, suffering, in its execution, but a own unique set of art and atmosphere. The story is simple but good even if the execution is not up to par with what you expect from a high quality script. Simon acts really naive and childish sometimes but grows with further developement of the story, establishing a good connection between the player and Simon. Depressed, full of emotional problems and self suppression, having problems of confessing his feelings for his crush, Simon is getting into an car accident, which changes his life forever. If you could throw♥♥♥♥♥♥at someone, everyone would throw it at Simon.I don´t want to spoil to much here so I simply want to say that this games story is mainly about suicidal, homicidal thoughts, depression, anxiety and shizophrenic mental illness. It talks to people with mental issues, as well as it does show mentally sane people at least the realism inside the surrealism of being a ♥♥♥♥ed up individual. As you can see, a topic not everyone likes, that´s why not everyone really liked playing the game for its story, or because the story was not speaking to some/most of the players, or they disliked the gameplay which is a taste on its own. For more look at the gameplay section of this review.Not everyone like me or maybe you went through the same situations and thoughts as Simon. I can feel for him with all of my heart though. Give it a try and see for yourself. Make sure to be open enough for these topics though. You really have to try it out and give it a chance. It´s based on the GoldSrc engine on which also Half Life 1 was running on. Team Psykskallar really made the best out of this old engine and you can clearly see it. Graphics are fantastic for what they can provide engine wise. Horror, Gameplay, Puzzles, etc.:You have a big variety of levels, from the typical subway station to the mental hospital and forest but also parks and sewers, subway maintenace bays, construction sites and apartements, a school, a very nice boat scene and more!You have an inventory system like resident evil. You have to carefully pick and manage your equipment. It´s kept more simple though. Weapon models are excellent, as are their animations and the sound design overall. Close Combat is clunky at the beginning but gets better and very smooth and satisfying after some time, as you figure out that GoldSrc is not good with melee weapons and thus the modder Andreas Rönnberg thought that a Dodge Button or double tap S or W, A or D could be quite useful and you start to adapt. Most people still don´t know that, you can even disable it in the options completely. Some people though will never learn it or like it. It really is just improvised and clunky due to the problems that old engine puts up.Do not worry Mr.Shooter, usually after the apartements, as soon as you get your first gun, that should be after 40 mins, you change the playstyle anyway. From 100% melee to what ever percentage of combatstyles, due to ammo count, you want. You have to create your own technique of slash and dodge to succesfully kill your opponent when once run out of ammo due to ammo scarcity. Dodging is purely accomplished by exercising it. Ammo for guns can be scarce on normal and hard, not so much on easy. Now to the horror. If you played Amnesia or Slender and you felt it was a walk in the park, then this game is nothing for you. It´s between Resident Evil with a touch Silent Hill. It has some cheap jumpscares, good jumpscares, many jumpscares, either unpredictable or very predictable, depending on your experience with game design, level design, and games, especially horror games in general. If you fall into the horrorspiral and you start being scared by this game and a nice haunting paranoia scrawls up your skin, it seems like this game achieved what it wanted to achieve. The Paranoia and meaninglessness of the world in general will hit you. This game is pure shizophrenia and depression in one pill to go.The soundtrack is one of the best in video games history, fitting perfectly to the games environment, characters emotional state and just the mood of the game, making it effective to build tension and depressiong feelings in the right moments. If you are a very emotional or sensitive person, you will love it. If you are a cold brick, better go back and play your casual games or tougher horror games with VR because CoF is really just a nice spooky ride and not a house of horror wanting you to♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants. Those games are horror focused as with this game it uses horror as its style. Some ""Puzzles""/Riddles can be frustrating and many parts can be hard to accomplish or are just pure adrenaline kicks (maze). As the maze is easy and requires the typical smart gamer skillset of good memory it can come over as if the game is badly designed or unbalanced. Yes, you have no map... why would you, the maps in this game aren´t that big anyway. Use your brain or go back to elementary school. First time playing it, its hard, but after you solved them, it´s really satisfying and rewarding and you can simply facepalm yourself for your own stupidity. I did at the fuse backtracking. The overall feeling after finishing the game is fantastic. It makes you feel accomplishment. And don´t call Simon an Emo or I come and eat your eyeballs.Endings & Game Length:There are different endings and choices to be made, if I remember correctly, you have two choices which give you 4 main story endings. 1 co-op ending, 1 secret and 1 manhunt campaign ending.The game is about 10 hrs for beginners and 8 for faster people and can be beaten in sub 2,5 hrs by pros or challenge hunters.Conclusion:For me it´s a 10/10. A fair unbiased rating would be a 7/10. It has its problems but how I like to say: Somebody who can´t be patient and endure a few grinding moments, also can´t enjoy the joy of accomplishment and nostalgia.Technical Issues & Contacting Me:If you have technical issues, please go to the CoF Forums, contact me or ask other CoF players for help. We always want to help as much as we possibly can. ^^ This game is heavily modified,  to such a degree, it´s just obvious that it´s having many technical bugs and problems on older or unstable systems. Sometimes it´s a graphical setting and sometimes just the steam client forgetting to download a file, so checking the game files often helps. Please don´t send friend invites just for wanting to play with me. You can add me anyways but keep in mind I won´t play it with you. ^^ I played the game long enough since its 2012 release. ^^ I got the whole cake already. On the forum you can ask others though. I´ve beaten every possible story and the co-op easily 5 to 8 times, gimme a break please :/Official Forum and Technical Support[www.cry-of-fear.com]Fun Fact: I think I noticed something. Don´t the trash bins in the game look hella lot like the official Team Psykskallar logo? :]			"

Have you ever wanted to have your pants filled up with your own poo?  Now you can, for free!Before I start I would like to state that this is MY OPINION and what I think of this game.Cry of fear is a Psychological First Person Shooter Survival Horror and is one of the SCARIEST games I have ever played! It isn't one of your average cheesey horror games. Cry of fear is a game where you never know what to expect around the corner.  It could be a chainsaw maniac that wants to chop off your head or a mental deranged child wanting to kill you.  Even though sometimes the enemies get repeated in some sections there are always fresh jumpscares that make up for it.The Good/The BadGood Scary unlike other horror games Unpredictable The game is around 8 hours long (plenty of jumpscares!) It's got co-op so you can crap yourself with your friends Free!Bad Outdated graphics Sometimes buggy (not often, very rare) Some sections of the game are unforgiving (lots of enemies, not much ammo) Co-op sometimes doesn't work (very good when it does)VerdictSounds 8/10Graphics 5/10 (uses half life 1 engine)Gameplay 8/10Atmosphere 10/10Overall Score           9/10""Fantastic, Frightening          and Free""Cry of Fear is a highly recomended game for anyone who likes a truly scary game and a bit of a challenge as well.  It's free, so what are you waiting for? Get Cry of Fear NOW!==========Update=============From what I know multiplayer doesnt work in Australia.  May work in other countries. "

 Pros and Cons here we go! Woot Woot!  What you'll love... - The Story... It's really Enjoyable and Depressing (hey, it's a horror game) at the same time!- The Gameplay... Excluding the confusing inventory, the gameplay is awesome! Survival Horror at it's best!- The Soundtrack... One word: BEATIFUL! If you can, buy it! Support the devs and listen to this relaxing/scary/awesome soundtrack! (actually, there are 2 soundtracks!)- The Co-Op... Yeah, i guess it's broken and you need to port forward or use Hamatchi, but when you actually get to play it, it's AWESOME!- The Visuals... It's using a 1998's engine, but looks good by today's standards too! Psykskallar milked everything out of the GoldSource engine! What you'll hate... - Some Cheap Jumpscares only scary once or twice...- Some low res Textures and graphical bugs (you won't notice them if you aren't trying to find them on purpose, hopefully)- Difficulty curves, ya know... bosses and Sawrunner...- Forgetting not to waste ammo (you lose unspent bullets if you reload with a non-empty magazine*)- And of course... having to wash your underwear after playing this amazing Survival Horror game which will not only require you to change underwear, but sleep with the lights on for the next few days!- Skandi007 Survival Horror VeteranIf this was a REVIEW (oh wait, it is) i'd give this game a 9/10, i really love it...There is some room for improvement... but i can live with that... :)			"

												Likes:I like that it had a different campaign for solo and multiplayer. Also that the multiplayer version was a continue of the first version. I LOVE that there was a survival mode. I liked that there were parts that weren't even meant to scare the player, yet they did. I like how the game had a good storyline. I also love that it was free! The game even ran well (most of the time) on my bad laptop! The game had some scary parts, but was not overly-abusive about the jumpscares and other scary stuff...Dislikes:I wish there was a create-your-own survival mode, even though I can understand that is back-breakingly hard to do... I at least wish the creator would've put more effort into the survival mode, making it easier in some way or less repetitive. The solo and multiplayer campaigns were VERY fun! However, there were some parts that annoyed me half to death. Some of the jump puzzles, the enemies that one shot you (sometimes), and least importantly... the enemy movement...I'm currently STUCK on the first part of chapter six with an annoying jump-puzzle... It's annoying! I also wish there was an item, or something, that would give you more inventory space. Overall:The game was VERY good! There were some parts that were annoying and some things I wish existed, but with what the game has, it's GREAT!!! I give it 4.25 golden stars that don't exist anywhere, but my mind, but that counts for something ;) -P.S. I want more...			"

												Cry of Fear is simply the best Half-Life mod I have ever played, with the exception of Counter-Strike back in the day. This game shouldn't even be classified as a mod in my opinion. The engine has been utilized so well that there is little resemblence to the look of Half-Life.Story:The story of Cry of Fear is worth experiencing for sure. I like the mystery aspects to the story and your character's journey in figuring out what's going on. There are many WTF moments, which I like in survival horror games. Plus, there are mutliple endings, so the replay value is decent. I don't want to give anything away, so you willl have to check it out yourself. Definitely plays with the mind and is more of a psychological horror thriller than a straight up jump scare horror game, which in my opinion makes for a much more interesting experience.Gameplay:This game truly is survival horror and the designers understand how to make the player feel like every resource is valuable. Similar to games like the early Bioharzard (Resident Evil) or Silent Hill games, items like firearms, ammunition, light sources, health, etc. all become scarce quickly if not rationed correctly and you always feel relieved to find more. There are times where I decided to sprint past enemies instead of trying to take them out since I didn't have enough ammunition or they were heavy in numbers. Speaking of enemies, there is a decent variety to them and they are creepy as hell. The animations make them very disturbing, and the sound effects that belong to each of them unnerve your senses. As for the objectives, they are usually pretty simple for the most part. There is a lot of back tracking, but it does make sense within the story, so it didn't really become annoying. There were some areas where I got confused on where to go, but to me, this helps the experience more than hindering it. I don't always want to be told where to go or what to do so directly. Survival horror games should make you think for yourself. Most games lack this aspect. The firearms feel much more realistic  than most games. They have some serious recoil and the accuracy is fairly similar to the real thing, at least from my limited experience.Graphics:The game is very well polished for being built on such an old engine compared to the new ones. There are many details on the characters and enemies that bring out their personalities or lack thereof. Since this is a FPS with third person cutscenes mostly, the hands and weapons look very realistic. Very good details, especially on the firearms. The animations are done very well and the designers really didn't try to shortcut anything. Lighting, color, post processing, water, textures, etc. were all done very well, especially for a free game. The only gripe I feel anyone can make is only because of how old the engine is for the game, so obviously the polygon count isn't nearly as high as modern games. The settings are very detailed and make you feel like you are there in Sweden, which is where the game takes place. You are mostly in an urban environment, cautiously going through the streets, alleys, sewers, parks, buildings, etc. However, there are some other settings such as the forest and suburban areas.Overall:This game has accomplished everything it set out to do in my opinion. The sound design and music compliment the harsh disturbing atmosphere and really creeps you out, especially when you don't know what's around the next corner. The graphics are great for the resources used, the gameplay is true survival horror, and it's FREE!!! So, sit back, turn the lights off, turn up the volume, have a weapon near you along with a change of pants if need be, and enjoy this game. I would pay money to play this game, let's leave it at that.My review is based on playing the single player only. I did not play through any other game mode. There is a co-op mode and a survivor mode as well, adding some more replay value.5/5			"

												Cry of fear is not for everyone, but it shows some people some problems with our world today. Lonely, depressed, suicidal, and angry. These are only some words to explain Simon, the main character. The game allows you to play as this run down man trying to find hope, answers, love. Loneliness has turned this man into something he's not, loneliness changes lives. For everyone who thinks popularity will make you cool, gtfo. You help ruin lives, destroy love, and kill others. You bully the kids who you think are ""lame"". Next thing you know, they kill themselves, all because you want to be popular. This game can change the way you look at the world today. You will feel horrible, sad, angry. This game shows us what bullying, and loneliness can do to people. If you just think popularity will get you somewhere in life, you won't like what you did when your dead. Simon is what many people feel like. Team Psykskallar hits this dead on. They show what loneliness can do to people. 10/10			"

												I remember waiting for the mod to come out for months at a time. It just looked like it was going to be the greatest thing ever. An atmospheric survival horror that let you fight back, just like Silent Hill or Resident Evil. Except this one is in the first person! At the time, I thought it was going to be one of the greatest single player mods ever. And that's exactly what we got.Graphically, this game goes beyong what the GoldSrc engine seemed to be capable of. The use of filters and high poly models, various graphical effects and I was blown out of my seat when I saw that water. This certainly isn't a bad looking game, even from a design standpoint. Even though the game is dark and dreary, the locations really felt like how they were supposed to. It really felt like I was wandering the city streets, or getting lost in the forest at night, or breaking into abandoned buildings. It was a genuine feeling that most games don't have today even with their emphasis on detail.The gameplay wasn't god awful but it still made you feel hindered. You had to take your time aiming and be careful with your shots to conserve ammo. Sometimes you'd have to abandon certain weapons because you couldn't carry all of them including the key items, but there was that chance you could back track and pick up that weapon later. What I liked the most is that the use of things such as sprinting and using the sights on your guns fit in with the game well. Sure, it slowed down the game but regarding your ammo, that felt necessary. The enemies are great, too. Each with their own unique set of skills and abilities as well as their macabre designs. It fits in with the game's abandoned otherworldly atmosphere perfectly.The game isn't even that short, either. In fact, it's pretty lengthy for a mod and rivals some AAA titles in terms of length and content. as you can see from my hours, it took me a while to beat this game because I felt like I needed to take my time with it. Having to go back and get weapons, dying to things I wasn't familiar with, struggling with puzzles, it felt like a game that would have stood its ground against the likes of the survival horror greats. The story is strange and, for some reason, it's logical as to why everything's so messed up.You even have a bunch of stuff to unlock. It's mainly hoodies, but it's still something you can strive for in your multiple playthroughs, especially if you're looking to challenge yourself on the harder difficulties. It has multiplayer too, which is done in such a way that acts as a sequel. It does re-use the maps so that's a bit disappointing. The game itself is so good that it warrants a second playthrough just to experience the game again. Oh, and mods. There's mods for this game and they're not that bad either.After it's all said and done, I take a look at the game's development on ModDB and I can't help but think; This game was the last hurrah for GoldSrc mods. There hasn't been a GoldSrc mod to come out in recent years that had anywhere near the amount of hype this game had. It was played to death by let's players, it was critically acclaimed by the community, it was a beautiful thing to come out of this veteran mod team, being that these are the same guys who also made Afraid of Mosters, another brilliant GoldSrc mod. These are memories that I'm most likely not going to have again, anticipating for this mod as if no other game in the world mattered and the conversations that would ensue between my friends as we played it through on the day of its release made the experience all the more memorable. That was a little over three years ago, but the memories are still fresh in my mind.tl;dr, PLAY THIS GAME NOW.			"

												Great game with a lot of problems. It's basically just elements from other survival horror games all rolled into one, but it doesn't really mix them all seamlessly. Also the main portion of the game is a fetch quest where you're going back and forth between large areas looking for a couple of items.Inventory management is very strict as well so you often have to drop very useful items just to keep the game progressing. I also wonder if the voice acting is bad on purpose?As a horror game it excels. Atmosphere, sound, design, everything looks and plays great but it's just very unfufilled in terms of gameplay. This is a free mod developed by a small team so you've got to give it credit for that, but just don't believe all the hype, this is a game with a lot of issues.Full Video Review:

												Swedish FPS Horror at its finest. Better than most AAA horror games nowadays.If you liked this, you should also consider trying Afraid of Monsters: Director's Cut, a Half-Life mod on Moddb, made by the same guy.Cry of Fear is kind of like Afraid of Monsters, except slower paced, less paranormal stuff, has an inventory and dual wielding system, etc. As well as most notably, a new coat of paint on the GoldSource engine, so the visuals are pretty slick this time around.So you wake up in an alley way, probably from being wasted, or maybe someone mugged you and punched your lights out, gotta find a way home.You soon find out that there is hammer wielding maniacs and other... things.. running about and wreaking havoc on your face.Did the local insane asylum break loose? Was an evil portal opened up by the local madman? Could I possibly pull out any more random excuses out of my♥♥♥♥♥to make this review any more mediocre?Well you'll just have to play the damn game to find out!8/10, would get spooked and run low on memory and crash again.

												Cry of Fear is a mixed bag. The game and pretty much everything about it is fantastic, with one glaring flaw: the drawbacks of using an engine as old as GldSource with so many modifications is that this game will crash. A lot.This wouldn't be such an issue if you weren't relying on savepoints, but *SPOILERS AHEAD* I got stuck in the train tunnels where you have to use the flares because it managed to crash three times in a row at about the point where you get to the doctor. At that point I gave up. But if it says anything, it is good enough I'm likely going to try to get it to work tomorrow. If you are somebody who despises any game with the potential of losing progress due to poor mechanics, then maybe you should pass this up.Other than the stability issues, this is a superb game and it scared me quite a few times. I loved the inventory system, if I had one complaint about it, keys shouldn't count as items. I know it may be a 'drop a weapon so you can progress' kind of game at times, but the only effect taking up my inventory with keys has is making me backtrack for the sake of getting back certain weapons I had to drop to pick up some keys.The music provided the perfect tone for every environment you can imagine, and was so good that it could create effective tension even in a room that is completely empty except for the player. I had a very nice time with this one, one of my all time favorite horrors in general. I'd recommend any fan of the genre pick this up if you have the time to get it working properly._____EDIT: Got it to work and have beaten the game twice. The story and visual beauty is so compelling that I'd recommend you continue playing even if you do experience frequent crashes. Final Score:9.5/10			"

												 I really wished that more people would  focus on depression, loneliness and isolation, instead off just pure fear faction. Than they would understand the meaning of all those horrendous creatures you encounter in your path. 10/10 my favorite game. We were all simon at some point in our lifes. Depression can literally kill people. When you are alone, all by yourself, when no one cares about you. I've been there... I still am sometimes. Just be grateful that someone loves and cares about you, and please dont try to ruin someone else's life, just because you are some cool kid that everyone wants to be around. Stop with the bullying. And maybe someday when you are older you will think about all the consequences you've done...			"

												It's a shame modern games don't really have the kind of modding scenes older FPSes did. The Half-life games in particular spawned some quality mods and conversions across quite a few genres, horror included. Cry of Fear is just such a project, with so much work put in that it's barely recognizable as a Half-life mod save for the familiar movement mechanics. And while it may have some rough edges, you might be surprised how spooky this one can get.You play Simon, a hoodied inhabitant of Stockholm, on his way home for the night. Through a mysterious and sudden event, he finds himself roaming deserted streets and buildings while assailed by nightmarish figures. Using the few meager weapons you find, you'll have to battle through the countless monsters to reach whatever lies at the end of your journey.In contrast with most first-person shooters, Cry of Fear has you fighting small handfuls of enemies with a very limited arsenal. During the first hour of the game, you'll have naught but a pocket knife and a weak pistol to guide you through. It's enough to overcome the mostly melee-focused monsters in your way, especially since you tend to encounter them one at a time. There's also a stamina bar used for dodging that's going to get a lot of use, because you're soon going to find there's only one good way to fight monsters in the cramped quarters of the game.I give Cry of Fear credit for crafting environments that look very much like real places, but this is one of those times where realism eats into the actual fun. Real-world alleys and hallways are VERY narrow, cutting off a lot of tactical options. Most of your encounters are going to be in tight hallways where you can't get around or past your foe. This leaves you doing the old duck in, stab, duck out shuffle for virtually every creature you come across. It's not quite as easy as it sounds but it can get very tedious very quickly.Despite the flat combat, the inhabitants of the game do a fine job of spooking you. There's a wide variety of horrors to battle, from eye-gouged murderers to spike-armed puppets and all the way to flying hospital bed monsters. They'll often come screaming at you from down a dark hallway or behind a door they just smashed down, and I had a few good jolts from them including the ones I kinda knew were coming. Cry of Fear's horror is very shock-centric, with herky-jerky creatures barreling out of the shadows and disembodied heads screaming at you in the cutscenes.It's not just monster mashing, either. You'll come across a number of puzzles, each one more grounded than hunting crests and some of them actually being pretty clever setups, like hacking a PC cafe terminal for a padlock code. There are also keys, health syringes, and other important items to collect and keep in your mostly unnecessary inventory screen. This screen lets you assign items to your three paltry hotkeys and use things like keys on doors, but honestly the game would flow a lot better without it. The game would also flow better with less backtracking in some of the larger levels, like the nigh-endless apartment complex. I also have gripes with the monsters sometimes glitching out and doing no damage, and the bosses being pretty underwhelming and a bit sloggy.Honestly though, I'm prepared to forgive all that for the excellent atmosphere and craftsmanship that went into this game. What you're getting is like a looser, less-polished Condemned, right down to the melee focus and decrepit setting. The dark, cramped, detailed levels establish a very grimy, oppressive feel that lends terror to the already freaky enemies. The soundtrack takes cues from Silent Hill in the best ways, going for grinding, pounding songs and effects when the action peaks. It's a long, long game as well, so if you're digging the grunge feel and stabby combat, there'll be plenty of it, and that's not even touching the custom story and co-op support. Cry of Fear trips on a few fronts but still clears the bar for an excellent horror game, thanks to some choice atmosphere and amount of content.			"

												        This game, like many other games, has gameplay. You can move, you can look around, and occasionally, fire a gun. It has graphics. It has lighting effects. It has a decent color pallet. It is also free to play, so you can't go wrong. It has a story unlike any other. It has enemies to combat. It also has allies that can help you on your quest. Unlike a lot of games nowadays, it has varied, thematic, set pieces. Don't let the title fool you, you won't be crying in fear, you will be crying about how amazing of an experience you've had, absolutely free, so you can save the money for passover. The movement is pretty dynamic. If you walk into a hard surface, you will stop. No longer will you have that lingering feeling that at any moment, you will fall through the floor. Oh, I forgot to mention that this game has a very engaging, and cinematic co-op experience. Each moment in co-op is unlike any other before it. You and your friends will experience a truly heart-wrenching, claustrophobic, gut-pounding, bowel movement-inducing, spoop filled catastrophe. Never has there been a more immersive co-op experience. The indie aspect truly shines throughout the many epic, magnificent, unanimous, diverse, open world realms. The only downside, and I truly regret to have to report on this, is the complete lack of an in depth character customization. Without a feature as crucial as character customization, I FEAR that this game will be overlooked by many. I CRY at the very thought that this game will go unnoticed. It is with all of my heart, that I recommend this game to everyone who enjoys a fast paced, adrenaline fueled, ride into the mind of the developers. Brace yourself for the emotional rollercoaster, and try not to CRY when you reach the end.			"

												Awful voice acting is really my only complaint. The game is built on the goldsrc (the same one Half-Life 1 runs on) engine, and has tight controls and excellent combat. The scares are really nice, and the jump scares are few and far between. It's very atmospheric, and even has a co-op function. It's also free. FREE.It'll also even run on potato PC's.

												Cry of Fear is a well executed Half Life 1 mod, focusing on first person survival horror. You play in the shoes of the flawed protagonist named Simon after a life changing accident, following the main characters struggles with Anxiety and Depression. The game itself is very well executed for a free to play game, although graphically it looks outdated, this does not draw away from the overall ambience and horrific designs of many of the monster filled throughout the game. All mechanics feel swift and responsive, including the combat mechanics.   Also, many different game modes are available to play, including doctor mode and nightmare mode! There is also a coop feature, which lets you immerse in the fear together as a different set of characters. In conclusion, Cry of Fear was a very entertaining and immersive gaming experience with a ton of replayability. If you are a fan of the Silent Hill series, I would extremely encourage you to try this game out if you have not already! As a free to play game, you have nothing to lose and I assure you it will be worth the time to download!			"

												Cry of Fear is a psychological single-player and co-op horror. You play as a young man, Simon, desperately searching for answers in the cold Scandinavian night, finding his way through the city as he slowly descends into madness.The single player campaign claims to take about eight hours time.There is also another secret campaign after beating the first, then a completely separate co-op campaign, and multiple custom campaigns along with a custom campaign and map creator that is intuitive and easy to use.The gameplay is like most survival horror games. You do have a backpack and your pockets but you cannot carry everything, forcing you to make sacrifices on what you want to carry and what you need to carry.Cry of Fear's atmosphere is great, the dark corridors, the creepy forests to a tight packed school, the environments are varied and have a great way of getting you in the mood and into the game. Another aspect of the atmosphere in sound, Cry of Fear has a wonderful soundtrack with scary, dark tracks and beautiful melodies.Cry of Fear was a Half-Life 1 mod that turned into a full free game. I  recommend it to everybody who loves horror games. You will not get anything better for free.Sounds 9/10Graphics 7/10Gameplay 8/10Atmosphere 10/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												Let me just say I've never played Half-Life, and knowing Cry of Fear started as a mod of that game makes me very intrigued to try it out, being as Cry of Fear is one of my favorite games on Steam. I have never been so unsettled and on the edge of my seat while playing a video game before in my life. I have played all the Silent Hill games, Siren Blood Curse etc. but none of those games made me feel so happily full of dread as this game. I enjoy being frightened and shocked; to me it's the best part of being alive. I don't know where to start because in my opinion there are so many positive things I can say about this game. For starters, it makes me happy/sad that I finally got to play a protagonist that so openly displays himself as a ""cutter"". I have a huge amount of respect for the Devs for keeping it in the game. I'm not saying I approve of self-mutilation, on the contrary I am strongly against it, but it is a real thing that many people go through and for the Devs to shed light on this sensitive subject is very brave of them. Certain aspects of the game are challenging, for example: escaping the falling subway. But for me thats what makes it that much more rewarding and enjoyable. the game is very dark and disturbing, so if you are scared of being chased by a lunatic with a chainsaw, claustrophobic or ""Facebook"", I would think twice before trying this game. The dark matter in the game: self-mutilation, suicide and depression, are present throughout most of the game. The story is very well done, and I appreciate the fact that there are multiple endings (similar to Silent Hill games), which gives some replay value. Along with the extra unlockable content, which includes weapons and alternate clothing options. I've never tried out the co-op or Manhunt mode so I cannot give my opinion on that part of the game. The custom campaigns are a nice add on as well, but I would suggest waiting until you've played the campaign all the way through before playing them to fully appreciate and understand them.			"

Product received for free
												Cry of Fear is an outstanding game, giving insight into the mind of a depressed teenager riddled with anxiety. For someone who is unfamiliar to these sorts of conditions this game may come off slightly hyperrealistic and only distorted for the horror aspect of the game, but that is not the case. Like a lot of other people, the main character's monsters all represent something he deals with in the real world, whether that being personal relationships, or his anger towards the world in the first place. Not only is the story solid, but the game play is easy to follow, yes there are times you must go back through an area you've already seen, but in doing so you begin to see how our main character sees everything as repetitive. The whole game is about the main character and what these depressing thoughts and anxiety riddled interations play a part in his life and what they do to him mentally. Cry of Fear is truley a step up from Team Psykskallar's orginal title 'Afraid of Monsters' not only in the horror aspect of the game, but story wise as well. Really hoping to see more titles from them soon.			"

												This to me is the scariest game on steam, I have played through almost all of it (around 8 hours, good length story). The only other game I could comapare this to ""scary-wise"" is PT the Silent Hills teaser on PS4. This game plays much differently than PT of course. The lore and atmosphere is so creepy and the character models, while not very detailed, are still horrifying. The little notes you pick up throughout the game will make you cringe and wonder, ""what kind of creep made this game?"". There are some puzzles which are moderately challenging and the combat isnt by any means great but thats not why you play this game. You play it to see if you have what it takes, to see if you can last the whole ride. -Gameplay 7/10-Horror 10/10			"

Cry of FearCry of Fear is a free but very great horror game. The main character is Simon who does not know how he found himself in a deserted town which has been overrun by strange monster. Our goal is to survive but also to solve a mysterious riddle. To defeat the monsters we have a melee weapons and a guns. You will kill a lot of monsters but also you are must to fight with the powerfull bosses. The game has a very atmospheric music but also have a custom stories and cooperation mode. My rating is a 9/10. "

												For a free game, this provides some ♥♥♥♥ing quality entertainment. Like really, it's a great experience with a friend(s), just know what you're getting into. Pros: Some pretty scary parts,It isnt exactly a walk in the park game, it has some genuine difficulty to some parts, giving a sense of accomplishment when you finally kill the chainsaw ♥♥♥♥s.Small download, if you don't like it or it's too spooky, there isn't much lost. Quality single and multiplayer content. Cons:You have to either play on LAN or port forward, which i assume is a problem for some people. (There is some other way but I hear it's really bad.)Bugs. There's a lot of them. Some really frustrating, some really funny, some helpful. Voice acting is horrid. Also pretty hilarious Melee feature is really bad and clunky, which is bad because you'll be doing it a lot. Be ready to be really frustrated at some really bad design points. Even though it looks like a lot of cons, its still a great experience and I was super excited to get the chance to play it again with a friend.			"

												One of the best Half-Life mods ever made. + Great atmosphere and climate of the cold, dark city crawling with living nightmares.+ Enemy design.+++ Story.+ Nice RPG elements.+ Does not overuse jumpscares.+ Many nice easter eggs and references.+ Graphics and level design of course. It's amazing how Team Psykskallar squeezed such a great-looking horror game from such an old engine.- Hardly any cons, just encountered few bugs througout the game and the voice acting can get a little cheesy sometimes but it's still very well done afterall.♥♥♥♥ing 11/10			"

												I played this game around the same time I fell into a deep depression a few years back and the whole time I played it I kept thinking ""Whoever made this must have been really messed up before"" If you enjoy the old resident evil and silent hill games you'll love this one, it's the kind of game you'll probably need a walkthrough for but it's full of some good jumpscares and the atmosphere will make you want to turn the lights on. It's combat is decent and it's story will make you feel bad for the main character a lot. If you haven't played it yet I highly recommend giving it at least an hour or two before deciding to continue or just deleting it.			"

												I'll start by saying, if you're a horror fan you have no reason not to at least try this game. Its free and has a gripping and quite lengthy story driven campaign. Thats not to mention it also has a seperate coop campaign and even tools to make your own custom campaigns.You follow a teen called Simon, a deeply troubled soul who for some reason gets caught up in a car accident. Upon his awake, he realises he's been left abondoned in unfamiliar territory only equipped with his mobile phone and pocket knife. Many questions have now been raised; How and why is he is here? How he did get away unscathed? Who and what are these shadowly figures that keep appearing around each new corner?The game pretty much plays like any other survival horror game. You control SImon from first person view and move from A to B collecting various items and solved puzzles along with way. The atmosphere here is perfect and is only made better with the chilling soundtrack. Even though it can look a little dated now (which is probably down to this being a Half-Life 1, Source Gold engine mod to be fair), this seems to only help with the creepy factor. I do get a sense that this game was heavily influenced by the Silent Hill series due to the settings and surreal nature of the gameplay but again this is by no means a bad thing. It contains a plater of jump scares, some cheap and some less so but these are all well mixed with some very unique experiences. Thats not to say the game doesnt have its problems. Some of the combat can be far too frequent at times giving it a repetitive feel. The maze-like map design can get confusing causing you re-tread many a room unnecessarily. Also the game does have tech and bug issues. I've had a number of crashes and random glitches but these were thankfully few and far between.Overall, I throughly enjoyed this and it has some excellent work on show. Its only a shame these guys wont get at least something in return for this. Highly recommended.			"

												I play 30 minutes of Cry of FearThen I stop.There's a free game called ""Virdi"" that is supposed to be great at relaxing your nerves, so I play that for a bit.It's a virtual flower garden. I play Virdi. I water my succulents. I draw sketches of my succulents.Then I play Cry of Fear again for another 30 minutes.I go back to my succulents. I play another 15 minutes of Cry of Fear, but immediately stop when I hear the Sawrunner.I go back to my succulents. I can still hear the SawrunnerI water my Echeverria ""Lola""I can still hear the SawrunnerI prune some weeds from my pot, that I have dubbed ""The Dankest Pot.""I can see Sophie's bloody, strewn body on the pavement.I plant my new Lithops Optica Rubras.Their blood-red tinge makes me think of the Human Flowers that impale Simon and drag his corpse to be amalgamated in their gore.The sketches of my succulents are now tainted with imagery of jagged knives and weeping women. They were my only respite from the hell that is Simon's mind. Cry of Fear still managed to poison my Garden.10/10 would have my mind permanently corrupted for all of eternity again. "

												Truly one of the best horror games I ever played. That is, as soon as I got it to run properly. It would often spaz out after playing an hour or so, but I noticed that if I went into the options menu and changed the resolution every now and again (so that all textures etc. got reloaded) the game ran perfectly. Now, the gameplay:A lot of modern horror games seem to think that there is nothing scarier than not being able to defend yourself. While that is indeed a scary thought (and works wonders in Outlast), knowing that you can indeed effectively defend yourself in Cry of Fear can have an inverted effect. You and only you are responsible for your survival. Success depends largely on your capability to react properly and not give in to fear. If you're looking for a a really really good scary game that has a very disturbing and grim tone, this is the game for you. Try not to get depressed while playing it.The one downside to this is the voice acting. The Swedish accent doesn't bother me, it's just that the voice acting doesn't sound like the actors meant it.

												Cry of Fear is a psychological horror FPS set in the Scandinavian Stockholm, playing as Simon, who got dangerously depressed after a car accident that costed the functionality of his legs. You don't actually play as Simon in person, but as the Simon in his own head, making every obstacle, every horrifying monster and every environmental obstruction a reflection to his real-life depression, which makes this game so different from the rest.The game is built in the Half Life engine and originally started in Greenlight, but has made its way on Steam. Rightfully.PROS:+ Unique type of gameplay/story with different choices and endings+ Long gameplay (easily 7-8 hours)+ Terrifyingly scary + Free to play+ Touching story+ Many unlockable weapons and items+ You don't need Half Life or its engine to run itCONS:- Can trigger actual depression if you're susceptible- Some puzzles can take a good while to figure out- Several bugs/audio/visual problemsIgnore the cons, honestly. Play this game. It's not just a game, it's an experience that leaves its mark on you.Note: this game isn't easy!My rating: 10/10 (and yes, I mean that in all honesty)			"

												Hello everyone.First of all, sorry for grammatical mistakes, English is not my mothertongue.But still, I want to recommend this game to everyone who likes intelligent and immersive single player games. Cry of Fear is a First-person-shooter, which focusses on Story, Storytelling and Atmosphere, instead of gameplay and bombastic graphics. Nevertheless, the game has some gripping shooting meachanics that work quite well due to the Source-Engine, on which it is based. Same goes for the Graphics. It may not be up-to-date, but the game still has good lighing effects and an overall round view. Plus, it never falls beyond 60 frames. But, as I mentioned, the core of the game is the story. The protagonist is young Simon, who wanderes around a desolated town after being hit by a car. In there, you will find some creepy characters and terrifying monsters. And I literally mean terrifying. They often remind me of Silent Hill, for them to be strangely deformed and tortured looking human beings. It is simply hard to watch them, for you can think of the pain these creatures probadly suffer from. While discovering the city, the player finds out more about Simon's past and sees some strange visions. Later, even reality itself will twist and change to drive you mad. This game is full of cruel, but somehow beautiful madness and creativity and confronts you with some deep frights and things that make you uncomfortable, like pedophilia, suicide, anger and depression. Also the plot twist at the end of the game will hit you hard. Finally, one can say that Cry of Fear is an absolute Gem among the Free2Play games. It is deep, terrifying, adult and intelligent. If you feel strong enough to play it and to discover the depressing story, have fun...Fot I don't want to sound like a mindless fanboy, here is some critizism as well:1. There is some backtracking that might annoy you.2. The game is not always fair, ammo and healing items are unfairly rare.3. The underwater section, which exists for some reason, is incredibly frustrating.4. There are, like in Half Life, some Jump n' Run sections, which are also incredibly frustrating.			"

												I've entirely redone this review on the 26/10/16. This review will contain minor spoilers.This game is certainly one of the best - if not the best (horror) game I've ever played in my life, and I've played a lot. I've played the campaign and every single custom campaign on nightmare difficulty and received all unlockables (except the donator one, shame on me really). Call me biased but this game seems to be up to par with AAA games despite of it being a mod for Half Life 1.The entire game is set in a mostly realistic and believable scenario (speaking about the proper campaign here) which seems to be Stockholm, in Sweden, though the world tends to have its horror-based twists here and there. The story itself revolves around the way Simon got into a car accident and hasn't been able to deal with his depression and anxiety. But Simon isn't alone - what's with the strange doctor? The guy that you seem to follow throughout the entire game and yet refuses to make a hold for Simon. What's with the girl, Sophie, that Simon goes to the same school with and that was the only person that he seemed to get along with and take care of him and he clearly is in love with? Why do they appear in the game and what's the matter with them? Why are you the way you are and view yourself as this mentally broken individual? Why is Simon trapped inside his own nightmare, fueled by his depressions and fears?I'm baffled by how much effort the developers put into something that is ""merely"" a Half Life 1 mod. Sure, the graphics are very outdated but by no means are they bad for what they're meant to do. Enemies look gruesome and dangerous, the places look believable (and really realistic for a video game depiction of Stockholm) and it's blatant that the developers put a lot of thought into the way they make enemies look because every, really every single enemy reflects a part of Simon's life/depression/anxiety. Guns are really good looking and they feel satisfying to use. When it gets to sound design though -  it's up to par with the big names and AAA studios. The game generally plays smooth and has a lot of action to it while also having a fair amount of puzzles which all seem to be very plain (carry item x to place y, find x to go to y). Backtracking doesn't happen too often for it to get obnoxious either.The game comes with a dozen of unlockables, custom campaigns and difficulty modes so there should be something for everyone (and the custom campaigns are mostly really good too!). I can proudly say I don't regret my time spent on this game whatsoever.			"

												Cry of Fear was an amazing experience for me and one of the best HL1 mod I've ever played. It feels more like a standalone game than a mod. It has some bugs here and there but they are not game breaking. The inventar system is very nice and reminds me of the RE inventar. The monster are so ♥♥♥♥ing crazy and different, actually I had more wtf moments from Cry of Fear than from the Silent Hill series. All the custom animations, sounds and cut scenes makes this mod really unique and special.As I playing further and further I can see how much love they put into this piece of work. The replayability is pretty high on Cry of Fear since it has 6 different endings on singleplayer mode and it will unlock secret files plus items after each ending. ( The devs comments are very interesting too! Especially from ""ruMpel"" lol) Players who only want to enjoy the co-op mode will be a little disappointed here. You can't save your game in this mode nor going back to the previous map unlike in singleplayer where all the maps act as one big section. You will also need a network tool like hamachi in order to connect to your buddies server and sometimes you will be disconnected due to some bugs but nonetheless it is really fun to play the co-op mode with your friends :)Well, this game is pretty sick and disturbing sometimes... don't play it if you are under depression or a scaredy cat :D			"

												The monsters in this game are pretty ♥♥♥♥ed up, that's what I like in a horror game. Cry of Fear engages you into it's dark atmosphere. Not only is it a mutant killing spree type of game, it has plenty of puzzles which makes this game the full package. Highly recommend this game to FPS gamers.10/10.			"

												This is classic survival horror.  Play on easy, unless you are very familiar with the genre, then play on normal or maybe hard.  Think classic Resident Evil/Silent Hill.  You could end up restarting the game, if you perform poorly enough.It boasts a lot of content: the main campaign, about 6-8 hours, although 2.5 hours is achievable.  There's a 'Hunk' campaign, similar to RE2, after the main campaign where you run a gauntlet with no saves or anything.  There are many unlockables, like infinite ammo famas, camera that freezes everything.  There are also fan-made custom campaigns which can be played in any order, at any time.  Finally, there is a coop campaign.There are 5 different endings you can get, depending on the choices you make.			"

												CoF is scary and is an improvement from previous mod Afraid of Monsters with two of the developers being part of this team. There are many original enemies and it used the GoldSrc engine from HL1 in a good way with different mechanics and movement. Levels are original and you fight many bosses. There are also co-op and an alternate story mode with more endings, counting a total of 6 endings (4 from original single player and 2 from these other modes). 10/10			"

												Cry of Fear has always seemed to me like an old abandoned playground. You would come there as a child, apprehensively but relentlessly. A place with rusty slides and naked trees around it. First, you're there out of curiosity, trying to overcome your fear. But then the place draws you with its unique atmosphere and memories that it bears. Simon's experience becomes your own depression sweetened by transcendental ambient soundtracks. It's so much like one of your nightmares that you dwell on after a long unsound sleep.If you are born with congenial depression or have a chronic existantial crisis, this will be a nice supplementation to your splendid sufferings.

												For a free game this surpassed my expectations. it has occasional boss fights a great atmosphere and story and it doesnt rely on jumpscares. you have to manage resources like whether or not you want to have a pistol and be able to find more ammo or a shotgun which is more powerful but ammo is much more rare. i give it 7/11 cries.

												I played this game on my old steam account back in the day. This game is one of those gems that define real survival horror. You'll probably need to go shopping for new pants after you're done with this game, assuming you'll have the balls to finish it all the way to the end. This game is very well made. The story is very engaging and the suspense and horror factor in this game is nothing to joke about. The graphics may be outdated by today's gaming standards, but give this game a try and you will not regret picking it up and adding it to your gaming library. In fact, this beats out most survival and horror games on steam...and this one is free! I would have gladly paid for this game for its full price without the need of a steam sale when I first discovered it. It was a godsend that the developer of this game decided to make it free. To show my support for this game, I shall list down an honest review of what I believe the game has made me experience.PROS:- For a game that was based on the old Half-Life engine, it is very well made and polished.- The horror factor in this game is unquestionable. You like getting your pants soiled constantly? Play this game.- The story is quite engaging and is a realistic take on people who suffer from the particular illness the protagonist is going through.- Realistic atmosphere and creepy environment adds to the horror factor of the game.- Classic game, one that will keep you on the edge of your seats the whole time.- Ever played Silent Hill? This game is pretty much on par with it.- This game has the most disturbing and creepy looking enemies you will face.- Online co-op.CONS:- There are some areas in the game that are VERY dark by design, even with the flashlight. You might wanna boost your brightness settings a little bit.- Controls may feel a little clunky at first, but overtime, you'll get used to it and it will seem more fluid as the game progresses.- PewDiePie once did a LP of this game. I rest my case.- The save system and inventory is a little bit troublesome to navigate through and get used to, but like the others, you will get used to it as you progress more with the game.I love horror games even though sometimes I don't have the balls to play them. I'll give this game a solid 9/10. I highly recommend it for both horror casuals and veterans alike.			"

												ok, cry of fear is definitely one of the best games ive played in a while, i wish they had a little more control but that is valves fault, not team psyskaller, they did a wonderful job and i wished i could beat doctor mode...other than that, it may be some trouble to get working right at first, but i think its definitely worth playing, if you dont have very much patience then your loss, this game also resembles alot of afraid of monsters (witch i also reccomend to play) and in that matter mainly the reason that the whole game im looking at my health bar and i dont even see it, and it takes forever to find a syringe, all in all, all the fear factors are introduced to this game as well, like there is a fear of death, great atmosphere, and very immersive, one thing i wouldve liked is (spoilers) more character development with sophie and more adknowledgement of her death (even though it was fake, it felt reall to the book simon) also, love the soundtrack, other than this, great game, especially for a mod, im glad it became a standalone on steam or else i wouldve never played this amazing game, i cant wait for another title from team psyskaller!!

												Cry of Fear is my favorite game ever! The storyline of this game is realy soulful. Every autumn, my depression grows to a peak, and playing this game is like... Feeling the way Simon felt. This game is a face of depression and suicide. Seriously, it is a free game, i would be ready to pay like 15$ for it. I even donated to developers, i realy like it. My advise: when autumn comes, get some alcohol, get 10 hours to beat this game, and after finishing it, enjoy your new suicidal thoughts :DDDЭто моя любимая игра всех времен. Сюжет здесь, трогательный аж до слез. Каждую осень моя депрессия достигает своего пика, и играя в эту игру, можно ощютить на своей шкуре как ужасно чувствует себя Саймон. Эта игра отлично олицетворяет депрессию.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ это бесплатная игра, я бы заплатил даже, так я и сделал, разрабам 300 рублей донатнул. В общем, когда будет осень, возьмите что нибудь покрепче, сядьте и играйте, пройдя игру, можете наслаждаться своей новенькой депрессией)))))			"

Suddenly you get big scary ♥♥♥♥ers that apear out of no-where and take most of your ammo with them.

												I simply love this game. ♥ I loved the story. It's a FPS, you can use a lot of weapons and you need your cellphone to illuminate your way.It's a game full of psychological horror, mystery and action. You must solve some puzzles to continue playing, and you need to be a good player if you want to beat all the creepy monsters and to grab all the weapons. It's awesome how everything has a meaning, each monster, every situation, all the scenery. I loved the end, all makes sense when you finish the game.  The ending depends on the decisions you make throughout the game.The bosses are epic and very originals, its a challenge to defeat them.The only downside to the game are the graphics (And I'm not sure If I have to count this as a bad point) and the technical issues (it crashes a lot or get some bugs) but if you can beat the bosses, I'm pretty sure than you can beat the technical issues.9.5/10 ♥			"

												Absolutely amazing game/mod.I really appreciate how it does go for unsettling tone and atmosphere, more so than cheap and lazy jumpscares. Now, don't get me wrong, there ARE indeed jumpscares here and there, but they don't overboard with it.I especially appreciate how the game does bring and raise awareness for (clinical) depression, suicide, PTSD, paranoia, and possibly schizophrenia.The game has plenty of collectables and secrets that'll keep you hooked and wishing for more.And hey, it's by the same dudes who made Afraid of Monsters. Another equally great HL1 mod.Pros:-Great atmosphere-Amazing soundtrack (can't stress amazing enough)-Twisted and creative monsters (and holy ♥♥♥♥, did they leave a mental scar...)-Horrific and mental scarring audio design-Good, and fair challenge (may vary depending on difficulty and player skill)-Collectables to keep you coming back-Brings awareness to real world mental issues-Jumpscares are present, but time and pace themselves really well-Balanced and fair weaponry (not counting collectables)-Plenty of AoM referneces-Your choices impact the ending!-Boss battles are fun and tenseCons:-Can be really unforgiving (looking at you, S-Rank Nightmare mode... took me ages to get Simon's Book)-Story/endings can actually have a negative impact on the player's emotions-Platforming is a bit clunky and stiff, sometimes unresponsive-Story could have done a better job on such a touchy and sensitive topic-Too much back tracking, feels lazy instead of offering more variety-Game stability is a bit iffy at times-Too much equivocation, not enough information (show, don't tell)-Objective(s) isn't clear most of the time (often found myself consulting a walkthrough)-Reoccuring, almost invulnerable enemy, the Sawrunner -- adds unnecessary tension7/10Great game, fairly polished, very rememberable, could use some work in game design, story telling and difficulty.

												*** UPDATED ***Cry of Fear is an interesting game not because of how it's done, but the fact that it's the only true survival-horror title we'll ever get in maybe a decade or so.The team that made this game also made the Afraid of Monsters mod for Half-Life, which some such as myself feel this was an improvement over it. The atmosphere in itself is just dark, metallic, tense, and irks danger more often than not. The way the world is built around this is pretty damn good too, it does it right.Unlike Afraid of Monsters where ammunition worked in the same way as Half-Life, this game does it tradionally, with there being a magazine counter rather than total rounds in reserve; any time you reload you dump all the rounds in the last mag, no ifs ands or butts about it, it's gone.

												Cry of Fear is a first person and co-op horror game that was formerly a mod for Half Life 1. You play as Simon, a disturbed man that gets hit by a car and wakes up in an alley. As you wander aimlessly through the dark Scandinavian night, you get attacked by vairous monsters and demons that represent your life before and after the accident. Throuout the game, you encounter many disturbing hallucinations, that progressively get more disturbing and dangerous as the game progresses. This game is a psychological horror, and only the bravest can witstand the entire game to its brutal conclusion. The game has multiple endings, each one having a slightly different scenario, thirty unlockables, several custom campaigns, and a follow up co-op campaign, along with a custom co-op campaign. This game is dark, disturbing, and atmospheric.And it explains some of the things that people might experience after suffering from traumatic experiances. Sadly, the developers aren't making any more updates for it.			"

Note: I will say this twice, I HAVE NOT FINISHED THIS GAMEOK take two on my review for this game... Cry of fear, a mod orginially for half life 1 before being givin a stand alone relese and what we have here on steam. Now I havent compleatly finished the game but from what I have played the game WILL ♥♥♥♥ WITH YOU, it will mess with your head and you'll ask just what the hell is going on, and from what I can gather the only way to find an anwser to that is to finish both the SP and MP campaigns. Yea a lot of times you have a gun or a decent weapon in your hand but you never truely feel safe walking though the empty streets... well not completely empty...Is this game scary? at time it is freaking TERRIFYING, to me at least. Diffrent people react to diffrent things and with this game I had goosebumps most of the time I was playIs this game good? I think it isIs this game scary? again I think it isI apoligize for the crappy review... I wrote this after staying up till 2am...			"

												This game is a very interesting and fun game to play, though you have to get the patch for the game, it is still fun to not only play through the story but to get all the endings and get all of the collectables, as well as beating the game on the hardest difficulty, now while the multiplayer is present, the server browser is unable to find servers normally but there are other ways around it. But overall the game is fun and gave me some occasional scares and constantly made me paranoid for the next enemy or boss, if there was ever a sequel for this game, I would buy it in a heartbeat.

												This is by far the best horror game i have ever played!It has all the right elements for a good singleplayer story, since the creator knows exactly how to build up some tension and let you scare yourself sometimes, when you feel like something is going to happen. Even though it isn't ""next-gen"" graphics with mo-cap cutscenes and all that, it uses what it has very well.With that being said it's not perfect, at least not when it comes to multiplayer.I have been wanting to play with a lot of my friends, but i have only been able to do that with my brother, because the only way to play with someone is by being in the same house (by using LAN). Although there is ways to do it with programs like Hamachi, it takes ages to set up and can be difficult.With that being said, i definitely think that its a game worth playing, especially if you love horror games.For me this is a game that i probably will, subconsciously, compare to any other horror game i'm going to play in the future.Score: 9.5/10Pros and Cons summary:+Great story+Bonus maps/storys+Nice level design+Scary atmosphere+Great multiplayer Co-op storyline+Original monsters+Not jumpscare-after-jumpscare based+Small puzzles from time to time (find keys/ropes etc, rotate statues)+Notes and secrets to intensify/expand the story-Cant play with friends unless you use programs like Hamachi-Not that many Co-op maps-Voiceover volume is sometimes very low-Small and few glitches from time to time			"

												""This game contains violence and gore,"" warns the opening title screen, ""and may cause fear, depression or suicide."" I wonder: has this game actually caused suicide? Because if a game could, this would be it.Cry of Fear is by far the most dreadful thing I've seen since Penumbra: Black Plague, but when I say ""dreadful,"" I don't mean ""bad."" I mean it fills you with dread. If there is such a thing as hell, it probably looks like Simon's nightmare world, not the fiery shores of DOOM 3, and depending on who you are, that's either the best reason to play it or the best reason to avoid it at all costs. Had this been its own game, not simply a Half-Life mod, it might have gone down as one the classics of horror gaming along with Amnesia and Silent Hill. In any case, it deserves more attention.			"

												The best game i have ever played. i am a man who loves stories to video games. this game is very dark, emotional, and scary. you also make your own options at some points. You are Simon Henriksson: a young 19 year old in stockholm, sweden. now the game is way too scary and depressing but it is different from most scary games. this game features a american horror and a japanese horror. american horror features on gore and chainsaws. japanese features on jumpscares and emotional scenes. this game also changes from scary to emotional then back. the co-op is not scary but it is very challenging and fun. the suicide (survival mode) is addicting, it gets scary at some scenes or fast at others. in the end of this game, you will have sympathy for simon. maybe sympathy for David Leatherhoff as well.Simon... i'm sorry.

												This game has had me hooked to it for days, and I just can't get enough of it. The jump scares in this game are heart stopping, the enemies are terrifying as hell, and the plot takes a nasty turn for creepy and confusing in the end, no matter what ending is  earned. If you want to find a game that will gave you a scare like no other game, I would highly recommend this game to you. 10/10 stars.			"

												The best game i have ever played. i am a man who loves stories to video games. this game is very dark, emotional, and scary. you also make your own options at some points. You are Simon Henriksson: a young 19 year old in stockholm, sweden. now the game is way too scary and depressing but it is different from most scary games. this game features a american horror and a japanese horror. american horror features on gore and chainsaws. japanese features on jumpscares and emotional scenes. this game also changes from scary to emotional then back. the co-op is not scary but it is very challenging and fun. the suicide (survival mode) is addicting, it gets scary at some scenes or fast at others. in the end of this game, you will have sympathy for simon. maybe sympathy for David Leatherhoff as well.Simon... i'm sorry.

												One of my all time favorite horror games with an amazing story. Captures everything psychological horror should have. The developers had made a half life mod, Afraid of Monsters, which was also an amazing horror game. Reminds me of the good ol' times with the Silent Hill series, up until Homecoming, which kind of ruined it for me.			"

												As a silent hill fanatic this game appeased me in a way i did not expect. These developers should make a SH game because they know what they're doiing with the game mechanics. The game will stress you out and make you feel fear, it will make you regret mistakes because it will PUNISH you for mistakes. There is no hand holding.  10/10 would buy the game if it costed money.

												Okay so this game is Creeeeeeepy. I first heard about this game from watching a Lets Play "" 666theheartless666 "" Ever since i wanted to try it and i ran out of games to play so i decided to get a copy of this for free. Watching isnt so bad.. but playing it gave me serious motion sickness within 2-5 seconds of walking and running around. i had to set my sensitivity way down. The monsters and this whole game is just very fast. So that sucks for me personally. But the game itself is amazing..You must try it, its so good. 9/10			"

												Cry of Fear is a work of masterpiece in its field. It can manipulate you into feeling hopless, horrified, sometimes having to rely on survival instinct. The amazing, original, and spine tingiling monsters can easily scare you till your lungs are out of air. What is the best is the fact that it messes with our minds. How we think of horror games, what we expect from horror games, and Cry of Fear throws all of that out of the window. Even though its an old game, it still scares the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me. For those who want to be horrified like nothing before, I defenitly recomend this game.			"

												Alright, so this game is terrrifying. Not because of normal reasons like why outlast or more action horror related games, i.e. resident evil. No. This game has a serious and deep sense of dread, the atmosphere is some of the best i've ever seen in a horror game. The visuals and textures are of course very dated but it makes up for it and more with the audio. H o l y h e c k. The audio to this game is absolutely phenominal. Some of the sounds the enemies make are just incredibely haunting. I'm a seasoned horror veteran and I had trouble facing another corner just to hear a shriek of a weird masked hoody dude with a screwdriver. Overall for what it is, a free horror game, the best free horror game i've ever came across. 10/10			"

												In theme this is a great game and is able to give off a great atmosphere. Clearly inspred from silent hill, which is always good, in fact going deeper into it It, it gets better, but the start of the game isn't great, the sp00ky jumpscare at the start can give a bad impression. The combat? Its really not that good either, its melee combat is preety terrible and its placement of enemies really makes it look confused, it wanting to be a SH esc game, or a dead space game, though for the atmosphere its amazing and I'd suggest trying it out for that.

												Cry of Fear is a big achievement when it comes to Half-Life mods. It is total conversion, it has a lot of graphical detail and some nice graphics put into it compared to something running on an old Quake-like game. The graphical element is really well nailed in this game.Gameplay is pretty solid most of the time, the weapons are fun to use and I like the way you have to use items to continue forth. Now the cons: It took me a while to realize that reloading my gun also meant losing any leftover ammo in the clip. That felt like a bit of a snag, Ihaven't seen any game other than Cry of Fear do that, and I doubt any game will do it again, for a reason. It wasn't a big problem, but I felt it was just frustrating.Now one more problem I had was the unnecessary bactracking. I think this is more of a design flaw, because the player's inventory made no difference between weapons, mission items and other items. I had to drop things, carry an item over to an objective, then get back to carry the rest. It was kind of annoying.The combat pacing was also off, a lot of times I felt like some areas could've done without having any enemies around, and in those places the combat felt unnecessary, and even detrimental. I'm going to expand on this more when I talk about the story.Cry of Fear obviously takes a lot of inspiration from games like Silent Hill 2, it dwells into the psychological horror category, but I think it fails to really capture the spirit of the genre. The game relies too much on jump scares and ""creepy"" monsters with no real substance behind them to try and scare the player. Most of the time it's way too much in the player's face as well. For example, the the nightmare sequence with the head in the middle making faces and spinning around ends up looking really goofy, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.The story doesn't feel like it really connects with the gameplay, with only a few cutscenes that don't really feel like they influence the course of the game itself. They also feel like they come out of nowhere. Let me elaborate:  this is especially the case with the cutscene where Simon's girlfriend kills herself. It felt like they were put in solely because a game in this genre needs cutscenes. We were meant to feel something, but we don't really care because up until then, we had no idea who Sophie was. She just pops out of nowhere. The story's simplicity becomes really apparent at the ending.The subplot with the pedophile♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥murderer in the apartments left me wanting to find out what was going on, what it was all about. However the subplot is never, ever expanded upon. You never find out how it is relevant to the story, or what happened to the guy, or how it connects with Simon. Could it be that Simon found his journals, was onto him, and he tried to silence Simon by hitting him with his car? The car accident in the beginning looked very deliberate. I was expecting it to be related to his incident, but the entire subplot never goes anywhere. That's another missed opportunity.This is also where I go back to my point regarding enemy placement. I think the game had a perfect opportunity to focus on it's atmosphere in the last part, where you're in the city and it's sunny. The monsters just felt out of place, and ruined an atmosphere that the game actually succeeded in building up. This atmosphere of anticipation, the feeling of a long journey being concluded. Had there been no monsters after the sun rises, it would've made the ending a whole lot better. Simon survived the night, he got out of the dark and there are no monsters left. The ending would've been less anticipated to turn out weirdly. I felt like the game at this point really missed it's chance to make a good twist that was very much needed, a twist that would've surprised and satisfied players.Overall I think Cry of Fear could've done with a bit more fine-tuning when it comes to gameplay, but that's not my main gripe. The game just misses so many of it's chances to be legitimately unnerving, creepy and atmospheric, trading it for dumb combat with monsters I just can't find scary at all, and filling up with cheap jump scares or backfired ""scary""content that ends up looking comical. It had a tremendous amount of potential, but it completely failed to take advantage of the opportunities that were screaming to be grabbed by the balls. It's a game that throws in a lot of half baked concepts to look deep, but there's no real effort in the story otherwise. If the developers focused so much on the high quality of the graphics and the content, they could've at least focused on the story, the pacing and the atmosphere just as well. What really hurts this game for me is all the potential that was opened up by the developers, but ends up being completely misused, ignored and put aside.			"

												Cry of Fear is a psycological horror-shooter in an area similar to Stockholm, Sweden. You play as Simon, just some ordinary guy suffering from severe depression and what I think, due to the monsters, some schizophrenia. The game starts off with a segment of a man crawling towards Simon, uging for help, but Simon does not respond in kind and harms the man, bashing his head into a wall. Then there's a few fades to a blood-soaked padded cell, but the blood seems to spell something. Then the game cuts back to Simon, who stands around for a second before getting hit by an off-roading vehicle. Then there is some gameplay where you take pictures of the letter X that reveal a sinister plot and then a face screaming at you in the end.Waking up in an alleyway with no recollection of what exactly happened before-hand armed with a (Slightly blood-stained) knife and a cell phone. Checking on his phone, he gets a text from his mother, urging him to come home, however; Simon cannot respond, as he has no service. (We all know that feeling, eh?) Then you embark on an adventure through the town on finding a way to get back home. This is the introduction to Cry of Fear, originally a Half-life mod and later a full Steam release, which I will be reviewing because I have no clue what the difference is but if there is one, you're getting the Steam release. This game is made by the same dev team who made Afraid of Monsters: Directors Cut. Winning quite a number of Indie Game awards, and rightfully so. But, just a fair warning, this game is grim and can cause nightmares.Some things could turn one off about this game, such as dated graphics and a slightly odd control scheme.Pros+Story Rich+Great voice acting+Amazing add-on maps+Spooks all around!+Guns don't feel too over-powered and feel as though they're tools for survival+Puzzles that aren't too difficult but aren't too easyCons-MP is difficult to operate without Hamachi-difficult platforming sections-monsters are a bit difficult if that's a con to you.Total rating: 9.75/10			"

												Well, this is really something else.Before playing Cry of Fear I wasn't really into horror games - in fact, I don't think I ever played any at all with the exception of a bit of Amnesia and SCP: Containment Breach. The reason I downloaded CoF was because it was a mod for HL1, and I was having serious Half-Life withdrawal symptoms at the time (seriously, where is episode 3?). What I got was not only an encouraging introduction into the horror genre, but one of the best games I've ever played in terms of character, story and suspense.In particular, the protagonist, a nineteen year old Swedish guy named Simon, really struck a chord with me. Before playing this game I was having some serious issues in my life, dealing with heartbreak and severe anxiety to name a few. I can't say much without spoiling the plot, but the mental trauma that he went through and the way he responded to it let me know that I wasn't alone with these problems. The immersive gameplay of CoF helped me a lot and allowed me to connect to the protagonist more than any other before.But anyway. As far as gameplay goes, it's relatively simple - if you've HL1 or any other Valve-made FPS, you should have no problem learning the controls. Unique to CoF is the inventory system, in which you can store up to 6 items, and the ability to duel-wield specific weapons. The puzzles are also challenging without being ridiculously hard, and if you get stuck like I did on the ""park puzzle"" with the statues then don't be afraid to look the answer up on Youtube.One criticism though. In order to avoid cheating, the developers have removed most of the console commands which would help you if, say, you're halfway through the game with low health, no ammo, and stuck in a room with 6 monsters armed only with your switchblade. This happened to me and I actually had to go into the game files and modify the damage values for the switchblade in order to progress. Not cool, Team Psykskallar, not cool! What if somebody encountered a game-breaking bug and got stuck in a wall or something? They wouldn't be able to noclip out. Still, that's pretty much the only criticism I have about this game. Everything else is spot on. If you're a hardened horror fan or relatively new to the genre like me, be sure to give it a go. It's free, after all. "

With GRAPHICS.I must admit the storyline's a bit lacking, but it makes sense since the protagonist's CLINICALLY INSANE, and sometimes the game just lags alot, especially with windowed mode, but what do you expect, it used to run off GoldSrc.Just get it, it's free.And get Afraid of Monsters: Director's Cut as well.And don't forget to poke the kitty 5 times.And call the police if you need help.And edit reviews to get steam badges			"

												Do you like first-person-shooter games?  Do you like Silent Hill types of survival horror games?  Do you like those two types of games blended together?  If the answer is no to these questions, then don't get Cry of Fear for free.  If the answer is yes, then stop reading this and download this game already.  I'm only up to the first boss as I type this review, but from what I've played so far I can tell you that I really like this game.  It has inventory space to have to juggle things you find.  It has duel wielding which you can change up on the fly via pressing the weapon keys of your choice together.  It has different weapon forms you can switch up via right click if one weapon equipped. Then there's things to keep in mind when duel wielding.  If you're duel wielding the knife and gun let's say, when you run out of ammo, you have to switch to just having the gun equipped so that you can reload it.  There is a lot of weapon management needed to keep you on your toes.  The enemies so far don't dissapoint in the jump-scare factor.  The game is downright creepy overall anyway.  So far the story seems interesting enough.  I did start a new game to play through the early areas again, and I can tell you that they change up the codes for doors and what-not.  You can't just speed-run knowing what the codes were.  You have to search out the clues again making it more worthy of a replay.  I also have read that this game is quite long, and has multiple endings, although I'm only an hour or two into it so far.  Now there are a few glitches here and there that I've found, and it also has crashed on me once as I died fighting the first boss.  Hopefully that won't be more common as I play on.  Even with a little glitching, I still say this game is well worth giving it a try.  It's one of the best free games I've tried on Steam.  Hell if they came out with a new updated version with better graphics and all, I'd buy it.			"

												Things I liked about Cry of FearVisuals were great for a goldsource game, I would forget it was half life 1 engine sometimes.Animations are great, spooky enemies and stuff.Monster design is extremely gruesome and great with the meaning behind each enemy making it even better.Music and sound is superbLittle bits like the inertia and such is greatGame is long lasting and hard to forgetNice nightmare scenesBad thingsBiggest issue for me still is the inventory management. It has a resident evil 1 style layout (Aka keys take up a slot, just like an m16 or shotgun) and it would be fine if you didn't have to drop all weapons to carry the keys to the next area then run back and pick them up again.I didn't like the character development for Simon or that one chick (Cant remember her name), they felt emotionless and boring.Iron sights are useless and unneeded.Certain segments easy and some stupid (Sawrunner v1)The endings made me upset physically (except the great secret ending)Multiplayer was tough to get set upLose half your already ♥♥♥♥♥♥ inventory and all weapons 3/4's into the gameSimon has asthma and cant run worth♥♥♥♥♥♥br>All in all I liked this game, I beat it when it was in beta still (Pre steam release) and I enjoyed it, past its flaws, and I would recommend it to any horror fan.

												This is a great game! I've loved it ever since it had came out a few years back, the game itself has a great aspect aside from glitches that either make you want to stop playing or just slow your story down in a nutshell. It's funny to play with other players, mainly because of some peoples reaction towards the game and other added jumpscares. I would totally recommend this game for people who just want to play it for the fun of it! The other people, like critics or others who enjoy either, story-based games, or just good games. I wouldn't recommend it.			"

												When it works, it works well. That being said, finding that sweet spot took a little bit of effort for a reward resulting from  successful ammo management and exploration.Most struggles arose from the back end of things - setting up the server using Hamachi wasn't impossible, but made playing the game a little more frustrating. Switching map on the server kicked everyone out, forcing everyone to rejoin again. Sometimes upon map load people would lose connection entirely, forcing a server reboot and progress to be lost. Some maps would seperate players into their own seperate instances - spooky, but concerning when most levels require the buddy system to survive.Enjoying Cry of Fear depends on the resiliency of the player(s). Some levels concisted of a neat gauntlet of ammo management among players, a puzzle of meleeing certain enemies, while having ammo to gun down larger foes. However, this scarcity of ammo turned the game from a scavenging horror game into simply a puzzle with the curtain of horror pulled down. Some levels employ simple platforming, those new to Source physics might find it a little overwhelming and those familiar may dislike how finicky some of the jumps can get.Despite all of this, the enjoyment just barely outweighed the frustration and it still made for an entertaining night among friends.It's free. It's ok.			"

Of course the Co-Op is there as an added bonus, for those too scared to play on their own! :P I highly recommend this game, especially because it is free and utilises some of the best aspects of horror gaming.

												One of the best survival horrors out there. The influence of Silent Hill (especially 2) is clearly visible on both gameplay and theme, but capturing that kind of atmosphere and mood can only be a compliment, A huge one. And worry not because Cry of Fear does have a really strong identity of it's own.The limitations of the Gold Source engine are barely noticeble due to just how much the original game was modifyed, however, like Half Life, Cry of Fear also changes gameplay mechanics from times to times, depending on the scenario you're in. For a horror game, Cry of Fear does this tremendously well, and except for a few moments of the game (like the falling train sequence) the game manages to use the change of it way of playing as a way of provoking fear into the player rather than frustration, since from a moment to another you will be forced to think in a different way if you want to progress. The story like I said earlier, is incredibly influenced by Silent Hill, however, it is obvious that alot of it came from the creator's life experiences. One thing I must criticize is that not all monsters seem to represent imidiatly Simons guilt and fears, some of them are just twisted and disturbing for the sake of being twisted and disturbing, but, while they dont offer much in terms of the main characters' psyche, they do offer more variety of gameplay, since Cry of Fear does have many diferent types of enemies. All I can say plot-wise is that it takes it's time to reveal what's actually going on, and the closer you get to the truth, the more twisted and nightmaqrish the visuals of the game will become, to express the depression and suicidal tendencies of the protagonist. The gameplay is filled with subtle details that are mostly overlooked even by the greatest of the surival horror genre, wether old or new. The presence of those elements only make this game grimmer and genuinly terrifying, since they add depth to the game, and you will have to consider their use if you want to survive due to the scarce resources. I was also incredibly impressed due to the quantity of bonus material. You get a bunch of new game modes, extra weapons, developer commentary, diferent outfits, trophys, pages of Simon's book, and also, parts of the game switch simply by starting new playtroughts. For example, codes for specific doors change so you cant simply resort to online help to solve a puzzle. There are also TONS of easter eggs in the game, 4 diferent endings on the main singleplayer, theres multiplayer and 4 different difficulty settings. Also, props to the sound design and music, it's also great.For a free game this is absolutly amazing, and for such a small team of developers... Then my god you guys have created a masterpiece. It is one of the scariest games I've ever played, dont let the terrible jumpscare screamer at the beginning reflect how the rest of the game is gonna be. And if you like Cry of Fear, then I highly recoment Afraid of Monsters as well, but that one you will have to install like a regular Half Life mod. This game, at least for me, proved that both game with combat or without combat can be just as scary as one another, taking diferent routes for their game design.So, if you are a horror fan, why arent you playing Cry of Fear yet?

Nice and Scary enemies, jumpscares that make you♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants, a cellphone that is an infinite flashlight, ♥♥♥♥ing perfect.The only thing I downvote of this game is the amount of bugs it has. It's incredible how you load your game, and when you appear you have a Switchblade and a Phone, but the thing is that they appear two hands within the Switchblade, and then other hand with the phone. WTF?. Or holding a Glock with 2 hands and then having a 3rd hand holding the Cellphone.Nice game - 7/10.			"

												Campaign is really good. No jump-scares, only scary enemies and stuff... But coop has TOO much problems.1. reliable channel buff overflow (wth is this).2. When you fail to win level and everyone die, level gets restarted, and you lose ALL weapons and you get Branch and pistol.3. After some times of playing levels, after rcbo (reliable channel buff overflow)... joined... lost connection, and BAM! STEAM VALIDATION REJECTED???But anyways if you like playing singleplayer at night, this game is for you			"

												Cry of Fear is a free-to-play horror game and was published on Steam in April 2013.You'll play as Simon, a teenager, who finds himself caught up in a nightmarish version of his hometown with only one objective - to find your way back home... You'll get to solve a couple of puzzles and you'll fight the monsters that hunt you throughout the game - this can prove quite tricky since amo is fairly scarce and the bosses of the game all require different tactics... Overall the games atmosphere and design is quite well done, the monsters are scary and the bosses and rooms prove to be quite disturbing as well! The story evolves as you progress in the game and focuses a lot on Simon - I wont spoil anything but there are different endings which conclude the games story really well! The whole approach is kind of ""Silent Hill-ish"" and interesting to play.The games graphics are based on the Halfe Life 1 engine and thus not good compared to modern standards, but the design is done really well and presumably WILL scare you a couple of times, mainly due to the variation of the different areas as you progress through the game...Overall I can recommend you to play Cry of Fear - if the graphics don't scare you off or if you like horror games with sinister stories in general! Being a free game, Cry of Fear is certainly worth the few hours you'll spent on playing it alone - or with friends.			"

												Re-reviewing this. It's an amazing horror game in all senses of it. Lots of replay value. Wonderfully scary, doesn't rely too much on jumpscares, even if it uses them here and there. The atmosphere is amazing for a GoldSrc game. The soundtrack just immerses you in the story. The story is nice too, depressing to say the least. Frustrating puzzles from time to time that take a bit of brainstorming to solve are scattered around singleplayer.If you're going to get into this, there are three things you need to know. You're going to get scared, you're going to get frustrated from time-to-time, and you're going to get pretty damn depressed. It's all good. Unless you're here for the multiplayer. Then you're here for balls-to-the-wall horror fun, with friends. It's fun and all, but has neither the story nor the puzzles of the singleplayer. I say: Get it for the singleplayer, and play the multiplayer afterwards. I wasn't dissapointed, and I hope you won't be either.			"

												[Potential Spoilers!]Cry of Fear is a psycological horror-shooter in an area similar to Stockholm, Sweden. You play as Simon, just some ordinary guy suffering from severe depression and what I think, due to the monsters, some schizophrenia. The game starts off with a segment of a man crawling towards Simon, uging for help, but Simon does not respond in kind and harms the man, bashing his head into a wall. Then there's a few fades to a blood-soaked padded cell, but the blood seems to spell something. Then the game cuts back to Simon, who stands around for a second before getting hit by an off-roading vehicle. Then there is some gameplay where you take pictures of the letter X that reveal a sinister plot and then a face screaming at you in the end.Waking up in an alleyway with no recollection of what exactly happened before-hand armed with a (Slightly blood-stained) knife and a cell phone. Checking on his phone, he gets a text from his mother, urging him to come home, however; Simon cannot respond, as he has no service. (We all know that feeling, eh?) Then you embark on an adventure through the town on finding a way to get back home. This is the introduction to Cry of Fear, originally a Half-life mod and later a full Steam release, which I will be reviewing because I have no clue what the difference is but if there is one, you're getting the Steam release. This game is made by the same dev team who made Afraid of Monsters: Directors Cut. Winning quite a number of Indie Game awards, and rightfully so.  But, just a fair warning, this game is grim and can cause nightmares.Some things could turn one off about this game, such as dated graphics and a slightly odd control scheme.Pros+Story Rich+Great voice acting+Amazing add-on maps+Spooks all around!+Guns don't feel too over-powered and feel as though they're tools for survival+Puzzles that aren't too difficult but aren't too easyCons-MP is difficult to operate without Hamachi-difficult platforming sections-monsters are a bit difficult if that's a con to you.Total rating: 9.75/10			"

												When I first downloaded Cry of Fear on my Steam, I thought I wouldn't be that scared by it seeing as I laugh at retro graphics (and all of the enemies you come across in the first Half Life game). However, I was wrong. The game's only elements of fear are from its jumpscares and they are pretty damn terrifying. I no longer require sleep anymore (but who needed that anyway?). The graphics are kinda old looking but that makes the game even worse because it causes the enemies to look more grotesque than a realistic game would. I prefer playing retro games anyway and I always find non-realistic looking games to look and play much better. On the whole, a terrifyingly-poopdedoop yourself- enjoyable experience and I highly recommend this game if you enjoy survival horror games, like Half Life mods (or are constipated).			"

												Cry of Fear is made off of a Half-Life mod and is surprisingly very well made. Developers clearly did put a lot off work in this game. However I am apparently stuck on the second chapter as I don't have enough ammo hence I'm unable to progress, but I did manage to watch the game on YouTube to get an idea about the game.The story-telling is good, clearly took inspiration from Silent Hill series. Gameplay is clunky (but challenging) and graphics well look decent, which is understandable since it was developed by a small team. The atmosphere is great, the monsters are scary and creepy, sounds were excellent and the visuals add up to the scary/creepy vibe. It's a great game and probably the best game for a mod and a free game.Now why I don't recommend this game? In my case, which is pretty rare I managed to have barely any ammo left and now to progress through I don't have any way to fight off the enemies. I played at medium difficulty. I loved this game until I got stuck. I get the fact that it was supposed to be challenging but if you ♥♥♥♥ up there is no going back. Very fursturating!! Also the jumpscares kinda get predictable later, you just expect the monsters to be out there lurking. I think it would be better if the monsters were not put in some part of the game for the sake of unpredictability factor.Some subplots could be explained better but they are completely ignored.So yeah overall a great game however my experience was ruined because of the poor design which i unfortunaetly was the victim of. I recommend people to try this game out. Also it is free so just go for it! "

												[Potential Spoilers!]Cry of Fear is a psycological horror-shooter in an area similar to Stockholm, Sweden. You play as Simon, just some ordinary guy suffering from severe depression and what I think, due to the monsters, some schizophrenia. The game starts off with a segment of a man crawling towards Simon, uging for help, but Simon does not respond in kind and harms the man, bashing his head into a wall. Then there's a few fades to a blood-soaked padded cell, but the blood seems to spell something. Then the game cuts back to Simon, who stands around for a second before getting hit by an off-roading vehicle. Then there is some gameplay where you take pictures of the letter X that reveal a sinister plot and then a face screaming at you in the end.Waking up in an alleyway with no recollection of what exactly happened before-hand armed with a (Slightly blood-stained) knife and a cell phone. Checking on his phone, he gets a text from his mother, urging him to come home, however; Simon cannot respond, as he has no service. (We all know that feeling, eh?) Then you embark on an adventure through the town on finding a way to get back home. This is the introduction to Cry of Fear, originally a Half-life mod and later a full Steam release, which I will be reviewing because I have no clue what the difference is but if there is one, you're getting the Steam release. This game is made by the same dev team who made Afraid of Monsters: Directors Cut. Winning quite a number of Indie Game awards, and rightfully so.  But, just a fair warning, this game is grim and can cause nightmares.Some things could turn one off about this game, such as dated graphics and a slightly odd control scheme.Pros+Story Rich+Great voice acting+Amazing add-on maps+Spooks all around!+Guns don't feel too over-powered and feel as though they're tools for survival+Puzzles that aren't too difficult but aren't too easyCons-MP is difficult to operate without Hamachi-difficult platforming sections-monsters are a bit difficult if that's a con to you.Total rating: 9.75/10			"

												Cry of Fear is made off of a Half-Life mod and is surprisingly very well made. Developers clearly did put a lot off work in this game. However I am apparently stuck on the second chapter as I don't have enough ammo hence I'm unable to progress, but I did manage to watch the game on YouTube to get an idea about the game.The story-telling is good, clearly took inspiration from Silent Hill series. Gameplay is clunky (but challenging) and graphics well look decent, which is understandable since it was developed by a small team. The atmosphere is great, the monsters are scary and creepy, sounds were excellent and the visuals add up to the scary/creepy vibe. It's a great game and probably the best game for a mod and a free game.Now why I don't recommend this game? In my case, which is pretty rare I managed to have barely any ammo left and now to progress through I don't have any way to fight off the enemies. I played at medium difficulty. I loved this game until I got stuck. I get the fact that it was supposed to be challenging but if you ♥♥♥♥ up there is no going back. Very fursturating!! Also the jumpscares kinda get predictable later, you just expect the monsters to be out there lurking. I think it would be better if the monsters were not put in some part of the game for the sake of unpredictability factor.Some subplots could be explained better but they are completely ignored.So yeah overall a great game however my experience was ruined because of the poor design which i unfortunaetly was the victim of. I recommend people to try this game out. Also it is free so just go for it! "

												Cry of Fear is a splendid HL1 mod which features very modern map design and gameplay elements.It's a very well designed mod in general however I felt Cry of Fear's spiritual predecessor Afraid of Monsters was scarier. Moreso because AoM was very surreal and it had this very low budget fanmade feel to it. Cry of Fear feels like what Afraid of Monsters would've been with a much more experienced team.CoF is a very nicely made mod in general but I recommend playing AoM first to get some perspective on it's design.

												We all have heard things about being alone, but we've never completely experienced it...That's why this game was created. This game puts you in Simon's mind, all alone, to feel what he feels, and experience what really means to be alone, in your mind. Even if you're not a fan of horror games (like me), give this game a shot and you'll love the atmosphere and the ambience of the game through the first playthrough.The Doctor's story was rather short, but it was worth unlocking it.The CO-OP campaign has a really impressive story and gameplay....Still didn't get my opinion did you? ok so here it is: The best horror modification (even a full game) ever made.Also it's free so you got no problem getting it now.Yes, right now.P.S: This was my first review. ^^			"

												Cry of Fear is my very first horror game I ever played, and it has to be one of the scariest. Cry of fear has a great storyline, lots of terrifying monsters, jumpscares and a fair share of blood and gore. The game post says that Cry of Fear was originally a Half Life 1 Mod, but it definetely has some great graphics for just being a Half Life 1 Mod. The only thing that annoys me is that Cry of Fear isn't 100% accurate with ammo plus I also don't like the fact that if you open your inventory, the game is still going on. So if you're going to look through your inventory make sure you're in a safe place with no monsters around, or you will die.			"

												This game is terrifying to play by yourself. Of course, that's part of the fun. I liked how there are other game types other than just the campaign, and the campaign itself has good replayability. You can go back and find all the secret nuggets hidden about, and unlock in-game items. Gameplay is smart and realistic, like how I had to sacrifice a light source to use a knife and gun in both my hands. This isn't a game you play for stunning graphics, but I enjoyed the enemy designes; especially the pregnant woman with the baby clawing at you from her stomach. I had to take a break after that one to calm down.  The only things I have against it are the jump scares and multiplayer. If you don't do so well with scary shnikey popping out of nowhere nearly constantly, you may have difficulty playing this game. There were many times when I thought I was going to have a heart attack, one right after the other. It opens up a big bag of nope for me. It's like the game relies too heavily on that tactic. Well, that and rediculously fast hostiles that make you panic and get yourself killed. For multiplayer the option is there, but it is practically nonexistent. There is no server upkeep, so I was forced to download seperate programs to try it out. I had to create a profile for different clients and host a room that lasted only a day. Once I got in a game it was actually pretty fun, with up to four players and multiple choices for game-types. Setup is just a pain in the backside. All the pros and cons aside, free is free. If you want to be scared this halloween, or any other time of the year, it is worth playing with the lights out and headphones at full volume.			"

												Personally, I love how this game was made. I love the gloom in almost every atmosphere, I love the design of the creatures you face. I love how the game is shaped around Simon's well-being, and you play through his depression and anxiety. This game is really one you can get stuck into, and there's a lot to learn about the game. If you like psychological horror games based on real life, this is a great game for you! One downfall is that I don't like the saving system and that you can only save in Medium and Hard difficulty. I'd love it if we were able to save in Easy too? Overall, I rate this game a 9/10.			"

 Cry of Fear...Cry of Fear is a detailed game with a excellent story that is being told. Simon's Story in a nutshell -~ Simon is a 19 year old male and an individual plagued with anxiety and depression. Before the events of Cry of Fear (as seen in the first cutscene of the game), Simon was the victim of a hit and run wherein he was pinned to a building by a car whilst trying to help an injured man late at night. While he surprisingly survived the incident, he was crippled from the waist down and confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life, subjecting him to further mental trauma which drove him into becoming reclusive and spiteful of his own life. Doctor Purnell was assigned as Simon's psychiatrist following the accident, and using Cognitive Therapy, Simon was instructed to write a book about his emotions and anxiety to get all the trauma out of his head. Simon and PurnellPurnell talking with Simon about his treatment.Simon authored the book as instructed and the events of Cry of Fear begin - the events unfolding being a metaphorical depiction of Simon's mind and his battle to purge his inner demons through writing, the actions taken during the game showing how well the therapy works.The Simon played as over the course of Cry of Fear is in fact a mental projection of Simon and what combats the trauma inside the real one's mind. The fate of both Simons depends on what ending is unlocked due to the actions made during the game.^ That may be a lot but that mostly is Simon's background.- This game also carries some good Co-op experience, meaning that the co-op is pretty fun and shares another story about how the Police is trying to find Simon to help him out and take him somewhere to get help while you go on a wild adventure meeting some creepy things.

												By far one of the best horror games I've played, the best part being priceless. Offers co-op up to four people for an even greater in-depth horror experience with your friends, with new jump scares and an add-on to the main storyline. This game is full of jump scares, but best of all has an amazing; mind boggling storyline that will continue to suck you in. Highly recommended to those in love with the horror genre, looking for something to give them a new fright but also giving a real story.			"

												This game is incredible.Now, I could go on for a very long time explaining, in depth, what I mean, but I'm going to keep this brief.I have been gaming since I was three years old. I have played a LOT of video games.That being said, Cry of Fear is THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE a video game has EVER made me feel.People say that videos games are a new art medium. If the point of art is to make you experience emotions...BOY DID I HAVE A BUNCH OF EMOTIONS PLAYING THIS GAME.It psychologically profiles you as you play it (although it does it very subtly, so much so that I only realised it during my second playthrough), and it will invoke feelings of confusion, sadness, and reverence for the mind of Simon (the main protagonist). Team Psykskaller did a fantastic job doing the writing of this game, and even in the most basic, low level monsters, there is symbolism to be found.Anyone who is tired of the generic slasher horror, and wants an almost overwhelming psychological trip, play this game.It is the only horror game that I (being someone who's scared easily) fully enjoy and would play through it multiple times all the way to the end.10/10			"

												Amazing horror game. Definitely one of the scariest horror games that I have played. It heavily depends on sudden and sometimes ""cheap"" jumpscares to scare you, but that's okay, it's something that most AAA games are afraid to do, what a  shame, it actually works good if used correctly.The game gives you the means to defend yourself (knife, guns ect.) and that is a nice change from all the recent horror games that the only thing that you can do is run, and hope for the best (Amnesia, Outlast, Slender ect.)The old graphics may not be the most pleasing to look at, nevertheless, the atmosphere that they have created with the half life engine is pretty creepy. The music and sound effects are great too. Finally it's a completely free game (you have the ability to donate in-game and recieve a special weapon), so I can't see why you souldn't download it!tl;dr Great horror game, a must download for horror fans!

												to be honest i thought of the good points quickly but it actually took a while to think of some negative ones about the game (because that's what people really want to hear in reviews), so here are some upsides and things that could be improved upon in my opinion and you can make up your own mindsome good thingsit's a survival horror first person. it has all the elements, jump scares, little ammo, dark atmos, creppy bad guys, etc..it's built on the hl1 engine i think?? it does amazing things!! hd resolutions, proper inventory with notes, quick slots, dual wielding, stamina. wasn't hl1 build on cry of fear's engine??difficult at times. what survival horror isn't. it wouldn't be a survival horror otherwise. it's not unfair at all, just difficult like a survival horror should beup to 4 player co-opthings that can be improved upon and/or implementeda map?? it's not like you have many places to go, it's not an open world. it's quite linear in fact but a map would be nice sometimes, just for some notes??just about all the bad guys are the same just do more or less damage and look different. they're normally quick (faster than you are anyways), they see you, charge, and attackverdictthose bad things could even be intentional and aren't necessarily bad things either, just my personal flave i guess			"

												A few bugs within the game, but aside from that... This game is a beast. The game gives off powerful expression of depression and insanity. I had spoken to the director of this game Andreas via facebook. Andreas also plays in a depressive black metal band called Intig (check it out guys) the theme of the band focuses on depression, solitude and emptiness; he is good at creating atmosphere through his music and his game. As I play this game, I could really sense the atmosphere coming from his music through the game. This game is one of my inspiration :)			"

												This game made my friend crap himself on the introduction.It's that scary.Cry of fear is a single player and co-op game where you play as a guy who wakes up in an alley and has to find his way back home.The story is absolutely amazing, and yet at the same time it will crush your feels like a bug.Sure, this game is old, and is based on the HL1 engine, but who cares?! It's still as fun as ever. And there's multiple endings, so you can play as many times as you want.The co-op, in my opinion, is so much fun. You are cops who have teamed up to destroy the zombies/monsters that have invaded the town. I love the fact that at the start of the final level, it gives you VP70's, sledgehammers and shotguns.So, if you're looking for a spoop, play this game. And then cry afterwards, because your feels are destroyed.It's free, too. Bonus!			"

												Absolutely amazing game. I don't know why people would not download this game since it's one of the best on steam and it's FREE. Like a first person Silent Hill game with more action and shooting, but the action doesn't ruin it. The only issue I have is the fact that the multiplayer is completely broken. It's almost impossible to play with friends let alone other people. Unfortunately with no new news or updates there looks like there hasn't been any efforts to fix it either. The only way you'll be able to play is if you find someone (such as myself) that portforwarded the game.... or if they use Hamachi like a scroob. I have hosted games for multiple people and beat the co-op campaigns multiple times, so if you're interested but have no friends to host, add me and I will if I'm not busy. If for nothing else though, download it for the campaign, it's free... so why not?			"

												I cannot like this game, i have tried. Monsters and gore doesnt make an horror game, and jumpscares are not scary at all, you just react to an unexpected situation or a loud noise (yeah headphones FTW).I preffer horror games that build tension, leaving you a nerve wrack, and THEN try to scare you in a situation that you cant fight back. For me guns in horror games its just a no-go (one of the reasons Doom 3 wasnt scary at all) they destroy the game fear atmosphere.Any person that played his fair share of horror games will see most situations coming, youll enter a room saying to yourself ""im going to be attacked now"" and you will probably be right. Enemies move silent and in fast-foward, but most attack with the speed of a snail and easy to read. Enemies will stop at obstacles like ledges, so, if there is one available that you can climb, its basically standing still free shooting galery for you. That and the character insists in getting stuck in a wall or two and items like ammo or seringes are really hard to spot.The game certainly has its moments, the start with the camera was cool, even if the jumpscare at the end was seen coming at a mile but still jumped with the fact i got a dude trying to destroy my eardrums, the maze where you eard the chainsaw guy in a distance was nice too, because it left me on full alert trying to figure if i was goint to fight him in those tight corridors or not.Its a niche game, if you enjoy cheap jumpscares and dont mind the little bugs. I can certainly recommend Cry of fear for you. If you, like me, preffer the ""Amnesia"" or ""Slenderman"" style horror, that leaves you defenseless and powerless against an all might foe. Then by all means, ignore this one.			"

												So, i guess its time for write a review for this awesome game.Cry of Fear its an horror game developed by Team Psykskallar.They also made the amazing Half Life 1 mod ''Afraid of Monsters''which is also coming soon to Steam for free and it will include Co-op andenhanced graphics.Anyway, this game talks about Simon, a guy who was hurted by a carand that it maked him paralyzed on a wheel chair.After this crash anyway, you wake up on a street unconoscious, you mustfind out what's happening and try to go back to ''home''... if you can still call it home uh.Ok, i'm not gonna talk anymore about the Story.Now instead, i will talk about some other things like the graphics etc...The game runs on GoldSRC Engine (same Half Life 1 Engine) and the graphics are great for such an old engine!Also, the game has a lot of scary enemy's like the ''Sawer'' which is... well, you will see with your eyes ;)The game also has 2 co-op campaigns up to a max of 4 players + a co-op survival game mode.So yeah, should you try out this game? Is it scary?Yes and yes.Its such a great scary game with lots of jumpscares.Vote: 11/10 -ign lel			"

												I thought this was a pretty fun game. Great story and twist ending. Kind of more of a psychological horror game, with some good scares here and there. It's free so why not check it out?			"

												Simply amazing......The story is amazing and so far, very scary and the atmosphere is one of its key features. Really impressed with the amount  of content this game has (its free) Long solo story and a long co-op (hamachi needed) for you and friends to enjoy.I highly recommend you download this game, right now!

												I'm not good at horror games. I'm rather good at the original Silent Hill though. Thats the kinda vibe this game gave me when I first played it. You wake up in a strange place with hardly any explanantion or anything and then *BAM* jumpscare. I first played this game at school with my friends, bad idea. The controls are solid. This game started as a mod for Half-Life so of course the controls are good. The graphichs look nice (a bit dated) and the film grain effect adds a nice touch of horror. I tried to play it, couldn't get past the opening. I don't really have any niggles with the game (haven't played much) but the loading times can take long and crash sometimes. When I first played it, I saw the task manager open at least 4 times. When it got running, it was rather freightining. I've tried to convince my mates to get it as it has CO-OP, but they don't like horror games. As we like to say: 3 spooky, 5 me. Its free so download it if you like horror, want to wet yourself or you're just insane. Haven't played enough to give a proper rating, but the game looks promising. For now its an 8/10 with a scare factor of 9/10.			"

												Cry of Fear is a First Person Shooter Survival Horror game and was originally a Half-Life mod, but now it's a standalone game. This game runs on the Goldsource engine and it's amazing how good and detailed the game looks on such an old engine. This game features a huge single-player campaign and a coop campaign as well. With a terrifying atmosphere, twisted monsters and tons of scares, if you love Survival Horror games you can't miss this one out. Since it's free, there's no reason to not give this one at least a try.			"

I've played co op about 3 times with friends, all didn't last long. Ever since I haven't been able to play with anyone, probably tried atleast 10 times since then.Singleplayer = Fun, worth it.Co op... Google how people do it, try it a few times, because it is fun...But don't waste too much time trying to connect.			"

												Cry of Fear is one of they best FREE horror games you can pick up on Steam.Although I see that many of my friends haven't completed the game cause of the scare factor,you have to look past that and see the beauty of the Half Life 1 Engine in modern time.I have to say the mapping is amazing well done by Rumple and great voice acting by the three actors.But the most amazing part of this in my opinion is how they tried to make Stockholm from playing this game Iwould love to visit Sweden to see the city. Also after your long first playthrough of CoF you unlock Doctor Mode and Nightmare Mode which adds hours of death and sorrow. The unlockables is one of the reasons I come back to get them all. Another reason is the many custom stories you can play! Sadly Team Psykskallars is no longer supporting custom stories but they're are still being made and are downloadable on the internet! I do recommend this game for any horror fan or story lovers maybe both!			"

												Well this game should be consider as a hidden gem..Originaly it was HL1 mod but now after year of developing it has become game, not just simple mod and its completely free. Graphics are like from CS 1.6 but much better. Anyway who cares about graphics if you have   awesome atmosphere and sounds :)Cry of Fear contains a single player campaign that claims to take about eight hours time.  The gameplay is like most survival horror games. Atmosphere is great, the dark corridors, the creepy forests to a tight packed school, the environments are varied and have a great way of getting you in the mood and into the game. Another aspect of the atmosphere in sound, Cry of Fear has not only a wonderful soundtrack with scary, dark tracks to beautiful melodies, but the sound in the game. Whether they are foot steps around the corner edging closer or bumping on the walls or a scream in the distance, Cry of Fear definitely full fills the scare factor.Story is simple - game set in a deserted town filled with horrific creatures and nightmarish delusions. You play as a young man desperately searching for answers in the cold Scandinavian night, finding his way through the city as he slowly descends into madness. If you are survival horror fan, you should try this game, maybe you will like it as much as i do.I rate this game very nicely although it has little bit older graphics - 8/10			"

												Honestly, Cry of Fear is a Powerful game in the ways of horror, the story is interesting to a point, in order to keep you playing. But on the better side the horror element is FANTASTIC!. There is ALOT! of effort into the ""Jack in the Box"" element and honestly, I can only see myself playing Cry of Fear in parts. I do not want to die from a heart attack (laughs) ""ha-ha"". But really the best things are.Pros.1) Fantastic!. Jack in the Box horror (jumpscares).2) Intresting story line.3) Good suspense.4) Makes you pray for safety (laughs) ""ha-ha"".Cons.1) So scary, it makes you play it in parts.2) Graphics.Now the Graphics are not that good, but it was a Modification for Half Life One but i like early two thousend game graphics i grew up with them so it. Does not bother me, I ACTUALLY, PREFER! early two thousend game graphics. But for those that want a fantastic graphical horror game then Silent Hill, Resident Evil, The Forest, Condemned One and Two, Doom III BFG Edition, and many others are the way to go BUT!. If you want a good game with awsome horror and an interesting storyline and if you are man enough, (laughs) ""ha-ha"" than Cry of Fear is the game for you!.P.S. ""I hope to gain the courage to continue to traverse the Hotel in Part one.""Rough Greek Translation.Ειλικρινά, Κραυγή Ο φόβος είναι ένα ισχυρό παιχνίδι με τους τρόπους του τρόμου, η ιστορία είναι ενδιαφέρουσα σε ένα σημείο, για να σας κρατήσει το παιχνίδι.Αλλά από την καλύτερη ομάδα το στοιχείο τρόμου είναι φανταστικό !.

												It's a very good game in general, and as far as horror games go it's the first I was really able to get into, though I'd played Amnesia and Outlast before Cry of Fear. I didn't actually beat either of those, and Cry of Fear is the first I've ever been able to finish aside from maybe Doom 3.Simple ""Pros and Cons"" Review:Pros:+Free+Impressive graphics for the GoldSource engine, and not really bad looking by any means in my opinion+Pretty good gameplay in general+Excellent atmosphere and soundtrack+Story is decent and I like how most of the monsters or environments can be significant to Simon's condition in general+Starts with a ridiculous jumpscare but still manages to make a lot of people scream in more surprise than anything+Getting jumpscared by some random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥+Being able to shoot that random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the face with a shotgun until he's dead+Sound design seems adequate+Voice acting is decent and gets the job doneCons:-Can be repetitive-A lot of backtracking, particularly the middle segment. I don't want to spoil much, but there's a big segment in them middle of the game where you have to backtrack through a big, bunch of seperate areas to retrieve fuses to open a door. It just feels like boring, tedious filler and I couldn't even figure out how to get through it or where to go without looking up a walkthrough.-Like I said before, sometimes it can be horribly tedious or vague on where you're supposed to go or what you're supposed to do. For example I spent 15-20 minutes trying to figure out what to do at a segment where you're given a shovel and spots to dig. I dug all the spots following the map and hadn't found a keycard I needed. Did I miss a spot or something? No, apparently not, it was behind a wall nearby, and the shovel and digging is really just to get things like extra ammo.-Sometimes there're too many jumpscares-Sometimes you don't have the ammo to shoot whatever ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ just jumpscared you-Nightmare mode is on steroids and I can't even get past the first guy on Nightmare difficulty, but it's probably possible I think-Co-op seems kinda buggy sometimesI can't really think of much else but all in all I kind of like it, and it's free, so that's even better. You can try it and if you don't like it there's not really much to worry about.			"

												This game, is something. I'm going straight into the problems. For one starting a server up for a ♥♥♥♥♥. It kept crashing, we couldn't seem to get it to work nor could we even get into the first menu screen. When it comes to aimming which I have feeling the developers made it like this. But every time you shoot your gun, or use anything else. It completely misses the zombie. I don't know if the developers made it that way, but it gets really annoying after awhile. Now, on to the scares. First of all, let me make this clear. I'm a ♥♥♥♥♥, like a huge ♥♥♥♥ing wuss. Hell, I couldn't even watch a Steven King movie without screaming my head off. So of course I was scared while playing this, even with friends. The fact you have a useless gun that does zero damage doesn't help either. It makes you feel hopeless in ways, and of course scared. Now, going on to the graphics. Do you really need to rip this game? Of course the graphics are bad, BUT the atmosphere is a whole different story. I think a developer should focus more on what is going on around you, then what you see. What I mean by that a game can look ♥♥♥♥♥♥. But if it has a good atmosphere it shouldn't matter. Really graphics shouldn't matter IN THE FIRST PLACE. Anyways, when it comes to the scenery this game does it right. It feels like something demonic has happen, or it makes you feel like you're being watch. And that adds the creepy part to the game, it makes you feel frightened. Anyways, I give this game a 7/10.

I'd recomend not playing this alone if you scare easy.

												I haven't even gotten to my first savepoint.  I was laying here at night, in pitch blackness save for the dim light of my monitor when I thought I'd give this a try.In retrospect, that was a bad time to start.My heart nearly beat of of my chest within the first three minutes of play.  I must play more, but not until morning.  Great game so far.Update: Over 3 hours later, I have managed to get through Chapter 1.  This is a brilliant and taxing game.  I find myself praying for savepoints - not because I'm afraid of being killed and having to start over, but so I can take a break.  If you're looking for real horror, this is it.  One thing to note, if you're playing on 64 bit windows, you will need the crash patch available online.			"

												The best horror/thriller game I ever played so far.  Donated cause I had to support it.  Out of all the other horror games in my list, triple A expensive titles, this is the one that deserves my money the most.I'm working up the balls to play in Nightmare mode.  This game will either make you a man, or it will make you......cry out of fear.It even has an extra co-op campaign and supports community-made addons and content, and even has some official ones.  It has tons of replay value.  I am a co-op nut and I -really- admire the devs for going ahead with the co-op, even tho it is buggy.Chrissakes, it's a free game and it has so much features and content.  One of the best uses of the HL source engine, ever.			"

												This is an amazing game or at least i found it really good, if you're looking for a game that keeps you on your toes this is the one the jumpscares are really well placed and the way the story is told is great. But the inventory has only 3 spaces so you have to choose wisely what you keep and what you discard. But this game is the one that makes you scared of what goes bump in the night. Enjoy.			"

												Andreas, James and team did a great work! Cry of Fear is one of the best FTP horror games you can play. Great psychological athmosphere and story, very good soundtrack and model/npcs design (especially Simon's model) and graphics. Really... Is it Half-Life GoldSource? Or is it Source? Yeah, it's GoldSrc, but they just pushed the engine to its limits. Dual wield is also good thing to include into the game. Water? Amazing! I wasn't even playing the game for the story but for the look of it! (ok, just joking :D) Anyway, great everything.Pros: - graphics, definitely improved GoldSrc and I appreciate this (10/10 [for GoldSrc]), - sounds/music, psychological and it reminded me of SH series (10/10), - story, really good and... again... psychological, you play as depressed man who walk in a haunted city and then you realize it was just his book, awesome! (9/10), - unlockables, the best of every game are unlockables, they keep you playing, because you want to own all of them (N/A), - scary as hell!, the most important part of horror is of course, horror [right? :D], you always think something will chase you or will jump on your face or something like this, I almost got a heart attack when crazy granny jumped into the vent in the subway's underground, or when sawrunner destroyed the door at the sewers at the almost end of game (ch7) (9/10), - difficulty, a little bit to much, but I like that kind of games! It's also cool that they implemented tape recorders to save instead of quick saving! Such an oldschool method, yup? (9/10), - animations 1/2, some of them are good, some are not, but I will say that I've seen even worse so I am placing them here (6/10). - easter eggs, they're so funny and really makes you feel happy for a second while being scaried all the time (10/10)Cons: - glitches, bugs, compatibility, I know you wanted to release this mod/game quickly, but then, when it got to Steam, you just didn't update it and the bugs just went across all the game. I remember that situation, when I had to change disk drives to play the game because of three/four hands and not working phone light (-1), - AI, seriously? Monsters which doesn't attack me when they are in front of me? This situation happened 4 times and it didn't happen in good place, examples: jumpscare (monster jumps right in front of my face), heart attack, and then... what... monster doesn't move and doesn't attack me. I can forgive it to you, because it didn't happen often and I know you updated AI in standalone version (monsters walking on stairs didn't exist in HL) (-0).Generally, I recommend this game to everyone who likes good and scary horror games and I hope Team Psykskallar will create other awesome projects like Cry of Fear and Afraid of Monsters! I give it 9,5/10 because of bugs and glitches, but anyway, it's very good! Thanks and keep makin' stuff! :)			"

Surprisingly long as well.Without even mentionning that it's free, it's well worth your time.			"

												Free horror games rarely get better than this.The atmosphere is great, the spooks are 2spooky, the gunplay feels nice, and the story is dark and interesting.Sure, it isn't perfect; the cinematics can be a bit wonky, the voice acting is meh, some difficulty spikes can be frustrating, and I got lost more times than I'd like to admit (which really killed the mood in one of scariest parts of the game).But, in spite of it's flaws, Cry of Fear is an excellent horror game that I highly recommend to anybody looking for more than a couple of spooks.

Surprise surprise in addition to being a truely amazing game, I found it helped with my own personal inadequacies, as the themes of self-hatred, sorrow, heartbreak and suicide are all no stranger to me. This game made me FEEL just as much as all the endings to the Ultimate Fallout New Vegas DLC made me FEEL. So much heartache and and understanding. 20/10, Cry of Fear goes above and beyond, breaking the 10/10 score by a longshot!			"

												Cry of Fear is a First Person Shooter Survival Horror game and was originally a Half-Life mod, but now it's a standalone game. This game runs on the Goldsource engine and it's amazing how good and detailed the game looks on such an old engine. This game features a huge single-player campaign and a coop campaign as well. With a terrifying atmosphere, twisted monsters and tons of scares, if you love Survival Horror games you can't miss this one out. Since it's free, there's no reason to not give this one at least a try.			"

												I don't want to give this a bad review and there's no middle between that and a good, so I'll just give it a good review because it wasn't overall bad. As someone who is an avid fan of horror games, I checked this game out after seeing good recommendations from other people. What I got from this game was a bit disappointing as I thought I would get more than a few jump scares. It showed a bit of promised during the intro and the first 5 minutes into the game, and I admit it was a little bit nerve racking in the first few minutes into it, but as soon as I got used to the atmosphere, I got bored of it and was craving for more. It didn't live up to my expectation. The enemies are dull and not at all terrifying to the point that I just run around the game hacking and slashing enemies as though I was in a knife fight with a COD player. However, again, this isn't an overall bad game. Maybe I'm just so used to the horror genre that I expected way too much from a free game. People should still check it out because it is still worth checking out.			"

												If Cry of Fear doesn't have you on the edge of your seat, who knows, it is possible that another horror game will (but not likely). This game is not the worst horror experience I've ever had, but it is pretty scary! Take on the role of Simon, a depressed man who wakes up in a strange place to discover that there are monsters all over the city! Find new weapons and manage your inventory well, choosing which weapons to keep and which to leave behind. Take Simon on a journey through the nightmarish place that his home city has become, killing monsters, doing drugs, and struggling to survive! Poor Simon... All he wants is to get home.			"

												Honestly i think this is one of the greatest and most fun horror games i've ever played in my life. Has the greatest story and Simon listens to Megadeth. That should literally just give it a 10/10 right there.			"

												Disturbing, potentially hilarious and downright scary. One of the best mods of all time, does a fantastic job of disguising the fact that it's even running on goldsource. Best played with a friend, or if you plan on going insane or dying of a heart attack, alone. The limitations of its being on goldsource probably add to its freakishness.			"

												Though occasionally it freezes and things won't load sometimes it's a great game. It's very immersive,has disturbing looking monsters, it's also very balanced when it comes to those monster attacks, it has melancholic locations and storylines about Simon the main character. The ambiance is similar to Silent Hill. I love it a lot!			"

												Absoloutely fantastic. Easily one of the best horror games ever made. This is also the only horror game ive ever played that has scared me to the point where i had to take a break. The gameplay is also good, and the story is fantastic (and actually has a very good message). The controls aren't the best though, so there willl be some jumping sections that could cause some rage but other than that, this was exellent any a must-play for any horror fan.			"

Also, EVERYTHING YOU ARE SEEING IS GLDSRC.AKA, Half-Life 1 could have looked like this, if they really tried. I give this game a 7/10 (due to the fact that it does not work on new Windows Verisons and it was full of crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥the would jump out at every corner.)			"

												Honestly, Cry of Fear is a Powerful game in the ways of horror, the story is interesting to a point, in order to keep you playing. But on the better side the horror element is FANTASTIC!. There is ALOT! of effort into the ""Jack in the Box"" element and honestly, I can only see myself playing Cry of Fear in parts. I do not want to die from a heart attack (laughs) ""ha-ha"". But really the best things are.Pros.1) Fantastic!. Jack in the Box horror (jumpscares).2) Intresting story line.3) Good suspense.4) Makes you pray for safety (laughs) ""ha-ha"".Cons.1) So scary, it makes you play it in parts.2) Graphics.Now the Graphics are not that good, but it was a Modification for Half Life One but i like early two thousend game graphics i grew up with them so it. Does not bother me, I ACTUALLY, PREFER! early two thousend game graphics. But for those that want a fantastic graphical horror game then Silent Hill, Resident Evil, The Forest, Condemned One and Two, Doom III BFG Edition, and many others are the way to go BUT!. If you want a good game with awsome horror and an interesting storyline and if you are man enough, (laughs) ""ha-ha"" than Cry of Fear is the game for you!.P.S.

												It's a very good game in general, and as far as horror games go it's the first I was really able to get into, though I'd played Amnesia and Outlast before Cry of Fear. I didn't actually beat either of those, and Cry of Fear is the first I've ever been able to finish aside from maybe Doom 3.Simple ""Pros and Cons"" Review:Pros:+Free+Impressive graphics for the GoldSource engine, and not really bad looking by any means in my opinion+Pretty good gameplay in general+Excellent atmosphere and soundtrack+Story is decent and I like how most of the monsters or environments can be significant to Simon's condition in general+Starts with a ridiculous jumpscare but still manages to make a lot of people scream in more surprise than anything+Getting jumpscared by some random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥+Being able to shoot that random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the face with a shotgun until he's dead+Sound design seems adequate+Voice acting is decent and gets the job doneCons:-Can be repetitive-A lot of backtracking, particularly the middle segment. I don't want to spoil much, but there's a big segment in them middle of the game where you have to backtrack through a big, bunch of seperate areas to retrieve fuses to open a door. It just feels like boring, tedious filler and I couldn't even figure out how to get through it or where to go without looking up a walkthrough.-Like I said before, sometimes it can be horribly tedious or vague on where you're supposed to go or what you're supposed to do. For example I spent 15-20 minutes trying to figure out what to do at a segment where you're given a shovel and spots to dig. I dug all the spots following the map and hadn't found a keycard I needed. Did I miss a spot or something? No, apparently not, it was behind a wall nearby, and the shovel and digging is really just to get things like extra ammo.-Sometimes there're too many jumpscares-Sometimes you don't have the ammo to shoot whatever ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ just jumpscared you-Nightmare mode is on steroids and I can't even get past the first guy on Nightmare difficulty, but it's probably possible I think-Co-op seems kinda buggy sometimesI can't really think of much else but all in all I kind of like it, and it's free, so that's even better. You can try it and if you don't like it there's not really much to worry about.			"

												Cry of Fear is still better than most of it's genre, and it's free. Instead of relying on easy spooks and a lot of gore, CoF delivers horror in moments like being lost in a pitch black cellar when you hear someone starting a chainsaw, or walking in a building that you thought was deserted when you hear quick tapping of footsteps from behind you. The atmosphere is sultry and thick from the beginning, and the fear might not leave you after you've stopped playing.I thought of myself being experienced in horror, but Cry of Fear surprised me positively. It made my skin crawl so badly it hurt, and I'm looking forward to experience it all over again.			"

												Cry of Fear is a First Person Shooter Survival Horror game and was originally a Half-Life mod, but now it's a standalone game. This game runs on the Goldsource engine and it's amazing how good and detailed the game looks on such an old engine. This game features a huge single-player campaign and a coop campaign as well. With a terrifying atmosphere, twisted monsters and tons of scares, if you love Survival Horror games you can't miss this one out. Since it's free, there's no reason to not give this one at least a try.			"

												This is a horror game. This is what you want when you want the rush of fear going down your back as you turn corners.  I played this before it was on Steam and nearly crapped myself the first 10 minutes of gameplay. It's free and only requires Half Life 1. Beautiful storyline aswell. Get it.			"

												If Cry of Fear doesn't have you on the edge of your seat, who knows, it is possible that another horror game will (but not likely). This game is not the worst horror experience I've ever had, but it is pretty scary! Take on the role of Simon, a depressed man who wakes up in a strange place to discover that there are monsters all over the city! Find new weapons and manage your inventory well, choosing which weapons to keep and which to leave behind. Take Simon on a journey through the nightmarish place that his home city has become, killing monsters, doing drugs, and struggling to survive! Poor Simon... All he wants is to get home.			"

												This game, is something. I'm going straight into the problems. For one starting a server up for a ♥♥♥♥♥. It kept crashing, we couldn't seem to get it to work nor could we even get into the first menu screen. When it comes to aimming which I have feeling the developers made it like this. But every time you shoot your gun, or use anything else. It completely misses the zombie. I don't know if the developers made it that way, but it gets really annoying after awhile. Now, on to the scares. First of all, let me make this clear. I'm a ♥♥♥♥♥, like a huge ♥♥♥♥ing wuss. Hell, I couldn't even watch a Steven King movie without screaming my head off. So of course I was scared while playing this, even with friends. The fact you have a useless gun that does zero damage doesn't help either. It makes you feel hopeless in ways, and of course scared. Now, going on to the graphics. Do you really need to rip this game? Of course the graphics are bad, BUT the atmosphere is a whole different story. I think a developer should focus more on what is going on around you, then what you see. What I mean by that a game can look ♥♥♥♥♥♥. But if it has a good atmosphere it shouldn't matter. Really graphics shouldn't matter IN THE FIRST PLACE. Anyways, when it comes to the scenery this game does it right. It feels like something demonic has happen, or it makes you feel like you're being watch. And that adds the creepy part to the game, it makes you feel frightened. Anyways, I give this game a 7/10.

												If you're looking for a serious bunch of jumpscares and puzzles, this is the game for you. I only put in about 3 hours because I was too scared to keep playing. And games never scare me. (Well, maybe Estranged a bit.) But besides the point, this game is fantastic and challenging in many ways. You can pick up various things, like keys, guns, morphine shots and much more. I would highly suggest playing it for the scares. Dem scares, man. Playing at night is even better with headphones and a dark environment. Oh my God, SSSPPPOOOKKKYYY!!!			"

												Cry of Fear tells a short but sweet tale of a young man named Simon Henriksson experiencing horrific events as he attempts to traverse through Stockholm, Sweden to get to his home. The plot focuses primarily on Simon's state of mind and his decay due to past events in his life.The gameplay consists of survival-horror mechanics. While guns are an option in the game, ammo can be scarce if the player has a bad trigger-finger. Morphine is used to heal the player, and is just as uncommon as ammo for specific guns. Melee weapons, while effective, do not completely protect the player from harm. The inventory screen does not pause the game, so if the player were to use the inventory system during a hectic fight, they would die if they took too long switching weapons through the menu, hence the quick select option. Saving is done through Tape Recorders, which can be found frequently through chapters. On the hardest difficulty, saving becomes harsher, with the player needing to find a tape to save and can only save 5 times throughout the entire story.There are over 5 different endings in the main game, and many more custom campaigns to play, each having similar characteristics as the horror experienced in the main story. Different modes can be unlocked through replaying the game, along with an assortment of overpowered weapons.There are 30 unlockables in the game, including unlockable modes, custom hoodies for Simon's apparel, and others, each increasing replayability value and can make the game seem a little silly i.e. Simon in Hello Kitty Hoodie.TL;DR Very good game. Play it at least once. Just don't forget about the Book.			"

												Когда эту игру выставили на голосование в greenlight я сразу за нее проголосовал, поскольку игра afraid of monsters от тех же разработчиков меня очень порадовала. И cry of fear оправдала ожидания. Главной идеей Cry of Fear является противостояние двух сущностей главного героя, как и в afraid of monsters. Игра предоставляет довольно широкий выбор по концовкам — технически их 6: четыре основные, зависят от выборов в течение игры, одна секретная/шуточная, связанная с Afraid of Monsters, и ещё одна, которую можно получить пройдя кооперативный режим. В целом игра превосходная, вязкая, буквально ощутимая атмосфера депрессии и отчаяния, потрясающие галлюцинации главного героя и невероятно крутой саундтрек. Пожалуй, единственный минус — чрезвычайная скудность настроек графики, впрочем, это не нужно тем, у кого достаточно мощный ПК			"

Best free to play horror game ever! 100/10EDIT (9/19/2014): I beat Cry of Fear and I have to say what an amazing, awesome, terrifying, nail-biting, very tensious and phenomenal horror game! The atmosphere on Cry of Fear is perfect! The scares on the game were superb and made me jump out of my seat a couple of times. The puzzles on this game I'll have to say it's good (even though there's only 2 puzzles on this game unless you count the jumping puzzles xD) The weapons on the game are pretty awesome and interesting! I also like how you can't carry everything with you so you'll have to make some tough choices/sacrifices. I definitely recommend this game if you're up to play an awesome, adventurous, and scary as hell horror game! (WARNING: This game is not for the Faint hearted) I'll admit when I played this game, some of the jump scares on this game gave me some mini heart attacks! xD			"

												for a mod running on an old engine they did an absolutely fantastic job! im not typically scared by horrer games/movies like this, but i literally have to take a break every 30 minutes so i dont have a heart attack. i haven't got very far yet (i have 6 hrs from pausing and taking breaks), but the story is already interesting and its scary as hell. the enemies themselves aren't too terribly scary, but they do like to get you with jump scares occasionally. the atmosphere is the real winner here, they did a really nice job with it. if you scare easily, you might want to wear a diaper while you play this...

												Cry of Fear is a fantastic horror game, with a great story. This game really makes you think, as it doesn't tell you much about what you have to do, and you have to figure it out yourself. The boss fights can be a little tricky, but after you beat them, it makes you feel accomplished to start pushing on through the game again. I could easily pay $20 dollars for this game. 10/10 enjoyable game			"

Don't pay attention to what my account says, I have played this game multiple times over and thouroughly enjoyed it every time. An amazing game to get oneself into the horror genre. An even better deal by the fact that it is free and has a large playtime (I've recorded about 9 hours of both it and its custom stories.) Trust me, you need this game!			"

												Well this game should be consider as a hidden gem..Originaly it was HL1 mod but now after year of developing it has become game, not just simple mod and its completely free. Graphics are like from CS 1.6 but much better. Anyway who cares about graphics if you have   awesome atmosphere and sounds :)Cry of Fear contains a single player campaign that claims to take about eight hours time.  The gameplay is like most survival horror games. Atmosphere is great, the dark corridors, the creepy forests to a tight packed school, the environments are varied and have a great way of getting you in the mood and into the game. Another aspect of the atmosphere in sound, Cry of Fear has not only a wonderful soundtrack with scary, dark tracks to beautiful melodies, but the sound in the game. Whether they are foot steps around the corner edging closer or bumping on the walls or a scream in the distance, Cry of Fear definitely full fills the scare factor.Story is simple - game set in a deserted town filled with horrific creatures and nightmarish delusions. You play as a young man desperately searching for answers in the cold Scandinavian night, finding his way through the city as he slowly descends into madness. If you are survival horror fan, you should try this game, maybe you will like it as much as i do.I rate this game very nicely although it has little bit older graphics - 8/10			"

Not only do I like the old style Half-life better than its newer games, but I sure can enjoy what I used back when I first played HL 1.Sure makes me want to play Sven Coop now.

The gameplay is also good, and the story is fantastic (and actually has a very good message). The controls aren't the best though, so there willl be some jumping sections that could cause some rage but other than that, this was exellent any a must-play for any horror fan.			"

I'd recomend not playing this alone if you scare easy.

												Cry of Fear is one of the best horror games I've played in a while. Creepy atmosphere, disturbing monsters, and some dark music to set the mood. It's like Manhunt got mixed with Silent Hill and Resident Evil, but in first-person. It's well worth every penny spent and then some!			"

												It's a free Steam horror game, and has about 8 hours of single player gameplay. It used to be a Half-Life 1 mod, but was released as a standalone.The dated graphics do their job of conveying the creepy atmosphere surprisingly well, and can just be considered as minimal art style today :DI wanted to quit recording, quit some time before I actually ended the video, because I was sucked in the game, and became quite engrossed, always a good sign.At the very start however there is a point where you need to do a crouch-jump, something that won't occur to you if you haven't played other HL1 mods of the era, which I might have, but that's like what? Ten years ago? Anyway, this got me stuck right at the very beginning of the game, always a very bad sign.Cry Of Fear, my first impression video, and walkthrough of approx the first hour:

												Cry of Fear is a surprisingly good, free horror game.Graphics:The graphics aren't great, but they are able to portray a realistic-enough city setting. The game engine's imperfect lighting actually adds a few scares, with textured models popping in over distant silhouettes at unexpected times. The game has some interesting cutscenes that look nice and present the story well.Story:The story is interesting and mysterious. Basically you have an unhappy guy who gets assaulted and knocked out, but when he wakes up he finds that his city has changed completely, or at least there's some supernatural things happening and a lot of people have gone crazy.I got a little burned out by the time I finished chapter 1 of Cry of Fear's story (maybe I just wasn't in the mood for horror lol) but I'm definitely eager to find out what happens next. (I've heard the game has up to 8 chapters, and a couple different endings!)Sound:The voice acting is believable, and the music and sounds are appropriately frightening. The game will sometimes play its tension building music at arbitrary times, and that's actually really effective at getting you to stay on your toes. And since the music buildups don't always result in combat, it actually helps the combat scare you more when you are really ambushed.Gameplay:The movement controls don't feel perfect, but overall that wasn't much of an issue. The combat is intense! Being able to make a quick dodge opens a lot of possibilies, while managing your stamina becomes a careful balance. The gameplay gets somewhat easier once you pick up a gun, but it's a tradeoff because then you always having to worry about conserving ammo (and not reloading too early, because you're essentially throwing away the leftover bullets from that last clip.) You really have to keep an eye out for morphine shots (health packs) because you can get stuck with low health for an awfully long time if you get injured early in the game before you really understand how the combat works.Overall:If you're on a budget, Cry of Fear is a well-rounded free horror game. It's not very polished by today's standards, but it does have some strong elements at its core, and some honest to goodness scares!			"

												This game, is something. I'm going straight into the problems. For one starting a server up for a ♥♥♥♥♥. It kept crashing, we couldn't seem to get it to work nor could we even get into the first menu screen. When it comes to aimming which I have feeling the developers made it like this. But every time you shoot your gun, or use anything else. It completely misses the zombie. I don't know if the developers made it that way, but it gets really annoying after awhile. Now, on to the scares. First of all, let me make this clear. I'm a ♥♥♥♥♥, like a huge ♥♥♥♥ing wuss. Hell, I couldn't even watch a Steven King movie without screaming my head off. So of course I was scared while playing this, even with friends. The fact you have a useless gun that does zero damage doesn't help either. It makes you feel hopeless in ways, and of course scared. Now, going on to the graphics. Do you really need to rip this game? Of course the graphics are bad, BUT the atmosphere is a whole different story. I think a developer should focus more on what is going on around you, then what you see. What I mean by that a game can look ♥♥♥♥♥♥. But if it has a good atmosphere it shouldn't matter. Really graphics shouldn't matter IN THE FIRST PLACE. Anyways, when it comes to the scenery this game does it right. It feels like something demonic has happen, or it makes you feel like you're being watch. And that adds the creepy part to the game, it makes you feel frightened. Anyways, I give this game a 7/10.

The gameplay is also good, and the story is fantastic (and actually has a very good message).

												Game Reviews #2 Cry of Fear.Apparently this is a mod that took 5 years to make with the old Half Life 1 engine.You are playing as a hoodie who has mental trauma that resulted to his life turn around in a manner of Silent Hill hallucinations and supernatural creatures. For a mod/standalone game that isn't much old [2013 released] it does have it's promise as a good survival horror FPS, There are some jumpscares, fears that you have to run your♥♥♥♥♥good against some enemies you cannot kill then this is the survival horror for you. You can only hold six items much like Chris Redfield from Resident Evil. This game is hard so I'd recommend starting on Easy to get used to how the game plays.I'd give this a 8.3 / 10. This game apparently needs a good gaming PC to Run despite it having the Half Life 1 engine. Which is a bit of BS. Because before I got my Gaming PC. I tried on numerous occasions to get this running on my laptop only to close down itself since it's able to play Half Life 2 games without any lage: but the bright side is that it's a freebie so you can play this game for your own enjoyment without any money spent and it has custom stories too! So you can play other stories besides the main campaign!			"

												If you're here to play singleplayer, this is definetily worth a download, it's scary, suspensful, and fun..Being free is a big bonus.Unfortunately if you're here to play co op, it's near impossible to connect sometimes. I've played co op about 3 times with friends, all didn't last long. Ever since I haven't been able to play with anyone, probably tried atleast 10 times since then.Singleplayer = Fun, worth it.Co op... Google how people do it, try it a few times, because it is fun...But don't waste too much time trying to connect.			"

												This is literally one of the greatest games ever created. It's scary, fun, exciting, and sad  as well. Surprise surprise in addition to being a truely amazing game, I found it helped with my own personal inadequacies, as the themes of self-hatred, sorrow, heartbreak and suicide are all no stranger to me. This game made me FEEL just as much as all the endings to the Ultimate Fallout New Vegas DLC made me FEEL. So much heartache and and understanding. 20/10, Cry of Fear goes above and beyond, breaking the 10/10 score by a longshot!			"

												This game is an amazing atmospheric horror-based zombie survival game, but it is so much more. It has a very subtle, intricate backstory with multiple endings to the story itself. Don't pay attention to what my account says, I have played this game multiple times over and thouroughly enjoyed it every time. An amazing game to get oneself into the horror genre. An even better deal by the fact that it is free and has a large playtime (I've recorded about 9 hours of both it and its custom stories.) Trust me, you need this game!			"

												Cry of Fear is simply one of the greatest games I've ever played. I hadn't expected such from a free Steam horror game, but I did play this in it's HL glory days, in which it was still slightly underated. The graphics wern't a problem for me, because the amazing gameplay and atmosphere filled in for what it lacked in graphic quality (it was still surprisingly good for the Half-Life engine). The gameplay absolutly terrified me, making me think that games like The Dark Decent were a walk in the park. Overall, this game is simply 10/10 from me.			"

												Cry of Fear is still better than most of it's genre, and it's free. Instead of relying on easy spooks and a lot of gore, CoF delivers horror in moments like being lost in a pitch black cellar when you hear someone starting a chainsaw, or walking in a building that you thought was deserted when you hear quick tapping of footsteps from behind you. The atmosphere is sultry and thick from the beginning, and the fear might not leave you after you've stopped playing.I thought of myself being experienced in horror, but Cry of Fear surprised me positively. It made my skin crawl so badly it hurt, and I'm looking forward to experience it all over again.			"

												Well it's free so you can't expect it to be a movie grade horror film but the way it's set up more than makes up for it. You will find yourself drawn in and as soon as you do the jump scares began. It's a great game but you might want to keep the lights on.-dark*This is my review but in games the best way to find out if you like it is to try it, even more so when it's free.			"

												Cry of Fear is a fantastic horror game, with a great story. This game really makes you think, as it doesn't tell you much about what you have to do, and you have to figure it out yourself. The boss fights can be a little tricky, but after you beat them, it makes you feel accomplished to start pushing on through the game again. I could easily pay $20 dollars for this game. 10/10 enjoyable game			"

I also appreciate some of the more unforgiving elements of the game including * enemies that can instantly kill you* enemies that can make you kill yourself* no quick saveI've also tried the co-op play (though just over LAN so far) and found it to be highly entertaining.All things considered this game gets 8 hammers out of 10.

												Probably the scariest game I've ever played that isn't called Silent Hill 3. Unlike other modern horror games, this one uses jump scares very sparingly and instead relies on its environments, sound design and art style to make the player crap their pants, and it succeeds with flying colors. Absolute must play for people who value true horror over cheap jump scares. It also comes loaded with bonus features reminiscient of old survival horror games that add to the replay value. And the best part, it's 100% free to play! Horror fans have no excuse not to pick up this terrifying masterpiece.			"

												This is the only horror game that has ever made me feel cold and depressed as well as terrified and alone... I can never forget what i've been through in this amazing game...Now turning into a classic mod and earning the title ""mod of the year"" for 2 years in a row, this is a horror game that must not be missed out on. (I know I sound like a cheezy buisness man, but it's true...) With an outstanding pace of horror and suspense, you're gaurenteed to be disturbed and terrified. The main things that stood out for me in the game was its unique duelweilding system (holding a gun and a knife, or a knife and a phone being used as a flash light). The incredibly well done atmosphere of the swedish motropolis, the way your moral choices affect multiple endings (7 if I remember correctly) but most importantly, the scares... I will never forget the tricks, traps, and unique ways for the game to endlessly toy with you... most horror games come to a point where you aren't scared anymore. This one actually gets worse the more you play...Don't play if you're suffering from depression. No joke. My friend reffused to talk to anyone for a whole week... It wasn't fun...please excuse spelling, I wrote an essay today and couldn't bring myself to spell check even more :P			"

												After patching the game for my old computer(a laptop), I finally got this to actually work(crappy computers not advised) so here is the basic list of the game's pros and cons:PROS:- Very clean inventory system- Ability to make your own maps- Different endings(watched these on YouTube)- Multiple weapons and items like flashlights- Very distinct bosses- Disclaimer at the beginning of opening the game up- VERY SCARYCONS:- No players on multiplayer- Not alot of custom maps(maybe download off of ModDB?)- Give's players power, which makes the game less scary.- Some bosses are way too easy to beat(I won't tell you how to beat the first boss).CONCLUSION:Out of all the pros and cons, pros dominated the table and I am proud to call this game a horror game because of its darkness, its grief, and what it means to be in a psychopath's mind is like(Hint Hint).

												Cry of Fear is an amazing game. The graphics may not be exactly the worlds best, but they are by no means bad. This game makes you feel alone when you need help most, putting your worst nightmares into play. Every monster in the game stands for something in the protagonist's mind. He is a very depressed man. This game is very morbid and twisted. Perhaps the scariest game i have ever played and ever will play. The story is gripping and the gameplay is fun but a tad buggy for co-op, but if you can get co-op to work its not as scary. Although co-op is very fun eitherway. You will scream, with the mix of puzzles and suspense. You will hear your very own, CRY OF FEAR. 4/5PROS:* Great singleplayer and Co-op*Scary and very entertaining* Great Storyline*Gives the feeling of abandonmentCONS:*Not so great gunplay*Glitchy Co-Op*Puzzles can be hard later in the game if your not always having your wits about you			"

												Probably the scariest game I've ever played that isn't called Silent Hill 3. Unlike other modern horror games, this one uses jump scares very sparingly and instead relies on its environments, sound design and art style to make the player crap their pants, and it succeeds with flying colors. Absolute must play for people who value true horror over cheap jump scares. It also comes loaded with bonus features reminiscient of old survival horror games that add to the replay value. And the best part, it's 100% free to play! Horror fans have no excuse not to pick up this terrifying masterpiece.			"

												Cry of Fear while it is a great game has some downsides. Sometimes the cutscenes wouldn't start, When i try to view notes it freezes the game forcing me to restart, and it took a long time just to start the game. But aside from those glitches it is a well made mod and is worthy of being called a horror game.			"

												This game is scary for the first few times, and maybe later. Anyways, this game is a fun experience to play. You play as a man named Simon Henrikkson (Dont know how to spell his last name) and he is trying to beat his way to his home, hopefully to escape from the abnormalities that come to kill him. As he goes deeper to the nightmare, he encounters the nightmare stages that actually kill him in reality. Combined with Silent Hill's atmosphere and Resident Evil's limited backpack space, this will provide a real challenge to new players who want a scare.... You have been warned.			"

												It´s so bad, it´s outright funny.I mean, I know the Game/the mod is really old and so on, so the graphics can´t be criticised by any means,But the ""coding"" (if you can call it like that) is more ""meh"", than ok.For example, it´s almost guaranteed to disconnect (while in COOP) when the area is changed, e.g. a door is opened.Also ""meh"" is the commonly occuring ""Glitch-Vision"". It means that no obstacles are shown, just enemies, ammo, doors and the basic path, no walls, no trees, no cars or anything.If you download it, check the Wikia before, it´s good to understand the whole story of that thing (which is pretty nice actually).I´d recommend playing with a friend (or more), to enhance the experience (or to come up with better jokes).It´s not all bad, it´s more like extremely ""meh"".

												I got this game late at night. I played the coop for 2 hours. It was the stupidest coop I ever played, the animations are jank, the enemy designs are laughably generic and difficulty varies rapidly. I loved every second of it.Multiplayer 100/10 Branch is best weapon. I played the first few minutes of the solo campaign and found it was lacking in spooks. Then it tried to jumpscare me with a googly eyed bloody face and I started laughing. I then stopped because I saw it was going to be 'one of those games.'Campaign 1/10 Decent atmosphere but no time for build up. Too fast to be spooks.Overall I give it 5/10 spooky flying beds.			"

												While I can't say anything about the Singleplayer (I only got a little ways in and the game crashes on me when I readjust settings so I'm not willing to go past the first jumpscare again) I can say that the gameplay is good and the Cooperative Mode is fun.Without any spoilers, I'll simply say that in the multiplayer campaign you play as up to four police officers trying to survive an onslaught of monsters. The worse (best) part of these campaigns are when you encounter Sawcrazy, a spazzy, monstrous man who uses two chainsaws to run at you. I've been informed that the Singleplayer version of him is much more frightening, which only deepens my fear and prolongs my procrastination of playing it. Ammo seems  to run a little sparse when playing with a lot of other players, which means for some enemies you'll have to get up-close and personal. In the dark. Sometimes alone, as your friends might be dealing with a twisted version of Simon or worse yet, Sawcrazy.Here's something important to note for the coop campaign. You'll probably have to use Hamachi to connect with anyone, since the CoF team never seemed to fix the server listings. I had to look up Cry of Fear servers just to find a forum post on Steam with someone who wanted to play with others (lucky me).Don't mistake this as being an indication the game is bad, though. It's frightening, sure, but that's exactly the point in a horror game. There are only a few minor problems to worry about, such as crashing after applying settings, but these aren't really problems after you're all set up. This is a great game and best of all it's FREE, so there's no excuse for any horror-lover not to download it and get started right away.The graphics aren't so amazing your eyes will pop out, but they're definitely decent. In truth, the fact that these monsters are slightly lower-textured than modern games just makes them that much creepier.			"

												9,5/10  Quite possibly the best Indie horror game i have ever played. Its simply amazing. I truly wish Team Psyskallar got paid for what they do, its so much fun to explore, even for a horror game, and the atmosphere is perfect. If you're a fan of horror games and you're reading this on a pc you own, there is absolutely no reason for you to have NOT played this. Its (sadly) free, and amazing. Go play it now.			"

												First look : ""wow ! for something using the half life 1 engine, this is quite an impressive work !""First jumpscare : ""oh that spooked me ! oh well... a bit cheap though, let's see where this is going""First steps in : ""wow... that atmospher is... terribly perfect !""First gameplay combat system : ""now THAT's what a survival horror is supposed to be : few ammo, aggressive ennemy, easily hit...""A bit later : ""I sweating on my chair like I was in a hammam ! It's been some times since I've been this scared !""And further and further in the game : ""wait... this is still the Half life 1 engine ?!""... ""wait.. this is still an indie game ?!""Coming to the ending : ""the guys who made this are definitly genius !""Story excellent, gameplay excellent, atmospher wonderfully dark, level design amazing even if some levels are recycled, cinematics good enough, voice acting could have been better sometimes (but oh well !), music beautiful.All those things proves the team do better than making a mod. They knows how to make a game. And all of that for free ! Seriously, you got no excuse for not testing this masterpiece of horror gaming, except if you can't handle the pressure of the clostrophobic event this game offers (and ""offers"" is a the best word here).Congratulation to Psyskallar !

												This is the only horror game that has ever made me feel cold and depressed as well as terrified and alone... I can never forget what i've been through in this amazing game...Now turning into a classic mod and earning the title ""mod of the year"" for 2 years in a row, this is a horror game that must not be missed out on. (I know I sound like a cheezy buisness man, but it's true...) With an outstanding pace of horror and suspense, you're gaurenteed to be disturbed and terrified. The main things that stood out for me in the game was its unique duelweilding system (holding a gun and a knife, or a knife and a phone being used as a flash light). The incredibly well done atmosphere of the swedish motropolis, the way your moral choices affect multiple endings (7 if I remember correctly) but most importantly, the scares... I will never forget the tricks, traps, and unique ways for the game to endlessly toy with you... most horror games come to a point where you aren't scared anymore. This one actually gets worse the more you play...Don't play if you're suffering from depression. No joke. My friend reffused to talk to anyone for a whole week... It wasn't fun...please excuse spelling, I wrote an essay today and couldn't bring myself to spell check even more :P			"

												Cry of Fear is a fantastic horror game, with a great story. This game really makes you think, as it doesn't tell you much about what you have to do, and you have to figure it out yourself. The boss fights can be a little tricky, but after you beat them, it makes you feel accomplished to start pushing on through the game again. I could easily pay $20 dollars for this game. 10/10 enjoyable game			"

												I got this game late at night. I played the coop for 2 hours. It was the stupidest coop I ever played, the animations are jank, the enemy designs are laughably generic and difficulty varies rapidly. I loved every second of it.Multiplayer 100/10 Branch is best weapon. I played the first few minutes of the solo campaign and found it was lacking in spooks. Then it tried to jumpscare me with a googly eyed bloody face and I started laughing. I then stopped because I saw it was going to be 'one of those games.'Campaign 1/10 Decent atmosphere but no time for build up. Too fast to be spooks.Overall I give it 5/10 spooky flying beds.			"

												It´s so bad, it´s outright funny.I mean, I know the Game/the mod is really old and so on, so the graphics can´t be criticised by any means,But the ""coding"" (if you can call it like that) is more ""meh"", than ok.For example, it´s almost guaranteed to disconnect (while in COOP) when the area is changed, e.g. a door is opened.Also ""meh"" is the commonly occuring ""Glitch-Vision"". It means that no obstacles are shown, just enemies, ammo, doors and the basic path, no walls, no trees, no cars or anything.If you download it, check the Wikia before, it´s good to understand the whole story of that thing (which is pretty nice actually).I´d recommend playing with a friend (or more), to enhance the experience (or to come up with better jokes).It´s not all bad, it´s more like extremely ""meh"".

												While I can't say anything about the Singleplayer (I only got a little ways in and the game crashes on me when I readjust settings so I'm not willing to go past the first jumpscare again) I can say that the gameplay is good and the Cooperative Mode is fun.Without any spoilers, I'll simply say that in the multiplayer campaign you play as up to four police officers trying to survive an onslaught of monsters. The worse (best) part of these campaigns are when you encounter Sawcrazy, a spazzy, monstrous man who uses two chainsaws to run at you. I've been informed that the Singleplayer version of him is much more frightening, which only deepens my fear and prolongs my procrastination of playing it. Ammo seems  to run a little sparse when playing with a lot of other players, which means for some enemies you'll have to get up-close and personal. In the dark. Sometimes alone, as your friends might be dealing with a twisted version of Simon or worse yet, Sawcrazy.Here's something important to note for the coop campaign. You'll probably have to use Hamachi to connect with anyone, since the CoF team never seemed to fix the server listings. I had to look up Cry of Fear servers just to find a forum post on Steam with someone who wanted to play with others (lucky me).Don't mistake this as being an indication the game is bad, though. It's frightening, sure, but that's exactly the point in a horror game. There are only a few minor problems to worry about, such as crashing after applying settings, but these aren't really problems after you're all set up. This is a great game and best of all it's FREE, so there's no excuse for any horror-lover not to download it and get started right away.The graphics aren't so amazing your eyes will pop out, but they're definitely decent. In truth, the fact that these monsters are slightly lower-textured than modern games just makes them that much creepier.			"

												FIRST IMPRESSION: -Graphics     This game does not boast particularly impressive graphics, but with a game like this it does not particularly matter. So do not let that be a deterrent for you. The game features some repeating textures and a lot of repeated AI animation (As in AI number 1 will always die with animation number 1). While something like that would usually deter me from a game I found no problem overlooking it as this game features many different types of AI and level types.-Audio     The audio roughly matches the graphics quality, particularly with AI (as in AI number 1 will always attack with sound number 1). As for the raw audio quality it is no masterpiece but it more than gets the job done and definitely adds to the sense of immersion.-Controls     I will admit that when I first started playing this game that I had some difficulty getting started with the GUI for things like the player inventory. There is no tutorial but as long as you're willing to spend five minutes casually learning the menu controls you will be fine. As for the actual gameplay controls I have no complaints, it's easy to navigate and you go where you think you'll go when you press a directional button. For the most part it's very natural.THE GAME:     This is one of my favorite games of all time. The story is immersive and sticks with you when you leave the game. While it's not a mystery game it will definitely hook you into trying to figure out what is going on. This game has caused me to jump more than once and can definitely invoke a sense of fear. That stacked on top of its twisted, dark storyline and anatomically distorted AI make it highly memorable. The game takes much more than 10 hours to beat with its mazes, combat and puzzles.Pros:-Scary-Immersive storyline-Vast array diverse of maps-Puzzles that are just the right amount of hard-1st person (Best for this type of game)-Longer game-Good amount of very original AI-FREENeutral:-Lack of tutorial (Good for immersiveness)-Almost zero instruction (Good for immersiveness)Cons:-Repetitive AI sounds (though this really won't affect you much)-Saves are non-transferable*SUMMARY:     Really you can't go wrong with this game. It is fun and free so you might as well give it a shot!SCORE:  For what it is and how much it costs  9/10  *You cannot pull saves for this game and use them in another installation, so plan to beat it before you replace your HDD			"

												9,5/10  Quite possibly the best Indie horror game i have ever played. Its simply amazing. I truly wish Team Psyskallar got paid for what they do, its so much fun to explore, even for a horror game, and the atmosphere is perfect. If you're a fan of horror games and you're reading this on a pc you own, there is absolutely no reason for you to have NOT played this. Its (sadly) free, and amazing. Go play it now.			"

Pros:- Amazing graphics despite being done with the ( modified ) Half-Life engine - I've never thought it could do water reflections, specular bump-mapping, post-processing effects and rain ( never seen rain in the original Half-Life ).- Jumpscares, although being used a lot, come with a lot of variants so I don't get tired of them. You'll never know what is waiting at the next corner.- Sound and music design are quite good. There are a few silent sections, which I believe the developers did it on purpose. Like Akira Yamaoka said: ""Silence is also a sound.""- Tons of extra unlockables and custom campaigns after beating the main game, and even the single player alone is more than enough for a free game ( +/- 8 hours ).Cons:- The limited inventory system can sometimes get a bit hilarious. For example, a key and a spade takes up the same amount of storage ( 1 slot ).- Sawrunner spots are quite predictable thanks to these save points. ( could fix this by implementing an auto-save system which saves game in the background without noticing the player about it ).- Frustrating backtrack sections.- Puzzles are irrelevant to the story being told. The same to item placements ( who the hell put ammo in the bus anyway? )- Obstacles seem obvious to bypass, can't be bypassed.Overall, this is a great Silent Hill/Penumbra hybrid and any horror fan must have it. And it's free. "

												This is a serious review so there isn't anything witty or funny I have played this game all the way and I can say that this is a top teir horror/single-player game.The first reason why i love this game is because it's the perfect amount of horror and suspense that makes this game one of my favorites. Like most of the horror games in 2015, they mainly focus on jumpscares and nothing else. This game, however, helps create a suspensefull story that you'll want to never end. Though this game has jumpscares in it, the game doesn't use it an excessive amount to here you don't want to play the game anymore.The other reason why i love this game is because of the story (NO SPOILERS). What happened? Why are there monsters everywhere that want to kill me? Who is this doctor guy? Why was I hit by a car and who was it that hit me? All these questions but no answers. This story makes you want to stay at your computer all day and play this game (like we always do with our games anyway). As well, the story keeps unraveling more and more as you play the game and at the end you finally get to see what the hell is going on.Though the game does have some glitches and bugs, most of them can be fixed through a couple of patches thanks to the developer.AND THE GAME IS FREE!!! A game with half the story as this is worth $60 but this game is absolutely free to play which is amazing.I hope this helped :)			"

												There are no words to discribe this game, its amazing! you have to remember this was a HALF LIFE MOD! this is amazing to be a half life mod! so, heres the pros and the cons.PROS:awesome gameplay.INCREDIBLE STORY!Lots of unlockables which provide (sometimes) alot more content, heres a taste of what you can unlock in the game: costumes, doctor mode, extra weapons, and many more!lots of endings, (hint: Play CO OP with a friend)voice acting!custom campains to play.CONS:theres no more public CO OP games ;_;thats it.but, heres my first time playing:loads up game.starts campain.plays through untill the first jumpscare.needs new pants.wakes up in an ally.thinks the voice acting is good.follows something into the subway. kills it.finds rusty used dirty needle.picks it up.equips it.uses the needle.probably gets 10 different illnesses.contines.game crashes.100/10 would go into a door and crash again.but really this game is really good!

												Game feels a lot like Silent Hill, but in first person with some platform and action. Has good atmosphere, the sotry interested me, and feels like a pro game. The dual wielding sistem works like acharm and the graphics aren't the worst. Has a complementary storyline as co-op. Plus its free.But the unlockables feel somewhat impossible to achieve, if not by playing over and over again.  I'd rade 8/10.			"

												Cry of Fear is possibly the best free indie horror game I've ever played and it still holds up almost half a decade from it's initial release. The game is set in central Sweden, which makes for some very beautiful, yet dark and gritty scenery. The ammount of diffrent enemies in this game is crazy and their designs will be sure to give you plenty of nightmares. For those who didn't know, Cry of Fear was originally a mod for the original Half-Life, but then it became it's own standalone game here on Steam. To see what the developers have done with such an old game engine is absolutely astonishing. Those who don't like this game usually critique it for it's clunky combat, excessive backtracking, and overdone jumpscares. What most people are forgetting is that this game is absolutely free and it's way better than most of the Untiy garbage we have here on Steam today.			"

												This may be the longest review ill be writing, even then it may still be short.From what i gather this is made in the source engine like the ohter halflife mod games, One of the biggest things ive noticed sinced ive played other games like that is: you dont need to own Half life 1 or two all the textures in this game work phenomily well, I remember playing no more room in hell and because i was missing textures they would appear in purple with this game there is none of that.Pros-Free to play means that there is micro transactions to it this is a absoluelty  free game-For a Free game the atmosphere is honestly amazing it spooks me, not like jump scare once and a while but a actually feeling of horror around every bend going into every door, the music is fantastic and so are the ambient horror noises that happen through the game-From what ive seen in what ive played the enemy design is so well done, very silent hill style but a bit more...disturbing-Being only two hours in it seems to have a pretty nice story line but i havent seen the full scope of the things to come and i may update it once i complete itCons-My biggest problem is the controls, there is some obsticles that once you get to it you have to play with the control and jump just to get through, but i can see that easily being fixed no problem, they may have just over done it with the box collider size-This is just a personal thing, i would have loved to have seen a limited ammount of saves thing just like RE had back in the day, I really loved that concept then and would have worked well in my opinion in this game to-Besides these two minor things this game is amazingOther thoughtsin this game im always at the edge of my seat with my heart pumping, Having been a huge fan of every RE game for the past almost 2 decades and silent hill, NONE of the there newer stuff has made me feel the way this game makes me feel, besides that i cant think of the last game that actually did make me feel me being scared all the way while playing it, these dev team clearly hit the nail on the head with a sledge hammer on this game and the fact its free its honestly unbelievable. I recommend this game to honestly anyone who loves these style of games as it is exremily unique and very well done.10/10 for meTl;Dr If you dont own this game download it, its free and phenomenal.

												Cry of fear is both a exciting and terrifying experience! I only saw the menus but BOY was I on the edge of my seat the entire time! Was it going to work?! Was it going to crash on me again?! WHO KNOWS! Man thats exciting! But you want to know what the most terrifying part of the whole thing was? When you tried to join a co-op game... It's almost to frightning to talk about... when you tried to load up a co-op game and the game froze for just a second. I swear your entire life flashed before your eyes wondering if its going to crash or work! but I will say this! The game has great replayablility, When the game crashes, you gotta re-load it and experience it all over again! Its a diffrent out come everytime!All in all I gotta be fair with this game! 9/10 would recommend!			"

												Cry Of Fear does one thing and it does it extremly well. It builds tension. The best part is that it dose this in a way no other horror genre game has done to date. Most atmospheric horor games build tension by letting your brain do a lot of the work. They place you in uneasy environments and don't rely on jump scares. Games like Silent Hill and Amnesia immediately spring to mind.Cry of Fear is too good for that old way. They took the novel approach of building tension by making it phycologicly draining to even play the game. It took 50 minutes of menu clicking and server setting up to even start to think about launching the actual game. All the while your brain is churning and building that tension ""will this game be worth the pain?"" ""What horrors could this agonizing process result in?""The answer is that you will not be able to set up a server and the game will crash. The scary bit was you just wasted an hour of your life... NOTHING is free			"

												I highly recommend this game for anyone who likes first-person shooter games, freaky creature attacks, playing with friends, being creeped out of your socks, and a single-player storyline campaign.I have 30 hours of game time so far, and I will most definately continue to play this game! I absolutely love the co-op mode. I've recorded multiple videos of me and my friends playing together going through waves of monsters with just tree branches and each other. The gameplay can be VERY challenging, such as when you run out of ammo in all of your guns and you get assulted by a chainsaw-slinging maniac! But it is also interesting, for example- the terrain switches up throughout gameplay from a village, to a sewer, to a maze/house, to a lake. It gets pretty insane!The graphics are smooth and detailed. So it can work well enough on an average computer, and if your computer is a little above average, it looks fantastic for a free game. I haven't tried out the single-player campaign so far, but I'm expecting no less than I'm getting from co-op mode. Definately worth 5 GB of memory : )EDIT: I've played a bit of the campaign now, and... It's an entirely different experience that the co-op! My nerves are constantly on edge as I walk around each street curb, and get ambushed by bloody creatures. Worth it!P.S.- Please click on the link below and check out my YouTube channel.

												If you can get past the dodgy voice acting, outdated graphics, silly Swedish accents, occasional (unintentionally) funny moments, and sometimes annoying gameplay, Cry of Fear does have quite a bit to offer, especially compared to its competitors in the free-to=play horror category.Being both a sufferer of depression and psychosis, as well as a long-term addict fan of horror games, it was somewhat of a comfort to see a title that revolved around such issues, as opposed to purely around an external conflict. (Instead of simply being at odds with monsters, you're also at odds with yourself.) That said, the story is fairly unique in that way, and is probably what kept me interested in playing the game despite its many shortcomings.Above all however, I have to praise this game for its skillfully-crafted depressive atmosphere and subtle ways in which it makes Simon's (the protagonist) character relatable. The most memorable examples of this were seeing self-harm scars on his arms whenever he rolled up his sleeve to expend a syringe, or being visually bombarded with posters and flyers for depression treatment regimens. It was that sort of thing that made me instantly identify with him, and it was charming in a way I haven't seen many other games pull off.			"

												Cry of Fear was an audacious Half-Life 1 mod that turned into a full fledged game for release on Steam about a year after the release. In short, this game is great. This game contains a gripping story of a young man named Simon who is lost in himself and struggling to survive when monsters appear. Cry of Fear contains a single player campaign that claims to take about eight hours time, but for my first playthrough I was about 12-16 hours of gametime. The gameplay is like most survival horror games, but you are limited, you don't have a briefcase like Resident Evil 4. you do have a backpack and your pockets but you cannot carry everything, forcing you to make sacrifices on what you want to carry and what you NEED to carry, this aspect helps produce more tension when trying to figure out, should I keep this gun even though I have one clip? Or take the melee weapon and key and continue on? The controls work well, and it's not clunky or difficult, except one section of the game which required platforming and was my sole problem with the game.Cry of Fear's atmosphere is great, the dark corridors, the creepy forests to a tight packed school, the environments are varied and have a great way of getting you in the mood and into the game. Another aspect of the atmosphere in sound, Cry of Fear has not only a wonderful soundtrack with scary, dark tracks to beautiful melodies, but the sound in the game. Whether they are foot steps around the corner edging closer or bumping on the walls or a scream in the distance, Cry of Fear definitely full fills the scare factor.On the topic of features, Cry of Fear has a good lengthed single player campaign, not like a Slender game that takes about 20-40 minutes, this game takes hours. There is also another secret campaign after beating the first, then a completely separate co-op campaign, and multiple custom campaigns along with a custom campaign and map creator that is intuitive and easy to use. Not to mention Cry of Fear's ""Suicide Mode"" which is basically survival, you kill enemies to decrease the amount of time on the clock to reach zero and survive, it's difficult, but fun and you can do it with friends.All in all, Cry of Fear is an amazing package, you get so much content and a wondrous game that was made very well for such a small team, Team Psykskallar did a great job, and did I mention this game is absolutely free on Steam? Go play and have fun! 9/10			"

												Cry of fear has a lot of problems, primarily in the design department. You have a bunch of great assets, and some improvements to the engine to make a creepy game, but in the end it's just a bunch of hallways, locked doors, and no direction. Most of the time will be spent getting frustrated by the maze of hallways that all look the same, and it will kill your motivation to continue. I think this game could have been something far better than it was if the developers had just spent more time getting it properly tested and polished. There is a lot of potential here, but it was sadly wasted.			"

												It is an awesome game,sometimes it can be a little bit buggy,like abusing from doors you can not reach or flawed hit detection with a special kind of enemies,but all in all,it is scary enough,psychological horror and some jumpscares now and then,it manages to build up the tension when you are trying to flee,and it does make you think about rationing your items,the graphics are like an old survival horror game,as if you where playing a first person Silent Hill,and when it comes to puzzles.....well....challenging is the word.I recommend this one,even if you play it for an hour or so,you will probably get some scares right from the beginning! xD			"

			Views: 310		

			This game is available here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/223710 A non-biased quick look @ 'Cry of Fear' - Cry of Fear originally started out as a Half-Life 1 modification, set in the same vein...		

This is how you make a really good half life horror mod.Cry of Fear originally started out as a Half-Life 1 modification, set in the same vein as the classic survival horror games of old. 4 years in the making and picking up several modding awards on the way, it is now a free, standalone game for anyone to enjoy. Beware though, it's not for the faint of heart. Cry of Fear is a psychological single-player and co-op horror game set in a deserted town filled with horrific creatures and nightmarish delusions. You play as a young man desperately searching for answers in the cold Scandinavian night, finding his way through the city as he slowly descends into madness. With a strong emphasis on cinematic experience, immersion and lateral thinking, players will be taken on a nightmare rollercoaster-ride through the grim streets of Fäversholm and beyond.

												The second mod of the swedish developer Andreas Rönnberg for Half-Life 1 (published in 1998) is definitely the largest and most impressive mod that I've ever played. Despite rather outdated graphics and animations - based on the Gold Source engine - the game succeeded to fascinate me by presenting survival horror with unreal-appearing elements in a way that you often question yourself whether the happening is real, a dream or even something else. In addition to the main story there are also several campaigns that have been created by outside developers, of which the game by default already contains some. A co-op mode with its own campaign and a survival mode ensure fun with up to four players! Because the mod can be downloaded for free on Steam and even Half-Life 1 is no longer needed to play it, I can only recommend to check this fantastic mod out!┴┬ German Translation ┬┴Die zweite Mod des schwedischen Entwicklers Andreas Rönnberg für das 1998 erschienene Spiel Half-Life 1 ist definitiv die größte und beeindruckenste Mod, die ich jemals gespielt habe. Trotz eher veralteter Grafiken und Animationen - basierend auf der Gold-Source-Engine - gelang es dem Spiel mich in den Bann zu ziehen, indem es Survival-Horror mit irreal-erscheinenden Elementen so präsentiert, dass man sich selbst desöfteren die Frage stellt, ob das Geschehen die Realität, ein Traum oder sogar etwas anderes ist. Neben der Haupthandlung sind zudem mehrere Kampagnen von außenstehenden Entwicklern kreiert worden, von denen das Spiel standardmäßig bereits einige beinhaltet. Ein Co-op-Modus mit eigener Kampagne und ein Survival-Modus sorgen für Spielspaß mit bis zu vier Spielern! Da die Mod kostenlos bei Steam heruntergeladen werden kann und selbst Half-Life 1 nicht mehr benötigt wird, kann ich nur empfehlen diese fantastische Mod selbst anzutesten!			"

												This looks like it would be a great game, if I could play it.  It loads up fine, but once I get past the opening vid. and try to use the inventory it gets stuk.  I can't exit the inventory.  I've restarted the game over and over, trying to get past this.  I've even tried not to use the inventory until a little later in the game.  Went back to look at the notes section, after collecting some clues, and got stuck again.  I really want to play this game...  I will write another review, if this is ever fixed, and will be glad to thumbs up then.			"

												A mod-gone-indie Horror game. Absolutely free, and absolutely terrifying.Single Player isn't that bad; The combat is awkward and a lot of the scares are ""cheap shots"" that rely on jump scares but ultimately, it gets the job done. Storywise, well... look elsewhere.Coop is a bit shallow; Isn't very long and loses a bit of the scare factor once you realise that everyone around you is there to help, somewhat dimnishing the horror effect, and the awkward combat makes coop more of a hilarity than a frightfest.All in all, a pretty good scare for a whopping $0.00. Try it out if you're curious, what do you have to lose?			"

												You play as a depressed, self-harming boy named Simon, who goes through a variety of locations where both his physical stamina and mental stability are put to the test as he tries to return home. As you progress through the game, you begin to realize how the sheer insanity of the enemies actually reflect on Simon's very thoughts and emotions.You have to go through this game assuming that something is going to pop out at you from where you are trying to go, or break down the door that you're directly in front of. This means that to progress, you will either need quick reflexes from the start, or you will have to employ trial and error very frequently.There are a few issues in this game, one being that if you open a note that you stored, or even sometimes when you are reading the map in the park, the game will get stuck on it, and you will be forced to reload the most recent game save to escape the screen. Additionally, the collision experienced here is almost game-breaking; there were several instances where it took 20+ minutes in one location because of awkward placement of objects and/or enemies. The absolute darkness and apparently broken gamma/brightness adjustment controls also had me navigating through moving along walls for most of the game, especially underwater.I recommend playing this game on ""Easy"" difficulty on your first playthrough if you don't want to get incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off, as I played it on ""Normal"" and I'm genuinely surprised that I beat this game. There are little provisions for ammo and health, but when there are, they will either easily be overlooked because of their placement in seemingly insignificant locations, or they will be placed in plain sight, but only because you are about to REALLY need them.The horror of the game itself was initially frightening, but only because it was unfamiliar. The jump-scares of the game quickly changed from shocking to annoying, as the same scares repeated themselves over and over and over again. The appearance of the enemies along with the general atmosphere of the game was more creepy than it was scary, but it did have a nice effect on the tensions in the game.Why do I recommend this game?: Only because the storyline and the existence of the enemies have a very intriguing and surprising correlation, which you slowly find out as you progress through the game. Cry of Fear is full of jump-scares, but it is also full of cheap, unfair, and broken mechanics that make higher difficulties mind-numbingly frustrating.Playability: 3/10Story Quality: 8/10Difficulty: 10/10Intensity of Horror: 5/10			"

												A non-biased quick look @ the game:


YouTube™ Video: ➜ A Quick Look @ 'Cry of Fear' (Win 10, GeForce GT 640) 

			Views: 310		

			This game is available here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/223710 A non-biased quick look @ 'Cry of Fear' - Cry of Fear originally started out as a Half-Life 1 modification, set in the same vein...		

This is how you make a really good half life horror mod.Cry of Fear originally started out as a Half-Life 1 modification, set in the same vein as the classic survival horror games of old. 4 years in the making and picking up several modding awards on the way, it is now a free, standalone game for anyone to enjoy. Beware though, it's not for the faint of heart. Cry of Fear is a psychological single-player and co-op horror game set in a deserted town filled with horrific creatures and nightmarish delusions. You play as a young man desperately searching for answers in the cold Scandinavian night, finding his way through the city as he slowly descends into madness. With a strong emphasis on cinematic experience, immersion and lateral thinking, players will be taken on a nightmare rollercoaster-ride through the grim streets of Fäversholm and beyond.

Graphics are not great but its a horror so its part of it. Its free so I cant argue anything about any obstacles or whatever you want me to tell. Some logick involved in some parts but other than that its fps where you need to scravenge for ammo. "

												I played this one in its pre-Steam days, and must say I was MOSTLY very, very impressed.  MOSTLY.  Now lemme tell you why (prepare for the obligatory rant)...   SAVE AND CHECKPOINTING SYSTEMS.  Yeah, I'm gonna go on about those...AGAIN.  But I really do live in a world full of hope...the hope that one day, game designers (both ""amateur"" and ""professional"") might realise that NOT ALL PEOPLE WHO ENJOY GAMES SPEND THEIR ENTIRE LIVES PLAYING THEM.  We semi-committed gamers, for instance, certainly seek a CHALLENGE when we play games...but we don't enjoy it when a game chooses to be so stubbornly, pig-headedly ""hard"" that we feel like THROWING OUR LAPTOPS OUT THE ♥♥♥♥ING WINDOW.  If you're going to put in insanely tricky bits of jumping, rendered three times harder still by surreal, otherworldly physics which don't quite translate when the graphics are a tad on the ""low-res"" side, please...PLEASE...put one or two checkpoints along the way so we don't have to do those first five finicky jumps EIGHTY-SEVEN ♥♥♥♥ING TIMES before we master that one jump that we can't quite get our stupid heads around.  And that oh-so-clever bit of uber-jumping up the crashed train car before it drops off the cliff?  Don't make me do that first combination of walk-forward/jump-up/turn-left/crouch-jump/two-steps-forward/turn-right/jump-WITHOUT-crouch-or-you'll-hit-your-head-and-fall-back-down/forward-one-step-and-one-step-only/etc etc etc OVER AND OVER AGAIN, without a single save or checkpoint along the way...please?!?  Though I really did love that final touch where I finally, after Lord-knows how many attempts, made it to the top, and what happens?  I turned the WRONG WAY (it was a fifty-fifty chance) once safely out of the train car, and somehow still managed to go plummeting to my death for the NINETY-SIXTH TIME!!!   This♥♥♥♥♥♥is not fun, kids.  It's just anger-inducing.  And plain-old INSULTING to people who've already invested a number of hours into your otherwise rather excellent and refreshingly JUMPING-FREE game.  Two more things on this subject:  One, all games need to have a ""natural""-seeming learning curve, where if you're going to do something like a pedantically-difficult jumping bit, it needs to be PRECEDED by similar-though-not-quite-as-hard bits which prepare the player for what is to come.  That's just sound GAME DESIGN.  Secondly...pedantically-difficult jumping bits really don't even WORK in a FIRST-PERSON GAME.  The first-person view just isn't suited to it.  If you wanna make a platform game, please make it in THIRD-person.  But enough of the incensed ranting, and on with the good stuff...   Cry Of Fear is one of the scariest games you will ever play, and one of the best first-person games you will probably ever play, period.  It's chock-full of great ideas.  A few silly ones, granted, and a♥♥♥♥♥♥tonne of rather derivative ones...but if you've ever wanted to know what the early Silent Hill games would have been like in single-person, you couldn't do much better than this.  SO many well-calculated scares, a likeable and intriguing if not entirely ""logical"" plot, suitably loony voice-acting and...well, just so much for a dyed-in-the-wool horror fan to love.  Which is maybe not surprising, considering what a labour of love this game/mod clearly was.  Just a wee bit of game-testing OUTSIDE of the hardcore, played-it-all-before, this-is-my-four-hundred-and-twenty-fifth-first-person-shooter-and-I-can-play-Half-Life-1-through-in-under-two-hours-with-one-hand-tied-behind-my-back crowd...and we could'a had a very nearly PERFECT game experience here.    I so very nearly love it, but I don't know when I'll muster up the courage to play it again...NOT because of how♥♥♥♥♥♥your-pants-scary it so often is, but because I really, really, REALLY don't want to ever have to do those two aforementioned ♥♥♥♥♥♥ jumping bits EVER AGAIN.  IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.  But I probably will...which is testament, surely, to how good the REST of the game truly is (okay, there's a few other crappy bits too, but those two truly take the cake).  Can't wait 'til these guys make a ""real"" (read: commercially-produced) game, with someone else's money, and all the quality control which (regrettably) only seems to come with that level of corporate overlording.  GETTING PEWDIEPIE TO GAME-TEST YOUR PRODUCT IS NOT THE WAY TO CREATE A WIDELY-ACCESSIBLE, UNIVERSALLY-PLAYABLE PRODUCT!!!  Find some people with full-time jobs, and see if THEY can get through your bloody game!!!!!!PS  I haven't yet played this one on Steam, so if the above ranting about lack of save/checkpoints is now null and void, I profusely apologise.  Having said that, I haven't seen any pigs flying outside my window tonight, so I'm kinda doubting such a miracle has taken place.  But again...WORLD FULL OF HOPE.  And really nasty, ♥♥♥♥ed-in-the-head horror games.  That's the world I wanna live in.Verdict: 9/10.			"

												Cry of Fear is a Psychological First Person Shooter Survival Horror taking place in Stockholm (Fäversholm ingame), Sweden.Cry of Fear is my 2nd favorite game of all time. It only gets beaten by S.T.A.L.K.E.R. I love Cry of Fear so much because of the atmosphere, the sick and twisted horror or it might be because, and I can assure you that, it is the best survival horror I ever played. The atmosphere is one of the best ever accomplished in a video game. It´s depressing, oppressing, evil and also obscure and something very unique. It made me paranoid for a while. The story is simple but good. Simon, depressed, full of emotional problems is getting in an car accident, which changes everything. He is also having problems of confessing his feelings for his crush. If you could throw ♥♥♥♥ at someone, everyone would throw it at Simon. Result: suicidal and homicidal thoughts. He gets in treatment, but the therapy backfires terribly and makes the unstable mind of Simon Erikkson a ticking timebomb. As you can see a topic not everyone likes, that´s why not everyone really liked playing this game. You really have to try it out and give it a chance. It´s based on the GoldSrc engine on which also Half Life 1 was running on. Team Psykskallar really made the best out of this old engine and you can clearly see it. Graphics are decent. Whats left? Ah, horror and gameplay. You have a big variety of levels, from the typical subway station to the mental hospital and forest but also parks and sewers, subway maintenace bays, construction sites and apartements, a school, a very nice boat scene and more!You have an inventory system like resident evil. You have to carefully pick and manage your equipment. It´s kept more simple though. Weapon models are excellent, as are the animations and the sound design overall. Close Combat is clunky at the beginning but gets better and very smooth and satisfying after some time. Usually after the apartements, as soon as you get your first gun, that should be after 40 mins. You have to create your own technique of slash and dodge to succesfully kill your opponent. Dodging is purely accomplished by excerising it. Ammo for guns can be scarce on normal and hard, not on easy. You need then to switch to your Close Combat wepons such as knives, batong, fists, etc.There are different endings and choices to be made, if I remember correctly, you have two choices which give you 4 main story endings. 1 co-op ending, 1 secret and 1 manhunt campaign ending.The game is about 10 hrs for beginners and 8 for faster people and can be beaten in 2,5 hrs by pros.Now to the horror. If you played Amnesia or Slender and you felt it was a walk in the park, then this game is nothing for you. It´s between Amnesia and Resident Evil with a touch Silent Hill. It has some cheap jumpscares, but only about 15% are cheap ones, the rest are unpredictable and just plain evil and scary as hell and you always have a feeling of being followed. The paranoia I mentioned, usually comes up in the silent parts. The soundtrack is one of the best in video games history, fitting perfectly to the game, making it effective to build tension and weird feelings at the right moments. If you are a very emotional person, you will love it. If you are a cold brick, better go back and play your casual games. Some puzzles can be frustrating and many parts can be hard to accomplish or are just tearing apart your brain (maze). First time playing it, is hard, but after you solved them, it´s really satisfying and rewarding. The overall feeling after finishing the game is fantastic. It makes you feel accomplishment, something very rare these days. And don´t call Simon an Emo or I come and eat your eyeballs.For me it´s a 10/10. A fair unbiased rating would be a 7/10. It has it´s problems but how I like to say: Somebody who can´t be patient and endure a few grinding moments, also can´t enjoy the joy of accomplishment and nostalgia.			"

												I don't even know where to start with this. The idea was very cool, playing a police officer in a horror game is an awesome idea! This just was not done right at all. I felt as if the story was very boring, and sometimes, not even ""scary."" I played the cooperative mode with a friend of mine, and if you die, you lose ALL items. Yup, if you die then have fun trying to kill dual-wielding chainsaw peep with um... a stick.The game could have been better, I understand it's on the old Source engine, but that's no excuse for such a poor executed development. On the bright side, it's free to play! Anyways, game does not live up to the standards of Silent Hill, or even Layers of Fear. I would rate this game, probably below average, a big 3/10.			"

												Not sure how the heck this game has 84% positive reviews its a total waste of memory space. In the short moments I attempted to play it I discovered this: its unplayable.First of all on intial launch of the game through steam your presented with this very small window with a few options to click on. From this small screen you have to then click another button that says ""Launch"" to actually start the game. While this isnt a big deal its kind of an annoying setup.Second the game crashes allot and doesn't save settings. I had my game crash 3-4 times just trying to join the server my boyfriend had set up for us to test out this game. As far as the settings issue goes I nearly got my ears blasted out from the volume of this game. So naturally I yank off my headset and go to look for the volume settings. Turned the volume way down and clicked apply assuming that it had worked. Closed out of the options menu and went to look for the join server button again. Of course my game crashes again so I re-launched it and once again almost got my ears blasted out because of the 2 part launch setup. Once I actually got into the game I realized it hadn't saved my volume settings. I went to change them again and after exiting the settings menu now the main menu structure is all screwed up.This brings me to my third issue with this game the menu structure. When the game is first launched the main menu looks like any other typical menu you'd see in a co-op style game. However once you actually click on anything the menu changes and it is very difficult to get back to the original menu as there seems to be no obvious ""back"" or ""previous"" button anywhere on screen. That for me was strike number three and after having all these issues when the game crashed for a fourth time I gave up and uninstalled the game.If you really wanna play a game like this thats free and based off of half-life try sven co-op. Its not as creepy but at least its freaking playable.			"

												Cry of Fear is one of the most ambitious mods I’ve ever played. Four years in the making with a small team of three Half Life fans, and I couldn’t be happier with the result.Essentially it’s a narrative horror game complete with jump scares, survival elements, and just genuinely terrifying horror that keeps you on the edge of your seat. What surprised me the most about Cry of Fear is the fact that it’s been built using the GoldSource engine, which to say the least, is ancient. The developers have worked so hard to create all their own custom content and enhance the engine in so many ways. Soft shadows, particle effects, the game looks really good compared to older generation games that used it. Gameplay elements such as animated ladder climbing, sprinting, true ADS and a bunch of other cool features, have given the engine a more modern feel. They’ve even added cutscenes that lend well to the story.In addition to the main story and unlocks, there’s also several custom campaigns that have been included with the standalone release. Some of these were made by the developers, but most are made by other modders who share the same passion for Cry of Fear. I’ve only played a couple so far, but they’re really fun and give people something to do after finishing the main campaign. There’s also a 4 player co-op feature, but it isn’t up and running yet so I’ll hold off on saying anything good or bad about it.Despite the old engine, the game is still very very scary. Before the mod was released last year, I didn’t think that something made using the GoldSource engine could even remotely scare me. Well Cry of Fear proved me wrong. The sound effects, pacing of the game, and even the subtle jump scares all create this sense of dread as you move through the mostly dark levels. Plus the enemy models creep me out! I love the soundtrack which has been mostly composed by the mod team leader. The songs really add to the tension of the game and I really get into it while I’m playing :P Now for some of the not so good things. The menu seems quite glitchy at times and I don’t like the voice actors at all. In particular, the main character *sigh*. He just doesn’t speak enough English to properly convey the emotional journey of the character and his descent into madness. I found it a hard time believing anything he said. I certainly couldn’t take him seriously (especially when he swore). But these are small concerns for an otherwise amazing horror game.  Now that this standalone version has been released, a lot more people can finally enjoy this horror adventure and I’m very happy with the end result.  "

												Get a friend and get ready for some cheap spooks!No, but really, this game is broken, glitchy, weird, with bad graphics and somewhat badly recorded sounds.If this game would have been somewhat good, like texture based or audio based, with better jumpscares and better coop support so you don't have to reconnect after every second loading....Honestly, I would have not played it.This game has something. Something that I cannot explain. You can call it a charm or something. I really enjoyed the campaign (I am a liar, I quit right at the start because They told me there would be a jumpscare), but the coop.... Maaan the coop.Where should I start? The coop is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ It keeps disconnecting the one that is not hosting the game after every first/second loading, you cannot save, but only start from the chapters start, so you better not ragequit, it isn't much long, only 5 chapters and so on. I could talk days about the problems of this game, but I won't. I swear that I have never, ever in my life had so much......fun. Let me tell you how it all started.-Okay, we're in the game, two cops on a mission huh? Nice.-Meanwile my friend already has no ammo because he tried to shoot the door open.- Something runs at him screaming, he is yelling to my headphones like crazy (Meanwhile I am trying to reconnect because there was a loading)-Misses all his remaining bullets and kills it with his last few shots.-Meanwhile I connect, start shooting like a mad man to kill the second ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ coming at us.-We've got both of them.-Friend is almost dead, we continue down the street.-Inhuman scream-AN UPSIDE DOWN BED THAT HAS SOMEONE ATTACHED TO IT AND IS.....FLYING?! (10/10 has flying beds - IGN)-We both burst out laughing.-I find some ammo and a syringe-Try to give the syringe to friend, accidentally inject it myself. (10/10 would get high accidentally again - Me)-Somehow manage to get through it both alive (I died cuz a BIG ♥♥♥♥ING TREE punched me and I flew like 500000 metres [Not lying] across the whole ♥♥♥♥ing map and then he♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me vigourously, friend picked me up after)-Get to a house.-Search it whole.-Oh a stairwell.-What could possibly go wrong on a stairwell?-GUESS WHAT, EVERYTHING!-Friend tries to run up the stairs and the stairs broke down as he falls through them.-SO MANY INHUMAN SCREAMS (One of them my from my friend just because he got scared so hard)-Jump down after him so I can save him like a mother♥♥♥♥ing hero from his misery.-Survives just barely....Yeah, that's just how our first session went because I went to bed after that.Day 2-Skipped the first chapter and went straight to the second just because we did not want to went through it again.-Friend spawns in a apartment hall, I am still loading.-Stars screaming as something is running right at him and then explodes.-*I connect*-Help him defeat all these inhuman enemies.-He finds a shotgun and I find something like a bolt action rifle from ww2-Go up the stairs.-WTF IS THAT (screams my friends)-WTF IS WHAT (I scream)- Then I turn around and see a ♥♥♥♥ing SOMETHING running at us, but it doesn't have arms, IT JUST HAS TWO ♥♥♥♥ING CHAINSAWS.-Die like 15 times, almost at our peak of ragequitting, then finally kill him.-Nice, start searching the apartment.-Friend starts screaming like a girl again.-Ask him WTF Happened.-He described that he saw a m4a4 like weapon in a bathroom and when he ran up to it, that the floor broke and he fell down.-Cannot find him, tell him that I am scared.-Finally find ourselves.-Move on.-A ♥♥♥♥ing forrest?-Nah, I am good.That's just how our second session went. We had two more, but I dont want to write anymore.Okay, so overall, best game ever.No seriously, In the term of best COOP horror game, I would say that this one is the best.10 out of ♥♥♥♥ing 10 , would love to hear my friend and myself scream like a little girl again.

												One thing that saddens me is the fact that most people who write the negative reviews either dont give the game a chance (playing for 0.3 hours and writing a negative review) or the just try and play the buggy co-op mode (not what you should try and play first when you get this). Anyway, just had to get that off my chest, now for the pros and cons!pros-Interesting storyline that slowly reveals itself-Lots of unlockables, challenges, custom campains,and multiple endings for replayibilty-Game doesn't make you feel like its a mod, more feels like it's its own game-Very realistic gunplay, like reloading too soon will waste bullets-A good variety of interesting, and/or scary monsters whith different ones getting intruduced as the game progress, keeping you on your feet.-Truly good jumpscares/scares, the game has a tendency to get you nice and comfortable and then BAM in your facecons-Kinda wierd learning curve, like some tutorials seem inconplete-Ammo saving melee can be very hard to do, and takes awhile to figure out the proper technique-Co-op campain seems a bit buggy, like randomly getting disconnected or being able to keep stun-locking enimies-Dated graphics, although kinda phenominal for using the old half life engie and still looking decent, pales in comparison to the graphics of other horror games misc-very hardcore kinda gameplay, this can be a bad thing for some people and a good thing for other people, so I didn't want to put this in pros or consSo if you like horror games, give this a try, afterall it is free. Just make sure to give the game a fair chance, once you understand how the mechanics work you'll love it.			"

												Reasons why this is one of the best indie horror games I've ever played:1.This is a Half Life 1 mod, but you can clearly tell that new elements had been carefully coded in, by a group of 6 people.2.This is not the typical Slender clone you'll usually see, it has a great plot and doesn't rely on thosands of jumpscares.3.This game is amazing at getting reactions out of you. Sometimes it had me in disbelief, other times it had me scared out of my mind.If you want an exceptional horror game with simple controls and a stellar storyline, but don't have a lot of cash, then I strongly reccommend giving Cry of Fear a try. That is, if you dare.			"

												This thing, i think is one of the best horror games i have played ever, the history is great, the horror itself in the game is not only jumpscares, wich is great, considering over 80% of the games nowadays, and it includes a co-op play, that is great either, the only problem there is, are the menus, dunno if this steam version has a fix for them, but they are not a great problem.

												Cry of Fear is simply one of the best games I have ever played. I'll jump right into it.Gameplay:CoF (I'll refer to Cry of Fear as CoF from now on) has some of the most challenging and enjoyable gameplay that I've ever played. The game operates as an FPS, with a non-recharging health system, and a (very) slowly recharging stamina bar. It follows the SH2 method of saving which is scattered save points around the world, in the form of tape recorders. You also have an inventory system with limited space, with which you can carry around key items, weapons, and health. This forces the player to make critical decisions about what they leave and what they take. Do you drop your pistol, weak but with lots of ammo, or your shotgun, strong with only a few shots left? The player must also make use of a cell phone for their source of light, but the game allows you to hold your phone in one hand and the gun in the other, at the expense of reduced stability/accuracy. Most of the actual game follows a pattern reminiscent of HL and SH2. The long-term goal is to get back to your house, however, you get sidetracked by cryptic messages to your phone, blockages in the streets, and of course, monsters, among other things. Like HL, there will be a lot of backtracking, to the point where it can become frustrating. Sometimes the solution to your current puzzle won't be obvious, and you might have to go through some confusion before it becomes clear (possibly with the help of a walkthrough). Unlike HL or SH2, the game features an objective-based system, giving you a clear (but sometimes confusing) goal to work towards. There are puzzles and combat interwoven well throughout the entire game. The combat can be frantic, and until you get the rhythm of each enemy down, can be frustrating. The monsters you face will be, above all, difficult. They are fast, unexpected, loud and disturbing. Several times I found myself jumping even when I knew that there was a monster. They move in a way that is totally alien, creating a very strange and creepy atmosphere. Story:You're Simon, a 19 year old boy who awakens in an alley after being hit with a car. It appears that there's something wrong with this city. Who are these monsters who are attacking you? Why is everyone gone? Of course, I can't give anything away, but there are quite a few plot points that I didn't notice first time around, and quite a few spoilers. The story for me ranks up there with that of SH2. This game is scary and disturbing. The characters Simon encounters are provocative and make you question what's really happening inside the game. They are strong characters who, though you know little about them, have intruiging and different personalities, that make them feel like real human beings. They aren't over-the-top caricatures of people, but act in a human way, even if sometimes that means an incredibly ♥♥♥♥ed up human. Sound: The voice acting is pretty meh, to be honest. Throughout the game, it increases in quality. Specifically the latter half, it really starts to get good. The sound design otherwise is superb. I never felt safe at any section of the game. There's always a reason to be afraid to go through the door, to check corners, or behind you. I always felt on edge because of the uneasy and at times, disturbing soundtrack. The monsters themselves make really creepy noises, from unearthly howls to shallow breathing that seemed to get right in your ears. The sound does a good job of creating the atmosphere.Visuals: So graphics. This game isn't the prettiest game you'll ever see. It's not at an Amnesia level, but for a free game, it's pretty ♥♥♥♥ing nice. The textures aren't super grainy, the models are well done and fit in with the maps, and you can't beat the variety in environments. Presumably you're in Sweden, and you'll go through a variety of environments, including, but not limited to, sewers, apartments, streets, alleyways, offices, parks, rooftops, subarbs, a mental hospital, a lake house, and a forest. Each felt very different from the next, but flowed together very well. Animations are damn well done - 3d person cutscenes never felt awkward or out of place, and they look good for a (free) game built on an older engine. Overall:This is a terrifying game. This is a difficult game. This is a great game. I would urge everyone to give this game a try. Fans of other classics like SH will enjoy this. I was disturbed, and sufficiently spooked several times over. I would have paid 20 dollars for this. ♥♥♥♥, I probably would've payed like 30, or 40 dollars for this. This game is worth so much more than 0 dollars. Give it a try, just for an hour. Then give it another 8 hours. Then cry and♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself from the scares. 10/10 would be too scared to leave my room again			"

												You know it is a really good horror/fps when you can't get past the first 10 minutes without ******** your pants. I'm honestly too scared to continue going because the intro got me hard with that person walking around the corner. I walked slower than a snail in slow motion checking my corners. Just make sure ou have 3 diapers ready by your side, or you have a toilet beside so you can just quickly lean over. Either way, this game is my  3rd horror, coming up beside R Evil and Dead Space.

Not to mention the story, unlockables, multiple endings, and the pressure of limited supply management, this makes Cry of Fear my all-time favorite horror game. Would definitely recommend to people who are looking for a genuine horror experience rather than an action-packed zombie-killing spree.			"

												At first this game may appear to be a steaming pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ but upon further examination I found Cry of Fear to be a deeply nuanced and riveting experience.  I soon came to realize that this game represents the exploitation of the working class by the aristocratic bourgeoisie reptilian semites from Babylonian antiquity. The game mirrors the human endeavor to arise from the mundane and materialistic plane unto the divine and immortal sphere of the enlightened ones through multiple reincarnations. I came to understand the role of the modern emasculated man living in the Kali Yuga, to live as an ascetic warrior resisting the facade of the modern liberal monoculture. Thats why I showed Alexander Dugin this game and he said  it affected him profoundly. Whoever made this game should get a noble piece prize and I will personally blow him/her.			"

												i remember playing this game every tiem i play it with family and friends they get all depressed but when i play it by myself i get emotionally, and mentally traumentized and when i beat it my best friend had to have been put in a refinement center. lol NO I'm joking for teh lulz. It has some nice puzzles, the efforts placed into the creation of the game is capital, and you could learn more about the development of the game via it's website or by unlocking the director's commentary. For example, ruMpel went around his neighborhood to get ideas on map/level design. This game has at least 4 endings, but I will not be a spoilering ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and tell you about all of them. However I think ALL of the endings aresaddening, because just this once I will be an inglorious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, Simon the Main protagonist kills himself. If there are secret endings, I hope I can find them myself The combat system is nice, it forces YOU to choose what to use, IE: A baton, a shotgun, and finally a hunting rifle. That was just an example of one of the combat loadouts. Speaking of combat & gameplay, there is a multiplayer mode with it's own storyline where you and a team of polisen trying to find Simon. However, somehow, you share the same hellish relm with our crippled David Leatherhoff in a grey hoodie.I recommend this game to fans of the ""Silent Hill"" series, the ""Resident Evil"" series,""Left 4 Dead"" series, and finally to everyone that has played, beaten, and enjoyed the half-life mod, ""Afraid of Monsters"".

												How this game is free is beyond me. This game has many unlockables and easter eggs.Every boss and miniboss can be killed with a certain method.Not for the faint hearted has many jumpscares and other scary events.Though I am not a massive fan of many horror games this game incorporates many features seen in titles such as Jericho, silent hill, resident evil, and The darkness.A gem for being in the free section.Pros:Scary even with outdated graphics.Environment is carefully crafted watch for small details.Many weapons. Limited inventory space - con for meChallenging bosses and minibosses.Many monsters.Cosmetic unlockables.Even on easy its a challenge.Voice acting (not the best but still)Objects found enhance story.Scenes induce emotion and relate you to main character.Multiple endings based on your choices.Weapon style/stance options.Cons:Outdated graphics.Environment can kill you by both design or occasional bug.Limited space to me was a con.Have to conserve ammo.Dropped items sometimes disappear during inventory management.Some weapons are basically useless.Too many useless doors.Needs to automatically use keys if you have them.Ladders are often hazards.Despite my most constructive and agressive criticisms 10/10 a gem for many gamers.

												Absolutley beautiful, felt like it woke a part in me I never knew. I'll admit the controls and puzzles can get to a player, but in the end it's all worth it. The voice acting and how on parts where you think you're safe it turns to not be true, just amazing. Love how it made me feel a tidal wave of different emotions, many times crying out in fear (ha yes an obvious pun) or in frustration sometimes dread but, soundtrack is what really got me, in my opinion it's the soundtrack and emotional mood setting that makes a game good. So this horror game is fox apporved!			"

												Cry of Fear is simply one of the best games I have ever played. I'll jump right into it.Gameplay:CoF (I'll refer to Cry of Fear as CoF from now on) has some of the most challenging and enjoyable gameplay that I've ever played. The game operates as an FPS, with a non-recharging health system, and a (very) slowly recharging stamina bar. It follows the SH2 method of saving which is scattered save points around the world, in the form of tape recorders. You also have an inventory system with limited space, with which you can carry around key items, weapons, and health. This forces the player to make critical decisions about what they leave and what they take. Do you drop your pistol, weak but with lots of ammo, or your shotgun, strong with only a few shots left? The player must also make use of a cell phone for their source of light, but the game allows you to hold your phone in one hand and the gun in the other, at the expense of reduced stability/accuracy. Most of the actual game follows a pattern reminiscent of HL and SH2. The long-term goal is to get back to your house, however, you get sidetracked by cryptic messages to your phone, blockages in the streets, and of course, monsters, among other things. Like HL, there will be a lot of backtracking, to the point where it can become frustrating. Sometimes the solution to your current puzzle won't be obvious, and you might have to go through some confusion before it becomes clear (possibly with the help of a walkthrough). Unlike HL or SH2, the game features an objective-based system, giving you a clear (but sometimes confusing) goal to work towards. There are puzzles and combat interwoven well throughout the entire game. The combat can be frantic, and until you get the rhythm of each enemy down, can be frustrating. The monsters you face will be, above all, difficult. They are fast, unexpected, loud and disturbing. Several times I found myself jumping even when I knew that there was a monster. They move in a way that is totally alien, creating a very strange and creepy atmosphere. Story:You're Simon, a 19 year old boy who awakens in an alley after being hit with a car. It appears that there's something wrong with this city. Who are these monsters who are attacking you? Why is everyone gone? Of course, I can't give anything away, but there are quite a few plot points that I didn't notice first time around, and quite a few spoilers. The story for me ranks up there with that of SH2. This game is scary and disturbing. The characters Simon encounters are provocative and make you question what's really happening inside the game. They are strong characters who, though you know little about them, have intruiging and different personalities, that make them feel like real human beings. They aren't over-the-top caricatures of people, but act in a human way, even if sometimes that means an incredibly ♥♥♥♥ed up human. Sound: The voice acting is pretty meh, to be honest. Throughout the game, it increases in quality. Specifically the latter half, it really starts to get good. The sound design otherwise is superb. I never felt safe at any section of the game. There's always a reason to be afraid to go through the door, to check corners, or behind you. I always felt on edge because of the uneasy and at times, disturbing soundtrack. The monsters themselves make really creepy noises, from unearthly howls to shallow breathing that seemed to get right in your ears. The sound does a good job of creating the atmosphere.Visuals: So graphics. This game isn't the prettiest game you'll ever see. It's not at an Amnesia level, but for a free game, it's pretty ♥♥♥♥ing nice. The textures aren't super grainy, the models are well done and fit in with the maps, and you can't beat the variety in environments. Presumably you're in Sweden, and you'll go through a variety of environments, including, but not limited to, sewers, apartments, streets, alleyways, offices, parks, rooftops, subarbs, a mental hospital, a lake house, and a forest. Each felt very different from the next, but flowed together very well. Animations are damn well done - 3d person cutscenes never felt awkward or out of place, and they look good for a (free) game built on an older engine. Overall:This is a terrifying game. This is a difficult game. This is a great game. I would urge everyone to give this game a try. Fans of other classics like SH will enjoy this. I was disturbed, and sufficiently spooked several times over. I would have paid 20 dollars for this. ♥♥♥♥, I probably would've payed like 30, or 40 dollars for this. This game is worth so much more than 0 dollars. Give it a try, just for an hour. Then give it another 8 hours. Then cry and♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself from the scares. 10/10 would be too scared to leave my room again			"

												I like the idea but the game is VERY broken and buggy.  The first time i played there was no intro I just started in a room with a camera that had a flash that didnt work.  Objects would appear so briefly i didnt know wha they were.  Then i got out into the real world and after a few min the game crashed.Second time a long intro played, no crashes this time but the obscure first puzzle doesnt work for me.  Oh did I mention you cant save?  If youi can I dont know how.There is potential here and its free so I cant complain too much but i dont understand why it has ratings as high as it does in its current broken clunky state			"

												This game abused and violated me.For the first half Cry of Fear played exactly like the Silent Hill-ish psychological horror game that I thought it would be.But then... everything changed when the second half attacked.Apparently the devs knew me in a previous life and they got reincarnated as Team Psykskallar in order to make a game that would hold me down and touch me inappropriately over and over again.Their game constantly defied my expectations and gamer logic.Enemies never show up where they ""should"". Ammo and health pickups never appear where they ""should"".You have limited inventory space and are constantly expected to make room for mandatory plot items.Do you like fuses? You are going to hate fuses like Pavlov's dog with rabies.Why, Team Psykskallar? WHY did I have to go back and get those fuses? And then another time?After I defeated the final boss my kitchen faucet exploded. I spent 20 minutes cleaning my kitchen, drenched in water, laughing like a maniac. 10/10			"

												I always wanted to try Cry of Fear, I started to watch this project back in 2009 and I was really looking forward to it and now it's a fully standalone game (previously you needed Half-life 1 to play it, because it was just a modification).The game itself is amazing, I like it, but it's extremely funny; flying beds with zombies chained to them, zombies moving upside down - kicking you with their legs and those funny screams they have, I laughed so hard. It's supposed to be scary but it's too damn hillarious for me :D huge golems, falcon-punching you and when you're on the ground, they finish you with their legs. But the best moment was when we played co-op with my friends, one got too close to some doors and the upside down zombie kicked the doors and screamed, after that it almost killed me because I was unable to aim xD it has really awesome and memorable moments, but I don't want to spoil anything more.Ok, now the bad things: I want to mention the overpowered chainsaw dudes. They are fast, they kill you with one hit and if you don't have ammo, you're literally ♥♥♥♥ed. But it makes the atmosphere really intense, so maybe it isn't a negative thing. But they should make them to kill you with 2 hits, or they should be at least kinda slower. Also, the creatures are slightly bugged. Sometimes they go through walls or just don't attack you at all.But other than that, this game is great. Flawless if you play it in co-op with the right friends.Team Psyskallar did a really great job ;)Overall: 10/10			"

There are a few minor bugs that may pop up here and there but they can easily be over looked by the feeling that something will jump out and run at you around every corner. If you get scared easily or have a bad heart... thats an even better reason to play this game.			"

												If you're looking for a free horror game that won't stress your PC, get Cry of Fear.I haven't put too much time into it but from what I have played, it's a very well polished game. There are a few minor bugs that may pop up here and there but they can easily be over looked by the feeling that something will jump out and run at you around every corner. If you get scared easily or have a bad heart... thats an even better reason to play this game.			"

												I always wanted to try Cry of Fear, I started to watch this project back in 2009 and I was really looking forward to it and now it's a fully standalone game (previously you needed Half-life 1 to play it, because it was just a modification).The game itself is amazing, I like it, but it's extremely funny; flying beds with zombies chained to them, zombies moving upside down - kicking you with their legs and those funny screams they have, I laughed so hard. It's supposed to be scary but it's too damn hillarious for me :D huge golems, falcon-punching you and when you're on the ground, they finish you with their legs. But the best moment was when we played co-op with my friends, one got too close to some doors and the upside down zombie kicked the doors and screamed, after that it almost killed me because I was unable to aim xD it has really awesome and memorable moments, but I don't want to spoil anything more.Ok, now the bad things: I want to mention the overpowered chainsaw dudes. They are fast, they kill you with one hit and if you don't have ammo, you're literally ♥♥♥♥ed. But it makes the atmosphere really intense, so maybe it isn't a negative thing. But they should make them to kill you with 2 hits, or they should be at least kinda slower. Also, the creatures are slightly bugged. Sometimes they go through walls or just don't attack you at all.But other than that, this game is great. Flawless if you play it in co-op with the right friends.Team Psyskallar did a really great job ;)Overall: 10/10			"

You will♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself.This game is my number-one favorite indie horror game. From the atmosphere, to the gameplay, to the sheer psychological terror it dishes out, this game deserves every bit of praise it gets.Pros:  Psychological horror on par with Silent Hill and others.  Gameplay is very well-done; controls are tight and responsive, weapons are realistic, enemies are intelligent.  Always manages to keep you alert and scared, with dimly-lit alleyways, nearly-silent buildings, and things moving out of the corner of your eye.  Sound design is masterful; just as many scares come from the background noise as they do the monsters themselves.  Very good-looking, given the age of the engine it runs on.Cons:  Co-op mode is buggy, frequently refuses to connect; it's just a PvE deathmatch mode, anyway, and nowhere near the main focus, so it doesn't matter much.  Very dated engine, although the devs hid it well.Overall: 10/10, would♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants again.			"

												This game isnt terrible, but I dont recommend it because there is constant backtracking and if you don't conserve your ammo properly you will get stuck and have to restart the entire game.  This requires you to save and reload every time you make a slight mistake on an engagement which gets boring and repetitive.  If you don't mind the backtracking and save reloads its worth a playthrough if you don't want to spend money on something better.			"

												The game has its flaws and plus sides so i will try to break it down to youPluses-Atmosphere- the game has its parts when it can get scaryJumpscares- they will scare you in the most unexpected parts of the gameEnemies- some enemies can be a threat to you. some of them are fast but slow some of them can trap you in the corrner and kill you some of them even can flyStory- Story is preety good Co-Op wise and in single-player it can be even better altough you can get stuck in some partsFlaws-Graphics- altough not as bad as it can be it looks like a bad texture half life 1 modSound- some of the sound that enemies makes is a bit overused loops and can get anoying Bugs- Some times the game may crash durning the game play and it gets realy anoyingFun parts- Reviving In Co-Op - Just play in coop and try to revive your team mate you will understand what i'am talking aboutGlitches- Some time the dead body of the enemie can get stuck in the ground and start glitching and streching out trough whole screen but there are many other funny glitches you can findBut thats just a bit of my review you have to play the game yourselfMy rating to the game is 7.9/10			"

												Cry of Fear is a psychological horror game originally made as a half life mod then remade as a standalone game (this is the standalone).Pros:Graphics: The Graphics are actually pretty good for running on the Half LIfe EngineGamePlay:The Gameplay Is really fun and terrifying.Price: The Game is Free.Con:Glitches:Some Glitches Here and there (there aren't alot(as of what i have seen))Frame rate: its♥♥♥♥♥♥even at low settingsI give this game a 8/10.And also a BIG WARNING before playing. This Game is not for the faint of heart. There is suicide in this game and a lot of gore and violence.			"

												At first this game may appear to be a steaming pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ but upon further examination I found Cry of Fear to be a deeply nuanced and riveting experience.  I soon came to realize that this game represents the exploitation of the working class by the aristocratic bourgeoisie reptilian semites from Babylonian antiquity. The game mirrors the human endeavor to arise from the mundane and materialistic plane unto the divine and immortal sphere of the enlightened ones through multiple reincarnations. I came to understand the role of the modern emasculated man living in the Kali Yuga, to live as an ascetic warrior resisting the facade of the modern liberal monoculture. Thats why I showed Alexander Dugin this game and he said  it affected him profoundly. Whoever made this game should get a noble piece prize and I will personally blow him/her.			"

												i remember playing this game every tiem i play it with family and friends they get all depressed but when i play it by myself i get emotionally, and mentally traumentized and when i beat it my best friend had to have been put in a refinement center. lol NO I'm joking for teh lulz. It has some nice puzzles, the efforts placed into the creation of the game is capital, and you could learn more about the development of the game via it's website or by unlocking the director's commentary. For example, ruMpel went around his neighborhood to get ideas on map/level design. This game has at least 4 endings, but I will not be a spoilering ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and tell you about all of them. However I think ALL of the endings aresaddening, because just this once I will be an inglorious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, Simon the Main protagonist kills himself. If there are secret endings, I hope I can find them myself The combat system is nice, it forces YOU to choose what to use, IE: A baton, a shotgun, and finally a hunting rifle. That was just an example of one of the combat loadouts. Speaking of combat & gameplay, there is a multiplayer mode with it's own storyline where you and a team of polisen trying to find Simon. However, somehow, you share the same hellish relm with our crippled David Leatherhoff in a grey hoodie.I recommend this game to fans of the ""Silent Hill"" series, the ""Resident Evil"" series,""Left 4 Dead"" series, and finally to everyone that has played, beaten, and enjoyed the half-life mod, ""Afraid of Monsters"".

												This game isnt terrible, but I dont recommend it because there is constant backtracking and if you don't conserve your ammo properly you will get stuck and have to restart the entire game.  This requires you to save and reload every time you make a slight mistake on an engagement which gets boring and repetitive.  If you don't mind the backtracking and save reloads its worth a playthrough if you don't want to spend money on something better.			"

												I'm a little late to the party here but if you're even later than me then DON'T GET THIS GAME. The story may be very good but there are loads of flaws not even the settings can fix. For one my view kept spiralling when I looked left or right so I could barely make it through the corridors in the first couple of minutes.For another the walking mechanics are as wobbly as they get. I get this game is not up-to-date by a long shot but for me it was a giant bug-/glitchfest from the start and I think we're not wrong to at least expect a somewhat decently built game. It was more buggy than your vision in SOMA.Maybe the storyline is worth a shot one day when I figure out what the hell to do to fix this hunk of glitches, but until then its a huge nono for me.			"

												I don't know where to start with this game? Where do I start? You play as Simon, a depressed teenager who gets hit by a car and is in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. That is it. That is the game, a guy in a wheelchair writing a book and just play through what he writes in his book, alone in his room with the doctor coming in from time to time. But this thing, this man that you play as, Simon is just someone who wants to be loved, for someone  to care about him or he kills himself. Thats all he wants really and he thinks writing this book will him through that but in the real life, is that true? Can writing a book on things you see or do really change who you are, or want to be? No. No it can't there is no way that writing one book will help him or anyone for the matter. He would have to write more than just one book to tell his story... his... cry of fear			"

												One of the best Horror games I have ever played. It's truely a horror game and not just a dumb shooter like most games who claim themselves to be horror games. The game has a really great athmosphere, a great and fitting soundtrack and it forces you to make decisions (like: Do I take the shotgun or do I stick with the pistol?)Graphics isn't that great, but it's okay. Overall I would give this game 9/10			"

												For a game built around the GoldSRC engine, this looks pretty amazing. The game itself is like an FPS Silent Hill, and plays pretty well! The 3D menu is a bit wonky, but works okay for the most part. And I love, I repeat, LOVE the music! The Co-op is fun too, if you can host it properly.And did I mention this game is free? Because it is. Why haven't you downloaded this game yet? You have nothing to lose!			"

And considering that this was a mod for the original Half-Life, the graphics were really good for being made on the engine it was. No matter how many times I've played this game, I can never get enough of it! Amazing game! Five stars! I would have payed $20 for it!			"

												Really fun and very scary. Even if you were to put cheats (i don't btw cus thats what makes the game boring plus cheats been patched for steam version) it is still scary AF. Due to the jumpscares and the noise is what makes this game addicting. The storyline was really good and very understandable. The multiplayer is really FUN!!! Me and my friends were messing around a lot in this game and we always ended up restarting the map because of how much we mess around. I would recommend this game to anyone if you're into horror survival shooter.			"

This game really does not make it easy to find out where you need to go, so if you are easily frustrated and lost, dont play this.			"

												A great game that needs more and more attention. Great atmoshere and somewhat smooth combat. I only wish there were fewer bugs and glitches, but since this is an indie that started from a mod, its great. Highly recommended to play. Gives a scare even if you expect it or not.

												The graphics are♥♥♥♥♥♥Controls are♥♥♥♥♥♥The enemy itself is very stupid at times.Okay now that we've gotten the generic first look experiences out of the way, let's move on to why I'd bother with this one.It can at times legit scare you off your seat! (it has a few screamers and pretty sure not a good idea to play alone)Small and short levels that you can easily redo if you happen to suck and die at any given point. But I suppose that could be seen as a bad thing?Basically the only reason to play this game is if you're wanting to play it with a group of friends that can have a laugh with you because, trust me, this game will give you so many things to laugh about. The first three lines of this review, the ones that are supposedly thought of as 'cons' to a game are, for this game, one of the reasons why you should get it and enjoy it with your friends. Because, let's be honest, in this day and age everyone's playing freakin' games like Fallout 4, Arkham Knight, BO3 and all the good graphic demanding ones so it's always nice to chill out and go to the Feudal age a bit and that's when this here game comes into action!This one gets my lenny seal of approval!

The game begins where Simon is walking down the street and suddenly finds a man injured on the ground and rushes to his ade. When he asks the man what happend a car with no driver starts behind you and rams full speed in to you knocking out the main character. once waking up he must find his way and gather his bareings through a freakish world of his imagination and survive against all of his thought and feelings evolved to monsters and 3 boss battles! can you survive? find out and overcome Cry Of Fear! ""The thing that gave me the first impression I was in deep♥♥♥♥♥♥was the warning of no small children, pregnant women, or elderly in the beginning of the story mode.""-BlackOut			"

												de hecho muy buen juego,jaja el single es muy bueno por la historia es mas los graficos son truchos,pero eso no importa lo q importa es la jugabilidad,de hecho un muy buen juego Survival Horror,segun yo supera a RE 4,estaria bueno q hagan un coop pero no el coop del cap 9 sino del cap 1 y de ahi toda la historia hasta el final eso estaria bueno... Dejen de leer para los q quieran hacer la historia porq les hare un pequeño spoilerSpoiler:En el comienzo del juego para los cagones :3 como yo,tengan cuidado a que X se acercan e.e ahi una en la q te acercas y te salta una cara por eso les aviso para q no tengan miedo xD y sepan q les va a pasar lel tambien les explico como va la historia de Simon y porq en el coop esta haci re sangrientoArmas:Bueno ni me atrevo pasar la historia por el tema del Jump Scream del comienzo,pero lo demas me chupa un huevo ni da miedo pero el jump scream si,bueno perdon me salte del tema de las armas jeje,no me atrevo a pasar la historia por el tema ese por eso no pude probar todas las armas del juego pero me se algunas unas cuantas pistolas,M4A1,Shotgun y mas de eso tambien rifle de sniperBueno aca termina mi analisis segun yo,buen juego de supervivencia horror,el q quiera jugar agregueme en steam(solo por hamachi se puede el COOP)Steam:Apunta con el cursor a mi foto -.-Skype:Emiliano.kihnFacebook:No me fiare de ust. a no ser q nos llevemos bien			"
