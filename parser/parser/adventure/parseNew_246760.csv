												This is the first and only Early Access game I have backed so far, but it really has left me with a high standard mark that I doubt will be met by all the other projects I back in the future.The game is amazing, people wouldn't think such a feat could be done with as little funding as this project had. The battlefield in this game offers a variety that might be overlooked at first glance, but it's that what makes it much better than HoMM or King's Bounty, at least in my eyes.The battles in the games previously mentioned tend to become dull and repetitive after a while, and I grow tired of the game and don't touch it for a long while. But in the case of this game, the battles are always quick-paced and focused. You can't just fiddle around wasting turns, you have to move and so does your opponent. Planning before the battle is as important as the fight itself. And that's just talking about how the fights go. The music is simply wonderful and the art is very well-polished. Still, it's a turn-based combat game, so it's a niche game on its own, but for a cautious turn-based player such as myself, this game has delivered much more than it promised.			"

												Legends of Eisenwald is in my opinion one of the best games that came through greenlight. The story is good and exciting. While playing you will have many decisions to make, all of which make the story evolve in different directions. The graphics are also well done, and there are a lot of nice side stories which come with beautiful pictures which you can read in a tavern. This gives the game a good flair. The combat system has a balanced and demanding design. I always looked forward to the next battle, because after I won a fight, my knight can level up again.

												If one of those bigger budget game companies released a game as well written and storied as this, they would get full 100% reviews lauding them as the new ""planescape torment"". It's really that good. Even moderately good recent RPGS like Divinity, Wastelands2 etc, haven't on staff any writer even half as talented as whoever wrote this game and its characters.This is one of those rare gems so full of style, atmosphere, character, story... This is exactly what gaming really needs. The more you play it, the more it reveals itself to you as a deep setting, with a rich story and very deep characters that any other developer would envy. At first I thought negatively of this game because of it's enormously lackluster combat mechanics. Yes, they are really simplistic and bad, forcing the same kind of repetitive mindless grind every single time. But this game is so much more.			"

												[Main campaign complete - the original review will be left ""as is"" with updated comments in brackets. The original review was written between a quarter and one third of the way into the campaign.]In my opinion, Legends of Eisenwald is first and foremost a turn-based squad level tactical combat game with a character development system that is focused almost exclusively on combat. The game ships with a campaign that tells a single story from the point of view of one of three possible protagonists. Your character will level and you do get to choose how your character develops in terms of the game's combat mechanics, but that is pretty much it. There are no game mechanics to provide any real character depth; and the story is very linear. NPCs with any real character are few and far between. The members of your army (really just a squad) are interchangeable generic constructs. I don't know why the devs even bothered to give them names. Thus (and there will be more below), I don't see how one can think this is an RPG in any way. I am going to judge this game largely on the merits of the default campaign as that is what one experiences as neither of the two items in the Steam Workshop (7/5/2015) speak to me. The game's fundamental combat mechanics are easy to grasp, but there is plenty of depth. This is not unfamiliar territory if one has played game franchises like Heroes of Might and Magic or Warlords. Just know that Legends of Eisenwald is not a rip-off of those other games; it is its own game. Overall, I have no complaints with the combat mechanics or the skill tree for the knight. The tactical combat is the game's strength; and, if that is enough for you, then you may enjoy this game. However, the game's liabilities are significant enough that I can't recommend the game in its current form. [There is an a scenario in the Steam Workshop that looks interesting]Points to get out of the way early:  Use descriptive names for your saved game files as you are probably going to need them. I know I've done a fair bit of backtracking, and I wouldn't have been able to do so as easily with the default saved game file names.   Wrap-up side quests before completing the main quest(s) in each chapter. If you don't have good save game files, there is no going back to previous zones to complete a side quest once you finish a chapter. Obviously, if you use a saved game to go back and complete a side quest, you are going to be forced to replay the chapter ending event(s). For me this is a relatively minor annoyance, but that may not be how others feel.  The journal and notes system does not allow you to refer back to previous chapters as far as I can tell. There are two problems here. First, there is information that one would like to refer to from previous chapters. Second, the quest and journal system does not capture all the dialog that it should to eliminate the need for a custom note feature (which does not exist in this game). Thus, one has to use another application outside the game for taking notes. Alt-Tab or play in a windowed mode; or posses perfect recall!There is too little documentation for the game. Yes. The devs did post a useful User Guide and a series of intro videos. However, this is not what I mean by documentation. There should at least be a text file that systematically lists and describes all skills, equipment modifiers, etc. There isn't one. For example, there are branching skill trees for NPCs, but there is no right-click or mouse-over to explain what they they are and you can't look ahead in the skill trees to know which one seems the most interesting to you. Thus, one is forced to save the game. Try one option, and read what it does. Then you load the save game, select the other option, and read what it does. The same is true with equipment with special characteristics. Want to know if a ""rugged"" helmet is worth the hit to initiative? Save game. Buy item. Equip item. See what it does (sometime it is still not clear what an object does). This is the opposite of fun - it is tedious and boring; and it is a waste of my time.Speaking of tedious and boring, there are quest objectives that require one to hit just the right spot in order to trigger a necessary event. Now I don't mind this much when there is the occasional quest that involves discovering something that should be hard to find. However, it is another matter when it comes to obvious things or when it occurs too frequently; it is maddening when one is well aware that one is wasting time trying to find the correct pixel to stand on for an event to fire. Once again, this is tedious and boring; and it is a waste of my time. Worse, it takes one right out of the story . . . and there is too little of that as it is. Yes. I would dispute that the campaign is ""story rich"". With almost every quest I am left wanting more story.[The maddening ""find the pixel to stand on"" theme does not exist in later chapters (and is limited to two instances in the early chapters), and is replaced with a slightly less annoying mechanic. Specifically, one has to hit a series of waypoints in the correct sequence. I found this annoying because I had gone off and done some exploring and grabbed some castles in advance of the story line. Thus, I had a pretty good idea where I was supposed to go in the quests; but I still had to follow the sequence of waypoints nonetheless.]Legends of Eisenwald has an interesting story to tell, but there are few opportunities for role playing and most of those opportunities are ruined by the story. Specifically, circumstances will dictate your options and your actions. One is given few real choices as the story unfolds; and there is little point in attempting to role play as, more often than not, you will be railroaded into only one course of action no matter what you do. Your only real choice is how you develop your combat skills. Thus, Legends of Eisenwald has a story to tell; but it is not your story. You are merely a puppet. In some regards, this is a very medieval point of view; and, if this was a conscious decision on the part of the devs, then they have succeeded in conveying that world view. [By the end game I was on rails; no choices at all.]There are major missed opportunities with the campaign from both a reward and historical perspective. There was an opportunity to better distinguish between true followers, feudal levies and mercenaries - particular in terms of the transition between chapters; but the opportunity is squandered. Also, a player might expect to be rewarded by being able to carry gains forward from one chapter to the next, but this is an expectation that has not been met in my game. This may be down to a lack of skill tree depth for NPCs or perhaps it is a necessary concession to play balance. In any event, there will be unexplained losses of inventory and members of your squad between some chapters - the game doesn't even offer a simple dialog box with a plausible story for the losses. One is left to make-up one's own story to explain what came through and what did not between chapters.I am at that point in the game where I am deciding if I am going to continue playing Legends of Eisenwald. I've completed several chapters; and, if the pattern holds for subsequent chapters, I think I know what to expect; and there is not enough on offer to justify taking significant time away from other games. I've done a little back tracking through my save game files to see if I can see where things might have gone differently, and I'm fairly certain that I've not missed anything obvious. Too bad. I'll monitor future release notes in the hope that better things are to come . . . as, to this point, I definitely feel like I paid too much for the experience currently on offer. That said, I suspect I'll keep chipping away at the campaign as I do enjoy the tactical combat portion of the game.			"

												I watched Legends of Eisenwald (LoE) as it made its way through early access. I liked the graphics and I loved the Middle Ages feudal setting. I put it on my Wishlist and when it went on sale I bought it. My first play, however, didn't quite go as expected. It wasn't that I disliked it. It was just that I had a bit of trouble understanding some of the game concepts. I stopped play after an hour or two and moved on to other things. About a month later I decided to try LoE again, but not before I watched some gameplays on YouTube. There I learned about right-clicking and stopping time. Right clicking on my troops allowed me to study their specific attributes, blessings, curses, etc. Stopping time limited the characters on the world map to move only when my army moved. Those two simple things completely turned the game around for me.I'm sure glad I gave it a second chance. I believe that I've invested 60+ hours in it so far and I know that this game is one of my all-time favorites. (For the record, Number 1 on my list is the Heroes of Might & Magic series 1-7, and number 2 is the Spellforce series 1-2.) This game is unique, but has a number of elements, especially combat, which reminds me of the Disciples series (another favorite). Some might complain about the amount of text, but I really believe that the developers went out of their way to make an interesting story. My only small complaints are the vague information provided for a number of quests and the re-use of the same face for multiple characters.  Anyway, a long review, but I HIGHLY recommend this game. If you enjoy turn-based strategy, the Middle Ages, and think that you might like taking a castle by force, collecting money from your serfs, and building up a strong army to take out your enemies, pick-up LoE.

												A mix of King's Bounty and Disciples set in (more or less) medieval Germany.The first impression can be somewhat off-putting, because the graphics and animations look simple and feel outdated for at least 5 years. Nevertheless, once you get past it and get into your first quests, the engine doesn't really matter anymore.   After the tutorial map the story picks up quickly and the first full size campaign map is very entertaining.If you enjoyed Disciples, HOMM or King's Bounty, and you don't mind simple graphics, I would definitely recommend this game. Bonus points for including an excellent Belarusian translation!			"

												Legends of Eisenwald is a great gift for everyone who loves European history and The Middle Ages. Its beautiful art and interesting story tied together with old good HoMM-styled gameplay makes the renaissance of a truly classic. I'm also amazed by the quality and quantity of content. While for the most of the time game keeps you engaged, the only thing that can distract you from the game is rare performance problems from time to time - maybe going with the flow and using one of the production-ready engines could be better option for devs. This is a great result for a game made by a small indie studio.

												Well...at first sight, i thought that i made a mistake by bying this game. Combat looked to simple, story telling in messages dull. But wow, have i been ever more wrong! This game is awesome! Awesome story, might be a bit linear, but hell its a decent story! The dude who wrote the script should do more of those. Becouse each stage of game have more of the lore than HOMM during the whole game lately. The graphics is realy pleasing the eye. Devs did a great job. Hope we will hear from them more. Becouse im definetely looking forward for any other project from theese guys.  Good job. Keep it up!			"

Early Access Review
								You and your trusted companion set out to visit an old friend of your family's, but during your stay trouble stirs in your homesteads. You return to your lands only to find your former vassals at war with each other, bandits ravaging the lands and strange pagan cults arising.Legends of Eisenwald promises a fresh new look at old-school RPG and turn based strategy glory, long forgotten in today's big releases. You are to assemble a team of capable warriors, healers and priests, manage their equipment and upgrades and lead them to victory against the many foes now scattered throughout the lands. You go through various chapters of the main story, all taking place in different areas, most of which pretty darn big. Lots of castles, villages and taverns bid you welcome and offer mercenaries or information, ruins and bandit hideouts offer their ill-gotten gains to whoever is brave enough to demand them back.For most of the game, you will be controlling your personal army of 12 soldiers (at max.), following the main quest. This alone will allow you to go down different paths, with a little bit of open-world feeling thrown into the mix. When returning to your old vassals, they will ask you to deal with their respective neighbours for them, and it is up to you who to side with. Apart from following the story, a healthy number of sidequests will beg for your attention. Some may offer unique treasure, others might get you a valuable companion. If you played Mount & Blade, the campaign-map will feel very familiar. Each army is represented only by one token character and the time goes by in a flash (adjustable).If you meet with a hostile army or enter an enemy settlement, battle will commence. Here is where the turn based strategy part advertised by the game comes into play. It is your task to organise your soldiers on a field of hexagons, with melee characters in front and support in the back. Based on every character's initiative-value, they all take turns going at each other. Some units have special abilities, some may buff your troops or curse the enemy.Combat is done well enough, though hardcore-fans of the days gone by might find it lacking in depth. Apart from different stats and abilities, your equipment plays only a minor role and will not even change the physical appearenace of your soldiers. Upgrading them feels like a somewhat sterile and uninteresting process. Quests are generally very straight-forward and come with exact map-markers, so friends of complex storylines might not get their money's worth here either.One major problem with the game: It is still in development, as the Early Access tag suggests. I experienced a lot of crashes and graphical glitches that have yet to be fixed.Eisenwald has an interesting setting. The music is atmospheric and the aesthetics are fitting. Also, work on your pronounciation-skills for German words, as ""Eisenwald"" is only one of many.Is Eisenwald worth buying? Maybe not so much at this point, but at the very least it is worth to keep an eye on it. If you want your nostalgia-nerve tickled, this might just be the thing for you.			"

Early Access Review
								First of all there are many negative reviews due to misrepresentation of the game by developer. Most people assumed that this game is an old school RPG game (as it is announced) and judged accordingly. If you want to categorize a game like this it simply falls somewhere between the Heroes series and Disciples series.I don’t usually write any reviews on games but in my opinion this one is particularly wronged by too many people. The early access version is 6-8 hours long to beat on first playthrough but there are people who played it like 40-50 hours and then disliked it on so many levels which is odd.At this stage this game deserves at least a 7 out of 10. Pros:-Good graphics-High quality sound and music-Good controls and camera mechanics-Simple yet sufficient tutorial as a part of the campaign-Good story telling-Manageable army and battlefield size-Simple yet fun to play battles.-Good blend of side quests-Challenging AI both in strategy map and battlesCons:-Some bugs and crashes which may hopefully be fixed before full release-Quest tracking is very unclear, some won't update as you progress, you have to read through the quest that you are on several times before you can figure out what to do.-Throws you in too deep and leaves you in the dark too soon.-Camera can’t be unlocked in strategy map (always fixed on your party)-no minimap (going between the map and strategy map is tiresome at some point)-very slow levelling-Lack of restart level option (VERY important to have.)Overall most of the cons are agreed upon by too many people but most of them can be fixed, polished or added before the full release of this game. As far as I can track the developer team is highly interested in what people think of their game and active on the Forums. So I believe that they can release a way better final product at the end. "

												Every dedicated gamer will understand this feeling- Your getting bored, you've played too many games recently and none of them seem to provide that deep gaming feeling of excitement, achievement and cheerful contentment and satisfaction that games provided you with in the past. Then along comes a game that reinvigorates you all over again, makes you sit up excitedly, totaly engages you in it's world , story and characters, and fully restores your faith in gaming as the ultimate escapism.Legends of Eisenwald is that game.After many hours of play the one thing that stood out for me was the writing, it's excellent. The low fantasy type story reeled me in and held me in it's grasp right from the beggining. Many games stories are judged in the first few hours of play so it's critical the player is kept interested. How many games have tried and failed at this test in the past ?, hundreds?. LoE, however, has no such worries. Without revealing too much on the story, as others have done in previous reviews below, it's safe to say that LoE is an excellent and believable knight errant type story set in medieval Germany. No voice acting opens the players imagination more and i honestly feel it's the best writing in a game i've had the pleasure to read for a long long time, it's the games crowning achievement . The turn based combat , character leveling up, game economy, items etc is deep and addictive. You can spend a long time purchasing the right armour, weapons, medallions, rings and potions etc and just as much time balancing it all between your team of soldiers, archers, monks and healers to ensure success in battle. I cannot add more than others have already said about this game other than it's one of the best RPG's i've played in a while. It's totally engrossing, a diamond in the rough, a gem of a game i sincerely recommend to the discerning gamer.Another positive is the effort made by the developer to engage the players to guarantee an enjoyable experience. I don't remember seeing a problem that wasn't fixed speedily or a forum post or comment that wasn't replied to by the developer. The input from Aterdux from day one of development right up to now has been nothing short of tremendous.			"

												Legends Of Eisenwald is a turn-based strategic R.P.G. set in medieval times both developed and published by Aterdux Entertainment. With a small feudal army at your beck and call, you take the lead and attempt to defend your right to survive in this ruthless world. This isn't a fantasy game where evil has the face of trolls, elves and dragons no...there are only people and their passions, sins and fears that often take a tangible form be that form good or ill. As you forge your destiny you will have to decide which path to choose...to live by your conscience, power or might? Or will you live by justice...and what is your justice really? Gather your troops and take off for adventure through the mysterious lands of old Germany...The Iron Forest awaits!This title features an very interesting non-linear story that unfolds in various quests that you accept as the narrative plays out. The main campaign consists of eight chapters plus two additional scenarios with hours upon hours of total gameplay. As far as conflict goes, Eisenwald's tactical combat is very challenging, unique, dynamic and leaves you with a true sense of satisfaction each time you win a battle. I often find myself clapping my hands together and yelling out ""Yes!"" after a victory. The fighting takes place on a hexagonal battlefield in turn-based format where you can rotate and zoom the view, ala Dragon Age: Origins, to get the best possible vantage point in order to decide how and where to attack your enemies. In the past, one thing that really bothered me with many strategy games is that simply moving a character cost you an opportunity to attack but this is simply not so with Legends Of Eisenwald. Your troops are still able to move across the battlefield and initiate an attack without recieving a penalty which is fantastic. As your legends win battles and complete quests you will, of course, earn experience points that allow you to level up your units via a very diversfied skill tree that also manages to provide cosmetic changes to your army. Building a powerful army is essential to your success in this game and there is a large selection of weapons, armor, spells, trinkets and abilities including the option to use mounted units at your disposal. If you are an obsessive compulsive R.P.G. gamer like me then you could literally spend hours of your playtime just trying to equip your people with the best and most appropriate gear as you carefully read each description and statistic to determine who should have what. One has to be careful though as this title has a heavy dose of inventory management thrown in for good measure. Just like in real life, finance is important so one can't go all willy-nilly and spend every coin on gear without having to maintain a balance of resources for other vital things or face disasterous results as a consequence. The developers even go so far as to state this on the game page...IMPORTANT NOTICE: Similar to games like Disciples 2 and HOMM, there may be points farther into the game where you lose it all, troops, gold, inventory. All those things you worked so hard for. This is part of the game, not a bug. And you wont know when....BE WARNED.WOW!!! That's truly scary but the risk is also part of the excellent gameplay of Legends Of Eisenwald.Graphically, I think this game is gorgeous a true feast for the eyes. The entire presentation of the title is executed quite nicely and looks very professional. I always love the isometric look of the strategy based R.P.G. titles and Legends Of Eisenwald is no exception. It successfully captures the spirit and atmosphere of the medieval ages esthetically and runs ever so smoothly doing it. The campaigns cutscenes consists of a combination of beautiful hand painted art and detailed character models which are crisp and well animated. However, I simply cannot go any further without mentioning the superb symphonic soundtrack that this game features. The brilliant orchestral tracks manage to create a charm that truly immerses you within the medieval ambiance of the story. This is definitely a title that has an O.S.T. that I listen to out of game on a regular basis because it is just that good. The sound effects are also quite effective as well. For example, when you're in a tavern listening to idle gossip or some merchants outrageous story, the sounds of people chattering and dishes clanging in the background are so immersive and crisp. The game is also laden with extras in the form of D.L.C., the aformentioned O.S.T., a Scenario Editor with the full set of developer tools for the modding community, Steam trading cards and Steam achievements. It's a great package for the price especially if one manages to catch the title on sale.I found myself enthralled with this game within the first few hours of playing it and I plan to spend many many more doing so. In a genre that is laden with lackluster titles, Legends Of Eisenwald stands out as a unique take on a tried and true formula. Strangely enough, this game fell under my radar but I was lucky enough to have a friend point it out to me. It's always great when you come across a title that you had no idea existed the day before and that game ends up becoming a true favorite. The battles are extremely fun, the story is intriguing and the soundtrack is fabulous. Legends Of Eisenwald is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to both, fans of the genre and casual gamers also. "

												Okay.. phwoa!!... long game. Just finished it - in at around 100 hours - Final Fantasy eat your heart out. A few late nights let me tell you. I feel that this game deserves the time and effort for me to write at least something about it and how I felt about it even if to just say it was a good game. But I will do more because I felt this game really was something special and I have derived so much enjoyment from it that it is the least I could do. I bought this game on sale for a few pennies (I can't remember now but I think it was for under $5) and didn't really have too high hopes for it considering its price and look but was then completely overturned in my opinion by what is essentially a really great game that in no wise is properly represented by its appearance. DON'T judge a book by its cover! Boy, don't judge this book by its cover, it is a great game for what its worth.  I think this game goes for around $20 more or less on steam and that is about the right price for this game. You won't regret parting with that hard earned cash. If you see this game for anything less than $10 buy it straight away, don't hesitate, you won't regret it. You might ask if it is such a great game why is it only worth $20 dollars? Well that is what I will attempt to explain.Although I did derive a lot of joy and pleasure from this game, it still very much feels like an Indie production, which is exactly what it is. A beautiful and well done Indie production but an Indie production none the less. There are a host of issues which will remind you of that time and again but they are heavily outweighed by the things that the game gets SO right. Like the loot, merchant and trade system which I guarantee will be the end of you. These guys have got it so spot on that its just scary how much time you'll be spending tweaking your characters inventories and travelling the four corners of the globe in search for new places of trading. Certain hero's you defeat will drop unique items that you will be on the verge of crying over whether you want to sell them for their insane item values or keep them and derive the benefit from them that few items will be able to match or you will need an assortment of items to do what a single unique or rare item can do freeing up those super valuable item slots. yep... thats the one. You'll be doing a lot of fighting and some can be pretty intense and take up quite a bit of time so you won't be missing out on anything there. The battle system is a little different from what you may be expecting but just accept things for as they are and get on with it. Sure I felt as if some of the things in the combat area are a little counter intuitive, such as not being able to move your guys where you want and not being able to attack whoever you want but don't let that stop you from enjoying the game as a whole. This game is an experience but the game isn't designed around just combat. It is designed around a story, and it is the story that is the main hero of this game. The combat is just there to spice things up... and provide you with loot to sell to buy stuff at the merchants and traders... WARNING, get those sick day excuses ready cos you are going to need a few with some of the late nights you are going to be putting in.The leveling up system feels right but is severly let down by the fact that you have to retrain your troops at the beginning of every chapter - 8 chapters I think - so all of that hard work to level up your characters (barring your main character) and tweaking their equipment and shopping around to get the best stuff will all be in vain by the end of the chapter as you will be stripped of all of your sellable equipment and all your troops. You will be forced to start from scratch all over again (very small but significant exeptions) at the beginning of the next chapter and collect all of your equipment - AGAIN - and level up all of your guys - AGAIN - but as dissapointing as that sounds, it is actually worse. You will continuously be at a compounding disadvantage as you will have to start with raw recruits each time and although that might not be too much of a problem in the first, second or third chapters, buy the time you are well progressed into the game you will need to start with raw recruits going up against enemies that are more matched to your main character who has advanced significantly by this stage.The sounds, music and graphics are all very beautful. There is no voice acting, all dialogue is written so get used to doing a bit of reading. The story is generally pretty good with very few 'cringe' moments that you might expect from japanese rpg's but the underlying theme of the storyline is quite mature and developed and centres around choice, consequence, belief and ego. The character models are not redrawn for each character in the game but are simply taken from a dozen or so stock character models, given different outfits and then regurgitated as different characters in the game so don't be surprised when Joe Blogs from the smithy looks a lot like the Duke from the castle with just a different hat. Thats because that's all it is, just a different hat, different name and different stats. See... told you I'd explain why its only a $20 game and not a $40+ game. One particularly annoying trait is the lack of sideward camera scrolling. The view is centred on your character and although you can rotate the angle and direction you cannot move the camera off of your character which means you are forced to constantly give them move orders to the edge of the screen, wait till they get there, give them the order again and keep repeating this untill they arrive at their destination which could be a world away. Fun I know. Then there are the bugs which unfortunately can become very frustrating.Do these things really make the game bad? No, they don't. The GAME is great despite these flaws but they are a reminder that you are not playing a big publishing house A+++ title. Thats what I was saying before about it being on the mark for its price. If I had payed top dollar for this game then these issues would have surely offended me but I can overlook them considering the value I believe I am getting for the game and the enjoyment and play length that it offers. In conclusion the game is great. Great story, great graphics, great sense of character progression and most importantly, great fun. It offers countless reminders of its indie roots but these should be kept in perspective of the price you are paying and the quality and quantity of enjoyment you derive from the game. There are always gonna be people who can't keep the reality in focus and are going to dwell on the negative despite ALL of the positive that the game offers. But thats the story of the world really. Final verdict... 7.5 out of 10. Excellent score all things considered.			"

												I oringally bought the game in early access. I played it, saw that it had good potential and decided to wait until it was finished with some updates. I am a guy who likes finished polished products and that is what the game now is...So you'll be seeing my hours rise as I deep dive back into the game. I want to say that I truly am perplexed by the mixed reviews. I've been a strategy, simulation and tactical combat guy for 25 years. I honestly am not sure if some of these other reviewers know the difference between rpg elements and tactical squad based combat and so on and so forth. I try not to repeat anything you already know, you can read what the games about on the store page. What i think best for a review here is to give you refernces within the genre and let you decide if that is what you are in the mode for...so here goes.This is a fresh take on an old school popular genre where it has elements of adventure, rpg, squad based tactical combat and a little resource management in relation to income, outgo, spending on troops and equipment and potential maintence of those troops. You will like this game if you enjoyed:Heros of might and magic ( mixes adventure and story into the map like this title with combat similiair but a lil diff)Battle brothers (like in this title manage your money and expenses or go broke and into ruin)Expeditions Conquistador ( EC does have much deeper characters but the storyline of LoE just does it differently focusing on the main character vs the party)So in conclusion if you want to enjoy a fresh story from a setting very few other games touch that combines elements of adventure, tactical combat and some minor income/outgo finanicial management this is the game for you. I do recommend the game as fans of the genre or of any of the above mentioned games will enjoy it. I really do not think the mixed reviews are fair as the reviews are focused to much on what the game isn't ( no game is anyones ideal) vs what it actually is and what it does correctly that it set out to do. This dev team took a lot of time to make a quality product and it deserves to the recognition of that accomplishment.			"

												I went into this Early Access game made by a development studio i had not heard of unsure about its content and a bit skeptical about its quality, but soon after I began playing all these doubts were put to rest. I suddenly found myself deeply submerged into the game and all it has to offer. Legends of Eisenwald is a true strategic RPG game that skillfully combines the heroic elements of  old-school role-playing with tactical turn-based combat and presented in a medieval setting filled with unique legends and folklore.In this game players will create their hero from a selection of three initial classes and then recruit a small army to travel throughout the realm fulfilling quests, investigating myths and legends, and conquering castles among other things. LoE is still very much Early Access and there will certainly be more changes made. However, this game is entertaining and playable in its current state and offers a lot of nice features.One of the most interesting features in this game is the concept of changing how the turn-based combat takes place. Unlike other games, Legends of Eisenwald has decided to remove movement points from combat in order to streamline it and make it more dynamic. I like knowing that one strategic movement or action can ultimately determine the outcome of a battle regardless of strength or numbers. Of course, there are lots of weapons, items, and spells typical to any RPG game that will also aid your army in battle. There is also an upgrade tree for improving your units as they gain experience along the way. The user interface is minimal and easy to use. Gameplay speed can be adjusted and there is an option to auto-play battles at any time. The developers have even included a level editor that will allow more content to be added by the community.Being Early Access also means that the game still has a few drawbacks though. There are still a few bugs in the game so I recommend leaving auto-save enabled or save your game often. The game includes a function to send error reports and crashes directly to the developers when a bug is encountered. However, this is also somewhat buggy and does not always work as intended. Also, the game still lacks the lustrious shine that a finished product has. While the artwork and graphics are very nice and full of detail, there is still no ""wow"" factor when it comes to battle animations. There is a ton of lore in this game that is scripted well, but the english translation is not very good  and can be confusing to read at times. One would think that this would have been picked up and sorted out through the beta testing community but currently it has not. Some voice acting would also enhance this game tremendously, but i'm not sure it is even being considered. Still, this game is an overall delight and it will definitely improve before its final release.The Good:=======+  High quality artwork and music+  Good storyline campaign with tutorial help+  Solid game content offering many hours of play+  Difficulty options that challenge players+  Many customizing options and items for units and heroes+  Adjustable game speed settings+  Minimal requirements allow older systems to work+  User interface is simple and convenient+  Level editor included for the modding community+  Steam Trading Cards and Achievements+  Active development teamThe Bad:======-  Text translations (english) need a lot of work-  Bugs and game crashes still present-  No controller support-  Battle animations are dull and boring-  No voice acting or cutscenes/strictly point & clickFinal Thoughts:===========Legends of Eisenwald is an entertaining game overall and considering its still in Early Access beta there is still a strong possibility that the game will be even better upon completion. While it still needs a lot of polishing and there are still a few scattered bugs in the coding, I still enjoyed it tremendously and would recommend it to fellow strategy/RPG gaming fans. With the right adjustments and improvements this game could become an instant classic.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												  If you loved the early HOMM and old school RPG games that rely heavily on text, then Legends of Eisenwald may be something you will enjoy. The game is set in Medieval times  where myths, legends, and superstition abound. You will spend time listening to tales at the local tavern. It's best to listen closely since they may very well save your party from trouble down the road. You won't find any trolls or goblins during your travels however expect plenty of  Intrigue, lust, and betrayal.   This isn't a fast paced game. It's best enjoyed with a pot of hot coffee nearby and plenty of free time to get lost in the lore.  Some quests may be difficult if you need to rely on twinkling sparkles to indicate where a quest objective is. Online guides may be hard to find if you truly become stumped on a quest.   LoE is more linear than I had expected. You can (unfortunately) skip large portions of game play if you want to power your way to the chapter's finish. Doing so would defeat the purpose of the game. There are no cut-scenes, voice over's, or other fluff. The time and effort of the developers was clearly spent on creating an experience that should fully immerse veteran RPGers.Scale of 1 to 10Game play -  8  ( A shame that party members are lost from chapter to chapter)Game stability -   7 (some quirky movement areas and random crashes)Music -  10 (Simply fantastic and perfect for the game)Graphics -  8 (on highest settings game looks great)Atmosphere / immersion factor  -  10 (The main quest line is average to be honest however take your time and read everything. It's the tales and stories you hear at the Pubs that make the game fun)Bottom line, for $25 you can purchase a solid fun game that will scratch that itch for some old school RPG fun. "

Early Access Review
								The story is awful.  I cant understand where to go. You have to stand in the correct places on the map after finding them for the story to continue.  Often times its up a steep mountaintop with no clue of a road.   In the first level everything you built up to gets taken away.  Then there is a troop chasing you so your time to escape is limited and the troop is undefeatable that follows you to each new scenerio.  Other things are...what you would expect to complete in tasks is unfulfilling and a waste of time.  The only thing I like about this game is the battle mode.  But, you dont have all the characters equipment available in towns and often thrown into 3 or 4 battles one after another when you would expect to win.  You have little to nothing to manage with and not much going on.			"

								This game is very unique, concentrating in medieval times, weapons, armour and classes, intead all fantasy. For all turn based lovers this game has a lot of potential but still a lot to improve. Pros: Great weapons & armours, graphics is good, original story.Cons: Move around in combat is not easy, if you are not moving for the kill you should stay put. Skip a turn for one unit, is only avalilable once per battle. And the worst of all, leveling up is extremely hard since the exp gained per battle is average 2 points, when most of the characters (Depends on the class) is 120, 150 to level up. And you have to ditch your party each chapter, what makes even harder to level up.Conclusion: If you are like me, who wants to be a part of this game from early start and is confident that is going to improve, I would defitely recommend buying, however, If you like final version of the games and do not have patience to deal with some bugs and changes (Part ot getting early access) then wait for the final review.

												Seldom has a game captivated me like Legends of Eisenwald has over the past few weeks. It's a unique blend of role-playing and strategy, in a historical medieval setting with supernatural elements. I particularly like the amount of customization and choices you can make. I made three playthroughs, one with each of the characters (Knight, Baroness and Mystic), and each with a different driving force (honor, profit, revenge) and despite following the same general storyline over the same 5 or 6 maps, so many of the details differed that they felt distinctly different. It also made me realize how much I missed on my first playthrough, by not exploring enough, or not paying enough attention to rumors in taverns, etc...Some people seem to think the combat is simplistic and lacks strategy, but I beg to differ. There are so many variables that you can play with that affect the outcome of the battles. Party size, positioning, items, weapons, terrain, whether it's day or night, whether you're inside or outside. Getting good at using all this to your advantage will save you a lot of money on healing. ;)Another issue that people have with this game is the fact that your party and/or money get reduced between the maps. Personally I liked the challenge of each map, figuring out when to do what and how to get strong enough to take on the hardest opponents (or lure them into a forest at night so they couldn't fight on horseback). It also invites you to do side-quests which will yield useful rewards like powerful items, cash or people joining your party.Aside from perhaps the last map, where you return to part of a previously visited map, every map has it's own distinctive feel, which ensures that the game never feels repetitive.In short, I whole-heartedly recommend this game. I have to confess that I was originally put-off by the (in my opinion) relatively high price tag and waited until it was on sale. I now regret this, I would have gladly paid the full price. Especially if you see the amount of effort the devs put in this game and the way they respond to every, even minor, question. To make up for that I bought the Knight's Edition and Season pass despite already owning the first DLC, because I feel such dedication should be supported!			"

Early Access Review
								This is a game with alot of potential. Enjoyable, good story. The changes needed are mostly in cost and management. The xp cost to level is very high, leveling is very slow and after 30 battles you may not even get to level 2 with anyone in your army. Healing is also very expensive, this is a huge detriment to party management. If no cost change would be done then I  would allow healers in your army to heal between battles as well. Currently there is no between battle skill use. If a healer can heal during battle why not in between? Whether it be a limited use between battles or a certain number per day. Lastly on the negative side, you lose all equipment in your inventory and all gold when you leave the starting scenario. You arive in the second scenario with nothign in your inventory and 600 gold. This was bothersome as I had 2000 or so gold and about another 600 gold in eqiupment in my inventory, a fix to this would be excellent. For now be prepared, get the best equipment you can get and put it on your character not in your inventory. Characters do not change appearence other than horse and weapons/shield would be fun if they did. There is no way to customize character looks as well.On the positive side, The combat is tacitical and you have to pay attention to whats coming up and how characters are moving on the battlefield. A small mistake can cost you. The fact that you can equip all characters in your army is very nice, although I would like to see graphic changes as you equip items other that just weapons. This allows you to customize how an army fights and changing a few weapons can have drastic effect. The graphics are very pleasent and easy on the eyes, game play is easily understood and controls are easily dealt with as well. The story is interesting and the game as a whole is engaging. The game has minimal fantasy element and this is not detrimental to the game at all. I would recommend this game for those that want a game you can relax and enjoy with.			"

												LoE is a turn based strategy game with rpg elements set in ""fantasy Germany"". It's a medieval low fantasy world where magic and the supernatural are present but pretty rare and low key compared to a more typical dnd-esque environment. Combat works similar to the older Disciples games where you have front and back lines meant for melee and ranged/support units respectively. The initiative stat determines the order in which the units act. Unlike in Disciples, units in LoE can actually move though options here are limited to attacking the nearest unit or using an ability or potion. There's a good amount of tactical options in terms of how and when you attack (there's a wait command), how you use your abilities,   how you build your squad and such though, imo, gameplay here is not as detailed or engaging as in Expeditions: Conquistador or Battlebrothers for example.  For one terrain plays no role in LoE except in terms of unit positioning. There's no traps, obstacles, ""high ground"", no attacks of opportunity or flanking (except for a specific ""rogue"" unit). There's a few unit types that fight better in difficult terrain and mounted units have to dismount in forests and buildings but that's it and it rarely comes into play. On the strategic level LoE plays similar to King's Bounty. You move around in real time fighting, trading, conquering, training, completing quests, etc. One nice part of LoE compared to Disciples or Expeditions: Conquistador is that each of your soldiers has their own inventory allowing you to customize their loadout with certain restrictions depending on unit type. Your men and women also level up and ""evolve"" into new units with a few branching choices available. You can pick between 3 hero characters representing the usual melee, ranged and support roles. LoE allows you to capture castles and various other locations to earn money over time and you can leave units in castles to be trained and level up on their own. However LoE isn't really a strategy game like Heroes of Might and Magic and like in King's Bounty the world is fairly static in the sense that it generally waits for you to act rather than actively trying to destroy you although there are roaming enemies that will harras you and capture some of the locations. This means that once you have positive gold income you could technically place some units in a castle and just leave the game running for hours while gold and xp accumulate. This makes some of these strategic elements feel tacked on and redundant, like LoE is trying to stradle the line between King's Bounty and HoMM but doesn't quite make it. But in the end it doesn't really hurt the game and there's no actual need to grind this way. Story elements seem to be very much derived from medieval folklore as well as pagan and Christian religions which adds to the game's down to earth, low fantasy feeling. The writing is pretty verbose and there's quite a bit of lore and stories to read in-game which can sometimes contain clues for quest solutions or secret items. Since the writing is so grounded in real life history and myths many fantasy geeks might find it too mundane or boring. Personally I found it charming and a refreshing break from the usual high fantasy stuff but I'm also someone who always reads in-game books and lore and enjoys text in general. Overall while I certainly wish combat had a bit more going for it and the strategic level was either better fleshed out or further streamlined (basically either KB or HoMM style) it's certainly a fun game for fans of turn based tactics. Just keep in mind I said tactics, not strategy.			"

								I started playing this low fantasy game about a month ago, and after considerable time playing I am still thoroughly enjoying it, even though ity is still in Beta!  The graphics are rich, the music is excellent, and the writing is extraordinary.  Very immersive storyline, and I have found the character development is both challenging and rewarding.  This is not an 'action rpg', and the combat does not play like an action rpg.  Successful combat is more dependent on thought-out strategy than hack-and-slash.  Not all games are for all people (I don't like ""mystery search""games), but I would HIGHLY recommend this game for anyone who enjoys good writing, challenge, and a real capture of the flavor of the late medieval period.

												Legends of Eisenwald is a real gem. I see it as a zoomed-in version of Medieval 2, with a great plot line (since Medieval 2 doesnt really.) Or.. like Mount and Blade overland map, with a storyline. It took me a little while to get into it, it might have just been my mood, I wont blame the game... but boy, does it really grab you after a little while. Betrayal, intrigue, lore, equipment, training, strategic battles. The writing and story are FANTASTIC. The lore is deep. Nothing to hate, everything to love. I have about 13 hours in, and Im just scratching the surface... I think there will be many, many more hours for me here. Very original. Get it.Some people have criticized the combat.. I just want to say, I think their wrong. It varies greatly depending on what types of troops you use, which changes the fighting style a lot. Also, I want to say that to me, this game is not all about fighting, its about the story. Sometimes I even use the Fast Fight feature just to get to the next story thread.9/10! .... -1 simply because nothing is perfect. 100% fun level.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is quite unique in what it has to offer. There is a depth to this game that is not initially apparent, I think. By sticking to a well-defined set of rules of limited engagement, the developers have effectively created their own version of tactical chess. Recall in chess, not every piece can move as it might like, but they have very restricted types of movement in how they can attack (a pawn can only move forward, usually one space, but must attack diagonally). This game is similar except any movement is the result of an attack, and not purely done in and of itself. The movement, when it occurs, is well defined and can be anticipated. Having these kinds of limits makes this game distinct from other games like King's Bounty and Eador, Masters of the Broken Realm, which are both great games in their own right. In this respect, I would argue, less is actually more, in terms of the depth this game provides. I really thought Eador was extremely tactical until I played this game, and decided this one had a more ""mature"" type of strategy than the you-can-move 1, 2 or 3 spaces kind of games. I believe the overwhelming reason to buy and play this game is to, in essence, play a new type of low-fantasy tactical chess based upon a 36-hex board. This game has all the tactical depth that chess does given in how it works. It may not be balanced, or fair, or even easy to grasp in terms of what this game really is, but it is a gem in its own right.			"

												This RPG reminds me of the days when games made had real lore and not just fancy hack and slash.  When you actually had to think things through to figure out how to make the best of a quest.  Heck, it takes me back to the early M&M games and I know from what I speak because I was playing these games when they released the Might & Magic series.  I've played them all and many of the first person slashers just for the fun of it.  But there isn't much like this GEM on the market today.If you like to read and puzzle out the meaning of the lore than you will love this game. Regarding the battles they are a lot of fun and very interesting in the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors mode.  I've seen a few people complaining that they know who is going to win when the battle starts...  Wow, really?  In a good RPG the goal is to keep the damage down on your team to the least possible amounts and gain the most experience.  Truly, If you  expected to lose the fight you should have never entered it in the first place.  That said if you have played through the game and not had only one or two seriously wounded team members survive... well you are a better man than I.Folks, this is an RPG the way is was meant to be made.  Test your mind versus how fast you can press a key... And when all else fails... there is always that all knowing god that can help with any question... google!Enjoy!			"

								So far, a few hours in and I am enjoying the game.  I haven't hit any major bugs.Pros:-very good tutorial as part of the main campaign.  -solid foundations for the story (comparable to most games in this genre)-logical game mechanics, especially during battles-quality graphics-excellent camera control-difficulty levels seem to scale very well- game does get tougher as you move on.  Definitely can't rely just on the basic party.-AI enemies in battle performs well-modest amount of side quests-developer communication is AMAZING.  personal answers to almost every forum post, and obvious love for their productCons:-army management/specialization is fairly simplistic-character specialization is through items and a very simple as well-small army and small battlefield (by design).  some could view this as a ""pro"" though.-no easy way to prioritize quests.  some don't update when finished, or provide enough guidance to pursue-levelling is VERY slowOverall:Well worth $10 at this point.  I am enjoying Blackguards, which would fit in this genre pretty well.  Blackguards is well beyond in most facets, but I feel with this game open to Steam Workshop, the game could become incredible.  The developer support is key, but I imagine improvements will be slow for such a small team.  I am happy to have bought it, and definitely imagine playing it even more as I am winding through the last chapter of Blackguards.			"

												 At first, I wasn't too sure about the combat system. It seemed too simplistic (i.e., there weren't going to be enough tactical options). however, I ended up liking it a lot and found the beauty in it's simplicity. It's quite different from any other turn-based strategy game I ever played; sometimes your options are limited but that just has to be taken into account when planning your strategy (the worst thing is when you are forced to knowingly send one of your soldiers into a vicious counter-attack). Unfortunately, you will sometimes have to endure walls of text. And let me be clear I have no problem reading text in my RPGs. When it's well-written, I like it just fine. But some of the many legends in Legend in Eisenwald (usually encountered as rumors in taverns) are… shall we say, needlessly verbose. They just go on and on and on. And while they are usually somewhat interesting and may even play an important part in the main story, I feel that many of them could be cut in half without losing anything substantial. Some other things I wasn't crazy about: *At the end of most chapters, you say goodbye to most, if not all of your soldiers and their gear.. That means all of the units that you worked to build into powerful army will be gone and you'll have to pretty much start over building your army in the next chapter.. leveling up peasants and buying basic equipment. I understand that this probably done for game balance reasons (and in particular, to give you incentive to conquer enemy castles, which allows you to hire additional units)…. nevertheless, its very irritating to lose all your veteran soldiers and their gear, and the game usually gives very weak rationale for this (e.g., someone tells you that a large force will attract too much attention so you can only take two units… But then as soon as you get the next chapter, you'll likely recruit more troops ASAP). I would've preferred if the game was balanced to take more of my units with me… You spend a lot of time rebuilding your army in each chapter, and while that can be fun for awhile, it inevitably feels like busy work.*Moving across some areas in the game can be pretty painful… I constantly experienced misclicking as it's seldom clear where you can and can't go on each area... Lots of twists and turns. It would have been nice if you could double click on a point on the map and have it plot a course to the destination… Instead, you have to actually see the place you want to go to, and since your field of view is so small, you will have to constantly rotate the camera to try to see whatever town or building you're trying to get to. *There were a few instances where enemies respawned. I could understand if they were vampires or something, but no, there in one chapter I remember regular enemies coming back to life and retaking the castle.*There were some instances in the game where my character makes some morally questionable choices that I would not have liked to do… There's perhaps a couple times in the game when you can make a choice, but for the most part your character is going to complete their quest by any means necessary. It's a bit frustrating in a role-playing game when things like this are decided for you… In the final chapter in particular, it seems my character acts based on a decision I made several chapters ago.. The final chapter dragged on a bit as you have to clear a bunch of castles, but I found the battles to all be rather easy (except the final battle which had an insanely powerful enemy). Other than that, I really liked the game overall and would recommend giving it a shot if you want to try something different. The music is fantastic and the combat / character class progression system is simple, yet effective.			"

								Ever wanted an old retro game but cant get past the fossil like graphics and constant silence? Well Legends Of Eiseswald is the game for you, Its easily the best Early Access game on the market so much that if you fixed the very rare minor bugs that exsist you could sell this game for $10, $15 as a finished product. Essentially if what your looking for is a modern day classic RPG this is a must buy. Even then this is a game everyone should try, I never touched those old RPG games, hell I wasnt even born when those games were around and I love this game.However that isnt to say the game is perfect it does have a few trip ups, For starters early on in the game most battle boil down to ""who has the better hit points"" because there isnt much else to do besides attack early on when all you have is fighters, and what thing that infuriates the hell out of me is that you cannot set yourself in a defence position which will turn a few people off.Pro`s-very beautiful game and due to its gameplay dosent require a powerful PC-Authentic classic RPG feel with AAA graphics-Quite a interesting story-Dosent hold your hand-Fair Challenge (however troop planning will effect your chances)-Good old medieval soundtrack-Georgous art style-Skill tree`s-User friendly yet still challenging battles-Quest finding requires attention, this game tells you what to do but expects you to use your brain-WorkshopCons-A little buggy-Lack of Defence stance-Capturing building`s is a little confusing at times-Avatar does not change dependant on armour choice-Throws you in the deep end a little too quickly-Some quests aren`t very clear at all during timesIn conclusion I love LoE its fast enough so im interested and slow enough so I can take some time to plan, and honestly I have no clue why there are so many negative review`s for this game because even if me a 14 year old teenager born in the gaming age of brown corridors I can assure the older generation of gaming still interested in Classic games will LOVE this. 8/10			"

												It's a little unpolished around the edges and can feel clunky at times but overall, it's still a decent tactical game. Moreover, the story has a surprising amount of charm and a decent narrative with unexpected intrigue.			"

												While I would recommend the game overall, there are a few frustrations to be aware of:1)  There doesn't seem to be a way to scroll the map.  VERY annoying to try to get around.2)  Healer type followers are difficult to find.3)  The most annoying factor, for me, has been the frequency of game crashes (roughly every 3 hours) and the inability to send errors/bugs/crash logs.  I don't have an Outlook account, which is required to send crash logs?			"

												I like it. Straight to the point right? Simply put, it's very similar to Heroes of Might and Magic (specifically 6) and Disciples except tone down the Fantasy about 5 notches and put it Medieval Germany. There are extensive upgrade trees for each unit with a very ""figure out where to go"" and ""how to win"" mentality in the game whilst still being very story driven. Graphically, the game is very pretty with a great soundtrack (I love good in-game music) that really works to immerse you in the world. It's definitely a good example of an Early Access game that was released a decent finished product on Steam compared to the garbage island levels of crap EA games that never finish or run out of funding (ie Spacebase DF-9). Of course, there are still some problems with the game but it's most nitpicky stuff that only someone like myself (who is so far up his own♥♥♥♥♥ would actually point out... like equipping items doesn't change your appearance. You know? Stuff like that. Summed up, I really like the game and I can't wait to log some more hours in LoE.Video Gameplay and Opinions:

												I'm only scratching the surface of the 1st chapter, and this review might change as I progress further in the game, but so far I'm really enjoying it. I like the mixture of Germanic setting and low-fantasy: * The story and quests, whilst at times do get a bit confusing (get ready to do a lot of wandering around), are pretty interesting in a ""figure it out by yourself"" kind of way.  * The combat is different to most games, but by no means ""bad"". It's actually pretty good in Dark Souls kinda ""git gud"" way.* But my main issue is that sometimes the descriptions in quest logs aren't really that useful and are written in a (sometimes) convoluted way. But I suspect that's because English isn't the devs' first language, so I guess it's understandable. But, still....*** MINOR SUB-QUEST SPOILER***For example, in one quest early on, you have to find a wealthy merchant who is involved in some grave robbing by a (quest description: watchtower casting a shadow on a rock by a southern gate). Indepth description, right? Well, there are a number of towers and rocks... but no gates. I spent 15min running around looking for it - even went to the south of the main town from which the merchant hails. Eventually the quest triggered (by pure, blind luck) and what they actually meant was the watch tower north of the south-eastern bridge.*** EDIT ***I gave up on the game as it's simply too drawn out. Sorry. But that said. I do feel that the money I spent on it gave me enough fun (mainly due to Germanic legends) to retain my thumbs up recommendation.			"

												This is a little gem in my opinion:I played the predecessor ""Discord Times"" and, except for the difficulty level, liked it very much. Legends of Eisenwald is an improvement in every way and does some things unique (in a very good way):- interesting story in a low fantasty world (prayers instead of magic)- myths told by peasants sometimes actually are optional quests you have to figure out on your own- a great sense of ownership over your small merryband of soldiers- customization (yet sadly not visually) of every unit- interesting ye not too overly complex turn-based combat (with ""auto solve"" option)Don't expect too deep tactics, this is a (great) game for story enthusiasts and explorers!

												I can't say enough good things about Legends of Eisenwald.Aterdux has managed to create, for me, the ultimate medieval atmosphere.  It's what the Middle Ages feels like to you when you're a kid and all you know are the stories about knights and castles, before you learn about all the bad things that happened in history.  Eisenwald is a journey across an idealized medieval landscape, to the sounds of a beautiful score, with the sun lighting your way as it wanders across the sky.  Your quests will take you across a green countryside and into castles, towns, churches, and taverns.  You will listen to rumors, hire men-at-arms and healers, and battle brigands in turn-based tactical combat reminiscent of Heroes of Might and Magic.  I've made it sound overly simplistic, but the truth is that it's not a complicated game.  It's a vacation, a trip into a simpler time and place, and there is a beauty and innocence to the atmosphere that few games could hope to capture.Aterdux themselves are a wonderful team, and Alex is the friendliest project lead I've ever met.  He's always taken time out to answer any question I've had and to indulge my curiosity, both as a journalist and an Eisenwald fan.  This is a developer worth supporting, and a pleasant journey you owe it to yourself to experience.			"

Early Access Review
								I liked the idea of this game and think the developers could take the original base model that they have and improve it. Some of the things I don't care for are:1. You can't just move a characted into a defensive battlefield position, he either attacks or skips.2. You have to pay for certain party members but you are expected to upgrade them. It is difficult to run an efficient party if you are trying to build up players but need to manage their time in the party. let me fall in love with my characters over time rather than shuffling them through, or else I don't become attached to them nor do I care when they die.3. There are many glitches and moving around the map is a real bore.			"

												It took me 90 hours to do the first playthrough, though I was not hurrying so I certainly got my money's worth already - and I want to replay with another char and going down a different line.ProsI like the settingGood grahics and musicThe combat sytem. Soldiers in effect have a ZOC, so you can't rush past a heavy infantryman to bash a squishy priest at the back. Some don't like that but it seems more 'real' to meGood immersive storyI enjoyed building up my little army and trying to max out their kit.Customer support from Alexander is when I got stuck (see 1st 'con' below) was fantasticConsLargely due to inadequate tutorial or else I wasn't paying enough attention, I found some objectives v. hard to find but it became a lot easier when I learned to click on the magnifying glass icon on many quests which showed where to go. Pathing sometimes unnecessarily hard - quite a bit of random clicking needed sometimes to get through a  forest for example. This is mostly why the stealth chapter is quite annoying, but at least it's quite short.Special weapon attributes not/not well explained. I still don't know what a silver weapon does and I had to learn that blessed weapons were needed to kill ghosts. Also, when I had a choice of path for upgrade to a soldier, I learned to save in advance and then upgrade 1 way then repeat using other path so I could make the better choice - tho' this is a minor irritant only.Overall I would thoroughly recommend this to anyone who likes this genre and to others wanting to try something new. A great achievement by such a small team and excellent VFM			"

Early Access Review
								So, what are my thoughts on this game? Well, it's definitely good. But that's from a fan's point of view, especially considering I played their old game; Discord Times, and loved that just as much. So from an analytical view of the game, what do I think?GameplayThe gameplay is quite interesting. You have troops you can hire for gold, but they don't cost much due to castle support. This essentially tells you how many troops you can support without paying them. Then you have the mercs. Troops you can hire for a bit more gold, but you have to pay them per day to keep them around. Expensive, but they can be high level units or simple peasants, so you get what you pay for with them.- EquipmentEquipment is definitely interesting, but you should know the scale of things. The better it is, the more gold it costs. However, the market you get them at does have an effect. Purchasing equipment at a merchant pier will cost you loads more gold than if you purchase it at a rural market, but this also affects the quality of the items. Merchant piers cost a ton for their items, but their often high quality, and really powerful in your effort for domination while rural markets aren't as costly, but the quality is lower too. However, it's not so low as to completely dismiss it, for a fight can be won with a simple pitchfork, if the odds are close.- UnitsTalking about equipment and such and yet not covering the units? What kind of monster am I? The units are simple and basic at first glance. Recruits, hunters, female healers (I've forgotten their names) and religious men. That about covers it. However, each unit can upgrade a number of times. Recruits can become veteran pikemen or infantry sargents, hunters can become hard hitting crossbowmen or incredibly nasty sargent archers, and the religious lot can become incredibly useful at healing or buffing your other units, if you choose to send them down that route. Each unit can be manipulated and upgrades to your desire. I nearly forgot the nobleman however. He's the unit that you want to upgrade for knights, paladins and other very nasty units. However, due to being noble blood, he costs an utter fortune for healing, and upgrading him takes a fair while, and a lot of effort.- StoryI can't really say much about it, other than it's quite good, and each action that happens in the storyline, as well as for your character itself makes sense. I won't spoil any of the storyline since it's quite good, but I will tell you this much: Your actions define this story. It's not a simple walk in a park down a narrow hallway, you have options. Be sure to pick what you think is right.Overall scoresGameplay: 8/10 - Could definitely be improved in some areas, but at face value, it's definitely good.Visuals: 7/10 - The game looks quite pretty but I do notice some performance issues in heavy forest. Sound: 9/10 - This is truly brilliant music in my opinion. The opening music is fabulous and the sound effects fit in with every swing of a sword. Small improvements could be made to where each sound happens but other than that, spot on.Story: ?/10 - It's a really good storyline, with multiple branching areas and different ways you can do things. It's truly brilliant.Final score: 8.5/10 - Due to this still being an early access game, there will be errors and issues abound. I've run into several crashes over the course of the development, and it's annoyed me every single time. But talking with the developers and their view for this game, they are definitely working on it. I hope this turns out to be a brilliant game on release!			"

Early Access Review
								Welcome to a fresh take on an old formula. Much of the strategy takes place before a battle ever begins. Who gets which item, which row to place your units in, and who goes on the flank. Never before has initiative been so important. Support units are no longer a bonus, they are a real strategic necessity. Notice how every game of M&M or King's Bounty turns into a combat grind that keeps you from finishing the game? You will not get that here. Combat is quick, and you no longer spend half the battle jockeying for position. I don't know about you, but that combat fatigue eventually wore me down, and I always eventually found my desire to play the game diminish as the thought of another half hour battle almost had me in tears. Enjoy strategy and combat that does not dominate the game. Here you get a well written story, with many hard choices and a real touch of human nature where good and evil are not always easy to distinguish. The developers care about this game to a degree which sets them apart from most other games. Legends of Eisenwald is a wonderful game, with a compelling story no strategy fan should overlook.			"

												As Shakespear once said: All that glisters is not gold. If this is true we can assume that not all gold glitters. Well, this game could be gold, but it doesn't glitter. It doesn't glitter at allThere are two kinds of indie developers: the ones aware of their low budget, who can't afford for a good modern graphic and choose style over technology, and the ones who try to realize a cool, standard 3d graphic and come out with something that look old and bad.This game fall into the second scenario. Is this a problem? Yes. Is this a deal breaker? Not necessarily.With some games you play and have fun for a hour, then they get old. Here if you don't give up during the first hour, you will have fun.You have to deal with many flaws, everything is pretty clunky. You have to click on a precise spot of an item picture to actually select it, you have to experiment with clicks on the map to understand where you can go and where you can not, and other stuff like this, but everything works in the end, and it is fun!Nice tactical gameplay, good story, pleasing medieval setting.Legends of Eisenwald isn't a charming game. It is not that good in the outside, but it is good in the inside, and if you like the genre, you will enjoy this game. Conclusions:Nothing feels really polished, but everything is good in its core, so if you'll put up with some flaws, you will enjoy a beautiful game.			"

Posted: July 15, 2015
												Just finished the game. Totally loved it. Here's a little summary.The game is a tactical RPG. The story in short is basically you're the son/daughter of a Count on a trip to visit a friend of your father's. After playing the tutorial map, bad things happen and you set on a quest of vengeance/discovery. The flow of the game is similar to Heroes of Might and Magic with a Disciples combat style, the flow goes that you play several isolated maps (scenarios) connecting the story like in HoMM. Also like in HoMM, when you finish a map, you leave all or most of your accumulated troops/money/equipment behind and start the next map with your main character (more experienced) and little else.Combat can get a bit to get used to. Many times you'll be thinking like it's an RPG and ask 'why can't I do this, doesn't make sense!', until you realize combat is more like chess. In chess you don't ask ""why can the Queen move 7 spaces at once and the King only 1? It doesn't make sense!', it's just the rules of the game, and when you realize the tactical combat is a mini-chess match, it all clicks. When you get a new combat screen, see (your and your enemy's) troops composition, their position and combat order, you need to figure out a way to win the battle, and to do so in an efficient way. One of the challenges of the game is the 'war of attrition', as resources are many times restricted, winning 'pyrrhic battles' will soon leave you broke and unable to afford healing your troops before the next battle, so you have to learn to find the efficient way to win.The game has plenty of choices and consequences. Do you want to betray this guy for a quick solution or take longer and help him? There may or may not be consequences to every action, and those consequences may or may not be immediate (some things happen as a result of a decision you made 4 maps ago). It's more for flavor though, you won't ""lose"" the game if you made the 'wrong' choice (since really there is no right or wrong), but it's nice to see things reflecting choices you had already forgotten you made.There isn't much for character customization, remember this is NOT an RPG even though it resembles one. You can be one of 3 classes, the 'skill tree' is very shallow, and they all share 2 of the 3 branches, so only one branch is class specific, and it only has some 5 or 6 nodes total.You can have up to 11 additions to your group for a max total of 12, these range from infantry guys (which can be specialized as defensive, offensive, pikemen), noblemen (which can be specialized as mounted knights or double-wielding duelists), ranged guys (which can be specialized into double-shooting archers or armor piercing crossbowmen), healers (which can be specialized into pure healers or witches) and finally religious men (which can be specialized into pure buffers or holy warriors). Don't get too attached to them as most if not all of them will be gone after each map. Your companions are basically chess pieces.It's also moddable, there are already some user created maps out there that I haven't tried. I wonder if users can also create full campaigns or just scenarios, hope so! If not, the wait for me may be too long for a sequel.Totally recommended!			"

Posted: July 20, 2016
												I'm hooked on this game, thoroughly. The AAA titles I picked up during the summer sale have all taken a backseat to this Indie gig.Every map is its own intriguing story, packed with tons of lore and legends. Exploring is fun and compelling. The story is so well written that reading dialogue boxes never becomes tedious, and the occasional bug is easily forgiven. All this, combined with a period soundtrack make this a seriously immersive late medieval experience. Anyone interested in this period in German history will be hooked by the atmosphere alone.At first, the tactical battles seem restrictive and underwhelming. If you stick with it, however, you will soon realize that the most strategic elements of the combat occur before you ever arrive on the battlefield. How you outfit your troops is an important aspect of combat, making the rpg aspect that much more meaningful. Money is hard to come by early on in each map, which leads to some agonizing decisions when it comes to hiring, healing, and purchasing gear for your men. Choose your fights, and your purchases wisely. Eventually, you will capture enough towns and castles to recruit and equip the superior fighting force in the land; then you'll lose it all and start the next map from scratch. This ebb and flow makes the game enjoyable and challenging. The game is way more than the sum of its parts. Highly recommended. "

												The first word I would use to describe this game is ""solid"", it might not really shine anywhere, graphics and sound are both good enough, the story and writing is pretty good (also there's lots of it), it's stable and relatively bug-free as far as I can tell. The combat system is new to me (possibly similar to disciples 2 or discord times but I haven't played any of those games) though similar to HoMM but different in a good way. Instead of collecting stacks of units which quickly becomes a chore each unit represents only one man, you are limited to having an army of at the most 12 men, but more frequently 6-9 which means every man is important. I would say it's just enough options to feel like I have a choice yet not so much that it would be overwhelming to keep everything in mind. The character development is really slow, I've seen it described as ""glacial"" but it fits the game, I wouldn't say it's a bad thing (though I must say I liked the short 3x exp period right after launch). You can certainly do a lot worse for this price (whatever it is, think it was around €28 when I got it). When you're done with the main story there are scenarios and a scenario editor, not to mention the main story can be played with 3 different classes for the main character, there's plenty of value in here.

												18 Hours in and still got most of this game to go. I am truly addicted to it at the minute. No issues getting it to work, I like the graphic style very nice and still runs smooth on slightly older machines.Simple but tactical combat that has kept me intrigued, with plenty of items and weapons.Meaningful progression of my troops takes some time, which makes me really value their lives and I feel adds more immersion.If you are looking for a medieval world to fully submerse yourself into, this is it. Beautiful artwork and music really helps create the world.Small elements of fantasy really add to this game, as anyone who studies history will know, many people were very superstitious during this period. Legends, myths, magic and real history were often intertwined in the peoples pyche.In summary, a great game from a small committed studio. Help them out and get this game. You WILL NOT regret it!

Wouldn't mind a larger area for battles, any melee characters in back rows can get trapped and forced to not do much on their turn, but that's why you fill those rows with ranged and support right?Great writing, great setting/art/music/atmosphere, good graphics, fun gameplay and a surprising amount of content.Definitely satisfied with my purchase. 8.5/10			"

Storyline in Legends of Eisenwald is very mature .What I like most  is I was 20h into the game and I thought it is almost over but some twist in story happend and here I go another 20h later. You can not predict what is going to happend.Graphics are very good much better that any other titles like Disciples or Heros.The games have few endings so read all what is happening because I end up wuth ending I did not really want, I guess I missed something along the line.

												I can't recommend this game at this time.  Advancement is stupid slow, you feel like you're not getting anywhere.  On the Lahnstein map the enemies just kept spawning no matter how many you kill, and healing is a nightmare thing you have to do after just about every battle or you're screwed. On top of that, I finally, after several hours of playing, get to the second map.  Guess what?  All my loyal friends, all my gold, everything except what my character was carrying on his person just disappeared and I had to start building a new band of merry men from untalented dimwits all over again.  So I enter the Alps map with almost 3K gold, and when I get to the other side of the pass I have like 355 or so.  Barely enough to heal.  So apparently the way this game challenges the player is it inexplicably takes everything you worked for away now and then.  This has the potential to be a great game, but with that monstrous jackover in mind, I don't think it was worth the money I paid for it during the Halloween sale. Keep working, devs, but don't screw over your player characters to make the game challenging.  Just make the game challening.			"

												A member of the Steamified community was so enamored with Legends of Eisenwald that they firmly requested that we run a feature of the game on our site. They had completed the game numerous times and couldn’t get enough of it. It had been a game that I had personally considered prior to the request but as a title that was released prior to our launch but not meeting our 2014 or earlier Steamified Revisits period was a game that I had personally placed on the backburner. However, I can honestly tell you that I am thankful for their recommendation.One of the first things that I want to say about games such as this one is that it is one that I can leave playing in the background and can dedicate short periods of play to it at a time. There are a lot of games that you really have to be dedicated to playing rather than having paused for periods of time. As a lone hand at Steamified I don’t often get to play games through to completion before having to make their feature. In some ways my nutshells are a first impressions plus (several hours of gameplay rather than completion) and so I feel a bit like a full time employee who would like to get through a massive list of games when its not a reality unlike say someone who works for a publisher and is paid full time to play new release games through to completion – sometimes multiple times – before writing on games. Titles such as Legends of Eisenwald are perfect for me. I can write and work around playing them. Games that constantly need attention (e.g. multiplayer games) are at a disadvantage in my life right now.But that means that the content that I need to play needs to be engaging. I need something that I can feel a part of albeit for a brief period. This game was perfect in that regard. I found myself involved in its world immediately. This is a game that immediately pulls you in and grabs you. The manner in which the story is told, the narrative, the characters backgrounds and the status of the world are all conveyed in a thorough manner. I had no trouble in jumping in and out of the game at any point throughout the first six hours of the game.This isn’t necessarily a game that you’re going to be expecting great graphics and sound from yet everything is at a level that I can appreciate. It’s more so the gameplay and the turn-based combat that needs to be top notch and it is. I thoroughly enjoyed the various strategies that I employed and tinkered with throughout the early game. The story telling was also exceptional. Obviously people are going to make comparisons to the Might and Magic franchise and the King’s Bounty games and I believe that the story is stronger than both. The setting being the Middle Ages and European history is a strong point of differentiation for this game and one that it conveys to the player extremely well.Legends of Eisenwald deserves your attention if you have yet to play it and are a fan of the genre. It represents solid value for money given the amount of work that has gone into every aspect of the game.For more reviews and our popular giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com.  "

												Pros:A-Simple Tactical turn based game with trailed storytelling elements, very easy to graspB-It is a combination of elements from other games, Heroes of Might and Magic, Crusaders, King's Bounty, Medevil and with its own look and feel. As if someone played all of those and plucked certain aspects to create the best result.C-Battle System is simple and direct D-Equiping and Leveling of characters with direct task puzzle solving questsE-Wonderful screen shots and artwork, Night and Day timeframes.Cons:A-This game can use a vast upgrade and more action packed oriented screens and flash action. This makes the combat stiff and one view point instead of various action sequences that make you part of the action like an Xcom 2. TolerableB-Saves have to be specific and like HOM&M equipping army members do not carry over. Each scenario resetsC-Mercenaries can drain your funds so quickly that your limited in quantity and time.D-No voice storytelling can tire you with a lot of reading. You can miss details if you skip and it hurts its dramatic storytelling deliveries. However, a great game to inspire reading.Final Take: I would do three things. 1. Get it on sale 2. See Videos of gameplay in workshop to get a full feel if its for you3. If you don't like classic role playing then this is probably not for you. Overall alot to like and I can see if they upgrade the engine and add more depth in storytelling, flashes, and action this game expanding on its humble beginnings.LoE 2 if ever made will have a lot of upgrades to build on. It is a nice game for your collection if you love the combination of games I mentioned above. It will challenge you and once familiar with the game mechanics keep you invested.My grade 3 of 5 stars			"

												I came to this game early on, and I was immediately pleased. The graphics are quite crisp and clean, the gameplay fresh. Ive played MANY games of this type, and this one is something special. The devs are always willing to listen to criticism, which is a breath of fresh air, especially for games like this. The story is deep, and engrossing. The combat, though not as easy to *grind*, as its not as useful as in other games, is helped by the auto-battle option. Be warned though, if you use this option for *boss battles*, you are most likely gonna lose unless youve done everything else in the level. HIGHLY recommended!			"

												This game is quite challenging despite its simplicity.  I enjoyed the campaign very much.  If you're into turn based RPG, I suggest this game.  The economy is minimal and a little off-beat, The battle mechanics are easy to understand.  Movement on the map is in real time with AI.  The game may not seem to be as robust in features or other large budgest TB-RPG, but it is just as satisfying.  Once start playing you'll be sucked into it and possibly scouring Youtube for answers.			"

												Took me 60 hrs to finish the game (with the knight on normal difficulty), what a great time. Getting involved into a sofisticatedly written story with many turnarounds, lots of reading of (sometimes hilarious) dialogs, finding clues in questlog, saves and loads, and search for walkthrough :). All of it is fun for ""slow gamers"" that enjoy beliaveble late middle-age atmosphere, chatting with outstandingly deep characters, unique style battles where every detail matters.After some time I gave up trying to figure up everything myself, running all over the map again and again, searching the right person at the right place at the right moment to trigger the right event. Luckilly, after some effort I found an excellent  walkthrough [www.playground.ru] translated to english. Yes, it can spoil the enjoyment from the game if you do not put any afford to it, but I found it too suffering without looking to the walkthrough at all. Also, you can speed up travelling around the map up to 4x, but I would need like 10x. The game is somewhat linear but it has three possible endings. I do not plan to replay it (but mystic on hard difficulty could be a real challenge) but when DLC are on sale I will go for them. I bought the game for 7 euro on winter sale, totally worth it. Also the music is great and I will always remember the fun I had when I met a group of wanderers going to visit Charles University in Prague (my university :).			"

												**MINOR SPOILERS***This game really grew on me after I reached the third act. At first I found the game charming but flawed, I loved the setting, the writing and the aesthetics but found gameplay lacking, particularly the combat. This all changes as the game progesses to the third act, the combat turns from an imbalanced grindable seemingly simplistic system to a beautiful puzzle with a satisfying level of strategic depth and challenge.Do not allow yourself to be put off by the first two acts, the fist one is a tutorial obviously so it's expectedly simple, the second is a showcase for the unit types and item customization which make up your strategic avenues in the game, and thus it allows grinding.You will lose everything except what your main hero has equipped on progression to the third act except for at least one possible artifact, this includes companions. This has caused controversy because some people invest a lot into building up in the second act. Of course this is by design, the second act like I said is a showcase where you can test drive different unit and weapon comps, unfortunately this is not adequetly communicated leading to a somewhat rude awakening for some people. Don't get too invested, the game truly starts in act three.			"

												First and foremost, recommending this game.Pros:1. co-existence of variety and depth in combat mechanics; for example, weapon type diversification, unlike the almost purely visual differences in most other RPGs, carry significant inherent differences that makes weapon type choice a strategic decision; a multitude of functionally distinct units, troop count limitation and intentionally confining combat map mean that homogeneous unit composition will be countered hard, thereby forcing the player to build for complementing roles rather than legions of identical units.2. Windy yet convincing plot, which tie with complex characters.  Warrior potential final boss nicknamed executioner? sacrificed an arm and risked life for love. Devout monk ridding the world of supernatural, malignant entities? shady past. Corrupt head of the knightly order? Treasures fellowship, vocally and actively supporting the protagonist who is likely subject to anathema 3. By layman's (mine) standards, highly authentic reenactment of medieval thoughts, beliefs, customs and trends (goes into a con later)4. literally epic (purple text and expectedly powerful) loot for warrior, filling helmet, body and weapon slots (the big 3) by mid-game, with potentially 2 optional yet extraordinarily difficult encounters to test your mettle, resolve and tact.5. free-rein editor to carve out your own designed scenarios----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cons might take a couple dozen hours to realize, but by that point there's no coming back1. lose virtually all companions when progressing towards all but the final scenario2. on all difficulties other than easy, upgrading unit classes take a long time, especially if your unit is the high power, high experience requirement type (cough, noble)3. poor transitional optimization; when triggering dialogue, buying/selling an item, or exiting a shop, the wait time seems a bit too long4. stringent location requirement for triggering events5. not recommended if you are Jewish and sensitive about it (as employee of an accounting firm, I borderline feared for job security while reading some of the lines); while this is part of the reenactment and a very accurate one, I don't see this bit has to be mentioned.6. excessive randomization in shop content, forcing me to scour the map for suitable companion equipment			"

												An absolutely spectacular game.It's somewhere between King's Bounty, Heroes of Might and Magic and a story based rpg. Basics are that you move a group of troops around (some melee, some ranged and a few support) and fight other troops to gain gold and xp for your army.The troops are individual fighters and you will have (including your hero) around 5 to 7 most of the time. The strength of your army does not come from having a horde (thousands of the monster X like in HoMM) but rather from recruiting a select few and leveling them up (choosing permanent sub-classes) and giving them good gear (that can have a huge impact on the individual fighting capabilities of each troop.The game is heavy on story and rpg-elements (optional quests) that press the game onwards, so expect to read about interesting things happening in the world and make choices that affect the flow of the story based on what you read. All the story elements and rumours (from inns) also hint at interesting things that may or may not be actual hidden treasures and bonus elements/fights on the maps you are on (or will get to), which makes paying attention to the stories you encount a joy. Often some strange rumour will lead to you finding something fun hidden on a mountain or in a forest somewhere if you visit at just the right time of day and with the right things in your pockets :)Best of all is the way the developers reimagined the fights. They have the following rules for the fights:1) There is no action for moving a troop -- it has to be part of another action2) All troops MUST do an action every round. For most this means you HAVE to attack.3) All melee attacks MUST be at the troop nearest you. So take this into account before you move your melee off to one side exposing your flank.It makes for interesting fights that don't just rely on the computer doing stupid things (like in HoMM) while you defend and kite.The only issue I have encountered so far is that when recruiting you cannot see the upgrade tree (the classes a troop can develop into), so you do a bit of save scumming to circumvent this interface problem.I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who likes a good story mixed with interesting tactical fighting.

												This is one of many cases when I regret that Steam reviews can only be positive or negative, and not neutral.There are aspects of this game I like: The graphics are nice, so is the music until it is repeated once too often, and a lot of thought went into the quest plots.On the other hand, there is a lot I do not like: Quests require you to read lots of long dialogues, without voice acting (should be standard in a modern RPG!). Quest objectives are often described vaguely, which makes you wonder what to do, wandering around the land until you enter a village you visited before and encounter a merchant who just recently appeared (because he was artificially unlocked by the quest progression) who can sell you an item that solves your problem... that is irritating, especially as in this game, lost time costs you a lot of money, because you have to pay your companions regularly.I do not like that your tactical choices in combat are so limited. There is an arbitrary rule that you HAVE to attack if you can, and as a melee fighter you can only attack the enemies standing closest to you - more than once I was forced to attack a heavily armoured opponent with an almost dead peasant, which was a kind of a suicide attack; meanwhile, my healthy and well-equipped main character stood two tiles away, but could not intervene because a mediocre henchman stood next to him and was the only valid target. This example should make it clear that the strict limitation of tactical decisions makes it impossible to develope actual strategies, and as enemy groups often display the same battle formation over and over, the fights become repetitive quite quickly.I do not like that you cannot see equipped items on your character or the NPCs, only in their respective inventories. This takes a lot away from the immersion, as your choices for armour and amulets do not have a visible impact on the world, just on the stats. My character in particular kept his looks identical through the whole process of levelling up, even though I changed his armour three times.I admit that I did not play the whole game. But up to now, everytime I entered a new chapter, my whole army was disbanded and their special weapons and trinkets lost, as I had to begin the new chapter alone and only with what I carried on my body. This felt very frustrating, as I invested a lot of care into the hiring, levelling and equipping of my soldiers. When the game made them simply disappear with all their gear, those efforts and every imaginary bond I could have had with my named NPCs who fought beside me through heated battles - just became pointless in a second.For me personally, the negative aspects outweigh the positive ones slightly, and I give this game a 4/10.

												This game got me hooked right from the Tuturial. Im a sucker for maps full of details and things to explore,turned base strategy, Roleplaying games with character develoment and aquiring of better gear and also a good story and good Quests.LoE delivers on all of those and even brings in a small part of finance management,as i found out the hard way after hiring two mercenaries that became quite expensive.This game is basically a more quest and Story oriented version of Kings Bounty or HoMM. Though where KB and HoMM focus more on resource gathering and large Armies, LoE chooses to go with small Squads and quality over quantity. The peons you hired may lack on punch and Hitpoints at the beginning, but after gainign some XP and leveling them up (and all of those, including your character have talent tree( not big ones..but they do)) they behcome quite adept and you will miss them when you move on to a different map and you havbe to leave them behind.The maps reward exploring and listen to rumors and tales in bars or cities...though there are a lot of tales and stories lore related to the LoE Universe which are not necessary to read to continue the main story or quests, but they are well written and help you immerse more easily. And a lot of those stories and the persons decribed in them are story related and you eventually meet them. The combat system is aturned based system on small hexagon battlefields. Here the game lacks a bit in depth. Im in Chaopter 3 now and all the battle fields are just flat boards. No obstaclkles, cover or objects to interact. Some units learn sepcial attacks when they level up, but mostly its just auto attack. Some situations are a bit unfair e.g. when you besiege an castle or watchtower, you as attacker will start the battle with a health debuff, which can be quite big. And when one or two units are shot down by cross bow units before you can even make a move makes you want to chocke your mouse. But normally you can get past those situations hiring more units (even cheap ones can make a difference. They may die with one hit, but they draw fire so your regualr units can pop a potion) and using different strategies.So the battles are ok ish and another thing is that the game crashes rather often..and in random situations. But at least it creates alot of autosaves so you can pick up where you started very easily. And i noticed that the gfx and the gameflow get somehat choppy stuttery as the game progresses. Having an I7, A 1070GTX and 16 GB of RAM...this should not happen.But those are all minor things nothing is game or enjoyment breaking.All in all this game is full great ideas and keeps you busy for a long time. I really have a great time with it and decided to write a review..which i normally dont do. Both thumbs up. "

								This is shaping up to be a pretty awesome game. It is definitely old school in its design. The combat system is very simple, yet requires some tactics. There is plenty to like for fantasy gamers and RPG fans. I appreciate the fact the dev team have put effort into a story line, which plenty of games lack.It is in the development stage and there are a few bugs here and there but that is to be expected. Only disappointing thing was when I realised the full game hadn't been released yet but it means I have something to look forward to.Definitely worth a look into.  "

								If you're into medieval strategy RPG games that are set in reality more than fantasy, especially in the area of art design, then this may be a game you'd like.  It's fairly heavy on unit customization and RPG elements.  Unlike games in the same genre like HoMM, you can hand your footman an axe and he'll use an axe, a spear and he'll use that.  The units level in the typical fashion as other games, gaining more power, but you can customize their gear, and thus their role and fighting style along the way.  All in all, a fun little strategy RPG that definitely stands out as being unique in a crowded genre.			"

At the start of the main scenario, you pick your character among several classes. Character customization doesn't really exist and it doesn't seem like there's many customization options at all. Kinda falls flat on how the epic porportion that the SRPG was going for but I will likely play this game to completion. Which says a lot.Would recommend to most SRPG fans. Would like a sequel?			"

												One of the best games I ever played. I got in on humble-bundle and I am greatly satisfied with it. Pros and cons:Pros: Very nice and cool graphics, medieval styleInteresting Lore, tales and game story full of adventure and plenty of choices to go throughCool mini-game battlesCool mini-game style character's upgrades and equipmentThe rgp style is great on this game, it reminded me of my first time playing pokemon Gold as a kid, with the excitement to explore every corner and aspect of the gameHiring many different characters with unique upgrades really adds to the Gotta Catch 'em All pokemon-feeling :DCons: Feels a lot like a mini game, battles are very punny and that turn-based style really makes them feel even more smaller Various minor bugs or glitches throughout the gameplay, and minor crashes, but still not THAT bad to render it unplayableThe worst CON is that every time chapter changes you lose most (if not all) of your characters, ALL your money, and of course all the castle support :( #feelsbatman :(It also lacks variety in character appearences, most sprites are recycled throughout the game. It would definetly be better with a little variation :PIt also lacks vocal narration and human speech. I mean that it would be great if they hired some actors to read some (if not all) of the speech bubbles and stories.Overall I give it a 9/10 as it made me feel great playing it. When I got this game installed I played 20 hours non-stop, skipped even night-sleeping xD "

												What a great game!If you like strategy games with great story, turn-based combat and RPG elements, you can't go wrong with bying this one.  I picked it up on a sale, but it's more than worthy it's full price.  It can be challenging at the moments, but never frustrating, especially once you learn the way the combat works (it was first time I played a game that had combat system like this one).  It keeped me pinned to the computer.  I bought Fallout 4 while I was playing this (it was on a great sale in the local shop), and I've been waiting to get my hands on Fallout 4 for ages.  I didn't touch it till I finish this one.Everything is good about it - even if what you look from a game is good graphics and soundtrack, you won't be disappointed.  I normally turn music off in many games, since I find it distracting - in this one it never occured to me.  The lenght of the game is worth the money - many side quests are available.  But on top of it, there are three possible endings to the game, and three different starting characters, so it can be relplayed for different experience.  That's the main campaign - there are three scenarios that come with the game and I believe there's heaps of mods too.I'd be hard pressed if I had to pick up a really weak spot for it.  The only issues I had was that a couple of times the save game didn't work, but that's like 2 out of 100 (I'm compulsive game saver sometimes) and I was able just to load previous autosave without losing much progress.I could write more praises about it, but I believe I already made it clear how much I enjoy it.  I definitely recommend it.			"

												I simply like this game. The music, the atmosphere... I simply love it. Right, my hero Knight is a bit of an jerk... Guess that fits in the medieval way of thinking. But what I like most is the amount of time and effort what the developers put in this game. It is so gorgeous!Is there anything not to like? Peasants are a waste of coin. They suck in combat and cannot be upgraded. And I'm not that far in the campain, but I feel lonely. Others have armies walking around and I'm just me with my few not so loyal mercs. Would be nice not to have to run across the map all the time hunting down beggars and taking back my towns.			"

												Got it as part of a Humble Bundle.Fun game with a pretty awesome concept. It's got a good story so far and I'm hooked. The gameplay is challenging but not overly complicated. At the start of the main scenario, you pick your character among several classes. Character customization doesn't really exist and it doesn't seem like there's many customization options at all. Kinda falls flat on how the epic porportion that the SRPG was going for but I will likely play this game to completion. Which says a lot.Would recommend to most SRPG fans. Would like a sequel?			"

Early Access Review
								Hi, I am a diehard HoMM V and VI fan, even though I am not very good at them, LOL!Regardless, I purchased this game to take a break from Homm and here is my review so far.Please remember, this game is early access.PROS:Beautiful game - This is a beautiful game and the graphics IMHO are better than any I have seen so far in these types of game.Beautiful Musical Sound Track - It has a nice Celtic sound to it.A more serious medieval times type of game as opposed to extreme fantasy games - IMHO this was a refreshing change of pace.Combat - It is very interesting and exciting, and seems very tacticalTons of potential - You can tell right away this game has a good solid foundation and if the Devs can keep up the development, this game could dominate the genre.CONS:Presentation - I really hate to pick on the Devs as it seems they were more concerned with providing a solid early access game as opposed to ""flash and dash"", thus I do not want to penalize them for being great devs, but poor marketers.Especially, when the opposite is the norm these days much to the chagrin of players.Thus, I say this only because I feel Legends of Eisenwald is one of those few games that deserves a good presentaton via marketing and game presentation itself.As a result, I feel the Devs need to add some flash and dash into the presentation of this game not only from a marketing perspective, but more so, in the way the story and dialog is presented as well as audio sound effects.For example, there are no sound effects as you travel across the map, and that really takes away from the immersion.It sounds trivial but, just having crunching sounds, i.e. feet on gravel, wind, birds, rain etc would help.Also, the dialog boxes that present interaction between characters are very bland....I know this is early access, but IMHO makes a bland first impression the game does not deserve.As a result, the dialog interface needs to be done in a more interesting way from both appearance, audio, and content perspectives.In conclusion, although I cites the above cons, I do feel they exist because the Devs tried to do the right thing by presenting a solid game experience first, and worry about interface eye candy later, at least I hope so.Regardless, this game deserves such eye candy to be implemented asap, as it is a good game that deserves such polish.Hopefully, the lack of such eye candy will not hurt its early access sales.I purchased this game because i see great potential to take over the genre once the game is finished and out of early access, and thought $19 was a good price, as I can see the price going up upon release.

A Turn Based Medieval Strategy RPG

+ Visually the game looks fantastic. I was especially surprised at how detailed the overworld map, and the great looking battle environments. + The combat system is fairly basic, but I found it to be very satisfying. You basically take turns attacking on a grid. There's some strategy in choosing which enemy you will take down first, or what abilities to use but nothing too complex which for me was a good thing.+ The medieval rpg elements are great. I really felt emersed in the lore, and felt like the quests were quite interesting and engaging.+ The User Interface is great and easy to navigate, which especially comes in handy when equipping items to your party, hiring new members, or buying things from a shop. - No voice acting. This is more of a personal note, but there's a ton of dialogue in the game that you must read through. It would have been nice if at least some parts were voice acted.- When inside villages / castles / etc. you only see a rather boring still image of the interior. I feel like the developers should have created a 3D lively environment to represent the interior of each place you visit.			"

								Turn based strategy, where you can customize the equipment on every character in your party, and they also gain experience and level up.Currently, the main campaign consists of 3 maps (there seem to be more in Russian, but they haven't been translated yet), and there are 2 other single map mini-campaigns available.All are very enjoyable, and looking forward to the rest of the game being released in english!

It is also much richer than expected: better graphics, quite a good story and flavor text, much love and hard work is to be found everywhere in the game. Alsmost no bugs and not the best performing grpahic engine, but no problem on 1440p.If you like good strategy, turn based fights, RPG features and a nice medieval story you should really get the game :)			"

												LoE is an rpg/strategy game in the vein of ""King's Bounty"" or ""Heroes of MM"".  You explore maps with a single party, avoiding powerful enemies while picking off weaker ones.  Your main character levels up, and any characters you have level up as well. This takes place in a low-fantasy setting. You'll run into some creatures here and there, but there are no dragons or anything like that. I was on the fence about recommending the game, because as fun as it is, there are a lot of frustrations as well.  Good:Graphics, story, combat gameplay, gear/upgrades, sound.Bad: Heal mechanic, exp gain is slow, quests can be obtuse (either the quest is not well explained, or the triggers can take a long time to find). All-in-all, it's addictive, and mostly fun, but the frustrations that are present seem largely unecessary.			"

												Great plot, many details, complicated quests, non-linear endings - game is very good. It has Heroes 3 vibe but characters and army much more managable and quests are more interesting. Still most of the quests are hidden behind rumors and you must pay attention to exact words in your journal. Maybe one thing I want to change in this game - combat phase. I think it will be better with ability for units to move on the field freely, like in Heroes 3 battle. And definitely bigger field needed too. Still battle phase is good.  About bugs - two game crushes per 30hours is perfectly ok. Game have quicksaves and autosaves and none of my progress was lost. This game is indie, but it is on par with most AAA-titles.			"

												This looks pretty good so far. I've watched some Youtube Let's Play by Kill Ten Rats and he does a good job. Apparently the exp was decreased after some of his first Let's Play videos (bonus to the Early Access players).So, what is this game? It is a medieval fantasy RPG where you are a German noble trying to retake his rightful lands. You have to build an army, defeat enemies and capture castles. You are allowed to hire an army  that is sized based on the castles you control plus you can hire mercenaries (mercenaries can increase the size of the army beyond what you are allowed) but the mercenaries will deplete your gold fast because they also cost gold to maintain the troops. You and your troops can gain levels based on the experience you gain by fighting.Play is in real time except for combat which is turn based, based upon initiative. The graphics are nice and the music is not annoying (not yet anyhow). The storylines are very good so far (already got a good plot twist). In addition to running around trying to complete quests, you have to garrison your captured castles and watchtowers (if you can't garrison them, then you don't have control yet.).I haven't decided what to give this for a score because I have not finished it yet but it looks like it has a fair amount of replay even if you know what to do.

												This game is great! I’d compare it a little to Witcher II with the level of depth and detail.The backstory has been well thought out, and you really feel like you are playing a role in a larger plan.The rumors, and stories you hear and read about in the game are interesting, and I've read each of them. Usually in a game like Skyrim, I'd read a few, and then just skip the rest. The stories all tie in very well with the game and atmosphere, the writing is really top notch. There are some typos, and some bits that did not translate well to english, but you'll still catch the meaning.The combat system is easy to grasp and enjoyable. The rules are simple, but you must make use of some strategy to maximize the damage you can deal to the enemy, and prevent yourself from taking too much damage. Injured party members can be healed with spells, potions, and local temples, but those all cost money, and money is sometimes difficult to come by.If you play the game, read some of the forum post stickies as they offer additional insight into the game mechanics. There are also some YouTube videos that show some easy tips to follow. For instance, it was not until chapter 2 that I realized the map could rotate! The right mouse button is your friend in this game. RMB everything and see what it shows and does. One of my favorite parts of the game is the inventory system when you go into a market or store. It is just like most games with a buy/sell system, but if you click on a party member, the store items rearrange themselves and turn different colors. It is almost like each party member has a wishlist of the equipment they want. If you have the money, buy the green stuff at the top pf the list! This is so much better than reading and comparing stats between multiple weapons to determine if a certain sword is better than a certain heavy mace.My least favorite part of the game WAS starting over at each chapter. I say WAS, because now that I know to expect it, I can prepare for it. Sure, you lose your awesome party members that you trained from a lowly peasant to a war steed riding knight of death, but you get to do it all over again, and this time you’ll make even better choices. There are a few times when you get to carry over two party members, so you don't always have to start fresh.I finished the game in 54 hours. I'm planning to play through again and see if I can find some of the stuff I missed on the first playthrough.I got stuck at one battle in the game (chapter 4?), and was unable to go any further without cheating. I'm sure this is because I'm not great with the combat tactitcs yet. The developer put some combat scenarios on his site to go through, and I'm unable to beat the first one... Supposedly it took the developer several tries as well, but I've done a dozen variations and keep getting wiped out.			"

This is a fun game let down by its lack of polish.Legends of Eisenwald is a solid turn-based combat game at heart framed by a weak RPG element, which becomes more and more irritating as the game progresses.It's a pretty standard set-up from the off; pick a fighter, archer or mage and off you go trying to right some terrible wrong to your kingdom.The objective of most chapters is to take over the whole map, largely done by levelling up your hero and his companions through a series of fights.The hex-based combat works nicely, with troop composition, formation and tactics vital to success - reminisent of the turn-based Conquest of the New World  (1996!).However, you find yourself horribly mismatched at the start of nearly all chapters, forcing you to spend long times dodging larger armies for a fight with an easier army, then waiting for that army to spawn again.It becomes a tiresome and tedious grind until you can take on enemies which you think you can beat.This is exacerbated by the fact the only outcomes are victory, bringing loot and experience, or defeat, which is game over. There's no chance to retreat/be taken prisoner like Mount & Blade, forcing you to pick your battles carefully. You'll find yourself constantly reloading saves to beat a difficult battle, instead of being able to a take a mauling and then licking your wounds after.After a while the novelty of the combat system wears off; your army rarely changes and you find yourself doing the same opening moves again and again, watching characters amble across the screen to attack.You know before you attack exactly how much damage it will do, which inevtiably reduces most battles to a predictable affair, necessary only because you fare badly auto resolving battles.There's also a stage in every chapter when the balance of power shifts dramatically. You go from running from most battles to completely dominating every encounter without breaking a sweat.The RPG element leaves a lot to be desired and feels completely superfical to the combat. There's castle, fortifications, different terrains and a day/night cycle, but it feels like very few events impact your battles. The quests are rlike an afterthought after developing the great combat, there's no depth to most of the characters you encounter. The main character might have some dialogue with some of the chaps wandering around, but you rarely get an input into the conversation.They're just something to improve your army with rather than to get emotionally involved in for the most part.I know the developer intentionally didn't want to handhold players through missions, but I had no interest in them because they felt so incredibly shallow.With that in mind, the game felt like it went on too long with too many drawn-out chapters, rather than fewer that were well polished.Overall:A fun little indie medieval fantasty combat strategy game let down by a lacklustre RPG element.

												This is a pretty good turn based strategy/RPG game.  It's set in medievel Germany and is more reality based, with ""low"" magic, mainly healing and buffs, no conjuring demons or firing huge bolts of fire, and your opponents are human knights/ men-at-arms/etc (at least so far through the middle of the 3rd scenario).  The quests are varied and a number have multiple options for resolution. T he artwork/graphics are appropriate for the game/setting, while the music is great.  The skill trees are not complicated, maybe too simplistic for some people, and skills are generally passive or applied automatically in combat (I would have preferred a skill tree that gave me a choice of different attacks in combat) but the system works.  My main complaint is tha some of the quests are too obscure.  You do need to talk to people, and you really need to think about what you need to do and who might be able to assist you.  But some quests have multiple stages and triggering one stage or another turns into a pixel hunt on the map because you have to be exactly at X point  (or pretty close to it)to trigger the next stage.  This is just frustrating, once I get in the general area, the nex stage should trigger, don't make me pixel hunt.The other complaint is that in the main game you move from scenario to scenario, and with each move you lose the troops you raised, trained and equipped in the prior scenario.  You also lose money and anything in your inventory other that what you have equipped.  It works in the game but if you aren't expecting it, you'll wonder what happened.  That said, I would have preferred carrying over troops - it's kind of frustrating to build them up through battle only to loose them when  moving the next scenario.All that said, despite the things I don't like, I'm enjoying the game.  The story is interesting, the quests are varied, and the location/period is pretty good.  Overall, a thumbs up.			"

Early Access Review
								Having played for a little over five hours since yesterday, I've got to say I'm really enjoying this game.  Great combat system that feels more like battle chess than DnD.  The story is alright so far, the lore is interesting enough that I didn't just ignore all of the sidequests.  The day/night cycle was a surprise the first time I saw it, with shadows stretching and shrinking as the sun moved east to west.  Really cool, very beautiful.  I also enjoy that unlike some similar games, they give you full control of the camera's rotation, but keep the camera centered on your party, so your eye of God advantage is somewhat muted while you can still fully appreciate the visuals.This being an early access game, there are a lot of bugs that make it difficult to advance the story.  So far I've made note of 22 major bugs that either cause ctd problems, or are effecting quests so that workarounds are required, or are completely disrupting advancement progress.  This is quite a large number of problems for a relatively short play time.  There are also many minor bugs as well, from corrupt textures and spelling errors to even some Russian dialogue that hasn't been replaced yet.The dev posting on the game's steam forum mentioned that they aren't proud of the UI, but work is being done to improve it.  I'm really looking forward to seeing the work done to it, as its probably the game's largest non-technical weakness.  It's not very intuitive at all, the map is functional but clunky, quest markers sometimes mislead you and accidentally doing part of a quest out of order can make the journal quite confusing.I bought it at the sale price, and I feel like I've gotten some very good value for my investment and recommend others who are interested to to buy it while it's cheap as well.  If I'd paid full price for the game, I'd honestly regret not waiting until it was complete.  I look forward to keeping track of the progress of Eisenwald as the game comes closer to a full release, as it has potential to be a dark horse that will really surprise and delight many old school fans of this genre.

												So, I spent nearly 80 hours and what I want to say.  I am fond of playing it. It has really enjoyable story, however, there are some who claim opposite point of view. It is surprising how few people think obvious quests would be desirable think hard about what it would entail. Simplification is the way to bored game play. There is not any quests in this game which have no logical solution, however, only thing that you should do is be attentive and collect all gossips in taverns.The idea that hero should hold his/here comrades to the next level is ambiguous. I agree, it is hard to lose your high-leveled team mates, but all the time storyline give us solid arguments why it would be. In my opinion, it is a feature, and, of course, good game design decision. Anyway, the greatest developers achievement in this game is that they create an  medieval atmosphere when you feel like a small fish between nasty sharks, and this is awesome. However, it would be irrational to dismiss problem like main character level-upping out of hand. I think, ability tree and interminable feeling of improving are inextricably linked, that the essence of the RPG game. Probably, vast majority of players would be eager to see bigger ability tree with more branches even if every single level-up be less effective, rather than when it small.I urge anyone who love RPG games with enjoyable, original story and tactical battles to play it.

												SAVE SAVE SAVE SAVE SAVE and listen to taven rumours.I have nearly finished the game.I did enjoy the storyline and the very few limited choices that I get to make.HOWEVER. This is a very slow turn based fight game.Upon completion of the tutorial you loose all of your items.Upon completion of your home map, you loose all of your items and heros.Upon completion of running away, guess what, you loose all of your items and heros.Upon completion of the Duke's country and talking to the chancellor, I read the help tips and I stored my men away because this time I only get to keep 2 and again I lost all of my items.Upon completion of the next map with Daniel I loose all of my heros and items. So I backtracked, SOLD ALL OF MY STUFF and everything on their bodys, and proceeded to the next map with 20,000gold from selling my things.Which I really needed because I've neared the end of this map and from starting with 20k, I now have 3kI really want to see what happens in the end but omg this is fustrating, the amount of times I need to reload and redo a map or a scene because I didn't approach it the ""right way"" it just ridiculous.The developers take on this game is that they don't owe you anything. So alot of quests I spent ages running around because I couldn't find it, because the referene was so small or insignificant.Your looking for Mr X well guess what hes living in castle 123, how would you know that? well you need to go run around and remember his name, because not all quests have trackers or hints on them.Thats what took so long. The game its self is very short, but running around trying to find someone when all you have to go on is tavern rumours is stupid.			"

(this is the problem with story mode)And then the game comes and take them away and you are alone again with your main character and nothing else, all the equipment they had is gone aswell.Besides that..

												A cross between HOMM style tactical battles, legend of the crown text and siege elements, RPG and a bit of puzzle solving. It won't be for everyone, but if you can make it through the first couple of chapters it really starts to shine, particularly the detailed writing (and you will want to read all the dialogue to get all the clues!).For me the writing is what kept me in until my in-game power started to improve. Some thought and care has definitely been put into this game. It is pretty unforgiving sometimes, as you do get to make choices that might cost you, but for me this is a positve. You will be reloading a bit though until you get a feel for army strengths and AI behaviour.			"

												This is a fun RPG game with an engaging story and satisfying quests. Well done for an independant developer. The primary difference between LoE and other turn-based-combat games is that you do not get to attack whoever you want in battle. You must attack the closest emeny to you. This allows for less strategy in battle and makes battles more difficult. Thus, it is important that you arrange your ground troops correctly according to their initiative, front row to back row, otherwise an infantry man will get stuck behind another troop and not be able to act until that troop is able to move. In the case of archers, you can attack anyone but the further away they are from the enemy the less damage they inflict.All in all, worth the money.			"

Early Access Review
								Any dissatisfaction I had was with Steam posting unclear information. As is, I understand now that this game is in early access and not complete. What is finished is enjoyable. There are some bugs but for being early access they are few and being adressed. Overall I would recommend buying for the 3 complete chapters in the main campaign and 2 scenarios. The games gives a Bauldur's Gate type rpg to a Disiples type game. Commanding your hero and his/her custom party thru multiple maps and so far the begining of an engrossing story. I look forward to completed project.			"

												LoE is a very solid experience. Beautiful visuals, interesting writing, great music (I particularly love the church chant track) and an underused (more low fantasy titles please!) setting. The combat system seems to be confusing for many users here but please disregard most of the negative reviews given due to 'simplistic' combat - once you understand the system you realise there's actually quite a few layers of complexity there. Kudos to the devs for trying something new instead of following the HoMM/KB formula.There are flaws here and there, ones you'd usually expect from an indie dev - tooltips issues, exploit opportunities, minor stability issues etc - but these don't detract from the title's enjoyability. If you like TBS, and particularly if you like the concept behind the newer King's Bounty games but grew tired over how repetitive they get, grab it.			"

Early Access Review
								I have been following this game since it practically first came on Steam in its early early release days.  It has come a long way since then and I think it is well worth the price.  The development team is very responsive and friendly.  You can tell they really put their hearts into making this game.Legends of Eisenwald is a story based game with RPG  and turn based strategy elements.  The story is the element that ties the whole game together.  I would say if you like medieval settings, good story, non-linear storylines and RPG/strategy elements you should check this game out!

												I'm slightly baffled as to why some people have said this isn't a great game - because it is. It plays similarly to Heroes of Might and Magic but it does evereything that vaunted series does better. The feudal theme is something like that to be found in the Blackguards games but, once again, it does that better too and without the overly crazy difficulty spikes. Yes some battles are very tough but with forward thinking they can be overcome. It's not a walk in the park though and casual gamers may be put off. Personally, I love it.It is well worth its full cost but is currently available for almost nothing in Humblebundle's Jumbo Bundle 8. Miss it and you may live to regret it. I do have one word of warning, however, I wouldn't advise anyone to get the ""season pass"" DLC as the final DLC may be some time coming and Blood of November can't even be classed as DLC. If you like the game just buy Road to Iron Forest instead.			"

Some minor glitches still evident (horseless kights floating in the air during the Winfield section) but then again you can find a glitch or 2 in almost every game if you look hard enough.Overall ""Hats Off"" to the Devs....I would welcome any future titles from them if they are able...

												This game is really good, but there are 2 things that i don't like...This is a RPG in wich your character can have a small army (min 5 - max 11 soldiers). Each soldier has a class (spearmen, archers, etc) and his own inventory: you can give to each soldier weapons, armors, helms, etc. This is a very good thing, but the problem is that you don't see any changes in soldiers' appearance except for weapon and shield...no changes in soldiers' appearance for armor and weapon and so the soldiers of the same class look very similar!!!Another things that i don't like so much is that this game lacks of a sandbox structure. But this is just a personal criticism.Except for this 2 things, i really like this game: battles are really strategic and balancing is good. I really hope that developers continue to improve this.

												Really well made Indie RPG/Turn-based Strategy with a captiviting story in a low fantasy setting, inspired by German folklore. The combat system is reminescent of Discples and Might&Magic , but in a low fantasy setting, so no fireballs and chain lightning , but you can still play a mage character, which is actually one of the more interesting choices in the usual Knight/Rogue♥♥♥♥♥Archer/ Mage trope .The setting, playing in late medieval Germany, is NOT historically accurate, but low fantasy with a little magic , a bit less than, lets  say, The Black Eye, but theres still  mages and undead and whatnot.For this price,  a real indie gem, with a lot of work and attention obviously put into it.

												Great game. Difficult to stop playing. Here and there running through the map over and over again becomes a bit tedious, but nevertheless one keeps playing. There are some minor glitches, but not so much as it would keep you from playing. Maybe it's too short, and I doubt the replayability value. The combat system is nice, whatever other people may say in their comments. To say the truth I hate RTS-gaming and that may be one of the reasons I like this ""old school"" gameplay a lot. In hindsight one migth say that the storyline is too straightforward, there are clearly no alternative outcomes. But what do you want from an indie game. For its price it's value for money.			"

You can complete them in any order you wish and take as much time as you need.  In ""Run Away"" you can't dally/explore at all as is normal in isometric RPGs or Berthold catches you.The difficulty is also quite unforgiving, even on ""Normal"", for a few of the encounters that are expected to be fought early on new screens before you have a chance to build up your squad.

Legends of Eisenwald is a strategy game in the vein of heroes of might and magic and king's bounty only set in a low fantasy environment. Think more what would mount and blade be in the turn based strategy genre. Instead of having 100 halflings 50 mages etc you get characters that take a spot in your army (either followers or mercenaries each with their own set of limits) and they can be upgraded through level up trees and given specific items to wear (again like mount and blade). There is some magical elements (prayers blessings that heal or give buffs) but mostly you get the feeling that its medieval europe. I don't think there is any multiplayer but there is a full campaign and level editors so with the game having workshop inclusion some modding may be possible. I only played the prologue so far but the game seemed like a fresh take on the genre(lore wise and perhaps some of the mechanics like the specific units). I wish you could rename the characters you get to make it more personal but i did not find such an option (it may exist or maybe in the future i guess the dev can alter that). As far as i played i would recommend the game as for me at least the world seemed interesting to play through.			"

												Legends of Eisenwald is a really nice looking game about Medieval combat. Basically if you are into Mount & Blade and like turn based combat you'd be into this. Personally, it was a little slow for my tastes but I can absolutely see how this could be a great time for fans of the genre.  I was impressed with the huge party you could build and liked the writing a lot.  Going from town to town was a little boring.I posted a review here if you'd like to see the game in action:

												Just got it for super cheap on a humble bundle and so happy I did. While it lacks the polish of something like AoW III or King's Bounty, it makes up for it with a fantastic score, great setting, and a sort of charm that is just hard to come by in games these days. It feels like a storybook fairytale meets Game of Thrones (without the nudity). You want to keep playing it not just because it's fun, but because you can tell that the devs really put some love into this game. I am just starting to get into the main campaign and I definitely plan on playing it through to the end. If you are a fan of tactical RPGs and strategy give this one a go.Update: Sadly, in light of recent gameplay I just don't think I will be able to finish it for several reasons. It has been crashing first off, not sure why but I'll just be walking along and the game will crash, so it just makes it unplayable. Secondly there are bugs. The kind where you will finish a quest, return for your reward, and then find nobody to talk to. There's just nobody there! Lastly, I'm confused af by this story and have no idea what's happening. Doesn't help that there are several typos and grammar issues with the game. Anyway, I really wanted to play this one but I just couldn't trudge through it with all this stuff keeping me back. May revisit in the future but right now I can't run the game and when I do bugs keep me from progressing!			"

												It is with a heavy heart that I write this review.The story is compelling.  I actually find the story refreshing (if somewhat linear, this is not a sandbox game) and commend the developers on crafting an enagging tale that goes beyond the normal cliches.The core gameplay, i.e the tactical battles is pretty good. It takes some getting used to but the seemingly obtuse combat mechanics are there to allow tactics to protect your more vulnreable party members and try to strike at vulnerable enemy targets. Tip: You can look at enemy formations beforehand and adjust your formation accordingly.So why did I stop playing halfway throught the campaign and couldn't bring myself to complete the game? Grind. Save your main protaganist, all other members of your party are typically not carried forward from one scenario/map to the next. The trouble is that party mebmers can level up just like your protaganist and upgrade into elite troops. It goes without saying the scenario's end battle requires a full complement of elite troops. But all my efforts in training party members is lost every change of map. It feels horrible.I probably should have just used the cheat codes to auto-level the fresh recruits I get at the start of every new map. But this is not without its drawbacks since the early encounters in new maps are balanced for fresh recruits. Ugh. Anyway, I couldn't bring myself to keep playing in spite of the positive values of ths game. If this is issue is not a deal breaker for you, I highly recommend getting this game if you like tactical combat and an engaging linear story.I'm probably going to look up story spoilers.			"

Early Access Review
								So, I've only played about 13 hours so far, and I have to write a review. Just because it's Early Access, I like how the game is going and whatnot, and I want them to continue improving!Gameplay: this is a hardcore RPG. Turn based, Hex based combat, upgrade your characters, and their equipment, take castles, and cities. It's pretty good. It's a good user interface, gameplay works well. It's really addictive. I'm only on the third chapter, but I'm looking forward to the rest. This game is going to be HUGE!Soundtrack: My wife often asks me who's playing with the soundtrack on this game, excellent music.I don't really have anything negative to say about this game. It's early access so yes, there's the minor bug here and there, but it's extremely playable, and really good. Anything I have issue with, has been said already, and will be addressed in future updates. The dev's are pretty awesome on working on what the players say. Hope you give it a shot, and enjoy!			"

												This game has been on my radar for a while now and with it being at a great sale price thought I'd take the plunge. I really wanted to like this game I really did...but it is just so damned hard even on 'easy' setting and I'm in the tutorial! So heaven knows what the game proper is like? Loved the graphics, music and setting but unfortunately can't continue due to the present difficulty.EDITYes, don't make the mistake I did of choosing the mystic and abandoning. I re-rolled a knight and now everything is hunky dory. Thanks for the comments.			"

Early Access Review
								So, I've only played about 13 hours so far, and I have to write a review. Just because it's Early Access, I like how the game is going and whatnot, and I want them to continue improving!Gameplay: this is a hardcore RPG. Turn based, Hex based combat, upgrade your characters, and their equipment, take castles, and cities. It's pretty good. It's a good user interface, gameplay works well. It's really addictive. I'm only on the third chapter, but I'm looking forward to the rest. This game is going to be HUGE!Soundtrack: My wife often asks me who's playing with the soundtrack on this game, excellent music.I don't really have anything negative to say about this game. It's early access so yes, there's the minor bug here and there, but it's extremely playable, and really good. Anything I have issue with, has been said already, and will be addressed in future updates. The dev's are pretty awesome on working on what the players say. Hope you give it a shot, and enjoy!			"

												This is very good little strategy, very small area unit (melee, archer and spellcaster) battles. Hero and companions go around, do quests to gain money and items. Good weapons and armor and other stuff is important, so money is needed to buy better stuff. And you attack enemy castles to get them and then you have little income..This is story related game, not just some strategy game. Game starts and hero follows to plot to different areas, there is lot of text reading sometimes, and then you know where to go and what to do, and there is special rewards to do something what is not even quest.Knight, spellcaster and archer are your companions (whomever you want to recruit), and you are yourself one of them (chosen at start). There is small character development ""road"", and your decisions are important, if you choose wrong road when levelling game can become difficult. And your companions level up too, but at the beginning they are left behind when you travel, so most important is your own character. So far i have liked the world, it is hard place and you must make some not so kind decisions if you want to survive, but it was the world then.....			"

Early Access Review
								It's a great game. Love that it's medieval. Would play it alot longer if my laptop could run the graphics this game has, even on lowest settings. XD So amazing grahics if I hadn't made that clear.PROS:-Medieval-Very well done inventory screen.-Combat is actually fun. No movement points, you fight and your enemy attacks back as soon as you do, so it isn't turn based, but more delayed combat between attacks.CONS:-Cannot move around the map. You're always stuck where your character is on the map. -If you run into anyone on the map, automatically you talk to them even if you don't want to.-The inventory screen, while well done, does have the problem that the armor you put onto your characters does not show up on the model.

												Updated: 07/07/15This is an updated review of a game i previously left. But as of the comment left bellow, i have revisited and played some more.Old Lag Issues: 10/10My main original issue has been resolved and i can now play the game without lag from what seems to be a graphics setting issue. I hope the game devs put an option in thier load gui to choose graphics card use. This may resolve people issues when starting the game on a laptop. But at least the problem is now fixed. Thanks Devs.Graphics: 6/10The game does look nice in its design, but could definitely use some polishing thoughout. As it is just released i will give it time to improve. cliffs looks somewhat smudged and the water to land merge is rather simple. On the other side the tree foliage is nicely seperate and there is a fair amount of drtail in the buildings. Combat System: 5/10This is left me lacking with enthusiasm to be honest. You have three rows and each row can only have on it specific types, melee front, range middle, support rear. The middle and back row are not movers and the front row have nowhere to move but forward. This system could be completely revamp with larger battle areas maybe 3 times bigger and have a rang for bows that wasnt the entire map. Thus making the combat system a little more idepth and challenging. As it stands a fair amount of similar games do this aspect of combat far better.Questing: 6/10The quests are you average thing in the game, go here do this go here kill that. Nothing i havn't already seen but i do realise that sometimes its hard to be completely original in this area, in this type of game. Map controls: 6/10Over all the point and click aspect of the game is a little confusing to start with due to its click to start click to stop settings. Most other games deal with a click to start and then a click to move the way point. Although annoying at first i did get used to the feel. Maybe some refinement in this area wouldn't go a miss.The Inventory: 7/10Pritty standard type inventory, items are easy to find and the drag and drop system isnt anythign to shout about, but it does do the job and it will not inpeed your gaming with an over confusing interface.The Map and Journal: 6/10Pritty standard map holding all standard map icons. The relevent is displayed when needed. I would like to see some better design on the quest identfying features. A highlight of the area in regards to the quest itself would be nice. Maybe a colour on the map when you hover over he quest or a blip of some description. Campaign Map: 6/10The campaign map follows your character through the world an although this is a nice thing, it would be good to be able to detach the camera for a look around the world. Shortcut Keys: 5/10Q and J for quest and journal page press once to open and then again to close, great. doesnt work for inventory, I opens but doesn't close. Just an observation on this point. Overall: 6.5/10Mostly a positive experience with this game and im sure it will get better as development continues and people create things in the workshop. I do hope however the developers dont use this as an excuse to leave the game in its current state. Or slow down the development to a snails pace.But after my current play though i can now say that i can recommend you give the game a try with a score of 6.5 / 10			"

												Got a lot of play out of this one.  Really good world and story building.  My own complaint, and it's not even a complaint really, is that it is really difficult at times.  Not everything gets marked on your map and you really have to read into the clues and hints in order to complete many of the main and side quests.  But ultimately it's worth it as you feel a sense of accomplishment instead of being hand held throughout.			"

I have not seen any kind of difference whether you do this or that, it always gets the same result in the end. :/  The game has the possibility to have multiple paths in the story but the designers did not exploit that at all it seems... how unfortunate. It kills the replayability of the game. Once you finish it once, I doubt you will play again right away, maybe next year, maybe never.			"

The storyline keeps you interested and the well written characters keep you engaged in their personalities. The overland maps are very similar to the older D&D games (such as Neverwinter Nights 2), The battles have excellent visuals and audio. I highly recommend this game to any fans of well written roleplaying games and enjoy turn based battles.			"

												Amongst the best surprises I had buying early access games on Steam ! I thought at first I'd possibly enjoy a more merry looking clone of Disciples but Legends of Eisenwald got so much more in store. First it is rich of an enticing story in the main campaign, full of turmoil and wicked twists, moral dilemnas and heartbreaking choices. Also, the quest system is truly old school. No hand holding walk in a theme park here. (perhaps a tad bit too cryptic sometimes but that might just be me being a little slow ..).Then you got the combat mechanics : If you're a Turn based fan like I am, this game is quite the treat. Look quite simple at first but reveal its subtlety progressively as you're making your way through some hard fought battles and therefore more satisfying victories. In more than 60 hours I played in the main campaign, at no point the combats felt tedious, actually I was always asking for more !..Don't let its indie game looks deceive you, this one is a gem ! With devs who not only crafted a solid game but are very dedicated to insure their players get the best of it, through support on the forums and quick patches on very little number of issues (encountered the first one after some 40 hours of playtime), big editors should take example !..Now I just cross my fingers this ""little"" wonder generates enough revenues for its authors so they can expand it in the future. I'd be a total sucker for an expansion with sandbox mode ;)			"

								Interesting game. Still has a few bugs, but I am sure that will be fixed with the full release. Also kind of short, went through the 'main' story in only a few hours, and that was when I wasn't sure what I was doing. There are also a few translation errors, but those are a bit minor. Only improvement I can think of right now is the expansion of the quests. A few of the quests have a 'choice' option but as you progress the choices are made for you, forcing you to do something that you otherwise would not have done in gameplay. The price/Gameplay ratio as of this moment is not worth the $20 pricetag, but I can see a lot of potential.			"

												I really wish that there was a ""indecisive"" button because I do not dislike the game completely.It is a very special game that really has some very strong points and the potential to be very entertaining.But there are some points that I really, really don't like.First: The language in the dialogues is not very fluent and makes it hard to concentrate on what it is about. I find myself skipping almost every dialogue because there is just so much to read and often very little point in doing so. At least for me, the dialogues fail to make me feel like I am ""in the game"", they simply bore me and look so similar and superficial.Second: In many instances, I get the feeling that some options and possible choices are not yet implemented. Maybe it really is that way but this is just another point where the game's atmosphere lacks some depth.In general, I have a feeling that the game is far from being ""polished"" right now. It is a nice game and I guess that players of very similar games will really like this one, but for me it is not the game I thought I would get. I just don't feel captured in the game's atmosphere and story.  "

												Don't write many reviews, but if it helps the dev team along then here goes. Being a mature gamer..ahem...I have played many RTS/RPG games and as always there is the good and the bad. With Legends, I find the path not as sandboxy as I would have liked from the setting. The castle points to build an army can be frustrating at times. As a reenactor I love the realism in the weapons and the armour, but still think the combat system is to basic....I dont want to attack I want to wait for AI to attack me so i want to create shield walls and pike hedgehogs. However, it is quite fun although you are sometimes at a loss with quests if you didn't read the text.....So in short...good start...gives us some sandboxy type of place.....allow a little bit more tactics in battle phase, and you might be onto something bigger and better.

Early Access Review
								I'm very mixed about my review, especially since this game is in early access level and in the middle of being worked on. I really REALLY want to like this game and my pros almost outweigh the cons but after careful consideration Ive come to the conclusion that overall unless they make some drastic changes to the game, I wouldnt in good conscience recommend it. Now its not a very expensive game, so maybe its still worth trying it out and finding out if you can ignore the major cons that pushed the scales out of balance for me. My review is purely informative, though I have to admit the game's frustration level outweighed my objectionable standing.While this game looks much like Heroes of Might and Magic and Kings Bounty in how the combat system looks and overall map systems are designed and played, the combat you would expect and how static buildings are handled are very different. If you are looking for another version of M&M or Kings Bounty, This game is not it. Combat takes place with single units instead of mass groups, and limitations on how many units you can have are based on how many castles you own. The castles only other benefit is that if you are attacked while in a castle, before your army is engaged the opposing unit gets wounded based on its level and defense. Siege equipment is not present at this time in this game at all.So far from I have seen, you have a starting base of six units you can have (including your hero) and you get an additional unit per castle you own. For example, if you have one castle you can support one hero, two foot troops, two archers, a healer, and a priest. Im going to break down what the units are like in Pros (because I do like their versions) and other ideas the game excelled and is severely hampered by below.Pros and Cons:Pros:Makes great use of the German historical background and some of its mythos. It really tries to immerse you in that culture of the medieval dark periods in its campaign. The art and music is by far enticing like few games out there and makes great effort to keep in the tradition of Germanic arms and equipment of the time period.Equipment is very easy to understand in terms of bonuses they apply to your units. The Tutorial slowly integrates you into the functions of the game rather well. Units consist of Melee, Ranged, Healing, Buffing, and limited Magic classes that really well integrate into the historical setting. Units promote into different options and provide interesting additions to your game, each unit can be customized with gear.While combat is predominately a ""Con"" for me in this game (see below), it does make sense that the front line limits melee from engaging in the secondary and tirtiary line of defense. I sincerely wish games like King's Bounty and M&M had that limitation in their games as well. The Journal is very useful though it could be better streamlined when giving you notes in ""Additonal Information"" on where to find quests..I stumbled around a lot trying to find some locations that are not immediately available unless you find yourself close to them. Cons: Movement in combat is a happenstance; Melee units are directed by the computer towards specific targets. a Melee unit cannot move just anywhere on the hex board, they may delay their action to move them to the bottom of the turn line once, but hereafter MUST engage in units directed by the computer with no other alternatives. If they do not have skills that they can use instead (for example, if you have a peasant that would most likely die if he engages with another by himself) he must engage since he has no other skills to avoid that engagement. A unit's only other move instead of to engage into combat (outside of skills like parry, counter strike, as an example), is to retreat one or two spaces from an already engaged fight. Healers, Mages, and Ranged Units cannot move except to retreat from a melee unit. They can only do their functions such as attack or heal, they are rooted to the spot otherwise. There's no moving to a better position in this game at all, and when suggested to the developers that this is a weakness to the game, they were steadfast that this would never change, as it would require a complete rework of the programming. This may be a condition of the early access situation, so this one is not a severe con since it can be reworked or streamlined, but it should be mentioned. Sometimes healers will not have certain targets available to heal, regardless of how wounded the unit may be. Ive contacted the developers on the topic and I was assured the game is working properly and that most likely the unit was trying to buff the units instead of healing them since as healers are promoted they get multiple spell options. This was not the case but by the response I was pretty sure there was no point in discussing the matter anymore (especially after the pointless conversation to cover movement in combat).The Market has a major limitation in that you cannot take something that your units are wearing and swap it out for something else. In order to upgrade, you must first buy the item you want, leave the market, switch items, go back to the market and then sell the item. In the second chapter of the campaign game, four different leaders ask you to destroy two of their opponents for them to help you. One of those leaders sits in the large town and is not accessable in order to destroy that opponent. You can take his castles and land holdings but it will not count towards destroying him unless you confront him as well. Once you declare war on him, he will no longer be accessable. The campaign in the third chapter is rather punishing. You are limited to jump through obstacles that require you to wait on other enemy units (which I dont want to spoil it for you, so Im being perposefully vague here) and at the same time are run down by an impossible adversary that requires you to keep on the run. After trying to play that section as specified by the game by its rules, I finally gave up when that impossible adversary showed up.In conclusion, at this moment while I believe the game has extreme potential, unless they make changes to the combat system I cant emphatically suggest or recommend such a game system...especially since a game like this is anchored around its combat system. The campaign is nothing without it. If changes occur during development of course Ill be happy to come in and redo my review when (or if) that happens.			"

												One glorious evening, Heroes of Might and Magic made mad passionate love to King's Bounty on a bed stained with Mount and Blade. Nine months later, Legends of Eisenwald was born, and went on to become more than the sum of its parents.Very, very enjoyable. The combat system is a little quirky and the inability to simply click on the destination you want to travel to on the minimap  is a pain, but these are minor issues. Game takes about ten minutes to learn to play and it's all fun from there. I can see myself playing it for a long time.			"

												To be honest i was not impressed with this game when i bought the early access version.Played for a while but it was just not for me and had some gamebreaking bugs.Just tried the full version and i cant stop playing.It is awesome, i recommend to everyone who ever enjoyed HOMM.Has some flaws ofc. but compared to similar games of this genre, it quickly became one of my favs.The combat mechanism is a bit boring after a while but the environment, music and graphics are very nice.Also i like the character development and how your choices form the world and the different factions, lords.Quests usually can be solved in different ways,Hopefully we will have some updates and DLC-s for this game.Dont hesitate to get it, if you are a fan of turn-based rpg/strategies, this game is for you too.

												Don't write many reviews, but if it helps the dev team along then here goes. Being a mature gamer..ahem...I have played many RTS/RPG games and as always there is the good and the bad. With Legends, I find the path not as sandboxy as I would have liked from the setting. The castle points to build an army can be frustrating at times. As a reenactor I love the realism in the weapons and the armour, but still think the combat system is to basic....I dont want to attack I want to wait for AI to attack me so i want to create shield walls and pike hedgehogs. However, it is quite fun although you are sometimes at a loss with quests if you didn't read the text.....So in short...good start...gives us some sandboxy type of place.....allow a little bit more tactics in battle phase, and you might be onto something bigger and better.

												Beware The Villager With The PitchforkLegends of Eisenwald is the second game from developer Aterdux Entertainment, and a medieval time period piece that allows you to experience a share of Germanic lore and style. I’m not sure if the story is historic or if the history of the Ironwoods is just the setting for this tale; I can, however, tell you that the story does intentionally take place in the German woods, and while its pacing is a bit slow and its gameplay quite grindy, it does have quite the tale to tell, if you can get through all of that.Click the link below to read the full Review:http://www.gamerheadlines.com/reviews/legends-of-eisenwald/ "

								I am usually very fussy about any game that are any of the following; RPG, story-line, turn based tactical combat.In my first hour of play Legends of Eisenwald pressed all the right buttons.  The game flows like liquid, there is no clunky interface to struggle with, it looks to have been extremely well thought out.The story so far is simple yet gripping, not the usual dribble you get with this sort of game.  The graphics are beautiful, and along with the music really match the atmosphere perfectly.Just by playing the game you can see that the project is a work of love and not profit.I was a little worried that the combat would be boring, but my fears were unfounded.  The combat is very easy to get into but complex to master, whether you loose half you units, or none can depend simply on your initial placement.This game is early access and cost £12 and is worth every penny.  I cannot see anyway that you could be disappointed with Legends of Eisenwald.			"

								if you are fond of old school turn based strategy like the PS brigandine or Brigandine expanded edition jap. or kings bounty and desciples this is a game for you. currently in this early access i enjoyed the game and not too long got too addicted with it. i love games that go turn based , you can hire units , can upgrade units and in here even equip units unlike other game minions where only the best gear goes to the boss. in this game you will learn how to use gold and equip all your party members.. the only thing missing in the game is maybe a bit more additional job tree. additional units and more class change maybe from humble beginings like for the peasant. well its still in beta so there are a lot more to happen. but im expecting a good game. bugs in the early access are quite still roaming arround , the missing resolution for me and mising texts or untranslated text are not much of an issue. but i wish they will be corrected by full game release.

												I bought the game because i read some of the reviews in here stating that its a good game, etc. BUT boy was i wrong, I mean Im a real big fan of turn based RPG and stuff but this game is quite bad actually. The figthing mechanics is too simple, healer with heal, swordsman, spearmen, bowman just click and do damage. Eventhough u can add items etc to each of ur squad member but it doesnt really effect the overall gameplay. I admit graphic is quite nice but the fighting mechanic is really boring. At this point i think heroes Might and Magic plays better then this game or even the crappy blackguard game fighting mechanic is somewhat okay compared to this. Not to mention you have to have lots of gold to heal ur party members in town, etc.			"

Posted: October 25, 2015
												SHORT VERSION: The free-roam, Mount&Blade-style RPG part of the game is decent (although simplistic... there are way too few stats and skills, for instance), but the combat system of this combat-centred game is irredeemably flawed. With too few tactical options and somewhat unclear rules, it fails to impress and STRONGLY encourages save-scumming. All in all, the game’s neither good nor bad - an okay-ish, relaxing experience that I (unfortunately) cannot wholeheartedly recommend, not for the full price. 5+/10 or 6/10 at best.LONG VERSION: The combat lacks depth. Let’s define depth as “the number of meaningful choices a player can make at any given moment”. If you consider that a.) you can’t freely move the units, b.) you can only attack the nearest enemy unit and c.) there are hardly any special attacks, abilities etc., the player often feels like there’s very little he can change (it feels almost like auto-resolve at times, you just do the clicking, not the decision-making). For example, if you have a warrior (a young noble, let’s say) and it’s his turn, you can only do 3 things (apart from drinking a potion): attack the nearest foe, postpone the attack on said foe or skip his turn entirely in exchange for a defence bonus in the next turn. There should be more tactical options like:- special attacks (e.g. a shield bash that does little to no damage, but lowers the defence of the target so that you could have a specialized character with high initiative that would make the enemy vulnerable to your slower (low initiative), but hard-hitting characters),- will points (limited points that you can use up to make the attacks stronger or more accurate or whatever; it worked great in The Banner Saga, why not here?),- flanking mechanics, defence penalties for being attacked by several enemies and, generally speaking, the ability to move your troops more freely (even if there’s a penalty for that); seriously, why do I have mounted troops if I can’t go behind the enemy line and kill that pesky healer in turn 1? That’s what cavalry does, flank and charge,- more “spells” (or at least alternative, stronger versions of the same “spells” which you have to “charge up” for a turn and which can fail if the caster takes damage in the meantime),Imagine for a moment that we have all these options. I just lost a battle, what do I do? Fight again and try a different approach, move my troops differently, defend my crossbowman this time, use up all the will points to eliminate that mystic as quickly as possible, or lower the defence of that tank-ish knight with a special attack etc. Lots of possibilities, as you can see. Now back to reality. I just lost a battle in Legends of Eisenwald, what do I do? Reload the game, ask myself why I failed and SAVE-SCUM by using that knowledge to modify my army (shift their initial positions, give some weapons or armour to different people, go back to a village to buy a potion or recruit a different person). See the difference? It’s breaks the immersion if your character is a psychic who can predict what will happen next :)So I’m not saying there’s no depth to the combat system. The problem is that the meaningful choices occur BEFORE the battle. Once you engage in combat, there’s very little you can do to change the outcome. And for me, that’s not much fun at all. I watched combat videos made by the devs to see if the situation changes in the mid- and late-game, but no, it doesn’t.Also, as I already mentioned, the game doesn’t make the rules clear enough. Why does the spearman sometimes counterattack and sometimes he doesn’t? Is there any defence penalty from being surrounded? Why can I sometimes choose the direction of the attack and sometimes I can’t? And so on.When it comes to the RPG elements, I didn’t play the game long enough to say anything about the story, but as I said, there are too few stats and skills for the game to actually FEEL like an RPG. Also, there’s no character creation whatsoever, which is sad. You can only choose the class and change the name so you don’t have to play as Heinrich.Overall, it’s not a bad game and some people will find it pretty fun (might as well give it a try when it's on sale and, if you feel about the combat system the way I do, you can always get a refund...). Personally, I may play it for a few more hours, but I have to say I’m disappointed (I was waiting for this game when it was still in early access). Too bad, because it definitely had potential.			"

												C'mon really ? Okay on the pro side:+ nice sound+ nice location+ nice ideas+ nice ""medieval"" art style+ easy handling / simple game rulesNow the cons:- very linear story telling- very basic combat rules / possibilities (nothing for hardcore strategy-gamers)- average story- minimal rpg-aspects- no freedom at all ( In the tutorial I bought some items for my party - which left me after the tutorial. I thought I lost 1000 gold in items. So I started all over again ♥♥♥♥ing up my stupid party in the tutorial - guess what.... After the tutorial I started with the same fixed amount of gold I also had before. Please my dear game-makers let us players have some freedom some openess and let the game world be ""realistic"" I mean in the story of this game why did I lose 1000 gold on a boat trip ? Why do I have to start with the same budget helping my old party or letting them run around naked ? So far so good ... overall it's 5 of 10 stars.			"

YouTube™ Video: Legends Of Eisenwald Review 

			Views: 5,595		

			Cosmic reviews Legends of Eisenwald a indie RPG with tactical battles and strategy elements developed by Aterdux entertainment. This games was provided free of charge for the purpose of critique.		

The combat is a simple turn based hex system that simply requires you to attack and defend. The combat is the biggest let down of the entire game. Unlike most turn based combat games, you don’t have freedom of movement. Instead you can only move when you want to attack a target. There’s no tactical positioning or moving your units out of range of archers. All that is every required in combat is a few simple clicks and while there are unit abilities and some spells, there is very little in terms of actual tactical depth. The sheer lack of freedom of movement in the combat can really hinder you at points, it means you can’t have your spearman on the right flank just move over to the left to defend against a mounted foe, instead the enemies closest to them, even if they are a couple of hexes away must be cleared out first.The over world works in real time, as you move so do others, time can be stopped, slowed or sped up at convenience. The overworld brings back found memories of the Heroes of Might and Magic series, legends pulls it all of well, with great landscapes and graphical assets. While the movement is slow, the developers have done a good job of making the world look alive. Characters have different routines, which are also affected by quests and the day/night cycle. For example, if you’re hunting down a thief, it’s likely you won’t find him during the day. Instead you’ll have to lay in wait, fast forward time and wait for him to come out at night. The movement is fairly slow on the overworld which can get pretty irritating when you’re trying to catch up with a certain character.The questing in Legends is a mixed bag of both relatively ok quests and some that are fairly tedious endeavors. The major issue for me was the lack of any meaningful choice system in the game which I certainly felt was due to the lack of creativity quest wise. The majority of main quests consist of running around to talk to a few people and a fight and that’s it, it’s all pretty much rinse and repeat after that in various forms. Questing in legends provides a shallow experience, there’s really very little depth to it, however what it lacks in quality it makes up in quantity. There’s a lot to do in the game and some of it I had no idea what I was supposed to be doing. This was thanks the vague quest instructions, which don’t get me wrong, I love figuring things out for myself and dislike games that hand hold the entire way through, however the obscurity of the quests were bad and artificially elongated quests that would have otherwise been very short, it also adds artificial difficulty to simple things.Now like I mentioned the games story isn’t bad if you can forgive the odd writing at times. However with there are a couple of uncomfortable moments by modern standards in there such as some remarks against Jews that certainly could be considered as Anti-sematic, do I think the developers are racist? No of course not. It’s clear they tried to reflect the times however the small remarks to other races add nothing to the actual setting and story and could have gone amiss.Graphically, Legends of Eisenwald does well, it’s not terrible to look at and the character models are done fairly well. The character animations look off and janky on occasion particularly in combat. The art style of the game could have done with a little more color as everything is done in a dark shade of color with little actual vibrancy. It’s not that a darker tone is bad, it’s that mixed with the shallow mechanics, it makes the game look bland and ugly in places, when it doesn’t need to be. The most disappointing side of the art was the lack of character assets with soldiers all looking like clone troopers from star wars. Each character looks of that class looks the exact same, for example three monks are identical clones which breaks any and all immersion when in combat. The soundtrack of the game isn’t bad but doesn’t particularly stand out in anyway, the only thing that did stand out about the audio was the few bugs that would cause the audio to go off.Overall Legends of Eisenwald has a lot of content but lacks any depth to its mechanics. It’s rough around the edges but does hold a certain charm to it. It’s certainly entertaining and packs plenty of hours in there to get your monies worth. I think people looking for an RPG with more depth to progression, combat and certainly a better quality story may wish to wait for a sale before buying Legends			"

												the tactical combat is good and brings in refreshing mechanics. the leveling of your soldiers is also a nice touch.the game also force you to make hard choices and they are getting harder as you progress which is also a big plus.on the down side there is too much running around the map back and forth to my taste and a lot of times the objectives are not clear enough. there are also some bugs and crashes but they are few enough to ignore.to summarize - some parts (combat mechanics, decisions, music) are great but others are just ok.overall i would give it 7/10.

It also has many side quests that keep the game interesting.  I might even play through on different characters. There were a few minor bugs but nothing that can't be worked around or figured out - i am sure devs will fix those too soon. If you like these types of games you will enjoy this one!			"

								The people who are writing negative reviews for this game seem to be the people who want their hand hel through every puzzle and looks for walkthroughs when things get difficult. Some things are buggy and take a while to figure out but its early access deal with it instead of crying and giving bad reviews for good games.			"

								Changing my review.  I wasn't able to play for a month after purchasing, due to it crashing on startup. Their latest patch fixed that problem, so I finally got a chance to play it.  Seems pretty decent so far. I'll definitely play it some more. Only have maybe 45 minutes of actual playtime.  Not sure how much I like some of the combat rules, but it hasn't been a dealbreaker yet. Worth a shot if you like turn-based strategy/rpgs.			"

												Clunky; is how best to describe this game.I had forgotten about this title all together having bought it way back in 2014/5 on pre release. I liked the way it was developing and looked forward to a rich story driven adventure collecting companions and wondorous equipment along the way. Sadly it isnt very different from what i can tell from pre release other than there is more of it and in truth it was a little dated in terms of game design back in 2014 but I thought it looked like it was going to have some new innovative ideas but once again sadly this appears not to be the case in fact there are some awful design choices in the game.The map you trundle around on......you can't actually pan around. You have to click somewhere along the route to get to where you want to go. Want to click on the map in the corner to set a destination......sorry no. Want to move around the map to look for something......sorry no. Want to drudge around drearily to your next possible destination only to figure out that it was on the other side of the map......yes you can do that a lot.In combat for example you cannot move tactically; you can only move towards the nearest enemy. If your archer is engaged in melee with someone with a shield they cant hit them unless they have a skill to overmatch. Your healers/priests/rear line do not even have a weapon to attack with in melee. Healing is next to useless in a tactical sense as most armies/groups will kill at least one of your people before your healer gets a turn (a useful turn) The whole balance of the game feels very off; to start with you struggle very hard to gain xp and manage injuries and gold and then all of a sudden you are capturing castles and don't have a care about gold.......the xp is still an awful grind though. The story driven narative was interesting at first but eventually just turned into click click click what fetch and carry quest dear peasant would you have your mighty lord carry out for you today type of thing. Also the quests themselves can be quite baffling and the log is no help; vague is putting it midly. You simply only have to google the undead graveyard quest to see a litany of baffled seekers; one of which even trolls, and rightly so, one of the developers who decides to post in the thread. I will admit there is something about the game that keeps you playing but after the first chapter i just couldn't face the thought of levelling every sinlge character in my party again, despite figuring out how to use potions out of combat by this stage......there is no tutorial as such; wait there is it just doesnt cover things like potions. Oh yes they game on every new chapter strips you of items.......gold.......party members but you do get to keep your carry over on the final chapter from what im told. Can i skip ahead to that last chapter then so my hours of play don't feel like such a dissapointment every time i complete a chapter......sadly no you can'tThere are older and better games out there that do this better than this title; it had a lot of promise in pre release but sadly it never lived up to that promise.

												An interesting take on the rpg genre with some strategy elements. The story is quite intriguing, but the game takes a little getting used to. You assmble a group of troopers to your merry band but you lose them with each map change. You assemble of bunch of interesting equipment but you lose them when the map changes. There is hardly any emotional investment in the game and the instructions is spare. There are almost no tool tips. So upgrading your troop is really a choice on who wears the most appealing hat.Finally the English and quest note taking takes some getting used to as well. I 'get' that the game is going for a 'hardcore' audience and not the wow crowd, but still the instructions for each quest could be better. Did not realize there were time sensitive quests till I was deep into the second map.I'd recommend this game if its on deep discount. It's a decent game, but has some flaws.			"

That being said, the game itself is awesome, there's intense lore into it, the story is amazing and in depth, the gameplay is smooth and beautiful, rarely if not never you'll face some bugs, the graphics look retro and pretty but you'll spend so much time grinding and training your army.

Early Access Review
								Do not buy this game. As mentioned by many here the game is completely shallow and in no way compared to any 4x games out there. At the strategical level there is no empire building at all. You have one wandering party you control with simplistic recruiting. There are a few wandering mobs to fight. At the tactical level there is no depth. Even ignoring the lack of spell effects and other graphical elements there is no combat gird that you can use. You have no control over where your units get positioned in battle and really it matters very little anyways as there are no deep game mechanics that make that useful (Like FF tactics os any RPG strat game).You merely click on an enemy, and your character will walk the ENTIRE length of the combat field to that person and mindlessly attack. The AI is absent completely, and is why these features are not there. There is some very crude path-finding and a simplistic algorithm for targeting units which the AI uses and that is it.Character customization is a farce. You can change the way your shield and weapon look. That is it. So don't get fooled into thinking you can customize your character.Oh and by the way, you cannot level your character in this game. Its bugged right now, when you load up your game from a save it forgets all of your upgrades in the skill tree. So you will be a level 6 character with no skills. This game should not be on steam it makes me doubt every indy developer out there.			"

								LoE is similar to the rest of the strategy genre. It does nothing new, and is very unforgiving with army combat. When you switch maps any troops you get attached to are gone. The game tho, doesnt go throught a ""rebuilding army"" phase like the player. I feel the original X com is more fun to play than this game. I had very high hopes and I'm thankful it wasnt expensive. Save your money and give another Idie game maker a chance elsewhere.			"

												I really wanted to like this game but now I am just glad I bought it when it was on a -50% offer. Disappointed to say the least. The interface is retro and basic but it serves its purpose and is usable. The battles, when you get over the dodgy pathfinding/target selection issues are fine. Nothing revolutionary but how much can you improve a turn-based, hex-grid combat sequence? This game makes you work. Its not handed to you on plate. Neither does it treat you like an idiot.And, once I got over my initial pre-conceptions and actually got into the game, I enjoyed wandering around the map, fighting and exploring. So all in all it doesn't sound that bad right? Well, for me, the problem is all the hours I invested in building up a little force, equipping them, choosing upgrades and deciding which partciular career path they were going to take. Then, you complete the current mission and whammo! There you are........alone......... and almost penniless. Your team has gone! All that time and effort you put in was for absolutely nothing!Now you kinda anticipate that when you get to the next mission the baddies are going to be tougher and better equipped (this is a TBS game after all), so you naturally want to take your team so you can cope with next mission, yes? Wel, no. What happens is you are droppped into the next map with only your characters gear and enough money to buy a bowl of gruel, should you happen upon an establishment that sells bowls of gruel, which you won't. The very next mission sees me recruiting a base level healer and two pitchfork wielding peasants. Have a guess how long they lasted against the pursuing bandits. Not very long at all., They die. There's nowhere else to recruit anymore peasants from and there are several waves of bandits heading your way that you simply cannot escape. It is totally pointless.Like I said at the top of this review, I really did want to like this game. I'm long in the tooth as a gamer. I go back to 1993  and The commodore Amiga and TBS games are my thing. But this one, well, my advice is not to bother. And that is all I have to say.			"

												Ended up not being anywhere near as awesome as I was hoping. Combat is dull and lacks any strategic depth whatsoever, and the ""world"" map is basically just a waste of time. It originally looked like it was going to be a Mount and Blade style game, with some turn based combat built it, and ended up being a 3 hour long romp through boring quests.Edit- Thanks for the youtube video, demonstrating how bland the combat is.

								The game itself is ok and the graphics are good.However the interface for the game is extremely slow on my Core i5 laptop with 8 GB Ram and 2 GB Graphics card. Even moving the mouse cursor around the screen is slow, and I often have to click on an object several times before being able to grab it.On top of that it is not always clear where to click to use the objects on the interface. F.i. when entering the list of ""missions"" you'd expect to be able to re-read the mission - but no, you can only click on a very small object to show the mission on the map.Had we had the opportunity of installing a demo version, I wouldn't have bought the game afterwards!

												I enjoy story lines and reading. A puzzling quest here and there is a great way to pass the time, but this game's missions are just annoying. I would stop constantly to look up a walk through to get through every side mission. 90% of the time information was missing. Example Mission: ""Get random guy drunk"". I go to the guy and there is no option for offering a drink or dialogue. I try several other options and still nothing. The quest giver didn't say anything specific, the mission notes don't give a lead. I search a walkthrough and eureka! I'm suppossed to get a special wine and convince the guy to drink it, but only after I have earned his trust by defeating a special renegade band. That was never instructed, nor hinted by any NPC. Missing information and poor writing make for frustration. The game has a wealth of potential, but I cannot in good concience recommend this title.			"

												It's a hybrid strategy/RPG game in a medieval setting with magic, similar to Heroes of Might and Magic but with much less interesting combat options and no resource management. On the positive side it has a well developed story line.  But...There is a problem with the engine - long delays on the menus and much lower frame rates than my rig gets on comparable graphics in other games.There are some technical problems which give the overall impression the game was made by amateurs. The most notable are:You have hardly any control over the field of view. You can pan and tilt only a tiny amount. This means you have to click many times to move. To make it worse, movement isn't smooth. Instead of continuing when you click in a second place, the character stops. Overall, movement is horribly clunky.Your fighters' character screens always say they are level 1 regardless of their true level.The text has a lot of terrible errors. In a few places it even refers to the main character as a man when she is a woman. The quest map markers don't update so they tell you to go to places where you have nothing more to do.If you move a mounted character's lance to inventory the game crashes. Overall it has to get a thumbs down. There are many many much better games in this genre.			"

The UI is clunky and the graphics and animations are on par with early 2000s games. I thought it would be like a Heroes of Might and Magic game with a longer unit upgrade tree but there is no tactical gameplay at all. The two sides just wail on each other until one side wins. I honestly cannot believe this game is being sold for 30$ it should be more like 10$ to even be worth trying.			"

												Legends of Eisenwald plays a little bit like King's Bounty, but unfortunately lacks some of the polishing (and a lot of game balance). That alone made this game a lot more frustrating, when making things just a bit easier or just a bit more apparent would have tipped the balance.The overhead map movement is an exercise in frustration because finding the correct path through the terrain isn't always immediately obvious. This led to a lot of pixel-hunting, something I thought we got rid of in the late 90s.UI is a bit of a mess, as well. One commenter noted that upgrading was a bit of a chore, since there isn't a way to figure out what unit upgrades do; unlike your hero upgrades, there's no tooltip to explain what an upgrade does, so choosing and saving/reloading was the norm. I stumbled upon this completely by accident, but right-clicking the upgrade tree for your units shows a tooltip of their upgraded abilities. I have no idea why this wasn't included in a regular hover tooltip, and this could have more clearly been highlighted in the tutorial.Finally, there are a lot of game moments where everything just feels unfair, without much warning. Spoiler alert: in the third act, you face zombies, which would be fine and dandy if I'd known that some units that are afraid of zombies will desert your army completely. I was put in an unwinnable situation since I'd chosen the ranged hero, and my whole front line disappeared. There isn't much build-up to this at all, and that alone put the stopper on any desire I had to play onwards.All in all, not recommended.			"

												Meh, i wanted to like it, it looks like a nice game but damn again, once again a game fails at some major game design choices making the game an utter pain in the♥♥♥♥♥at some point...but here comes the complete story:So i started as Heinrich the Knight, being the noob to the game i am, i follow the games advice.works out well without to spoil too much, but i get to have a castle when all of a sudden some super human mercenary troop arrived to kick me in the face. For no apparent reason, they are just landing, running towards me and killing me. Its silly, their leader deals 1 blow kills even to the main character wiping out the entire army alone. Well i thought, ok lets give him a bit of a challenge and hide out in the castle. After all a siege takes away a good portion of their health...or so i thought. Apparently his troops can teleport or fly, since they dont get any siege penalty, resulting in the same utter crushing defeat in the very first few missions of the game. If the game designers wanted the game to end like that why not just pop up a window and write ""the end"", there isnt even a story attached to it its seriously just Badguy: ""i will kill you"" style...and off you go.Whoever wrote that piece of story should rethink his choice of job he is utterly unqualified for gamedesign.Damn, and i really liked the game up to that point.

												This game is confuzzlingly good (confusingly good, just a little joke i like to make with words haha hope it was cool with ya'll and not too offesnive, )  its kinda like Heroes of Might & Magic 3 combined with Fallout 1 and 2 with a dash of cocaine and methamphetamine drugs rolled up in a tortilla and stuffed in the false bottom of a semi tractor trailer as it barrels across the US border, illegally destined for doing crimes. It's kinda strange how in this day and age )(review written in 2017 AD) we can still play and enjoy such a game that is seemingly simple and primitive and one might say Buggy AF (as fart, no offesnve intended to sensitive readers) but yet simultaneously robust and satisfactory. Essentially imagine yourself but wearing knight armor instead of ambercramby and addidas and instead of driving your bicycle yyou drive a horse. Now picture yourselve stabbing a bandit for 36 damage and then ytour friend patrick the archer Shoots the same bandit for 15 damage and the bandit falls over dead and smote upoin the ruin of his hubris and youre like cool I got 4 gold for that, but probably more importantly some experiance so my guys can level up. When that happens they can turn into different mans.Anyway hope this review was very helpful to anyone and stay tuned for more fresh enlightening reviews from me, your man, player of gbad games (lol its an ironic name because i actually only play theb est game ever made, like this one. and another one, hope the irony wasnt offesnive to anyone :) )			"

												Some UI and QoL improvements would've really helped this game. The premise is good, as are the core mechanics. Some people might like it just fine how it is. The big con for me: the quest log is absolute garbage. If you don't carefully pay attention to every single thing that every random NPC says (and take your own notes), you will not know/remember what you're supposed to do to progress. Not only is there not a marker on the map for most of the things, but there isn't even a conversation log or ""important notes"" or anything like that. If it either had well-implemented map markers or a conversation log, I'd probably have kept playing the game. As it is, I stopped and don't plan on going back.			"

Early Access Review
								More reviews @ TheVideogameBacklog.comLegends of Eisenwald is said to be a Medieval Strategy RPG. On the surface it looks even better than I expected it to be. I mean, we are starting to see a lot of good-looking Early Access games, but still it surprises me. I do like myself a good tactics game as most of you well know, so I wasn’t about to pass this opportunity up.The main pull for myself to Legends of Eisenwald was the combat. That’s also the first disappointment as well. It’s on a hex system, but there’s not as much depth to the combat as I was hoping, but it is rather brutal and fast… kind of like a medieval skirmish would be I presume. You’ve got rear healers and buffs, then your ranged and then your “tanks”. I use air-quotes because as of writing this, really only my main dude is a tank. Everyone else is more like a meat-shield. You can either start to attack the top half or the bottom half with your main character if he’s in the middle as is the default, but everyone else just kind of moves forward to the guy closest to him. This is the fight. You can’t have everyone just jump to one guy at the beginning of the fight, but rather you are forced to fight the closest opponent. If realism was the intention, they got because that does make the most logical sense. Tactics-wise… you can’t change the positioning of your guys before the fight, but rather before you even enter the fight and see how they are aligned and then it’s too late. There are no obstacles, just people and it feels like a different combat system would have worked better here. Maybe a 2.5D isometric combat system?The main pull for myself to Legends of Eisenwald was the combat. That’s also the first disappointment as well. It’s on a hex system, but with no real depth.

There are no obstacles, just people and it feels like a different combat system would have worked better here. Maybe a 2.5D isometric combat system?The story is that you leave your home to go off somewhere and fight only to come back home and find that there is infighting at home. Lame, but dems the brakes. The writing and story in Legends of Eisenwald is pretty solid. I’ve enjoyed most of if not all that I’ve encountered so far. It’s both interesting and intriguing but it seems to be held back by the game proper. The quest log is somewhat useful, but not very. I was once told to go to the southern bridge near a watch tower… there wasn’t one. It will guide you to some places, but not all (which is fine, I can read, but still). You also don’t have too much money, but you’re told to go and hire people to help you out. They cost money per day, but that didn’t come off as obvious to me and I still don’t really see it anywhere listed. The button just says hire not pay this amount each day. (Goodbye money.)Legends of Eisenwald doesn’t feel too much like your traditional RPG either where you can go off and explore, killing bad guys for loot and money and generally getting the lay of the land. You need more money and I’m believing that is only going to happen while following the story. There is nothing wrong with a linear game, but Legend of Eisenwald doesn’t feel like it was intended to be that way. It gives the feeling like it was supposed to be more open. Maybe you just have to pay your dues and follow the story for it to open up to you later, but that’s not really how I play RPG’s. I wonder off and kill bad-guys and take their money… but the bad guys are mostly broke here.Score: Wait For Some UpdatesI don’t give this score lightly. I really wanted to give Legends of Eisenwald the better of the two impression scores, but while it has a lot of potential, I feel it will probably be more worth it after a few more updates. I enjoyed the story. If they wouldn’t call it a tactics game, I probably would have enjoyed the combat more. The music was good. The overall game as a whole just feels like it’s missing something, maybe it’s better direction (please don’t read that as hand-holding), but when you’ve done a decent job running around questing, but can’t quite figure out how to turn in some of them and run yourself into a place where your only real option is to start over completely… I’m just not a fan. I’ll keep checking on this game and let you know if my opinion changes, but as of right now Legends of Eisenwald I feel like it’s a solid “wait”. Unless you like what they are presenting and want to support them in their endeavor that is (which is completely understandable.)			"

It has too many bugs that prevent smooth game play, and I often have diffecuties even getting the game to boot up. I do hope that the developers finish this game, because I really like what they have done so far, its just not complete.			"

												NO I would not recommend this game.Each Chapter you lose1) Inventory2) Followers...... Aka your Army3) Ultimately a level of patience. Patience that Indie Devs desperately require to make their game successful.It's almost like the DEVS' used themselves for the UAT process and just gold stamped it as workable. A game that could have been great if the DEV's weren't horribly stupid and over indulgent. A Fart of a game, and it wasn't meant to go in gamer’s mouth. Bad Dev's and a pox on your horrible death fart of game.This game is very very BAD!			"

												This game hardly feels meaningful. It's not intuitive at all.Things I like:Things I don't like:- First time I tried to play the game: ""The system worked too long. Restart the computer to start the game."" Wtf?- While creating your first custom game there is no information at all on how things will affect the game.- While creating custom games there is only 1 choice to make, and that is your class.- Texts are not very clear. It's difficult to read + and -.- The environment has several places you can visit, but each of them do absolutely nothing, unless you have a quest for the place. Then you end up running back and forth because you must do everything in a specific order. It feels meaningsless and it annoys me. This is the opposite of open ended.			"

The game play is sophomoric and the indie team never botherd to hire a writer. The story is terrible and the characters don't really have a consistent voice. The plot makes huge leaps without really connecting anything together.Don't bother getting attached to your men/women because they are taken from you every chapter change for no good reason. Disappointing game. 2/10			"

Early Access Review
								30 hours of gameplay?I played 6 and my ""legend ended"" after I talked to a zombie.Rather.. my character said something along the lines of ""but.. i..""and then the zombie spoke latin or something and moaned.Then the game ended.That was about 30 minutes after investing 5+ hours in the first part of the game.. which i did enjoy very much.Recruited helpers, leveled them up, upgraded and geared them into an army.  Then.. they are taken from you as an overpowered guy on a horse is chasing you to the ends of the earth.If he catches you.. you are forced to fight him with no possible way to win the fight.So you lose the game, says you died.  Doesn't say legend ended.. so I'm curious as to why my zombie interaction ended the game.Was I supposed to avoid the zombie?  Why didn't I die then.. I would have reloaded save, like I did half a million times when the op as ♥♥♥♥ knight was chasing me.Was that just the end of the early access and I have to wait for game release to actually finish the ""Legend""?Well then why the ♥♥♥♥ didn't the prompt say THAT instead of what was basically.. ok you talked to a zombie, thanks for playing the game it's over.And the new UI sucks! Everything is condensed and tucked away, but the font sucks terribly.Very hard to read and see what's going on.. which were very simple things before with old UI.			"

												Call it a valiant attempt. The promise of combining Heroes of Might and Magic with deep and rich lore and history seems like a winner. It isn't. After years in early access, it is still bug ridden. But it isn't the bugs, dissapearing potions are fairly trivial when drinking them is largely a waste of an action. In an oddly appropriate act of Deus ex Machina given the flavorful immersion in a magical catholic pre-germany, chapter two starts with you broke and alone, just like chapter one, and the design flaws pile on each other. All that ""stragegy"" you built up? Gone mysteriously, just like your gold. Quests fail to complete, choice is nowhere to be found, and God save you if you were hoping the quest log would be even slightly useful. Perhaps a better description would be ""Visual novel with rpg and tactical distractions.""Give it a pass. If you're looking for grinding frustration, might I suggest FTL or Darkest Dungeon?			"

								  This game would've kicked♥♥♥♥♥in 1998.  But (keep in mind it is understood this game is clearly still in development) so far is incredibly boring.  Pretty, but boring, and lacking in guidance; even in the first Cursed Castle mission.  Every single battle is exactly the same, with the same tile layout, over and over again.  Except sometimes it's extremely hard, and sometimes extremely easy.  As with all Early Access games, you end up feeling as if so much more cool things could happen, but as with *almost* all Early Access games....it won't.

In fact all decisions in the game seem of little or no consequence.Should I attack army A or army B? YawnShould I have an archer or a melee unit? It doesn't really matterShould I buy some new armour? Why botherShould I take the time to equip some of the armour I won in a battle?

												For the most part this is actually a pretty decent game.....however the combat seems very broken the only real movement you do is to move to someone you are going to melee with. Yet you have a combat modifier on ranged being over 3 hexs away for damage (despite the fact you cannot move closer to mitigate that modifier). Also if you go with a spellcaster at low levels he cannot cast damage spells at range (which is absolutely ludicrous a book reading spell caster IS NOT going to wait for you to get next to him to cast Flambe')so you cannnot move next to them to cast this and have to wait for them to get right next to you. This reaks of a designer that always feels that spellcasters are always OP. Well I like spellcasters so up urs ******berry. If you have such a probelm with them make them glass cannons. Nobody has a problem with that because as we all know Conan is a tough hombre and he may still kick your taint to the stars after you have napalmed him. Next and not in the least insignifigant if your forest is beautiful and your mountains are beautiful and the get in the way of me properly navigating the map then, ITS BEAUTY IS TOTALLY LOST ON ME. That having been said as far as I could tolerate these issues it had a decent although simplistic story line and it could have really been really good bang for your buck if these simple issues had been fixed. If you're anything like me you will be cussing in no time at all. Once again that having been said if they fix these issues in a patch and I play it and see them fixed i will most likely revise or add an addendum to this reveiw. thank you for reading this friend.

												This game has so much promise but in the end it's just a frustrating grind...providing you can get past the bugs to even reach the grind.  The controls are wonky and unneccesarliy difficult.  Example: the save game default to a long string including current date.  If you want to name your saves you have to backspace ONE KEY AT A TIME.  You can't just hold the backspace key, you must hit 15 times.  That probably doesn't sound like a big deal and in isolation it wouldn't be but combine that with multiple other klunky UI issues and it just becomes a frustrating mess.The quests directions are unbelievably obtuse, not challenging, not though provoking, but obtuse and frequently downright wrong. Example:  on one quest you are told to seek a man by the south gate of a town when the shadow of the tower reaches the big stone.  Except there is no south gate of the town and the tower (providing you are lucky enough to guess the one intended) doesn't actually cast shadows.  While I will give the devs credit for being active on the boards answering questions, they actually answered this one wrong.  They said to go by the big rock (which rock???) at dawn but it turns out you have to be at the north side of a bridge at dusk.   Gah, what a cluster.  I can't vouch for it myself because a bug prevented me from getting past chapter 1 but apparently if you are able to progress, at the end of each chapter you lose the party members you've spent the past 6 hours levelling up and have to start from scratch.  I had followed this game since it was Kickstarted and desperately wanted to like it but I deeply the purchase even though I bought it on sale for less than $5.  I should have had a burger and fries instead.			"

												Allthough I was positively impressed from the videos I have seen of this game, I have been very disappointed by it after purchasing it. The game is to me in a way a copy of Kings Bounty(main difference here as a plus is that here you can equip items and level up all characters in your army), but it lags far from games like KB or Heroes of Might and Magic.  The quests have disappointed me, the graphics and options, the battles, and also the map gameplay. They all have good ideas behind, but the way they are implemented, just feels bad... really bad. The main story gets fuzzy and the quests are confusing and bugged.  I would really like to say I like the game, but a bug in the main quest, was the show stop for me, now way to overcome it in my case, and no good saves at hand. I whish I could get a refund, but I played 2 hours more than allowed for refund. I really wanted to like the game... My personal opinion, save a bit more and get  something u can trust.			"

								This game is horrid. It is first game I regret buying in last 5 years... after just 40 minutes of play I want to return this ""masterpiece"" back to store.What makes this game so bad -> battles. They take place on hexagon field, where you can not move or position your armies. Oh, melee units move alright, if they can attack closest enemy. But your caster, with spell of range 1, just sits there, and can not move closer, so he can actually use his spell. That just does not make sense. As a fan of strategy games, if you like simplistic battles with simple rules, you can try Disciples series instead.			"

												The game is currently poorly optimized. There are excessive load times and wait times between screens. For example in the equipment screen changing from one character to the next requires a pause of several seconds before the change even occurs. I was unable to spend any serious time playing it due to these issues. i5 3GHz Intel Quad Core2 x 770 GTX SLI32 GB RAMEdit: The developers were kind enough to get in touch with and recommended some suggestions through the FAQ to resolve these slow-loading issues for both the loading screen and in-game UI elements. However, after adding the game to my antivirus (Webroot) allowed list and even attempting to run the game with my antivirus completely turned off the issues were not resolved. I have the latest nVidia drivers as well. While I am thankful they contacted me my issues are still not resolved and I have an essentially unplayable game in my library.Edit July 7, 2015I re-installed today after being contacted by the developer notifying me that the game had left Early Access and was fully released. The issues I faced in the Early Access review are no longer present. The game runs smoothly.The combat takes a bit of adjustment since you can't move your characters to specific locations - you can only move-to-attack the nearest enemy. This makes defending with melee units more important to prevent your ranged / support rows from being isolated. You can modify the equipment for your troops (new swords, armor, weapon types, etc.) I like that different weapon types have different advantages (swords allow counterattacks, maces stun, etc.) I haven't gotten too far in to the campaign yet but will update now that the stutter issue I faced is no longer present.

												The beta is shaping up very nicely. It has a nice mix of RPG, strategy and tactical fast-paced combat. I especially enjoy exploring and the story and background in each scenario. If they add more scenarios and more content in each scenario I believe the final game will be really good.			"

												I recently received Legends of Eisenwald as part of the latest Humble Bundle. I was unfamiliar with it going in, but as a fan of classic turn based strategy games like Heroes of Might and Magic, Disciples, Warlords, and so on, I thought it would be worth giving this game a go. I'm now 10 hours into the game and on the third chapter of the campaign. There are definitely some rough edges here but I'm enjoying my time overall. On the negative side, the interface is a little buggy and obtuse. There is no easy way to compare the stats of two different items and considering the game is asking you to fully equip up to a dozen soldiers, that can make inventory management a bit frustrating. There are also a number of item abilities, but to my knowledge there is nowhere to go to see what effect an ability has. Some are obvious, such as one called something like Vampiric Touch. I can get a solid idea of what that does, but others are not as clear. More problematic, is that I also have been unable to find a way to look at the upgrade trees for various soldiers, making my choices pretty much random. And even when I have made a choice there is often little explanation of what has changed or improved with the upgrade. So poor inventory and stat management combined with a decent but not excellent translation (I assume from German) makes the game a bit hard to get into, but as someone who has been playing games for 25+ years, I can easily remember a time when every foreign game required a bit of guesswork, so that didn't bother me too much. That said, I can easily see how a less patient gamer might just end up giving up on this before they figured it out. Once you do get a hang of things most of the rest of the game is a big positive. You have a fair number of upgrade paths for your soldiers without things being overwhelming. You need to outfit your entire force but there doesn't seem to be an inventory limit so you are free to keep things for future use, and combat is tough, fun, and quick while not being too complex. There are also a ton of hidden secret areas in each level you can find that would earn you high quality gear if you go exploring. As a final note, numerous reviews here and on professional sites have said that the quest log is poor, but I have not found that to be the case. You can hit the magnifying glass on most any quest where you need to go to a specific location and have it mark it for you on your map. Others have said rumors aren't saved in your quest log, but that is also not true, they are just located under notes.Lastly, there is the debate about losing your soldiers and inventory at the end of each level. While standard practice in this type of game, traditionally you are allowed to choose a couple soldiers or items to keep and take with you to the next level. Here you just get your main character and whatever equipment he has on him at the time, which is fine but I would have liked to select one or two additional units to progress with me. As it is, you have to start your army from scratch each level, which can be a bit deflating. All told I would recommend this game to fans of classic TBS titles from the 90's, as well as any younger gamer who enjoys slower paced titles and is willing to put up with some rough edges they might not be accustomed to.

												I really love this game, is a point and click with a challenging script and a political theme. I find it simple yet addicting! I hope these guys make more games in other genre's as well!			"

												What a quaint game.A very humble, enjoyable RPG. It was definitely worth the few bucks I threw at it. Ten is good, but twenty bucks may be stretching it.			"

								Do not buy this game yet.It appears good but I am having a number of issues with it.The big one is a crash to desktop that happens every time now.minor issues such as in game translations and screen resolution are also issues, some of the menus continue below the screen.Another issue is bug reporting, it doesn't appear to lead anywhere at the moment.

												Holy smokes this game is long. And I didn't even unlock the ""secret"", deeper endings. It has a polished lore, complex story and quite unique taste - I've never encountered a game with so many interesting legends, fables and stories - not only that, but majority of them is also connected to the core plot of the game!The game succeeds in making some interesting gameplay experiments which allow you to feel something very special. Just imagine: it’s a dark night. You, a betrayed knight/sorcerer/crossbow-female-knight, together with your servants and companions pass a lonely bench under a tree and get to a tavern. But there are no generic black-cloaked quest-givers inside, not at all. But there are common folks all around you and you start listening to what they have to say. Some peasant and mercenary talk about a knight who lives nearby – the peasant heard the knight keeps some weird barrels in his basement and the mercenary claims he knows what’s inside them. A peasant girl tells the innkeeper that apparently some other knight sleeps with his own sister, while the innkeeper claims he saw the same knight entering a brothel in nearby town. A monk tells the gathered people a legend about the saint man who is the patron of the local monastery while a drunk beggar talks to himself about a ghost which he believes he saw next to the ruined tower...The variety of side quests, main quests and level structures is impressive and often you have to figure out on your own if a legend has some truth in it or is just a silly gossip. The story is very complex and it tries to show every side of each story as grey and conflicting as possible. Even though the core story is mostly straight-forward and very tightly holds your hand, sometimes you have to make decisions and choices which most of the time feel as “judging what is the lesser evil”. Very rarely the game offers you an easy choice such as “do you prefer some amount of gold for doing something evil or more XP/an item for taking an extra mile to do the right thing?”. Most of the things you are going to do are neither right nor just, and sometimes not even that honorable. I like it a lot and it’s hard to not compare it to Game of Thrones and it’s mean-spirited portrayal of royal families as normal, weak people who always see themselves as heroes and find excuses for their bad deeds.However.The game has many flaws, some of them - major. UI is absolutely terrible and could be improved in so many obvious ways it gives me a headache. Multiple performance bugs can annoy and break the immersion, although not as much as the fact that through the entire game we control only 5-12 (rarely) people and with their help we destroy huge noble families, conquer castles, lands and so on (I don’t mind “unrealistic” approach, but it sometimes get rather silly). Some graphics are amazing, some are terrible. Sometimes music makes a fantastic atmosphere, yet sometimes it gets glitchy – a couple of songs play at the same time, volume spikes up and down and so on…It is very clear the developers had to make some budget cuts and had many interesting ideas which they couldn’t bring to their full potential because of lacking resources. A good example may be the watchtowers and outposts. These structures, once conquered, may become a defense posts for our army – we can keep in them our spare soldiers and try to stop some of the roaming A.I. (which has tendency to conquer our villages while we are on the opposite side of the map). However, transporting soldiers is an absolute pain in the♥♥♥♥♥since you have absolutely no extra space or tool to do that – if you want to have a filled watchtower, you have to go to a castle, leave there your soldiers, take spare soldiers, take them to the watchtower, go for new soldiers and also bring them to the watchtower, then you can take your own army back... It’s ridiculous and it feels like the developers just couldn’t create the entire balanced system of army management so they decided to leave it just like it is, even though it’s completely useless.The battle system is also far from perfect and it lacks “depth”. Once I got bored in managing my units I started to use the “automatic battle” option 95% of the time and thankfully the game handles it pretty well. Very rarely you face an enemy which you can defeat by strategy and not just by probability count introduced by the game. Many reviewers find the combat system the most important flaw of this game, so if you want to play this game mostly to lead your knights and soldiers to battle, you may be disappointed and I would suggest looking for a different title. The English translation sucks a lot. I’m not a native speaker myself but even I was often distracted by unnatural phrasing and generic mistakes. And there is A LOT of dialogue to read so a good editor is definitely not a part of the game where you should save a buck.-----TL;DR 7/10 is a fair rating, however there is lot in this game to love. I think it can satisfy most fans of medieval-fantasy RPG games (especially if they like games like “King's Bounty” or “HoM&M”), but there surely are some people who are going to be absolutely enchanted by everything this game has to offer - especially because of the clever writing. Judge yourself if you can forgive some bad gameplay decisions, poor UI and other mistakes.			"

												The game is currently poorly optimized. There are excessive load times and wait times between screens. For example in the equipment screen changing from one character to the next requires a pause of several seconds before the change even occurs. I was unable to spend any serious time playing it due to these issues. i5 3GHz Intel Quad Core2 x 770 GTX SLI32 GB RAMEdit: The developers were kind enough to get in touch with and recommended some suggestions through the FAQ to resolve these slow-loading issues for both the loading screen and in-game UI elements. However, after adding the game to my antivirus (Webroot) allowed list and even attempting to run the game with my antivirus completely turned off the issues were not resolved. I have the latest nVidia drivers as well. While I am thankful they contacted me my issues are still not resolved and I have an essentially unplayable game in my library.Edit July 7, 2015I re-installed today after being contacted by the developer notifying me that the game had left Early Access and was fully released. The issues I faced in the Early Access review are no longer present. The game runs smoothly.The combat takes a bit of adjustment since you can't move your characters to specific locations - you can only move-to-attack the nearest enemy. This makes defending with melee units more important to prevent your ranged / support rows from being isolated. You can modify the equipment for your troops (new swords, armor, weapon types, etc.) I like that different weapon types have different advantages (swords allow counterattacks, maces stun, etc.) I haven't gotten too far in to the campaign yet but will update now that the stutter issue I faced is no longer present.

Early Access Review
								June 2015-It is amazing what one year can do especially in this game, I have kept up with this game seeing small changes over time and It keeps improving. When I first reviewed the game I found the concept to be great and the battle system to be so, so, but this has changed. The battle system while still being potentially lengthy Is now something to truely enjoy the visuals have improved (thought I must say its hard to say how much) and everythign has a much smootherflow really giving you alot of choice. Bugs of course have been fixed for the most part as they often do over time.This game is soon to be released and I would recommend it to most people.August 2014-This game had potential the battle system was nice the graphics good but the story line can get confusing and sometimes quests are never ending due to bugsfurther it is impossible to come across enough loot to keep yourself well equiped and healed.tried to play this game multiple times each time disapointing.

												Being formulaic, think Heroes of Might and Magic meets Mount and Blade on semihistorical medieval Germany.This game is a unique gem, however. It mixes smart tactical combat, solid looting and leveling gameplay, good art, amazing music, a sense of immersion I struggle to find nowadays in games (I'm an older gamer) and an absolutely great story.The tactical combat looks  simple but surely it isn't. It is a smart and different take than HOMM series, as you have to act with your units, and move is a consequence of the attack order. Every action you have a series of decision to make and it is very interesting for a long time.If you are an experienced strategy gamer, however, if you don't go for the higher difficulties it could be a bit too easy, and after while it gets a bit repetitive, but until there it is very fun.The leveling and looting system makes managing your party interesting. There is a nice variety of loot and troops, and simple but rewarding upgrade trees. The story is top notch, though the storytelling is a bit lacking. Some say it is complicated and really is, you have to pay attention. I would say the story is on par with King of Dragon Pass. You don't have a lot of choices, though, as the story unfolds, but the quality makes for it. The worldbuilding is awesome as well, you really feels like you are in medieval Germany.At the end of the campaign the gameplay gets a bit repetitive, though, but is mostly a case of the campaigtn being too long than the gameplay being boring. I only kept going for the story.Overall, a great game. 8.5/10			"

												Incredible game with surprisingly good storytelling and great atmosphere. I loved every bit of this game and once i started playing i was hooked. This game is really amazingly good done and to be honest i can't wait to play more games like this with so engaging story. Characters are really fleshed out, dialogues are never boring to read through and player actually feels the diffrence between choices that are made. Combat might be repetitive after a while but still some fights require a lot preparations and tactics.			"

												I started playing this game and really enjoyed the story and the turn-based style gaming, but in the end I just got too frustrated with several game aspects that I can not give this game a positive review.First off, everytime you move to a new chapter of the game you loose all of your party members (except for yourself) and all of the items that they had. Even if you remove their items and put them in your inventory, you are assigned a new inventory at the start of the next chapter. With this game mechanic there is no reason to level up people other than yourself since they won't be with you in the long run.Second, the quest log can be very vague at times. I understand that in order to fully understand a quest you need to read dialogue, but to include important information in dialogue and not the quest log is very frustrating when you are trying to complete quests. Also I have had times were I am progressing through a quest and the quest log doesn't progress with me, leaving me unsure of what path to take next.  "
