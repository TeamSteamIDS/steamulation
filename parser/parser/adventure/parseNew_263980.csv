												Put a quarter into the arcade machine and play this one. Ignore the cheesy chip tune (or turn it off in the options), ignore the shooter game it starts with, because in a sudden twist you'll find yourself in a platformer with a teleport gun that handles arcade style: no blue and orange portals, just straight up teleports and precision jumps that let you reach where you want to reach, provided you can figure out and make the jumps.Don't pass this one by while it's on sale.

												Ok, let's be honest: I bought this game for 0,19€ and thought it would be 'okay' for a couple of minutes, I'd grab the cards and then it would disappear in the library, never to be looked at again. After the first 20 minutes I had to admit that the game is quite entertaining and after seeing the ending I didn't even notice that I've played it for over an hour. Sure the (retro-style) pixel graphics and the 16-bit sound seem to be standard for every second indie game, but in 'Out There Somewhere' they do their job quite good, they made me feel a bit nostalgic and are very charming (I really like this music in the main menu). The portal gun and the different puzzles are well done and I seriously had to think sometimes how to solve this room. Green, red and blue light beams, jumping, momentum - there are several things to consider when shooting that little bullet. Yeah it is a short game with a short 'story' (the bad guy shoots at me, my ship crashes and I have to explore the planet to finally kill the bad guy. All of this because of... reasons!) and a length of approximately one hour for the first playthrough. However during this short period I've been entertained well and it never felt repetitive. In addition there are many interesting achievements that bring in some replay value, so I'd say it's definitly worth this small price and I have to admit: Developers, you've done a really nice job!

												Let me start by saying that I bought this with 96% discount for 19c. The title grabbed my attention, and so I just had to try it. What else could I buy for 19 cents anyway? I can't think of many other things, and certainly not something that could keep me entertained for several hours like this little gem did.What is it about?Out there somewhere is a short 2D puzzle-platformer with a few simple but interesting mechanics. For me personally, it feels like a mash-up of Portal, The Swapper and You Have to Win the Game, which is a good thing because I like all of those games.You take a role of Yuri - the space cop, who tries to protect the mothership from a bad guy Grigori. Your ship was shot down and crashed on an unknown planet. Now you have to find missing parts, repair your shuttle and face Gregori once again…GameplayAlthough the very first segment of the game is a classic arcade-machine-style space shooter, don't be fooled. The whole gameplay is based on jumping around with teleportation gun, solving puzzles. How it works is, you fire ""teleshots"" and you are instantly teleported the moment they hit the surface. Your telegun also stores your momentum, which is another important little mechanic to keep in mind. There are obviously different surfaces, obstacles and problems throughout the levels, and it's all up to you to solve.Later in game, you'll get a pew pew gun to deal with enemies if you so desire, but you can very well just avoid most of them...SidenotesPuzzles are challenging but fun. There are plenty of checkpoints, so even if you die, it's not a major setback most of the time.Even though the visual style is simple, I really dig the concept art and the cutscenes, as well as chiptune soundtrack - it's surprisingly not as monotonous and annoying as I thought it would be. I think it all works well with the space theme, too. Not to forget, there are even some funny little easter eggs and references here and there, and I'm always a big fan of those.Like I mentioned before, this game is short. Even taking it reaaally slow and casual, it took me only 3 hours to beat. You could very possibly manage to do your first playthrough in 90 minutes. There's even achievement for finishing the game in under 20 minutes… There's some replayability thanks to Steam achievements, but even then, you shouldn't expect endless hours of fun. On the other hand - it's a very simple game in terms of game mechanics, and it could get boring and repetitive if it took too long. I guess it depends on how you look at it. I would say it's reasonable for what it is.ConclusionWhat can I say, it's a nice little game. It requires thinking and quick reactions, and thanks to that, it can be pretty challenging. It's a kind of one-trick-pony, but well executed IMHO. I know some people might feel it's too short for the full price, but I definitely do recommend it when it's in sale.			"

												Bought it for 17 cents during the summer sale, and out of all the games I bought (Garry's Mod,  etc.) this was still my favorite. Very platform-y, and not only has great music but also great visuals. Would higly reccomend to anyone. Best 17 cents of my life.			"

												Out There Somewhere is an aesthetically pleasing puzzle platformer that makes use of teleporting and various environmental obstacles. The art and gameplay are both well done, and it is a nice treat. The mechanics of the game are easy to pick up and there is an even balance between execution and solution in the puzzles (in other words, it takes some thinking as well as fast fingers). Not to be confused with a portal gun (where you make two doors and enter freely), when you fire your telegun you are teleported when your projectile hits a solid surface. There are obstacles (crumbling surfaces, mirrors, glass, some beams, and enemies) that are thrown into the mix to keep things interesting. The controls all feel solid, and, given the length, the game was fair in challenge and pacing.There is very little combat (most enemies can be avoided) and there are 3 boss fights (1 being a repeat). That being said, unless you get health upgrades, there can be some challenge in avoiding everything or killing everything. The main game is rather short if you are focused on just beating the game (my first run with very little exploration clocked in just over an hour), however I highly recommend you take the time to explore and find all the upgrades: these areas are some of the more challenging of the game. The story and dialogue feel underdeveloped, and overall I was left wanting more of the game in general, but I do not consider this a bad thing.Out There Somewhere is light on combat and easy on your backlog, but those looking for a clever puzzle platformer should check it out.

 About Out There Somewhere Game starts off as a shoot'em up side-scroller, which really took me by surprise. I mean, judging by the screens you'd rather expect a puzzle platformer and you get that not so long after the game starts, too. And then it just hit me, the brilliance of the idea: you fly, fighting your way to a new planet. Then you land, 'meet the locals' and proceed with the featured mission, which involves solving puzzles, fighting your way forward and doing some cool oldschool platformer type trickjumps. It's just all there. Again, really awesome mix. Gameplay	The puzzle part is rather fun, the puzzles are not terribly easy, but also not too complicated. Can't imagine spending 8 minutes trying to beat one though (one of the achievements). As the game progresses, different beams are implemented, which change the behaviour of your teleport gun. The variety of enemies is rather limited - 4 kinds, erasing them is a bit of a chore, spam your gun until they drop dead. The game could feature no enemies and no one would probably miss them. The NPCs remind me the ones in old NES games, like Duck Tales, sometimes you have to sweat a little to get to them, but they might have some useful information or will say some funny things.The shoot'em up part is just there I guess. It covers approx. 5% of a game that lasts for an hour, so you don't really spend too much time in it, shame.Graphic	It's mostly just your basic 'oldschool-nes-like-game-graphics'. Anyway, the art style is pleasant to watch. The only thing that somehow buggered me was that some maps looked a bit mundane and dull, with only same bricks of terrain laid over another same bricks of terrain. Adding more background details and decorations would probably make the game look a bit nicer, but then again, it's not really about the graphics this time, is it?All in All Out There Somewhere is a really good Indie Game!8/10 From MeSweep 	 "

Product received for free
Basic InformationTitle:  Out There SomewhereDeveloper:  MiniBossPublisher:  EQ-Games, MiniBossGenre:  Classic style platformerGeneral ImpressionOut There Somewhere is a 2D platformer that emulates the classic side-scrolling action of older titles while offering a breath of fresh air in the almost entire absence of platforming sections.  The story is all about a stranded astronaut trying to survive. Quite odd for a platformer is the lack of many enemies as well. You will mostly teleport here and there with ocassional text based dialogue pop-ups. This is definitely more an experience about exploration than combat and avoiding obstacles. Even if the game is rather short it felt a bit boring at times. It features simple graphics and sounds but for its price point and considering the inclusion of Cards and Achievements, the game is ultimately worth trying out.Strong Points+ Plenty of collectibles.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points-  Unbalanced difficulty.- Too short.Rating 6/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes.

												I've never seen this mechanic before, it's very fun and gives some interesting puzzle platforming. And it is well explored in the level design. I love the visuals too. Quality pixel art, very cute. The game is mostly on the easy side. I figured out the mechanics quickly and at worst I died 3 to 4 times on the hardest rooms. The bullet hell sections, however, are pretty hard! at least to me, I hate bullethell games. It is a very small part of the game, but it makes me wonder about mixing such completely different genres. Here it didn't take anything from the game but I remember feeling quite disappointed with Brutal Legends, for example, because I went in expecting to play an action fighting game in an open world and found myself playing an RTS. I don't like RTS so I couldn't enjoy the game, no matter how good it is. But I digress. This is not an issue with Out There Somewhere, the spaceship sessions are short and few.It's extremely short though. But without considering price, length is not a very useful information. What I mean by that is I think the game is worth what they are asking for it. It's a short adorable, original and fun little game and it's cheaper than a sandwich. I'm a very satisfied custommer.

												Out There Somewhere is a nice platformer where you initially drive a spaceship, then you explore a planet full of weird aliens, and finally you get into your spaceship again for the final confrontation.You can beat the game in well under two hours, and as far as I can tell there is not much replay value (unless you want to collect the several achievements that Steam lets you collect). I recommend this game as long as you buy it at a discount, since it's a very short game. However, it is well done, it sometimes requires some reasoning to travel through certain screens, there are several secret screens and collectables thrughout the game, and its aesthetics is overall nice.Plus: it's chocked full of sci-fi (mostly Star Trek, but not only that) references, which is always good!

Note: video review embedded below.There’s something untraditionally appealing about Out There Somewhere’s insubstantiality. It’s a very brief, straightforward experience, but rather than feeling shallow it uses its brevity to subvert the players expectations in interesting ways.That arcade shooting segment at the start? That’s just a prelude to the platformer that takes up most of the game. That gun you’re carrying? It’s actually for teleporting you around instead of killing enemies. The huge world the game seems to be hinting at? In reality it’s a more classical one direction platformer. Out There Somewhere is full of little touches that seemed designed to throw you off course and surprise you with how things play out. They may come at the cost of making a lasting impression, but I feel like that wasn’t ever its prerogative.Out There Somewhere also gets away with a lot more than most games could because of how strong its mechanics are, and how intrinsically they’re tied to level designs. The teleporter gun is largely your only tool throughout the game, and each screen is made to perfectly utilize it for platforming and puzzle solving (provided your reflexes are up for it). Eventually I was having to take into account bullet speed, character momentum, and environmental devices in order to navigate effectively. These additions are added quickly, but also scale the difficulty smoothly enough to where I almost didn’t realize how much more involved later levels were because the game had taught me how to play so well.One could argue that Out There Somewhere is too short or simple or loose, and they wouldn’t be entirely wrong. The game often feels as if it’s holding on by a thread and some frustrating moments can be a lot more unpleasant due to how much of the overall game they encompass. But its length and careful scope feel so intentional and considered that I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and enjoy how it played with my expectations. I might not remember it a year or even a month from now, but as a condensed experiment in teleportation and unconventional design I don’t regret the journey.

Short story, unusal game mechanics, pretty good soundtrack. But I don't know, there is something wrong with jumping... Sometimes you just can't jump again after using a teleporter and it's really annoying. Actually this game is about teleporting and reaching new grounds. "

												Out there somewhere is a nice platformer with a decent ""old-school"" feel -- it's not a strained and missed attempt to cash in on nostalgia for ""retro"" games; quite the opposite it feels and looks solid like all the parts belong where they are. The platforming can be pretty challenging at times due to the addition of a teleport gun gimmick that teleports the character to wherever the bullet lands. Add in conservation of momentum across teleports, ability to shoot multiple tele-bullets at a time, and special beams of light and you get some neat platforming! Akin to old platformers the game world has its share of secret rooms and hidden bonuses that await the daring explorer. Also monsters and other baddies, a big bad boss, and two space shmup sections! Overall a pretty short experience -- around 1 hour for a casual experience, or under 20 mins for a speed run -- but between the secrets and a speedrunning challenge there's enough to warrant an extra play or two.

												I have to say, this may verry well be the best $.49 I have ever spentPros-Amazing teleport mechanic-Good difficulty curve-Great Music-Treeman-Overall gameplay is greatCons-It's short-Bats-somewhat annoying combat systemBartle TaxonomyKillers: Not the best game for these guys. You only get one gun, and it's not that powerfull. Not the best game for this type of player.Achievers: Many achivements and ingame collectables to get. A great game for this type of player.Socialisers: There is some interaction with aliens, but not a whole lot. Most aliens only have one line. There won't be much of any replay value for this type of player, but for the first time through it will be decent.Explorers: Explorers should have a great time with this game. When playing through it, I often saw places I couldn't reach from my current position and thought ""How can I get over there?"" There are many hidden places to find. This type of player will have a great time with this game.Score:7/10Make the combat less annoying, have more interaction with aliens, and make the game a bit longer. These are the only complaints I have about this game. However, for it's price, I highly recomend this game.			"

												A nice little game, I got a copy early but never actually got around to playing it so I figured I'd do that now.What is it?Well it's basically a semi-portal metroidvania. You have a teleport gun that moves you to where it shoots, with it carrying over momentum so when you jump it keeps your speed. That being the core mechanic of the game it does it very well. You have to utilise you teleport gun along with various world objects to get around.Is it something I like? No, it's really not my style of game.Is it something I'd recommend? Definitely, it is a very solid platformer with an emphasis on timing. Don't let the chep price fool you, it's certainly worth a lot more than they are charging.			"

												A fun, charming and creative puzzle platformer. It pushes the creativity of its teleporting mechanic very far. Only lasted about an hour but it was really enjoyable.This game is a bit challenging and forces you to think about what you're doing. One thing I loved was that failing a level didn't have a lengthy game over screen, or a splash. It would throw you right back in which kept the action up. And even if was only 3 or 4 enemies I also liked that the game had some combat. I'd love to see the idea expanded. I think there's a lot of hidden depth in the teleporting mechanic that the developers didn't exploit this time around. This is a  great game that's worth a try.			"

												I bought this game in one of those infamous 19¢ sales at some point in the distant past, never actually thinking I would play it.  Then one day I fired it up, saw it was a terrible side-scrolling space shooter, and uninstalled it.Except...that is a fake-out, as anyone who has played for more than a few minutes knows, and once that is finished you get to play through a brisk but still roundly enjoyable (and adorable) kind of simple platformer-meets-Portal.  Well, teleporting, not portals, but it certainly calls that to mind.The pixel art is gorgeous, the soundtrack matches perfectly, and it will probably make you feel smart when you figure out some of the trickier puzzles.  Totally worth 19¢.  I daresay I would pay upwards of DOLLARS for it!			"

												After beating the game several times, I gotta say I feel bad I got this when it was on -96% sale.This was a surpisingly good indie game to me. I didn't know what to expect before installing it but since I saw from some other reviews that the game was short I decided to give it a chance. I'm glad I did.The game is a conventional 2D exploration platformer for the asthetics, but combines it with some Portal mechanics and specially with the Cave Story gameplay style. The game takes place into an uncharted dark world that together with the main character look-a-like give that final Limbo taste. So actually the devs' description about the game is accurate enough.You accidentally land into this planet so the goal is basically finding a way to repair it and get rid of the people who chased you. A very soft story but heh, aside from Ori and the Blind Forest, no one expects a deep storymode from a 2D platformer, do they?Graphics are cute and satisfying to my eyes. Even though the world is constantly dark, you feel pretty immersed in it soon enough. Also, the few places where the story take place are quite varied so you don't feel you're just stepping into the same thing over and over. Music is surprisingly catchy. I've always liked chiptune/8bit/16bit music and this game catches the point. Damn, this game is worthy just for that, guys!Gameplay is perfect as usual in 2D platformers. Tight and fair, every death will be at your own fault. The physics of the portal gun, the jumps, the movement and those devices that works with the gun respond as they should.As an exploration game, the game is rewarding. I didn't care to play this game 4 times, and between them I just discovered new things, which was charming considering how short the game is. The map is pretty well developed and I can only critisize the fact that to get full map exploration you need to avoid some checkpoints until you get the laser gun so you can die and restart from start point with it.Puzzles are fair and not frustrating. I'm usually super derp with these games since I usually think answers too much and never reach the end, uninstalling the game eventually. But this one felt the right way. Puzzles were easy enough for me, but still give you that feeling of ""Oh! Now I see it"". Overall, I'm happy I made priority with this game over many from my library. Even at full price, the game will give you entertainment and joy. Devs certainly deserved more than 19 cts!Final Mark: 7.5/10			"

												TL;DR - I know my play time looks insane. You will assuredly not get 190 hours of this game, but you will get 2 of the most fun hours you've had gaming in a while. Buy now!As my first foray into speedrunning, this game has given me several dozen hours of entertainment beyond what would be expected by reasonable gamers. But I am trying to be unbiased, and think of this game from a casual standpoint.I still recommend it glowingly.A quirky 2D platformer with a laser-sharp, utilitarian design approach, Out There Somewhere gives you a light dash of shooting combat, a gentle hint of exploration, and a core game built around puzzle-platforming with a 2D teleport gun. It is bookended by space shooter segments that some reviewers have taken issue with - I won't argue with them for finding these segments disjunct, but I still enjoy them anyway.It is worth noting that the pace at which new mechanics are introduced is absolutely stellar - far better than many A-list titles. You get a sense for what each button does, a scenario or two that changes your approach, and then a wholly new element just as you are getting comfortable.It seems like the biggest complaint from most reviewers is the game's short length. Most people should have an easy time earning the ""Swift Success"" achievement on their first play, it's true, but the collectibles should keep completionists occupied for another hour or so after - they even require a little meta-gaming! At a two dollar price point, this is plenty of game for your buck, and it's not often that this caliber of level design, soundtrack, and art style find their way into a two-dollar title.			"

												This is a competent retro 8-bit platformer. But wait! What makes this particular game interesting is the teleport gun: you fire the gun, and you teleport to the point of impact. The developer makes good use of this fact for a variety of puzzles, spiced up by the fact momentum is maintained through the teleport, plus vertical light beams that have different effects on your projectile. There's also a more traditional gun, although to be honest the combat never really felt necessary, apart from a couple of puzzles. It's not that difficult to figure out a way through each room, and in fact there are occasionally different ways of doing so; the difficulty lies in the execution, but thankfully it's not that frustrating.It doesn't last very long, 90 minutes at the most, but I paid $0.19 or something so I'm hardly likely to complain. Nice traditional chiptune music, appealing 8-bit graphics, some secrets to find, and even a space shooter minigame, overall it's worthwhile if you like a bit of puzzling in your 8-bit platforming.

												Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ When I initially saw this game on the store for 25 cents I wasn't sure if a game this cheap would be worth it. However upon downloading and booting up this game I was instantly met with waves of energy and joy. From when I hit ""new game"" I knew I was in for a ride, and what a ride that was. The music controlled the gameplay almost more than I did, forcing me in and out of situations that would seem impossible with the very sound of a note. The ""portal gun"", as one could call it, adds a new depth to the platforming which makes it fun, puzzling, and at some points infuriating. Out There Somewhere is like nothing I have played before, or as I should say, many things I have played before. The developers took Cave Story, Portal, Metroid, and VVVVVV and spat out one of the best indie games I have played in the past few years. I recommend this game to everyone who loves difficulty (while still beign fair), a simple yet entertaining narrative, and just some sweet bumpin' tunes. So what do you have to lose? With a full price of 4.99 and a sale orice of 0.25 (canadian), this game is a steal. I give it a solid 9.5/10			"

												Low-res puzzle platformers are almost literally a dime a dozen now but Out There Somewhere manages to stand apart by being polished and clever with its core mechanic. That mechanic is a teleport gun, which fires a bullet that teleports you to its point of impact. The teleport preserves your momentum as well, so if you start a jump right before you warp, you can essentially tele-walljump. Several puzzles make use of this and other neat physics tricks you can do with yourself, gradually nudging the difficulty up in a pleasant, inviting way that has you feeling clever and masterful by the end of the game. There's a little combat with enemies and a few secrets to hunt if you are so inclined, but it's a very short and sweet package... one playthrough will last you less than an hour. I certainly wish it was longer because it is very tight and fun for those 45 minutes, but what's there is more than worth playing. There's even some inklings of plot and some interaction with aliens as you traverse the odd little world, and neat opening and closing sequences that play like Gradius-style shooters. And if you really feel like sticking with it, there are a mess of oddly-grindy achievements to shoot for, though I wouldn't encourage it. Overall a great little experience for even the most jaded puzzle platformer player.			"

												Although the story is not something that will take hours to go through, this game is worth the price. It is a kind of game that you will replay—it has achievements that you likely cannot get in just a few playthroughs. There are hidden easter eggs to be found as well. The soundtrack is fun and the graphics are rather nice too. I've played through the story once and know I will several more times as well, for I still have things to find and achievements to get.

												SPOILERS AHEAD! In a sense this is actually 2 games, so I will talk about them separately. The shmup section was short but sweet, I am terrible at these kinds of games but I enjoyed it. My only issue is that your gun won't fire at full speed if you hold down the button, requiring you to mash for the most damage potential. I died as soon as the boss shot his laser, and though I'd need to restart until...The puzzle-platforming section, which is the meat of the game. Crashing on the planet and needing to find ship parts (conveniently the same model as the shmup upgrades) reminded me of Knytt (in a good way), and so did the slower pace and early lack of combat. Puzzle progress felt steady and fun, though the ""double shot"" puzzle I managed to solve without learning the proper trick, stunting my progress in the next few rooms. I really enjoyed having a ""teleport"" gun instead of a ""portal"" gun, which felt very fresh as a mechanic. Combat was passable, with notable frustration trying to hit the flying bats, and not knowing how long the boss would take to defeat. The biggest issue I had was with NPC conversations, ending the conversation would not close the text box right away and another press would start it again; extremely frustrating.Going back to shmup at the end was unexpected and exciting, and I didn't die to the laser! I was a bit sad that it ended, but that title call-out was a great wrap up to the story. The art and sound were excellent throughout, with a special mention to alien NPC designs.			"

												Short, but enjoyable.I beat ""Somewhere Out There"" in about an hours time, but by no means to completion. Despite this, I whole heartedly recommend this game. It's a clever little puzzle platformer that harkens back to some of the classics in the genre. The story, while short, is interesting and the music is memorable and entertaining to listen to.My only real beef is with the very plain graphics. The character sprites and the portraits are so nice, I wish that the backgrounds had some of the same attention given to them. The game just looks plain. Take a look at a game like Rex Rocket for an example of how beautiful a game like this can be. Fortunately, ""Out There Somewhere"" is saved by it's fantastic platforming, which is really all that matters anyway.			"

(jesus I love them but i hate them at the same time......)- Too short, way too short..- What makes the game take long are the puzzles and the time you get stuck in them but if you are quick to do them it's too short.- Space battle is just 1/5 of the game, it could have more space battle in order to make the game a bit longer as wellOverall:Fun game, good art, good music, good mechanics. All in all I recommend it's a fun game to pass some time tho it is a bit short it is still fun and still worth the money.Score:8/10			"

												Definitely feels like cave story so far - looks good,. worth 19 cents even without the trading cards. Possibly more. Worth getting while the special promotion is up and running,.Too early for me to tell if the whole game is worth 5$ or more, but it's looking good so far.edit1: A bit further into the game, it will get harder, but not by so much that you'll bash your head on the keyboard. Some of the puzzles can even be ""cheated"" by completing them with a bit of clever jumping to avoid the way they were ""intended to be solved"".Some reviews will claim it's about 90 minutes worth of gameplay,. and at the speed that these puzzles are getting solved I'd say that seems about right. Still 19 cents for an hour of something new is good,. but I wouldn't pay 5$ for it. So, get it while it's on discount, or in the next humble bundle.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a 2D platformer with simple puzzle elements. Your mission is take out Grigor, but in the battle your ship was damaged and you crash land on an unknown planet. You have to find him on the planet and take him out for good. This is mostly done by platforming. The main mechanic to get used to is the use of a portal gun. You shoot it and when the projectile hits a solid target you will be teleported to that spot. You'll learn the ins and outs of how that works, along with interacting with different beams and other obstacles that will change the way your teleportation works. There's also a gun you can use as a weapon to fight off the planet's hostile inhabitants. This gun doesn't shoot very rapidly and it's a small bullet, but this only makes it all the more useful as you need to aim carefully and plan your shots. It's simple to grasp but will test your smarts and skills as you try to get the hidden upgrades. The graphics are pixelated and dark. The visuals, along with some cool synth music, make for a nice atmosphere to travel through. There's not a whole lot more to say. Not much story, just some simple mechanics and areas to clear. It's a nice little game.There are some problems, though. All of them seem to stem from the game's legnth. It'll probably only take you 1-2 hours to beat it, and not much more for achievement hunters. That's fine story-wise, as there's not much there outside the premise. However, it seems like more could've been done with the mechanics that were set in place. More puzzles, more ideas with the mechanics, and just some more outside the box thinking. Having a longer game would also mean a larger world, with perhaps more items and powerups to collect. More bosses would've been good. There are two space shooting sections, but having more would've been nice as well. It's neat that those sections start and end the game to kind of tie it up in a nice little bow, but having more of them might make the playstyle feel a little more welcome. A map would've been nice too.Overall, this is a lighter recommendation. The game is nice with simple mechanics and intresting atmosphere, but it's rather short and could use some fleshing out. Perhaps there will be another game by the developers in a similar fashion, or maybe even a sequel to expand upon these ideas, which have a lot of potential. What's here is good, and only taking a while to beat isn't bad, but this game FEELS short. It feels like this style of game should have more to it. It's no Super Metroid, it's no Cave Story, but it's something neat that, if on sale, if worth checking out. Five dollars is a little steep for a Steam game like this, but if you can get it for a few bucks or less, consider it. Out There Somewhere gets a 6 out of 10 for being a neat little adventure that has lots of potential and a satisfying, even if short, experience.			"

Warning: May Contains SpoilersTwo words: wasted potential!I have just finished playing Out There Somewhere and it was a really pleasant experience. However, it was a very SHORT experience indeed.Anyway, let me break it down to details and grade every aspect on its own.ConceptGame starts off as a shoot'em up side-scroller, which really took me by surprise. I mean, judging by the screens you'd rather expect a puzzle platformer and you get that not so long after the game starts, too. And then it just hit me, the brilliance of the idea: you fly, fighting your way to a new planet. Then you land, 'meet the locals' and proceed with the featured mission, which involves solving puzzles, fighting your way forward and doing some cool oldschool platformer type trickjumps. It's just all there. Again, really awesome mix.StoryNot much to say really. No history, no explanations, no nothing. Just fix your ship and welp, you're done. I mean, I didn't really expect to have a Witcher 3 in space, but for the sake of having the player become involved in the game, it really needs something. Tell me a story of a war, rebellion maybe, invasion, whatever, but please share some details with us, not just generic 'Humanity almost extinct, Grigori attacks, protect planet' stuff. I wouldn't even need any cut scenes, just some text scrolling up with a nice background, skippable for those who don't care about such aspects of the game.GraphicsIt's mostly just your basic 'oldschool-nes-like-game-graphics'. Anyway, the art style is pleasant to watch. The only thing that somehow buggered me was that some maps looked a bit mundane and dull, with only same bricks of terrain laid over another same bricks of terrain. Adding more background details and decorations would probably make the game look a bit nicer, but then again, it's not really about the graphics this time, is it?MusicSimple, yet quite atmospheric. It reminds me of the soundtrack of Risk of Rain that is electronic sounds that just really fit the space exploration theme of the game. The musical themes change when you change a map/biome and pretty much all of them are really enjoyable.GameplayThe puzzle part is rather fun, the puzzles are not terribly easy, but also not too complicated. Can't imagine spending 8 minutes trying to beat one though (one of the achievements). As the game progresses, different beams are implemented, which change the behaviour of your teleport gun. The variety of enemies is rather limited - 4 kinds, erasing them is a bit of a chore, spam your gun until they drop dead. The game could feature no enemies and no one would probably miss them. The NPCs remind me the ones in old NES games, like Duck Tales, sometimes you have to sweat a little to get to them, but they might have some useful information or will say some funny things.The shoot'em up part is just there I guess. It covers approx. 5% of a game that lasts for an hour, so you don't really spend too much time in it, shame.ContentI've got only one thing to say about the content - More!. The game needs more planets, more story depth, more types of guns, more types of enemies, more collectibles, more puzzles, more bosses, more flying in space, more technical upgrades to your ship, more play time, more replayability, just literally, more of everything. Honestly, give this game a 10h playthrough time which implements new mechanisms, enemies and bosses gradually, add a decent story, raise the price accordingly and you have a really decent game!To compare, playing this game right now is like getting a new toy, figuring out how it works and suddenly, someone snaps it out of our hands. It just leaves hunger for moreOverallTo sum up, for the price you're going to get this, which is usually less than 1$, this game is totally worth it. But be warned, it literally has an hour of gameplay (exactly 53 minutes on my save file). I really hope that if the next part ever comes, it's going to have a significantly larger budget, which will allow creating a more in-depth experience with some solid (re)play value of at least 10+ hours.

												Very short little game that has a few nice ideas and an overall good quality (if you are not already fed up with pixel art and chiptunes). It could have been longer and more generous (the end is kind of abrupt) but I feel that it would have overstayed its welcome given that it has not the scope of a true metroidvania.Anyway, it offers a good couple of hours of puzzle/platforming with a sensible difficulty curve. Thus, with the original price tag, I truly recommend waiting for sales.			"

-Quick Review-Out There Somewhere is a 2d puzzle platformer with a hint of old arcade-space-shooting at the start and end, making the nice sandwich, which is ""Out There Somewhere"", developed by MiniBoss and released Mar 14, 2016.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: You play as the Protagonist: Small-pixel-man-with-goldfish-bowl-on-head. Goldfish bowl head starts out by flying a ship trying to shoot down space-captain-who's-his-face. (Can you tell none of the names stuck with me?) While the story and plot are pretty forgettable the game controls aren't in the slightest.

Gameplay: The basic controls are straight forward, you move right and left, jump and fire a portal gun, later you unlock a regular gun you can use to kill the various hostile NPC's. The controls work, I have been guilty of mixing up my two fire keybindings, which has resulted in death-by-NPC-face-hugging, or teleportation-into-pits-of-death (For clearification sake, your teleportation gun fires THROUGH NPC's hostile and friendly.), the controls weren't so bad for me, but the game really seems like it was designed more so with a controller in mind.But I'm getting ahead of myself, you start with just a Teleportation Gun, you fire a shot and when it connects with the wall, you teleport to the location of the laser/bullet. You actually have a few tricks you can pull off with the Teleportation gun early on, but don't learn about later in the game, so there is some skill that is developed with the Teleportation gun, rather then fire and teleport.

So once you finish playing the game, and if you start a new game you realize there are many hidden spots in the game that you originally had no idea where there. So that hints at the amount of time it takes to finish the game: it's a pretty short game, think an hour or two on average (Naturally the time to beat the game after your first, will rapidly decrease unless you're trying to find new locations and secrets).While I personally didn't find any of the puzzles too overwhelming, there's definitely plenty of difficulty to keep you mumbling obscenities under your breath as you get murdered again and again. While there's definitely more to the game, and plenty of content to keep you coming back, that's about all there is to say for the gameplay.Conclusion: As a whole, I enjoyed playing this game. This was one of the games I downloaded and played on my laptop while I was on a short little vacation away from my normal habitat. For using on lower powered computers I highly recommend this game, but when it comes to powered up computers that are normally playing MMORPG's or triple A titles... Out There Somewhere is still a pretty good diversion of a game. Pick it up on sale, play for a couple hours, go back to playing something else.

												This is a great little game! Very short (I beat it in under 1 hour), but it was very enjoyable, while it lasted.The visuals are nice, and so is the music. Nothing new in these 2 aspects, but they're faithful to the games that inspired this game and they're well done!The game has one main mechanic, and then some variations that support it. The mechanic is simply a teleport gun. You shoot a pellet that teleports you to it when it hits a wall. That's it. Despite its simplicity, though, it changes movement just enough to be ""surprising"", in some way, reaching escape velocity from ""generic platformer"".The level design is pretty good, always pushing you to use what you've learned about the teleport movement, instead of presenting normal platforms. There are also details spread throughout the game for speedrunners, which gives it another layer for those interested.The one complaint I have is that it is too easy, for the most part. There are hidden health-ups and armor for your ship, but these are mostly inconsequential to the game, so they're there for the extra challenge. Which is ok! The problem is that the game locks you out very often. You cross a certain section, and then you can't go back. This is a bit annoying, since the upgrades seen in one screen may require you to go around from another screen to get. So you may keep pushing forward, looking for the path, and then realize you can't go back... oops.Since the game is 1 hour long, this is not really a problem? But it's not optimal either, I would have prefered the other way.Anyway. Not much more to be said. It's not groundbreaking, but it's a very enjoyable title if you're looking for something quick, but still good!			"

												TL:DR, this game is great for its price. Granted, you'll only get ~5 hours of enjoyment from this but it is still pretty fun.The gameplay is very unique. I haven't seen anything like that in any other game I've played. It got me thinking really hard in the middle (though in the end, it got pretty easy to figure out.The story left quite a bit to be desired, with little to nothing explained about the characters. I leaned more about the main character from watching the trailer posted here than I did playing the game.The game itself felt... incomplete for lack of a better term. Right when I was having fun solving all the puzzles and finally getting the hang of it, the game cut to credits.While the game is short, you have to keep in mind that it is $2. It was a very fun and unique experience to me. I really hope the developers go farther with the gameplay ideas in future projects.			"

												For a game I paid about $0.20 USD for, I got 75 minutes or so of fairly straightforward puzzle-platformer-with-teleport-gun gameplay.  Nothing stood out as exceptional but nothing was lackluster either, which is a plus really considering the price and what someone might expect from the saturated indie platformed genre.  I didnt feel like my time was wasted and I had some fun with it.  I dont particularly like chiptune / bit-aesthetic music. but it was pretty catchy and pleasant to listen to.  The NPC character sprites were also pretty well animated which is a good touch as well.Some players I see complaining about the control scheme.  I could see it as a problem for some, but I'm used to a few similar games so I handled it pretty well.  I didn't test a controller but with the Steam Controller API I don't think it should be much of a problem if you want a custom mapping.All in all, it was good!			"

												Out there somewhere tries to make up for being incredibly short (<2 hours at best) and linear by being teeth grindingly hard. The entire game revolves around mastering trick jumps......and that's about it as far as game play. The only real indication  of it being ""inspired by"" metroid or cave story lays in the graphics and sound. The game looks and sounds great but there just isnt enough game to go with it.			"

												This short platformer's got soul, a cool 8 bit soundtrack and tight controls.I'll skip the story and let you figure that one out for yourselves. The core gameplay consists of platforming, shooting things and using your teleport gun to... well teleport around the place and get over obstacles. There are collectibles scattered all around the place which help you progress more easily and help with the final boss battle.The soundtrack compliments the mood that the artist has set here; marooned on a strange planet of slug creatures, now stop crying, take that teleport gun, fix your ship and get revenge! It's an incredibly fun experience although it is rather short. My first playthrough took me a little bit over an hour and 30 minutes to complete. Second was a bit over 40 minutes and the last speedrun was just under 20 minutes.I wouldn't hesitate getting this game even at full price though I must note that it was on sale with a hefty -96% discount when I bought it.

												This review is going to be a little bit unfair, but then I feel I was misled. At the time of this writing, the ""About"" section describes this game as ""Inspired by games such as Cave Story and Super Metroid"", and it's tagged as a ""Simulation"", ""Strategy"", and ""Metroidvania"" game.It is none of these things. This is a short, hard, linear puzzle platformer, with brief side-scrolling shooter bookends. The game as it is is pretty okay, and I got it on sale, but I spent my entire playtime wondering when the game map was going to open up and I was going to start getting interesting upgrades, which never happened.Bottom line, misleading store page, thumbs down.

												Well, some pixels here and there, few will love it instantly, few will hate, and the rest? Well, they will land on the planet and will die a lot, just because it is fun, challenging and rewarding once they'll master controls and tricks. Storyline isn't complex but it's not a bad thing for Out There Somewhere and yet you feel good once you make progress, and notice as sprites changes. When you found out the pattern of combined challenge and exploration you improve with controls and tricks and overall game experience gets better and better, because every part of the game is like a puzzle, once you start getting whole image game becomes great. Out There Somewhere is casual platformer with nice pixels and enjoyable chiptunes which can take up few hours to complete, depending on your teleporting performance. Play it in a spare moment and you won't regret time spent on Out There Somewhere. Sequel would be nice, tho. 9/10			"

												I've never seen this mechanic before, it's very fun and gives some interesting puzzle platforming. And it is very well explored in the level design. I love the visuals too. Quality pixel art, very cute. The game sits mostly on the easy side. I figured out the mechanics quickly and at worst I died 3 to 4 times on the hardest rooms and sailed through the game in about an hour. The bullet hell sections, however, are pretty hard! at least to me, I hate bullet hell games. It is a very small part of the game, but it makes me wonder about mixing such completely different genres. But I digress. This is not an issue with Out There Somewhere, the spaceship sessions are short and few. It's extremely short though. But without considering price, length is not a very useful piece of information. What I mean by that is I think the game is worth what they are asking for. It's a short, adorable, original and fun little game and it's cheaper than a sandwich. I'm a very satisfied customer.			"

												I purchased this game for $0.19 and I could say that it's worth at least this amount, but it is most certainly not worth the full price. Out There Somewhere has a very brief playtime of about an hour and, as it aesthetically calls back to older games with similar playtimes, this would normally be fine. I say normally because this is where the problem lies - while many games from the era Out There Somewhere seeks to mimic can technically be finished in an hour or less, they are usually challenging enough (though not necessarily always for good reasons) to occupy players for hours before they can scrape by with a victory. Out There Somewhere, on the other hand, simply poses so little challenge for the vast majority of its duration that I can count the number of rooms with any sense of difficulty from either the puzzles or the platforming on a single hand (4).This is a case of a game where the concept simply does not live up to its full potential. The teleport gun is a neat mechanic, but it is a largely wasted one as environmental obstacles and puzzles are repeatedly reused in the same handful of ways - you're going to be shooting at a whole lot of blue beams either halfway up a jump or on the way down from a jump in order to reach a platform a bit farther away. There are a few optional secrets, but as this is primarily a puzzle game it is not really worth the effort to go back through the whole game again if you miss one the first time around.While aesthetically appealing, Out There Somewhere is ultimately an unsatisfactory experience as it is lacking in narrative, challenge, and, other than the concept itself, any real sense of creativity.

												Out there somewhere is a really interesting 2D platfomer where you have to use a portal gun to move on to the next level. The game has a really great soundtrack and overall a pretty interesting idea. It has a pretty boring story but that's ok in my opinion.The big reason why I can't recommend this game is because of it's ""portal jumping"" mechanic, in the game you can't double jump so what you have to do is shoot your portal gun towards the wall and than jump in mid-air. It's very difficult to control and really hard to master. So a large part of this game is really just trying to get to a certain platform by portal jumping, with not much else going on.I got this game for about $0.51 when it was on sale so I can't really complain too much, but for me this game is definitely not worth the $2 price tag. Maybe if you're overflowing with money than this might not seem like that big of a deal to you, but for those of us who are on a budget and don't have too much cash than spend your money on something else "

There's also a small shoot-em-up minigame done in the same style.

The Short:-Short and sweet way to get your platforming fix.The Thick::Pros::Interesting platforming dynamics made possible with unique teleport gun.Short enough to enjoy entire game in single play session.Priced fairly for what you get out of it (right now it is 1.99 USD and can be bought in indie bundle as well)Enjoyable throughout.::Cons::Really short. I continued my save file after the credits rolled in disbelief that the end came that quickly.NPCs are obnoxious. Most of them have nothing important to say and just get in the way of the gameplay flow.The platforming portion of the singular boss battle can be forced to only use his first two attacks simply by getting enough (like 3) attacks off on him during each cycle. This makes for an incredibly simple boss battle that felt more like just another platforming room rather than a boss.There is no real incentive to collect the optional ship parts. The shoot-em-up section of the boss battle is doable without upgrading the ship.Spoilers: Forced cliffhanger ending where the villian is still ""Out there somewhere.""Random Thoughts:I dunno... this game really makes me wonder if the developer didn't have a strict plan for what they wanted to make. The existance of relatively numerous NPCs suggest that there was going to be more of a purpose for them. Maybe for lore/world-building purposes? There also is really weird pacing in the game... though it is difficult to describe with the game being so short. I suspect (though I should note I have no idea if this is true) that this was planned to be a longer game. It certainly feels like there should be more (again, the price is very fair for what you get), and like many others seem to be saying, this entire game feels like it should be the tutorial/intro level of a larger game... and I think that was probably the plan initially...Everything points to that theory:An abundance of NPCs most likely for world-buildingStylized artwork for textbox profiles and the rare cutsceneProgressive upgrade system for ship, which could have been spread out over the course of the game, as it felt completely unneccesary for the boss.Short to the point of it being unbelievable that the end falls where it doesSee final item on Cons.I do recommend this game because it's a great concept. I'm just disappointed that it wasn't explored further than it was. Don't get me wrong, I understand the limitations that a small team of developers can bring... I just think this could have been a great game. I'm disapointed not in the game, but in Miniboss for creating such a small game out of a concept with plentiful potential,			"

 Out There Somewhere It's a small game, but bunch of Fun you'll have. :) GamePlay: The gameplay is as simple as the game is and yet sometimes challenging. At the beginning you'll have no weapon, which will change very soon till you get a teleport gun!Teleporter gun: You can shoot with this gun and the time it hits an object you'll teleport to this point. Anyway this is just the half impressive part of it, because you can jump and while you're moving upward you can teleport yourself, but the physic of moving upward keeps. This is the part where it becomes a bit tricky to time you shoots.Normal gun: Additional to the telegun you'll also receive a normal gun to shoot enemies. If you acquire the additional upgrade you'll shoot faster and deadlier which makes the run way easier.This is the Charakter Gameplay. There are also objects in the world which tries to build up riddles for you. ;)I love the idea. <3 (One point loss because it's really short 1h 20min. first run. :/ I wish I could be longer)★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ Graphics: The graphics is a pixelstyle and not very impressive.^^ It looks very nice, but I just cannot give all points!★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ Story: The Story is also well made. ""Brevity is the soul of wit!"" this is something fitting to its story. It's indeed not very long, probably because of the length of the game, but you don't forget storypart which confuse you in futher progress.I really liked it. With some nice Cutscenes and dialogue.★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Leveldesign: If you want all Achievements then you should know that you have to visit (nearly) every screen in this game. literally!There are screens with no name and you'll have to see them to get the 107% Achievement. (I think it's pretty obvious why it's called 107%. :p)The normal screens are well created to make puzzles, as I've said it befor. ↑ up there ↑I don't see any reason to give less than the max. points.^^★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Music: My favorite part of any game with good music recommendation. <3 Well, this game contains so many good soundtracks.

												A short but very replayable game, especially for speedrunners and achievement hunters. The puzzles are devious but well designed and it's fun to use the teleport beam in clever ways. Some of the moves are pretty tricky to pull off with some very strict timing required and might be frustrating to inexperienced players. An experienced platformer player might get through this in about an hour- there's an achievement for speed-running it in less than 20 minutes and I managed to do it in 15 after some practice. At full price this is a good buy- at 19p in the sales, it's a no-brainer.			"

												Bought it for 50 cents, but I would have gladly paid full price and beyond for this game. It's a charming platformer that manages to be challenging without being impossibly so. It utilizes creative gameplay mechanics that revolve around a gun that teleports you, which adds a puzzle-like quality to getting through some of the screens. It also has a fantastic soundtrack.My only disappointment with the game is how short it is, because I want more.			"

												Puzzle games don't have to be difficult to be stimulating. Out There Somewhere keeps my brain stimulated with constantly changing and quality music, scenery, and puzzles. It doesn't revolutionize, but it's still a very polished and solid experience. I think full price is asking a bit much for the short length, but you know how Steam works. Add the game to your wishlist and grab it when it goes on sale for around $1.99. I for one, got it on sale for $0.19. Needless to say, totally worth it.			"

												I forgot what this game was about or how much I had paid for it. Decided to boot it to see what it was about and was welcomed with a shmup. Nothing all that exciting but it did look nice. Then you're introduced to the bigger part of the game, which is a puzzle platformer of sorts.I was immediately very impressed by the quality of the game, visually first then everything after. The puzzles were smart but not very complex; not that they were not enjoyable.I thought I was just starting and next thing I know, and hour or so later, I finished the game. I was a disappointed, especially considering how highly I regarded the game. It showed so much promise.Then I went to the store page and saw that the game is actually 1$. And I'm fairly certain I bought it on sales.I don't really feel like playing through it again right now but it was a lot of fun while it lasted and if you are up for it, you can complete more than one playthrough to get more hidden stuff. It's well, well worth the 1$, very short but very high quality.No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, no pointless fillers, this game doesn't try to make up for what it lacks in content by throwing tedious stuff in. Just the essential, just what you need to have fun.			"

The ""Portal"" concept in a 2D Platformer works brilliant, though it could've been used in way more fun ways. Like I said, it's worth for the small price and has some cool achievements to unlock.

												I can only recommend this game at the price I got it at, $0.19. At that price, it's well worth it. At the price listed, it's really not. The game throws you onto an alien world in a story that tries to be more than it is. If this game is part of a series, something would be explained, but on its own it is unremarkable. The big hook to the game is that you have a teleporting gun that allows you to warp to wherever you hit with the gun. You retain your momentum, so much like Portal you encounter some interesting puzzles. The puzzles are seldom difficult, with the only real difficulty coming from the imprescision you deal with. Occasionally you'll encounter something where you have to think in order to proceed, but I got through these by just shooting and somehow ending up where I needed to be. There is a secondary weapon that damages enemies as well. It was a good choice to introduce this weapon, as it does introduce some variety in the gameplay. However, the weapon never quite ""feels"" right. It's hard to explain. Combat, for what there is of it, feels frustrating, especially when you fail later in the room and have to do it over again. Still, having the gun does add to the gameplay. When you die, you respawn quickly. This is good since you will want to try again quickly, but sometimes it can lead to you dying 2 or 3 times in a row because you're still moving when you spawn. This futher compounds the difficulty of a particularly tough puzzle.The game lasts about 45 minutes. I enjoyed most of my time with it, and there are some interesting obstacles introduced throughout, but I did find myself wishing things would get mixed up a little more towards the end, or just wanting the game to end. Overall, there's a lot of potential here. The teleporter gun brings some neat ideas, and the environments are well built around the mechanic. And it's worth the price at 96% off. It's a nice little game, that shows that the developer has a lot of upward potential for their next games.			"

												I can recommend this game, but not at the price they're charging. The game is extremely short - one or two hours long. It feels like it's over just as soon as you've figured out how to play. The controls are interesting, but they don't feel all that tight. (They're not bad, but not great either.) The graphics, sound, and music get the job done but aren't particularly compelling. The level design is pretty decent, but not great. There is some mildly humorous dialog. All-in-all, it's a decent game, but it's just so short.Get the game if it's on sale, maybe.			"

Product received for free
												A space metrovania game. I believe i got this game for free as a gift from a friend if i recall.Anyways this game is quite short. Notice my time above the review? That is how long it took me to beat the game. Be aware i probably did not find every secret or searched the levels extensively.One thing i found annoying about this game was the fact on some maps your forced to go only one way, even though the game is clearly meant to be like a metrovania game that should let you go back to older maps, but some maps it is incredibly hard, if not impossible to do.Because of the way the maps are, i cannot recommend this game. Playing it again got very repetitive very fast. If your into these type of games, this might be fun for you...but due to shortness, very difficult traversing maps, and also, the music was a bit bland to me.			"

The puzzles are bothe simple and yet confusing for a first time through and yet when you figure it out you will be wondering how you couldn't see the solution earlier if i could nitpick one thing it's that there is no way to turn off the tutorials if you intend on a second playthrough. Also i sold the cards from it for 18 pence so i came out with a great game and financial profit.			"

												I picked this game up for about 20 whole cents, and boy, can I ever say it was worth it.My first playthrough lasted me about an hour, but at the end, I felt satisfied. Since then, I've played through the game several more times to explore, collect, and just speed through it. Out There Somewhere doesn't do much, I'll say that. However, what it does, it does VERY well. I'm still thirsting for more.The controls for the game felt tight and I had no issues with moving, shooting, or jumping (I use a controller). Not once did I feel like I could blame the game for falling or dying. It was just a matter of getting faster with the timing, or better at positioning.As far as sound goes, the music is incredibly well done. There are several tracks in the game that change as you progress through the different areas. A few of the tracks are just mindblowingly good for how small the game is. As for sound effects, there aren't an awful lot, but they aren't ear grating which is nice.Aesthetically, the game looks wonderful. If the audio wasn't enough to tell you that Cave Story was an inspiration, the visuals will help remind you. I find the graphics to be very pleasing and easy on the eyes, and it's very easy to tell the different mechanics apart so the puzzles don't feel as frustrating to figure out.Finally, the gameplay. The gameplay is very basic. You can run, you can shoot your portal, and you can shoot your gun. Not much else to it, but that isn't a bad thing. The puzzles aren't overly difficult, either, but there is definitely a learning curve to them. My first time playing, I'd take a few minutes to figure out some of the puzzles. In later playthroughs, it's fun to see just how fast you can get through the puzzles that had stumped you before. Just because the puzzles aren't overly difficult doesn't detract from how rewarding it is to solve them.Overall, the game is very well done. For just $0.20, I'd say it's absolutely worth it. Even for $5.00, I'd say it's worth it if you plan to play through the game multiple times, trying to complete it. Out There Somewhere was a surprising hit, and I'm absolutely glad that I purchased it.			"

												This game is an incredibly fun 2D platformer that plays similar to Metroid, albeit with a much greater emphasis on platforming puzzles than shooting and exploration. I haven't played Portal, but from what I gather, this is what Portal would be like if it were a 2D game.The controls are perfect, and the game even detects and gives accurate input suggestions for my original Xbox controller that I am using via an unofficial USB adapter and the XBCD third party driver.For the great asking price, you almost can't afford not to give this game a try if you need something fun to play. It's worth getting simply to listen to the catchy music.The developer has really impressed me with this title. Bravo!			"

												Somewhat simple to solve plattformer. In my first attempt I needed under an hour, and there wasn't really a puzzle that made me ponder more than a few moments. (However, I do have a long history of plattformer experience, so it might be a decent difficulty for casual gamers and beginners)Its still a charming game though. I liked the bouncy retro graphics, the ""all your base are belong to us""esque-cutscenes with the very flat dialogues and even enjoyed the music in this short retro flashback.So: If you can get it really cheap on a sale like I did, and enjoy oldschool puzzle plattformers with a relaxing difficulty, I don't think you can go wrong with it. The full prize would've been too high for my taste though.			"

So that's where you, the reader, comes in....A very small, yet very awesome game! I'm sad this game is quite short (1 hour to complete it), but there are, of course, secrets, puzzles and secret puzzles on your way. There is also a small batch of achievements waiting for you to unlock. So you might be sticking longer on this game when you want to go 100%.The greatest thing I like of this game is the gameplay which reminds me of:- VVVVVV- Portal- Risk of RainIt's so lovely to wander through the game. Everything feels so smooth and fitting, even the OST. Favorite thing of this game: Player walking animation.As said, the game is short and the mechanics are simple, but for 1 euro you should definitely buy this game!Rating: 8/10			"

Puzzles hit that sweet spot for me, where they're satisfying to finish but never frustrating.Begins and ends with a simple shmupy segment, again short and simple and fun.A Good Game.			"

												Simple and short but extremely fun and creative little platform/puzzle game. This game was made by a very small team, and it's a really impressive achivement! You've got an extremely limited move set - you can jump around, you can fire a teleport beam, and you eventually get a blaster - but you'll use that limited move set in a wide variety of funny, clever, unexpected ways. There were so many times where I thought, ""Oh, this trick move won't work"", and then it did! So then what if I jump off here and then shoot my beam there, but before I land, I jump and then...oh, that worked too! The game is just full of surprises like that and all these puzzles that test your creativity, logic, and ability to exploit the mechanics. I also really like the pixel graphics - the art style is charming and memorable. I don't actually have any real critiques here! It's a short game, but it never outstays its welcome. There are even a decent amount of secrets and it'll take you a while to really collect everything. On top of all of these strengths, Out There Somewhere is really cheap - it even often goes on sale for something like 25 cents. You can't beat that! You can wait for one of those super cheap sales if you like, but this is an awesome little game at any price. In fact, this is probably one of the best deals on Steam, bar none.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a 2014 platformer developed by unknown studio Miniboss. Another in a long line of Super Metroid lookalikes, it's enjoyed some success mainly due to being incredibly cheap. But rather then simply riding on the coattails of Super Metroid (or Knytt, as it were), Out There Somewhere proves to be an enjoyable linear puzzle platformer, with a teleportation mechanic that features conservation of momentum similar to Portal (though the two have no real similarity beyond that).  It's no metroidvania by any stretch of the imagination - most of the ""upgrades"" are for an endgame effect that doesn't amount to much, and outside of that venture there's a total of 5 collectibles. Instead of playing a retro pixel wannabe, I played a well-paced linear adventure, that nevertheless isn't perfect. Most of the pacing is due to just how short it is - a playthrough won't run you longer than an hour (15 minutes if you know what you're doing) and the sheer lack of enemy variety becomes apparent on subsequent playthroughs. Add to that, that while the sprites are well designed and look quite nice on inspection (thankfully, not using the retro clause of pixel art to turn out subpar product) the very poorly handed tiling and lack of visual noise make the game's art look much more amateur than it really is.This is most readily apparent during the intro and outro space battles. With a closer look, you can see the spaceships slowly rotating, the metal sheens and the sci fi aesthetic shining through, when taken as a whole it looks so empty and barren that you could mistake it for a first-year highschooler's Game Maker project. These aren't particularly pressing issues; Out There Somewhere suffers from a lack of talking points. This isn't a particularly interesting game, and for all the secrets thrown into its linear world or the cool design of the protagonist, if this game hadn't gone for 20 cents then I wouldn't be recommending it. I wouldn't have even bought it. I've played Newgrounds games with more lasting value. At $5, I wouldn't recommend it unless you're the type that goes for 100% completion. At the ridiculous sales price, I fully recommend Out There Somewhere as a snack-sized short romp to pace out the larger, more memorable videogames.			"

												When Steams summer sale was going, I decided to buy lots of 19 cent games, because why not. Without saying, almost everyone of those games seemed to be... below avarage and usually end up idling cards for them, but this game was a nice exeption. When I opened the game what I found was really well polished indie puzzle platformer. It doesn't offer anything majorly groundbreaking nor flashy, but because everything feels, looks and sounds really nice, it kept me interested in it. Pacing seems great with new mechanics introduced slowly, once gotten hang of the momentum mechanic controls feel tight and music makes you want to keep going even after several deaths. Only negative may be that it's an hour experience, for some it may not feel like worthwhile to give money, but there's something great about beating game in single day and it's freaking cheap!Shout out to awesome soundtrack as well: https://miniboss.bandcamp.com/releases- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Kun Steamissa oli kesäalennukset, päätin muuten vain ostella paljon 19 sentin pelejä. Sanomattakin melkein kaikki niistä oli... keskivertoa huonompia ja suurimmasta osasta tyydyin saamaan kortit, mutta tämä peli oli mukava poikkeus tähän. Kun avasin pelin huomasin sen olevan hyvin viimeisen päälle kiillotettu indie tasohyppely pulmapeli. Se ei tarjoa mitään maata räjäyttävää tai kiiltävää, mutta koska kaikki tuntuu, näyttää ja kuulostaa erittäin hyvältä, se piti minut kiinnostuneena. Pelin tahti tuntuu hyvältä ja uusia mekaniikkoja tulee hitaalla tahdilla vastaan, kun vauhtimekaniikkaan pääsee sisälle kontrollit tuntuvat tiukoilta ja musiikki pitää pelissä vaikka olisi juuti kuollut muutamaan kertaan. Ainoa negatiivinen asia taitaa olla että se on todellakin vain tunnin mittainen, joka voi joillekin olla ehkä liian pieni kokemus josta pitäisi maksaa, mutta se tunne että pääsee pelin läpi yhdessä päivässä on erittäin mukava ja se on järkyttävän halpaa! Myös maininta mahtavalle pelin soundtrackille: https://miniboss.bandcamp.com/releases "

For $5 it just isn't.  There's little challenge, and while the graphics work and sounds and music are great throwbacks to old school gaming, the game play gets boring fast.  I may go back and play another hour someday to try to get all the achievements or something, but story and game play wise there is zero replay value.  Worth it at $0.19, not worth it for much more.

But no, it turned out really was the end, and Steam says I only played 56 minutes.Also, don't be fooled by anyone who says this draws inspiration from Super Metroid. It absolutely doesn't.

												Out There Somewhere is a platformer/shooter game in which you find yourself crash landed on a distant planet far from your home world. At first it may seem to be more along the lines of an ""R-Type""-esque scrolling shooter, but that only lasts for a moment. Stranded, you need to find a new power core for your space ship so you may return from being ""Out There Somewhere"".The gameplay is simple to grasp but it has several nuances that require a great deal of practice in order to master. Using the WASD keys you move your character back and forth, and you use the x and c button to shoot your portal gun and use something else found later in the game ( no need to spoil that ). While the controls at first may seem a bit wonky (nor is there an option to remap the keys), with a little time it is not hard to get used to them. Your teleporter gun will be your main mode of transportation and movement. While the game is inspired by Portal, instead of using the one end spits out another end, your teleporter gun changes your location to match where the bullet hits a wall. One of the cool mechanics surrounding this is that your momentum before you teleport is maintained after the teleport, allowing you to jump just before impact to scale walls you normally would not be able to get over.The music in the game is a pleasent albeit repetitive set of chiptunes, each unique area having its own sound. There is an option to turn off the music present in the main settings (along with various in-game sounds). Story is minimal at best, and history is presented through both the visuals and interactions you will have the inhabitants of this planet.Gameplay: 9Music: 8Story: N/AMechanics/Controls: 9Overall: 8.75/10The game itself is very solid although it is very short, at $5 it is definitely worth the look. It also often goes on sale for as low as $0.19, and at that price the game is a must buy for anybody that enjoys platformers (while the trading cards will also cover the price as well).			"

												a short, adorable, little game and it's cheaper than a sandwich.The first thing you'll notice are the cute animated cutscenes. They are fairly short and clickable when you have read the subtext. You then are thrown into a sideways space invader type game with increasingly powerful weapons, ship upgrades, and enemies. This is a sort of trick though because when you get damaged down to one heart, and this won't take long, another cutscene flashes and you end up on a planet. This ground portion is a side view 2D platformer like Starbound or Terraria. Most of the game is this ground portion. You are taught some basics like how to jump and are eventually introduced to a wicked cool teleport gun similiar to Chell's gun in Portal. More games should have portal making abilities. You'd think more people are thinking with portals by this point. I digress. You will use this gun and platforming to complete puzzles. Eventually you will encounter the boss and beat the game, unlike me. I was unable to beat the game because timing things and puzzles usually fill me with rage rather than joy. Also a minor framerate issue. I was consistently getting an unplayable (5 fps) framerate on planet. If this issue happens to you then store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds. <--DON'T ABUSE THIS SYSTEMYou'll love the pixel art and upbeat music. You will bob your upper body and head like a slowly wiggling fish. If you use a gamepad or whatever you will be content. However, if you seek mouse support in menues or in the game you will have to keep seeking. The English, French, and Portuguese languages are available via a toggle in the options menu. The ingame menu is limited so don't expect to change volume or controls outside of the main menu at the start of the game. This game has a unique menu option to show or hide playtime. Thank you diegzumillo for inspiring me to play and review this game from your review!I received a key for this game without requirements or contract.:( This game is restricted to unfree Windows/Macintosh software.

												Relatively short little platformer taking ~2 hours to beat, but good fun nonetheless. The game focuses mainly on the use of a portal gun to deal with various, some relatively challenging, physics-based puzzles. While the game is somewhat devoid of much of a plot line, I could look past it with the humble attempts at humor and the nice aesthetics in the 16-bit graphical style. I grabbed this one in the summer sale and can safely say I can see no finer way spending $0.19.			"

												""Inspired by Cave Story, Metroid, and Portal""I think a better mashup is Cave Story, R-type, and Portal (with a much smaller scope). I didn't personally get the Metroid vibes.Out There Somewhere is a fun short game (I beat it in about 45 minutes) with good aesthetics and decent level of difficulty. It may only leave you wanting more, as the whole game feels more like a ""first stage"" than a complete game. It definitely has the potential to be something much greater, but overall, I still recommend it. I'd make sure to grab it on sale though, as in my mind, the game is too short for the full price.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a exploration platformer with a mechanic of teleportation. You control Yuri on his quest to repair his ship and escape the planet he crashed on. Armed with a teleportation gun which allows you to fire a shot and then teleport where it lands, you must use this mechanic to your advantage to progress.This game makes excellent use of its core mechanic. The platforming feels solid and incorporates the telegun very well. The difficulty curve feels right, gradually increasing so the player has to use what they have learned in prior levels in new and different ways. Progressing requires quick reflexes and some thinking, and death isn't a hindrance due to instant-respawn. The aesthetic of the game is great, with pixel visuals, and the chiptune soundtrack adds to the feel. The game is a bit short, however. It took me about an hour of gametime to beat the game on my first run, and it left me wanting more. What the game provides is excellent and leaves me wanting more, which could have easily been added. The final boss felt a little underwhelming and could probably have used the game's mechanics better. Overall, I rate Out There Somewhere a 8/10, on the basis that the game is a bit short.			"

												Well, today this game is on sale for 20 cents so you're probably buying it anyway. It's quite a tricky little platformer with a jump/teleport mechanic and a fair share of puzzles to accompany it. Unfortunately it's very short; it took me 75 minutes to beat it the first time. It has collectible energy tanks so you could play it again and 100% it for some replay value. But in a way it's comparable to VVVVVV; it doesn't overuse its mechanics, which explains the fact that it's not very long. So a pretty balanced game for (basically) free.			"

												Hoooly crap this game is SO good. i cant believe its this cheap. If you like Portal and platform based games, this is for you... Because this game is basically the combination of those. If you want to spend a fun hour or so, but dont want to spend too much money, this game is for you; And even then, if you really like it (like me), you can try to complete achievements or speedrun (or both) which is what I do. The game itsleft lasts for 1-2 hours, (which is completely worth your money taking in account how cheap it is btw) and if you are a completionist or a speedrunner like me, this game can easily give you up to 10 hours of fun or even more. And its not just the play time; its the play value... Every single minute of this game is just pure fun. Its cheerfull, clever, it has perfect pacing and makes and its puzzles never get too easy or too hard. TL,DR: Amazing game, incredibly fun and unbelievably cheap. Give it a try, Im sure you can spare the money, I promise you wont regret it.			"

												Man, what a neat little game. It's unfortunately rather short, which is about the only bad thing I could say about it. The game's mostly based around the teleportation gun mechanic, which lends itself well to a lot of neat puzzles and platforming. Momentum is conserved through jumping so you can use it to gain extra height on a jump and get places you otherwise wouldn't be able to. Even in the small game world there's a ton of secrets tucked away and collecting them all does give you a health boost (and ship boost at the end of the game). It's really quite fun and the game does a lot even with its short length to keep things varied and interesting. The final boss is a bit weak/simplistic, I suppose, but the level design is great throughout to make up for it. Considering that it's currently $.19 USD on steam right now, there's no real excuse not to pick this one up and give it a shot.			"

It requires some quick reflexes and basic puzzle solving skills but generous checkpoints means it's not too hard or frustrating. Good retro styled graphics and music, and it controls well (I played with a 360 gamepad). Takes about 1-2 hours to beat. If that length is worth the price is up to you to decide, but at 96% off it certainly was for me. No complaints, really.			"

												I bought this game for 0,19€ during sales and I feel like I stole the game.The game's quality is well worth it's price (4,99€)^^. Review (SPOILERS!!)Graphics-The graphics are pixelated and are really nice to look at.They kinda remind me of Cave Story ^^. Gameplay-The gameplay is really interesting.You have a ship during the opening section and it's kinda like those arcade space shooters where you go up and down and shoot things that are coming infront of you.After the first short ship section is over you are able to walk on the ground, you have a portal gun but it's nothing like the one from ,,Portal series"" more like a Teleport gun. The teleport gun teleports you when the projectile hit's a wall or something else and it makes for some pretty clever ways to pass trough an obstacle. You can find a gun at some point an you can kill enemies with it. There are hidden ship parts an heart containers, the ship parts can be used to upgrade your ship for the final boss battle and the heart containers to make you capable of taking more hits before kicking the bucket. There are only 2 ship sections in the game and they are : Introduction section and final boss ^^. Story-The story is very simple, your space ship is under attack by a notorious villain called Grigori and at the first ship part of the game your ship gets damaged and you crash on an unknown planet. You (the captain of the ship) need to repair your ship and catch Grigori.Grigori is finally defeated by the end of the game or is he?Maybe he is still ,, Out There Somewhere"" Pros +Stage Design.                                        +Music suits                                   the game                                    perfectly.+Good cutscene Art.+Responsive controls.+Fluid sprite animation.+More than one wayto complete the game.+Cards are easy to get.Cons-Kinda Short.-Some music tracksare forgettable.-,,But How?"" Achievment is buggy and sometims you won't get it.(try window mode to get it)Verdict     9,2/10I would honestly pay to see a sequel ^^ "

												Out There Somewhere is a 2D platformer game which would have fit right in back on the NES. While the graphics are probably a bit better than what would have been around back then in some places, on the whole this is a pixel graphics game whose gameplay harkens back to a much simpler time.You play Yuri, a space cop in hot pursuit of Grigori, some sort of bad guy. You start out trying to shoot down his ship, fail, and then have to travel across the planet to confront him and collect a light orb to repower your ship and beat him down in the end-game.The game is very simple. It claims to be inspired by Cave Story, Super Metroid, and Portal, but honestly it is its own thing, and not very much like any of those games. It is very linear, there isn’t much of a plot, and it is very centered around its central game mechanic – a teleportation gun.When Yuri fires his gun, he gets teleported to wherever it hits, with whatever momentum he presently has being preserved. He cannot teleport if he is already right next to the surface he would be teleporting to.He can also jump.These two mechanics make up pretty much all of the gameplay in the game. You do eventually get a gun you can kill monsters and destroy certain blocks with partway through the game, which opens up a few more puzzles, but most of the game is centered around platforming with the teleportation gun – including one room towards the end of the game with no platforms in it at all, which the player scales by shooting shots across the room, landing, then jumping just as the shot hits the far wall.The game cost 50 cents on sale, and is extremely short – this is the sort of thing you can beat in a single sit down. I was pretty heavily achievement and secret hunting and beat the game in 89 minutes my first time through. All that’s left at that point is trying to figure out how to acquire the last few secrets, many of which are pretty devious (such as requiring you to go through about a third of the game without saving once so you can die and respawn at the very start with the block-destroying gun, in order to acquire one of the secrets).Was it worth 50 cents and an hour and a half of my time? I can’t say I wasn’t entertained by it, but it wasn’t high-quality entertainment – the game is decent enough as what it is, but it is not exactly aiming for the stars. If you like 2D platformers with simple, straightforward mechanics, this is probably a decent choice for you; if you like nice graphics, complex gameplay, a sophisticated story, or anything else like that, you’ll probably be disappointed by this game.

												This game is extremely fun. I've replayed it numerous times trying to get all the achievements and trying to beat my fastest time.  It's quite a short game but you can spend ages on it.  The puzzles are challenging and require some skill although they can be done with some practice.  I'd say definitely get it, the price is tiny, and you will definitely feel that it is worth the meagre price you paid.  Also, a great bonus are the trading cards, and an 'easy' perfect game.  Oh, and the soundtrack is amazing.			"

If their is i would buy it, I think dev should think about making either multiple planets in either an update, DLC or sequel as i was hoping their would be more then one planet but still worth your time and money!

												Here's a short and fun puzzle platformer using a teleporter gun mechanic (different from Portal). It requires some quick reflexes and basic puzzle solving skills but generous checkpoints means it's not too hard or frustrating. Good retro styled graphics and music, and it controls well (I played with a 360 gamepad). Takes about 1-2 hours to beat. If that length is worth the price is up to you to decide, but at 96% off it certainly was for me. No complaints, really.			"

												Really great little game! I was genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed it. (Especially the *second* playthrough!)The game starts with the basics of the teleport gun, and introduces more advanced nuances as you go, requiring you to think how to use the environment and your new techniques to overcome platforming ""puzzles"".  Many of them require quick timing, especially the later ones.  By the end of the game, it leaves you feeling very clever, and with a great feeling of accomplishment.And this is what got me super excited when after beating the game I went back and played through a second time, and suddenly realized there were a ton of new areas/secrets that I could now reach. Areas I could have reached all along, if I had only known the techniques before.There is actually still a secret I have yet to be able to reach, as I am playing without looking at any guides. I think I have figured out how to do it, but it requires amazing split-second timed jumps and shots. I'm enjoying the attempt though!Sure, you could blow throw the game in an hour or so, but finding all the secrets and/or trying to get all the achievements adds a lot more value, and replayability.  If you like clever platformers, give it a go! "

												The Good:Very fun teleporting mechanicRetro graphicsFunny little premiseCharming old school musicCheapThe Bad:Still pretty short even though it's cheapPotential to crash, but not gamebreaking due to many checkpointsOut There Somewhere is really good, and I liked it a lot, but I sort of wish it was fleshed out more. The vast majority of the game is simple puzzle platforming with a teleport gun with a small scroll shooter segment at the beginning and end. I understand this is indie and short, but I liked it so much I wish there were more planets and scroll shooter segments to play. You encounter some alien species and a few power-ups for your ship, but it's only for one more shooter segment. I think it would be cool to extend this idea into a larger game with explorable planets and just more of the same fun.I recommend this game because it's great and very fun, but it is short. Buy on sale if possible.			"

												Man, what a neat little game. It's unfortunately rather short, which is about the only bad thing I could say about it. The game's mostly based around the teleportation gun mechanic, which lends itself well to a lot of neat puzzles and platforming. Momentum is conserved through jumping so you can use it to gain extra height on a jump and get places you otherwise wouldn't be able to. Even in the small game world there's a ton of secrets tucked away and collecting them all does give you a health boost (and ship boost at the end of the game). It's really quite fun and the game does a lot even with its short length to keep things varied and interesting. The final boss is a bit weak/simplistic, I suppose, but the level design is great throughout to make up for it. Considering that it's currently $.19 USD on steam right now, there's no real excuse not to pick this one up and give it a shot.			"

It has collectible energy tanks so you could play it again and 100% it for some replay value.

												At $5 I'd say this one's worth it, with a great concept with well thought out puzzles and a world with a great design alongside a really good soundtrack (in my opinion). For less than a gumball, you'd be crazy to pass it up if you're a fan of puzzles/platformers. The only negative I could find about this game is that it's not really too long, but at the price you can't really ask for much more.			"

												If it's on sale, buy it, even if you don't like it you can get your money back from selling the cards, besides, it's one of the best puzzle platformers I played, even if it's short it still gives you quite some fun.9/10, music is a bit annoying and the game could be longer, otherwise, it's great.

												This game is an excellent platformer with a twist. The puzzles may be a bit simple, but the timing required sometimes isn't. It reminds me of ""My First Quantum Translocator"". The game is a bit short, though it has plenty of replay value if you try to get all of the achievements.			"

												Really great little game! I was genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed it. (Especially the *second* playthrough!)The game starts with the basics of the teleport gun, and introduces more advanced nuances as you go, requiring you to think how to use the environment and your new techniques to overcome platforming ""puzzles"".  Many of them require quick timing, especially the later ones.  By the end of the game, it leaves you feeling very clever, and with a great feeling of accomplishment.And this is what got me super excited when after beating the game I went back and played through a second time, and suddenly realized there were a ton of new areas/secrets that I could now reach. Areas I could have reached all along, if I had only known the techniques before.There is actually still a secret I have yet to be able to reach, as I am playing without looking at any guides. I think I have figured out how to do it, but it requires amazing split-second timed jumps and shots. I'm enjoying the attempt though!Sure, you could blow throw the game in an hour or so, but finding all the secrets and/or trying to get all the achievements adds a lot more value, and replayability.  If you like clever platformers, give it a go! "

												Picked it up in a Steam Sale for $.19 which was an amazing deal. It's a short game, my first playthrough was just over an hour. Some people might complain about that, but I thought it was perfect. With all the games in my backlog, I prefer a lean game that plays well, and isn't full of fluff.The game has a very straightforward premise, you crash land on a planet and need to find parts to repair your ship. You start off with a gun that shoots portals that you teleport to when they hit a surface. Every screen has some sort of puzzle requiring timing and finesse to progress. You eventually get a pea shooter, but it's mainly for breaking rocks and getting the odd enemy out of your way.There are a fair amount of achievements that require a second playthrough, but it's pretty much a breeze, because once you're familiar with the mechanics of the game, you can plow right through it.

												""Inspired by Cave Story, Metroid, and Portal""I think a better mashup is Cave Story, R-type, and Portal (with a much smaller scope). I didn't personally get the Metroid vibes.Out There Somewhere is a fun short game (I beat it in about 45 minutes) with good aesthetics and decent level of difficulty. It may only leave you wanting more, as the whole game feels more like a ""first stage"" than a complete game. It definitely has the potential to be something much greater, but overall, I still recommend it. I'd make sure to grab it on sale though, as in my mind, the game is too short for the full price.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a exploration platformer with a mechanic of teleportation. You control Yuri on his quest to repair his ship and escape the planet he crashed on. Armed with a teleportation gun which allows you to fire a shot and then teleport where it lands, you must use this mechanic to your advantage to progress.This game makes excellent use of its core mechanic. The platforming feels solid and incorporates the telegun very well. The difficulty curve feels right, gradually increasing so the player has to use what they have learned in prior levels in new and different ways. Progressing requires quick reflexes and some thinking, and death isn't a hindrance due to instant-respawn. The aesthetic of the game is great, with pixel visuals, and the chiptune soundtrack adds to the feel. The game is a bit short, however. It took me about an hour of gametime to beat the game on my first run, and it left me wanting more. What the game provides is excellent and leaves me wanting more, which could have easily been added. The final boss felt a little underwhelming and could probably have used the game's mechanics better. Overall, I rate Out There Somewhere a 8/10, on the basis that the game is a bit short.			"

												A cute little game by a developer who obviously loves the style and genre.  The puzzles weren't terribly difficult, though a couple required very exact precision and thus might take you one try or a hundred to get right.  Don't expect combat to be any more difficult than the puzzles.Definitely worth more than the nineteen cents they're charging during the Summer Sale.  Not sure if it's worth five dollars, though; it feels like the first chapter or so of a Metroidvania rather than an entire game.Keeping an eye on this developer!			"

If you want to spend a fun hour or so, but dont want to spend too much money, this game is for you; And even then, if you really like it (like me), you can try to complete achievements or speedrun (or both) which is what I do. The game itsleft lasts for 1-2 hours, (which is completely worth your money taking in account how cheap it is btw) and if you are a completionist or a speedrunner like me, this game can easily give you up to 10 hours of fun or even more. And its not just the play time; its the play value... Every single minute of this game is just pure fun. Its cheerfull, clever, it has perfect pacing and makes and its puzzles never get too easy or too hard. TL,DR: Amazing game, incredibly fun and unbelievably cheap.

												This is a 2D-puzzle platformer. And a bloody good one at that. It contains a sort of portal gun. The puzzles are not very easy but not to hard either. There are also quite the amount of secrets to find in this game. It is a lovely little game. You can however beat the campaign in about an hour and a half. The game gets a lot longer once you try to get 100% on the achievements. I got the full 100% now in about 9 hours and trust me that's not an amazing achievement, it is just that short. And the time added to the game is mostly just artificially added to the game. Not actual gameplay, just a lot of things you have to do a certain way that a lot of time to the game. So, lovely little puzzle game but short.Final conclusion: If you get this game for the full price off 5 euro you might be paying a bit too much. But if you're one of the people like me who bout it for 0,19 euro you have paid way to little for this fun game :D			"

PresentationOut There Somewhere is possibly one of the most challenging, unique and intriguing platformers you'll ever play, as it puts you in control of a little alien, stranded on an unknown planet after his ship has crashed as a result of a space battle between him and his nemesis, Grigori, who ended up on the same planet as you, changing the lives of the planet's inhabitants. With that being said, you'll soon be on your way to recover the core needed for your ship to function again and finish what you've started, but to do so you'll have to traverse a long way, filled with danger, friendly and foe aliens and plenty of secrets. While the intelligent life on the planet will mostly only complain about how Grigori has influenced their lives since his arrival, and occasionally open a door for you or give you a hint to where you should head next, the more barbaric enemies simply known as monsters will often stand between you and your next objective, forcing you to think up different strategy on the move. While the plot isn't the most unique one and it certainly doesn't have any twists along the way, it is pleasing to see how many different areas and secrets you can find along the way, some which will often lead to items that will make your journey easier, such as abandoned cores or ancient alien artifacts. There is a certain lack of character development when it comes to the intelligent aliens, which will only interact with you with the same line of dialogue, which in most cases doesn't make any sense.Rating: 7GameplayAs any platformer you'll want to play, gameplay is the key element for an unforgettable experience, and in this aspect, Out There Somewhere brings some interesting concepts to the table, such as the teleport gun which allows you to send a beam to any wall that will teleport you there once it reaches its destination. As that mechanic alone would soon run out of challenging situations, blue, red and green beams will make puzzles more difficult, as red beams will block your teleportation beam, blue beams will stop the gun's beam at their location, and green beams will send it upwards. Combing those simple mechanics with the machine gun that will allow you to shoot enemies in your path in addition to using the teleport gun creates situations that are challenging, yet fun to solve and think your way out of. Secrets are also an important part of the experience, as exploration is rewarded with items such as health upgrades or the machine gun upgrade that allows you to shoot faster, and looking for different alternatives out of a certain screen will often take you to a completely new one with a new challenge ahead. The most important thing is that the game allows you to play however you want to, as you can avoid shooting enemies completely, making your way forward using the teleport gun alone, or take your time, explore the world around you and make sure you collect everything along the way.Rating: 8GraphicsOut There Somewhere goes for an old school look, with simple, low resolution textures formed out of squares, and while that art style fits the concept of the game fairly well, the problem comes in the form of repetition using those textures, as each screen will look similar to the previous one, and even when you do reach an area that's meant to feel and look different such as Grigori's Tower, it still feels like the same square with a different color shade on top.Rating: 6.5AudioThe audio quality is pretty cheap, which isn't necessarily a problem since there isn't much to hear aside from the effects that will only show up when you command them to. The soundtrack is okay for this time of game, but it does get boring pretty quickly, but since there isn't much else to hear aside from the background song, you could just mute it and play your own tunes.Rating: 5.5ExtrasIt will probably take you around one hour to complete Out There Somewhere for the first time, but just as a note the game can be completed in less than 15 minutes, and the game even encourages you to do that as it has a specific achievement. You could play it a second time to earn all the achievements and see the secret areas you might have missed, but afterwards that's it.Rating: 6VerdictOut There Somewhere is a cute, challenging adventure to spend your afternoon with, as long as you don't mind the fact that it will be over fairly soon, but for its low price and a possible secondary replay, it's worth a try.Rating Overall: 6.6Check out the full review and a lot more about Out There Somewhere at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=357 "

												A 16-bit puzzle platformer that may be short but it packs quite a punch. It takes queues from many puzzle/platformers, such as: Portal, Half-Life, Braid, and VVVVVV, just to name a few. You play as a spaceship captain who, aided by helpful aliens must repair your ship to return out there somewhere. While the premise and the controls of the game are straight forward, this game is more challenging than meets the eye. If you enjoy bit graphics and are also a fan of platformers you should be playing it right now.			"

												Fun little puzzle (sort of, I guess?) / platforming game. It's a good game for the price (and a steal at 19c as of this review). I mean, come on, you get to use a teleport gun. My only complaint is that you can't change the keybinds of the 3 buttons this game has to any of the non-letter keys (at least, that's my experience). I wanted to map jump to space, but unfortunately, the game has a list of pre-set keybinds which the player can set.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a simple as well as simply priced game on Steam with a lots of detail added in such a short little space adventure.  While it is short in stature, it makes up for it with the quality put into the the low price, sprite-work, and the gameplay.  The game itself costs two dollars on Steam, so it is very unlikely you will regret your purchase with all of the fibers of your wallet if you dislike it, unless of course those two dollars were needed to save you from dying of hunger. Of course, there is a chance one might receive a coupon for it upon crafting a badge or something, further decreasing the affordable price.  The sprites give off a very solid Metroid reminiscence, which is fair because the game was reportedly inspired by Super Metroid.  Each of the environments are tailored almost exclusively with each screen that your character passes through.  They may have an underlying theme to it all, be it uncharted wasteland to menacing metal, but they all have something unique in level design incorporated within the game.  The game is built around a teleportation mechanic.   A specially designed gun fires a blue bullet that, upon impact with any solid platform, teleports you to that specific location.  The gameplay revolves around you, and how you determine when to fire, not to mention time how long the bullet takes to reach your designated location.  Of course, with all of those pluses, the game itself is rather short.  If you do not go out of your way to find any collectables, (and even if you do) the game boils down to a solid hour or two of total playtime.  Which is a shame, because the teleport gun mechanic is rather fun to play around with.  Another issue I have with the game is the way the levels are organized.  I feel as though game is very linear, each level designed to be a simple obstacle that prevents you from proceeding, so any unique level concepts are used once and left behind.  If one wanted to find the collectables aforementioned, they would have to backtrack through each of the levels that appeared to be designed in mind for separate challenges meant simply for providing something to hop through once and be done with, compared to games like the original Metroid or its remake, Zero Mission where there are several tunnels connected in a sense where you can be familiar with the layout and return without it feeling like you have to return through a single linear stretch.  However, the game is a solid buy through and through.  If you feel like adventuring on an alien planet with a trusty teleportation machine, feel free to buy for a short yet sweet playthrough.			"

												This is a truly innovative retro puzzle-platformer. It mechanics I have never seen used in another game. It has a really good difficulty curve and you gradually learn more and more complicated moves that use the same basic mechanic. The world is interesting and the soundtrack is top notch. The only downside is that a normal playthrough will only take about an hour. It does have some replay value as there are plenty of hidden items to collect that require some pretty advanced puzzle-solving. I recommend it highly, even though it is a short game.			"

												Dunno what it is about the game, but i liked it instantly.Must be something about the way the game was designed and presented. It doesn't waste any time with overlong exposure and gets right down to the good stuff, mainly controls, animations and characters. The tiles aren't the prettiest though i wouldn't call the game ugly by any means. Animations and music give it a very good athmosphere.It focuses less on action, combat or powerups, and more on puzzles with a healthy serving of platforming. Climb everything and explore everywhere! It somewhat resembles Cave Story, but with fewer monsters (at least initialy) and less fighting. It has it's share of cutesy aliens and quirky characters, though the stories cannot be compared.The only downside is that there's no difficulty options and that it's not a very long game. I finished it in about an hour, but i enjoyed it. It's not brutaly easy but it's quite forgiving, which could be a good thing if you rage easily.I don't know why you're not playing this game. It's mix of puzzles and platforming requires some skill and feels rewarding. I'll admit that it doesn't look like a winner just by looking at the trailer & screenshots, but it's solid.Yes, recommended.			"

												Graphics - 9/10, fit this game 100% perfectly. It is pleasing to look at but it can be too dark even with your brightness all the way up. If they just did a lighting overhaul it would go a long way.Story - 6/10, there isn't really a whole lot of story to this game. Basically you are on a space ship when aliens attack it, so naturally you go and fight them. You are overwhelmed and crash into an alien planet. You need to find a power core to get of the planet. During the game you hear from a few different NPC's that Grigori is a monster and they wish he wasn’t around, you also hear also hear he has that power core you need. So you take off on a mission to kill Grigori and get the power core.Gameplay - 9/10, while I want to say that this game has perfect gameplay, I can't. I personally feel that the beginning and ending space battles are unnecessary; I feel these two scenes are completely different from the rest of the game. Every other part of the game is plat-forming genius but then you have these button mashing sequences basically.Soundtrack - 8/10, I like the soundtrack this game has but I prefer to listen to my own music while I play because I'm personally not a huge fan of the ""Classic Pixel Style"" this game uses. But I do recognize that this a very well done soundtrack and I consider it worth having in my iTunes library.Overall - 32/40, even though I only have a short amount of time on this game as I am writing this (Currently 8 hours or so) I plan to add a lot more because I love this game. It is really addictive and I really recommend you buy it. I think it's worth full price but I imagine quite a few people would want to buy it when its on sale because it is so short. "

												Out There Somewhere is an absolutely charming platformer that I highly recommend as an essential addition to any Steam user's library.  Much like Shovel Knight or Momodora, this is a modern game that looks and plays like one of the classics.The game's hero is a fighter pilot who is shot down during an epic space battle.  After crash-landing on a volcanic planet populated with friendly talking snails and strange tree-men, he ventures off, armed with a teleportation gun, to repair the ship and rejoin the battle.  Along the way, there's a few health upgrades and maybe even a weapon or two to help survive the baddies; there's also 11 hidden ship upgrades to find.While the platforming elements and the game's retro aesthetic are both great, the real star of the show is the teleportation mechanic.  Your primary trigger fires a slow-moving bolt of energy that instantly transports your character to the point of contact when a surface is struck.  Using this competently is necessary for getting through the game.  The really exciting bit, though, is the teleportation gun conserves momentum, just like Portal; beginning a leap just before your energy bolt hits something, for instance, means you'll still be traveling upwards after being teleported.  Mastering this makes for very satisfying gameplay, and abusing this mechanic to go as high or as far as you possibly can also lead you to secret areas or shortcuts that you wouldn't otherwise find. This game isn't very long, and while it's not a total cakewalk, the level of challenge is relatively low.  My first playthrough took about 90 minutes, and that was with a lot of optional exploration and puzzle-solving.  My second playthrough was a 100% playthrough, and took a little over an hour.  After learning the game's layout and mechanics, a speedrun will take not much more than 15 minutes.However, while not long, this game is really quite fun, and totally worth the very reasonable asking price.  Give it a shot, you won't regret it. "

												One of the most difficult platformers I have ever played. The whole game is wonderful and the concept is pretty good.I replayed it twice for acheivements and trading cards.About 1-2 hours worth of gameplay on first time depending on your platformer skills.9/10 for this game. Definitely get it while it is on sale for .15 USD or maybe even get it when it isn't on sale! "

												A really clever, fun, albeit short game. I paid a mere 19 cents for this game, but it's probably worth the two bucks.*Fun teleporting/platforming*Fun music*Fun pixel graphics*Fun space shooting*Fun while it lasts...The only con is that it's short, and once you've played through it you probably won't pick it up again. That's no reason not to pick it up though!			"

 SPOILER ALERT	I feel like that game is really worth the price... best spent 19 cents on a game. The Story	Humanity is in peril, Allies receives a signal that the notorious villain Grigori is attacking again and decide to call Yuri - our hero for help.As he sets out to fight Grigori, his ship gets destroyed and he sees Grigori landing on an unknown planet and he decides to follow him without any other choice since he crashes on the planet.As soon as our hero lands he sees that Grigori has imprisoned the intelligent life on this planet.          He must free the planet's citizens, find a power source to get his ship to work again and defeat Grigori for good. Gameplay	The game revolves mostly around teleporting which is done via your teleporting gun (It's nothing like portal's portal gun).You get teleported the moment your bullet hits a wall and you depending on your timing you can jump after teleporting which can help you reach otherwise unreachable locations and it makes up for really clever platforming.The movement and shooting once you obtain your Gauss gun really remind me of Cave Story which is a good thing.You can also collect 3 Alien artifacts with each one making you more durable to damage. Pros.	+Great pixelated art                 +Great music                                +Alot of replay value+Memorable protagonist+Fluid Gameplay.+Alot of secret collectibles. Cons.	-Really short Final Verdict   9.6/10	 "

												Out There Somewhere is an absolutely charming platformer that I highly recommend as an essential addition to any Steam user's library.  Much like Shovel Knight or Momodora, this is a modern game that looks and plays like one of the classics.The game's hero is a fighter pilot who is shot down during an epic space battle.  After crash-landing on a volcanic planet populated with friendly talking snails and strange tree-men, he ventures off, armed with a teleportation gun, to repair the ship and rejoin the battle.  Along the way, there's a few health upgrades and maybe even a weapon or two to help survive the baddies; there's also 11 hidden ship upgrades to find.While the platforming elements and the game's retro aesthetic are both great, the real star of the show is the teleportation mechanic.  Your primary trigger fires a slow-moving bolt of energy that instantly transports your character to the point of contact when a surface is struck.  Using this competently is necessary for getting through the game.  The really exciting bit, though, is the teleportation gun conserves momentum, just like Portal; beginning a leap just before your energy bolt hits something, for instance, means you'll still be traveling upwards after being teleported.  Mastering this makes for very satisfying gameplay, and abusing this mechanic to go as high or as far as you possibly can also lead you to secret areas or shortcuts that you wouldn't otherwise find. This game isn't very long, and while it's not a total cakewalk, the level of challenge is relatively low.  My first playthrough took about 90 minutes, and that was with a lot of optional exploration and puzzle-solving.  My second playthrough was a 100% playthrough, and took a little over an hour.  After learning the game's layout and mechanics, a speedrun will take not much more than 15 minutes.However, while not long, this game is really quite fun, and totally worth the very reasonable asking price.  Give it a shot, you won't regret it. "

I've considered using this to get into speed running.Pros:Awesome pixel graphicsSweet musicGreat game mechanicsChallenging, but not too challenging that you rage quit.Cons:Kinda short, but highly replayableGuilt of only paying $.19 for this game.I really hope the developers are able to release another game like this soon.

												Great story and fun puzzle playthrough, but here are the things that really bugged me about the game:-Can't go to options while in game, have to save and exit and then you can access them at the main menu.-Doesn't have very good keyboard controls. I had to set my own from the start of the game, but once I got use to it it was fine.-I found the boss fight nearly impossible with keyboard controls because I was trying to dodge things while flying in all directions with arrow keys, and I had to also focus on shooting him with a different button. It would have been much easier with a controler.Besides all of that, it is a great little game, with interesting mecanics and good puzzles that aren't too difficult. For the current sale price of 0.19 cents, it's definitely worth it.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a neat little 2D Game. You can compare the design to the Metroid games and all in all the game structure really reminds me of ""You Have To Win The Game"", what is, by the way, a really nice game.A short assessment by myself:Story: 8/10   It is the classical ""Hero-Kills-Evil"" concept as it is in Megaman. Yuri is Megaman and Gregori is Dr. Wily.Soundtrack: 100/10 The soundtrack fits perfect and is just genius.Level Design: 10/10  It reminds of Metroid as I mentioned before.Controls: 5/10 The control is the only thing I want to criticize. I highly recommend to play this game with  a Game Pad, because it is a little bit awkward with the keyboard. (Compareable to ""Super Meat Boy"" + Keyboard"" just worse...!)Difficulty: 10/10 Although you cannot adjust the difficulty in the game options you are able to play this game without getting frustrated. There are maybe some points where it can take a minute longer than usual but all in all the game is quiet easy.But it gets much more difficult when you try to find all cores or try to collect all steam achievements.

												Great little game.  Reminded me a lot of La Mulana (to a degree), VVVVVV (to a degree), Knytt Underground (to a degree).  Simple platformer with some nice mechanics that lead to a game that you play 'screen by screen'.  Each screen provides a puzzle to beat.  These puzzles are usually fairly straightforward and I only had a couple of screens that gave me trouble (but which were very easy once the solution hit).Takes as little as 20 minutes to beat (there's an achievement), but expect about 60-90 minutes if you start hunting down the hidden areas / achievements.

												Are you nervous it's gonna be bad? Well read this! It's a really fun game for me! But maybe it's not for you....idkFor those people who like platformers mixed with Portal and Super Mario (like me) then definitely buy this game! That price for so good 8-bit music and an RPG/Platformer that is very fun is unheard of! And it's so addictive, I LOVE IT! Gameplay is a bit short but come on. Everybody knows it takes a while to make a game! If you loved Portal and played it every single day but you got bored because you finished the game, or if you missed the good old days when Super Mario was a big thing, or do you just miss amazing, fricking awesome space games, or do you just wanna play a really good platformer? Then i highly recommend this game! Don't have any money? Just ask your parents! It's really cheap!Final words:A good game for many people. It's very addictive. It's great!9,7/10			"

												Graphics - 9/10, fit this game 100% perfectly. It is pleasing to look at but it can be too dark even with your brightness all the way up. If they just did a lighting overhaul it would go a long way.Story - 6/10, there isn't really a whole lot of story to this game. Basically you are on a space ship when aliens attack it, so naturally you go and fight them. You are overwhelmed and crash into an alien planet. You need to find a power core to get of the planet. During the game you hear from a few different NPC's that Grigori is a monster and they wish he wasn’t around, you also hear also hear he has that power core you need. So you take off on a mission to kill Grigori and get the power core.Gameplay - 9/10, while I want to say that this game has perfect gameplay, I can't. I personally feel that the beginning and ending space battles are unnecessary; I feel these two scenes are completely different from the rest of the game. Every other part of the game is plat-forming genius but then you have these button mashing sequences basically.Soundtrack - 8/10, I like the soundtrack this game has but I prefer to listen to my own music while I play because I'm personally not a huge fan of the ""Classic Pixel Style"" this game uses. But I do recognize that this a very well done soundtrack and I consider it worth having in my iTunes library.Overall - 32/40, even though I only have a short amount of time on this game as I am writing this (Currently 8 hours or so) I plan to add a lot more because I love this game. It is really addictive and I really recommend you buy it. I think it's worth full price but I imagine quite a few people would want to buy it when its on sale because it is so short. "

												Great game, but still with great discount 96%. I thought that would be a regular platformer, the type of run and do not stop with a flat plot and settling graphics, but there it was. The game really surpassed my expectations, from the beginning of passage, you start to get involved and want to pass it to the end. About 5 rubles spent no regrets, if discounts were not, would buy at full price. Were evaluated for 10/10.			"

												Not bad, but not memorable. The teleporting mechanic itself is unique, but the overall game feels all too familiar for those who played many puzzle-platformers. If you haven't played a lot of games from this genre, it may seem all new and exciting to you, but there are gems out there, somewhere, that deserve more your attention; if you are a veteran, I recommand it if you can never get enough of this kind of game. I had a fun ride, but I will probably forget this game in a few weeks, especially since it's so short. I gave a positive review because I had a nice experience, but I would give a neutral review if possible since you have to consider everything above to determine whether or not it's worth it.			"

												The game is quite interesting i have to say! - it really reminds me from a different game - i can't come up with the name for now - maybe later.However it still plays differently. you start with a ship - and it is some sort of ""asteroids game""  - eventually you will lose and u will crash - - you have to find the missing parts of the ship. You have a teleport gun - if u shoot - there will be a projectile flying - which will let you teleport if hit to a wall. the game could be quite difficult too and with there puzzles. You also need intelligence and quick thinking in order to pass some area's.There are save stations/checkpoints throughout the level.It is also a little bit of ""metroidvania"" that u have to go back point to point to do somethimg. but so far i know - you do not have a map which COULD be dissappointingthe music is quite ok - it is 2D side scrolling 8 bit graphic style.monsters will respawn if u left the screen - the sound affects ""from guns, exploding, deaths, etc"" are a little bit cheap - i mean, its a very very old sound effect.You can play with an xbox controller. Which actually plays better then on keyboardDefault keyboard controls are weird. Z to teleport. X to jump. C to shoot. I think C should be jumping, Z to teleport and X to shoot.You can heal at checkpoints.THE GAME IS OK BUT SHORT! to make teleport useful - i do recommend using small hops, so that u can jump again once the projectile hit and u fly higher.I give this a 6/10			"

												Oh, this game. Let's think this game first. This game is really hard, really annoying and really frustrating.  Teleport laser is very hard to handle, because later on the game, you need to do double jump with teleport gun and take like 5 minutes to pass one double jump sections. Also this game have so many dead traps. I ragequit several times during this game, because that stupid teleport laser. But I still recommend this game? Why?  Music is kinda good, maybe sometimes annoying, but good. Levels are well done, expect double jumping. Story is also pretty good (I haven't finish game before this review). Pros:+ Good music+ Nice level design+ Very low cost (19 cents)+ Story+ Aliens look hilariousCons:- Rage game elements- Teleport Gun- Double Jumping- Hard platformingI bought this game from sale. This game is annoying and still pretty good, but if it wasn't in the sale, it's not worth it. Also game is very quick, you can see credits after 2 hours.6/10			"

												This game is very interesting.The story is about a space cop who is hunting a villain named Grigori. But after a fight with him, his space ship gets badly damaged and both land on a same planet. Main gameplay begins here and you have to find a light orb to fix your ship and defeat Grigori for good.Gameplay is really nice. you have a teleport gun which is frequently used in the game and nearly all of the puzzles must be solved with it and a gauss gun to kill enemies. After progressing further in the game, you will encounter new enemies, three types of lightbeams, mirrors, breakable objects and moving platforms which add to the challenge.PROS:- Nice gameplay- Great soundtrack- Collectables affect how much hard the last fight will be- Can 100% the game easily with a little skill and patienceCONS:- Short (Can be completed in 14 mins to 75 mins on first playthrough)- You HAVE to lose in the first encounter with Grigori and you can even lose at the beginning; but it's not clear. So you do your best to take him down and after a lot of minutes you find out it was a complete waste of time.- Some rare achivement problems: One of the achievement did not unlock until I did it's required action for the third time.VERDICT:This game is really nice and definitely worths trying but it's short and after you unlock every achievement, you may not want to play it anymore.

												Out There Somewhere is a platformer/puzzle game with bullet hell stages, with mechanics that resemble Portal.It's a very fun little game that, despite being very short (~2-3h of gameplay, maybe 4 if you want all achievements) is very entertaining and will keep you stuck to the computer until you beat it.PROS: Beautiful pixel graphics Funny and simple storyline Very rewarding to figure out how to pass certain levelsCONS: Short Game Storyline is not too deep, you won't get very attached to the characters Those who do not enjoy Bullet Hell (or are bad at it) will suffer at a couple points I died so many times at the final boss it gives me nightmares til todayFinal Score: 4/5Very fun little game, extremely worth its price tag. Highly recommend anyone who enjoys platformers/puzzle games to grab this. Sell some items or cards on the Market and grab it. It's totally worth it.			"

												This is a short but excellent puzzle platforming adventure. It takes about the length of time a ""chapter"" might take in a longer game, so somewhere in the ballpark of an hour if you're going at a relaxed, casual pace. (There is an achievement for 20-minute completion for speedrunners.)Figuring out how to use the teleportation gun to solve each room---as well as discover secrets for the more observant---is very satisfying both to solve and to execute.There isn't much of a story here, but I don't think you'll care about that too much. What the game lacks in story, it makes up for in charm and style. It definitely has that nice Cave Story / Metroid kinda vibe that SNES era kids will love.I also got it on sale for NINETEEN CENTS?! That is a f***ing steal.			"

												I found Out There Somewhere to be very boring. Beyond the puzzle solving this game does almost nothing to pull you in. The puzzles are decent, requiring quick reactions. The teleportation gun is an interesting mechanic, and has a lot of potential, but I just don't care enough to go slogging through the rest of the game to get to this theoretical point of interest.The story may as well not be there, as it does nothing to intrigue the player beyond giving a background to the puzzles to come.I don't recommend this game unless you have a keen interest in 2d puzzle platformers, as well as a lack of interest in compelling story telling.

Out there somewhere is a very cheap platformer game, and in this case you get nothing more than what you paid for. A bland, uninspired jumpfest. The game consists of you having to perform tricky jump after tricky jump until the end credits roll. Out there somewhere claims to be ""Inspired by Cave Story, Super Metroid, and Portal,"" I don't see it - at all. I'd call it a lie in an attempt to boost sales, but there's nothing wrong with saying what inspired you, I guess. A satanic death metal band could claim the inspiration for their latest album was the Beatles' white album, even though you'd never actually hear that influence in any of their music.Apparently, if you're good at this sort of game, you'll finish Out there somewhere in less than an hour and are entitled to some bragging, for example in the form of the Steam Achievement for finishing the game. If you're not particularly good at this sort of game, you'll notice they managed to make 'Out there somewhere' very challenging (difficult) but forgot to add any fun or wonder to the gameplay, which would motivate to try and finish it anyway.All in all, Out there somewhere  is a below average platformer that's only for the die-hard platformer gamer who's looking for a quick but extremely difficult fix.

												(Review writed with 7.6 hours gaming and all achievements unlocked - Jan 01st, 2017).Out There Somewhere is a 8-bit portal game with a little of space invaders. You play with a space pilot who's crashlanded on an alien world, and you've found yourself inside a retro-tinged platformer in which each room works as a single puzzle, all to repair your spaceship. Pros:- Challenging puzzles;- Nice 8-bit portal game play.Cons:	- Few levels;- Lame history;- Few boring challenges;- Hard achievements.6,0/10.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a clever game that's just all around quite humble and enjoyable to play. The platforming handles well, there's little secret areas throughout that still feel rewarding to find yet aren't too impossibly hidden, and it's got a short and sweet story. Game runs a little short (only took a few hours to 100% all the achievements), but the satisfaction from finishing the game justifies the price.			"

												Very nice platformer with an interesting game mechanic.You play as a captain of a space ship who ends up in a fight with a villain named Grigori (who is still out there somewhere btw)It result in your ship crashing on some alien planet. Now you have to find your way through the planet to get a light orb to fix your spaceship (Every spaceship needs light orbs cause you know... reasons...) and optionally collecting ""abandoned cores"". You have a teleport gun which teleports you to where the shot lands... a cool game mechanic that is very well implemented.Pros:-Figuring out how to get to the end of every screen is a lot of fun.-Timing and thought required make it enjoyable.-Short but not too short.-Tight controls.-Good soundtrack.-Good-looking pixel graphics.Cons:-Almost no story. (doesn't really matter for this kind of game ... use your Imagination)Highly Recommended!			"

												This game was very good, however there a few things to note if you wnat to get it, i spent about 5 1/2 doing puzzles to beat this game, then a faught a boss using some of the skills i learned before, then i faught a space ship using absoultly no prior skills after spending 5 1/2 hours i had to fight in an new way that was way to difficulthowever if your stuck on the last boss, the best way to win is use a controller,also mash the fire button so you shoot faster, i failed my first 30+ tries and won my first try with a controlleroverall this is a fantastic puzzle game however there is no point to collecting cores, once you get them all you need to backtrack to some dude to upgrade them? waste of time			"

												Kind of like a 2D Portal. It has fun platforming with a unique twist, while still being a challenge. You use a portal gun to propel yourself higher and make jumps that would make Mario jealous. Colorful world and great graphics, it fits in nicely with the space theme. It can get tedious at times, but once you get the mechanics down you'll be swinging in no time. The music is great and goes well with the rest of the game. Overall a very fun challenge that will give your fingers a workout. Definately worth two dollars.			"

												MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOWThis game isn't long, but that doesn't matter, because it is a well-constructed game.  Initially, you begin with a side-scrolling space-shooter sequence that takes you through an army of rival space ships.  After the initial boss fight (which you are supposed to lose), you begin exploring a planet armed initially with only a portal gun.  You'll find an actual weapon later on to fight enemies with and to help with solving puzzles.The game is basically an action-platformer in the vein of games like Metroid with its exploration for various items, including extenders to your life meter and components which can power-up your repaired ship at the end of the game.  There aren't a whole lot of mechanics to the game, which is fitting for its short length.  This also makes the game easy to pick up and play.  There is a good challenge to the later sections, but there is nothing that truly feels overwhelming or unfair, which is a testament to the overall game design.  The price is fair as there is replayability to earn achievements.  For such a short title, there is a fairly large number to attain, and I can see people earning all of them with lots of practice.I can find very little to criticize about this game.  You do have to be careful of scene switches because you can walk and/or jump into a hazard without fully realizing it, similar to Castle in the Darkness, though not nearly as unfair as in the latter title.  Also, in some of the vertical sections, I had to stop and search for my character, who was just about as far down the screen as possible, usually in a corner!  A brief, flashing arrow pointing to your character would help here, but this is not a big criticism.  It's possible to solve every room on the first try if you're observant and careful; I can even see a few people maybe having a deathless run on the first playthrough.Out There Somewhere has just the right length for casual gamers while being robust enough for those looking for a challenge, especially those seeking to 100% the game through both winning and through completing the achievements.  I highly recommend this game.  It is both well-crafted and extremely well balanced.  Buy it!9.0 / 10			"

												Makes you think to solve puzzles. Gets a thumbs up because that part is done well. It was worth about the 19 cents I paid for the 20-30 minutes of playtime I put into it. I won't be playing it anymore because I was just too bored. Probably the horrible atari colors they used for the graphics that make me want to go on a shooting rampage in a bong shop full of hipsters.			"

												Even though the mechanics in this game are completely different from VVVVVV, I would recommend this to fans of VVVVVV in a heartbeat. Static screens, tricky but not impossible jumping puzzles, and kickass chiptune music.Don't be fooled by the absolutely horrid SHMUP opening - this is one of the better indie platformers of 2016, and at a VERY reasonable price, to boot. It harkens back to an era of Steam where indie games weren't all overpriced Early Access games or tedious RPGMaker clones.			"

												It's $1 for a puzzle-platformer that'll probably last about an hour on your first go, has above-average pixel graphics and a pretty killer soundtrack, and a handful of pretty darn well-hidden trinkets. My only real objection is that said trinkets only serve to make the final boss even more of a cakewalk if you collect enough of them. Good deal!			"

												Basically, it's a demo.  The game has unique gameplay elements and all; but it's extremely short and linear, running you through a token tutorial for about 20 minutes to show off the engine.  Think like the Final Fantasy 8 demo being released as a full game, or if Super Metroid ended when you beat the Bomb Torizo.Really not a lot of thought put into it.  Glaringly little thought put into world and scenario.			"

												This game was so promising, and I sat down expecting a sweet metroidvania style platform puzzler. I played it for 30 minutes, and took a break to get some food. Then I sat down again and realized I was just outside the chamber of the first boss. ""Great"", I thought, a boss battle is always nice. So I went ahead and defeated the boss in about five minutes. Then the game ended... WHAT!? 35 minutes of gameplay, and ONE boss? Really?I realize this game is only 5€, and you can't expect much from a game that cheap, but still, 35 minutes of content just isn't enough for me to recommend this game.If you still need to kill half an hour and like platform puzzlers with a wee bit of skill needed, then by all means, this game is for you.

												I normally try to make well-written reviews, but due to this game's slow performance I'm not even able to play it.I got it on a sale really cheap, so I don't really mind wasting a couple coins in it, but the hardware requirements this game has written are totally false, my computer meets them but the game still runs horribly slow.The worse part is that the game doesn't even have complex graphics, I'm able to run games like OpenArena, Minecraft and other games at 60 FPS at some points, this games goes like at 5 FPS and the graphics are just horrible simple.Also, the game lacks options to disable graphic effects or anything else, the only graphic option is to toggle fullscreen.

												*Extremely minor spoiler alert.*I really wanted to like this game.  However, 2 minutes into the game you'll face an unbeatable boss.  I learned this after another 5 minutes of mashing the fire button and dodging attacks.  I didn't even get to the real game, and now I don't even want to.Devs, if you want to blow up my ship, that's fine.  Make it a scripted event, or give the enemy an unavoidable attack.  Don't waste my time, and don't make me do something that feels stupid.  Having to intentionally destroy my ship completely breaks immersion and removes all my motivation for continuing.			"

Sure I'd say the same if I wouldn't have tried to do this jump for over 2 hours now with every possible guide. They all do a 2 high jump, portal shot on wall and than JUMP AGAIN!! which doesn't work. No matter how I time it. It simply doesn't. I have a gaming PC with gaming keyboard and also an xbox 360 controller. I tested everything including rebinding keys on keyboard and/or controller. It's not working to make the wall jump. I play a lot of hard games and jump games and I simply know when I'm just to bad. This jump doesn't work for some reason. Only reason could be a bug.			"

												Inititally, upon starting Out There Somewhere, I was skeptical. Another pixel art puzzle platformer. But the game started to grow on me, the art style was pleasant, and the music is surprisngly well done. The mechanics of the game are simple, but fun and intuitive. The gameplay revolves around a gun which, when fired, fires a bolt which you teleport to when it collides with something. The puzzles designed around this are quite clever, and the game introduces more puzzle mechanics that spice up an already interesting style. It was getting interesting. And just as I felt as though the game was going to advance into something better, it ended. Now, I purchased this game for twenty cents, but it runs for five dollars normally. And because of this, I ultimately cannot recommend Out There Somewhere, as the game time is abyssmally short for the asking price, and honestly left me dissatisfied. I was able to beat the game in under an hour and a half. That sucks. The gameplay itself is enjoyable, but it feels more like a Flash game in the end.			"

												It really hurts me to not recommend this game...Because when you look at it, it is very pretty, the gameplay is smooth, and all the art design (atmosphere, sounds, story...) is very nice and thought.But... it is much too short, and quite unsatisfying in terms of experience. It is definitely a flaw in games these years, although some others would argue it is a plus. Yet for me, such a small contribution in terms of entertainment and gaming is exactly like with toys and games... a diminished version, a raw skeleton without any flesh or organs.In other words? The type of gamer I am can not feel fully satisfied with what feels like a demo, like a ""short story"" of a gameplay mechanic. Please realize I am not asking for a 100hours long rpg, but this ""little gamish piece of art"" would have been great if there was more substance to it, more body. As is, I feel sorry to say that I can not recommend it...			"

												Out There Somewhere is the game that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ts me. It took me 2 minutes to just navigate the main menu. Probably because this game was meant to be played with a controller. I can't move down, mainly because my down arrow key is up. I  honestly find this to be tons of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and I'm quite the fan of platformers.			"

												Playing on a Mac here, if that makes any difference.I'm sure it would be fun if my controls worked half of the time I played the game. The first time I launched it, the escape button didnt work, so i coulnt bring up the menu, but i troopered through. Once I completed the Galaga section, I landed on the planet. No story text popped up, no hints, nothing. ""Okay, maybe there's not supposed to be anything here."" I play around with the controls and learn them, since my escape button doesnt work. Controls learned, time to move on. I go to the right, since nothing is blocking my way, and nothing happens. Screen doesnt change to the next area or anything. ""This is really, really weird. Let me restart the game."" Alright, restarted the game and it puts me on the planet, just after Galaga. I get story text and hints this time, and my escape button works! Awesome. I move right, and then the screen changes. Fantastic! Game is going good...until I have to shoot my teleport gun. ""What the heck?"" I press X multiple times and no response. ""Dangit. Gotta restart again."" Restart game, game works in all aspects. Gameplay was alright, I guess. I think it tried to be too much like Risk of Rain, a game I highly reccomend, in both the controls and the overall feel of the game.  But for the technical problems I had, I cant reccomend Out There Somewhere.			"

												Out There Somewhere is not a great Steam game, but would be right at home on a Flash website.The opening feels like a student's first Multimedia Fusion game after following a tutorial on how to make a space shooter.  Staticky sound effects, zero enemy variety, unnatural parallax scrolling, no interesting visual effects... It's pretty amateurish and gave me a poor first impression.As the game progressed, I was pleased that it has some originality, and it's reasonably satisfying to jump around and teleport from place to place.  In the game's cleverer moments, it does a good job introducing new mechanics and ideas.It was over in less than an hour.  I was expecting the game to go on for quite a bit longer, considering it hadn't expanded upon the teleport-gun mechanic all that much, and I was still seeing the same three enemies.  I never spent a full five minutes in any one room, and I know that because several of the Steam achievements I didn't get reward being slow.  I'm sure there were some areas that I missed out on, but I don't care to go back to them, because it would mean going back through the unchallenging samey puzzles I already solved.I couldn't tell you what the plot of the game was, or how any of the music goes from memory, because none of it particularly stood out.  What I do remember is how irritating it was that the gun fired shots so slowly, and how enemies seemed to take more hits than necessary.  I remember discovering all the doors are needlessly one-way when I tried to check an earlier room and couldn't do it.  And I remember how closing a textbox had an awkward delayed reaction because I kept immediately reopening NPC dialog on accident.The way I see it, Out There Somewhere feels more like a prototype than a finished game.  There's very little diversity, no thought required, not enough polish, and even the visuals feel flat and artificial.  It's not bad, per se, but it's not great, and not something I'd recommend to my friends if they had to pay money for it.			"

												Too short and linear to call Super Metroid and Cave Story influences. It's actually drawing more from Portal.Solid idea, way too short for a $5 game. You will complete it in under 1 hour.Go get Axiom Verge if you want a Metroid experience on PC.Really this game is undeservign of a Metroidvania tag and is total trash in that regard. If you want a 45-min 2D portal game this is it.			"

												This platform game includes some new stuff, such as teleporting. Still, the music and design doesn't make it very attractive and it's way too short, you can finish it within 1 hour without problems once you get used to jump with the teleporting thing. I guess it's fine for platform lovers, but I wouldn't buy it again, not even in sales, as it's not really interactive.			"

												A really neat little platformer that takes about 100 mins to complete the story of on my first go. As far as i can tell to 100% it you would also have to play a number of the levels in reverse as well to get all the collectable which i havent done. The main mechanic of this game is the teleportation system which is really cool, it allows for some really interesting puzzles that may require you to think about for a bit before you can complete them. In the same way Portal requires you to think with portals, this game requires you to think with perfectly timed teleportation. Would reccomend it at the normal price. So if its at 15p it totally worth it.			"

												A cute little platformer that reminds me of a 2D Portal. There's a lot going on here for the price. The game has a nice ramping difficulty, but none of the puzzles get so insane you won't be able to solve them. The soundtrack is awesome, and the artstyle is new-age retro, which is definitely up my alley.

												Let me start out by saying this: There's no way I can do this game justice by a simple review.Good retro visuals, a good, catchy and well made soundtrack, perfectly responsive controls, a good and simple story, and high replayability are only a few of this game's qualities. Drawing clear inspiration from Pixel's work (Cave Story and its successors), Out There Somewhere manages to dish out the right amount of nostalgia, while being unique enough to earn its own place in Indie game history.The first playthrough will take about one hour, but with so many hidden secrets and alternate ways to complete the puzzles, I can almost guarantee you'll start a new game at least two more times.Truth be told, I've written and deleted at least three paragraphs trying to describe this game, and I still can't do it. My recomendation is simple: buy it and see for yourself.			"

												Reminds me of cave story ive spent a lot of time playing and replaying this game. Its really fun to play and you can go over and play it again without it getting stale. Its a fairly cheap game with a great art style (altough a bit over saturated) and nice chip tune music this game is a phenominal game and I highly recomend this to anyone.			"

												A cute little platformer that reminds me of a 2D Portal. There's a lot going on here for the price. The game has a nice ramping difficulty, but none of the puzzles get so insane you won't be able to solve them. The soundtrack is awesome, and the artstyle is new-age retro, which is definitely up my alley. The combat (while not a major focus of the game) feels a little clunky, and there are some sections that seem like filler (not intutive level design) but a solid game overall.			"

												Disappointing. Being on-boarded to a game with a spammy splash-screen is NOT a good indication of things to come. The actual mechanic was interesting and accessable, though I--a not-great player of games--finished in about an hour. I was narrating while playing, too, and demonstrating, so actual gameplay is probably closer to 45 minutes for a good player. I probably won't go back and 100% the achievements. It's just not worth it to me, so that is telling.Is this game worth it on sale? Yes. Is this game worth it full price? Not for me, but probably for most people. Just bear in mind that you're paying for around an hour's worth of entertainment, and this is a one-shot deal as there is no procedural generation at work here.			"

As in description of the game was said it's cluster of portal and other logical games. I recommend you this game if you like adventures.

												Let me start out by saying this: There's no way I can do this game justice by a simple review.Good retro visuals, a good, catchy and well made soundtrack, perfectly responsive controls, a good and simple story, and high replayability are only a few of this game's qualities. Drawing clear inspiration from Pixel's work (Cave Story and its successors), Out There Somewhere manages to dish out the right amount of nostalgia, while being unique enough to earn its own place in Indie game history.The first playthrough will take about one hour, but with so many hidden secrets and alternate ways to complete the puzzles, I can almost guarantee you'll start a new game at least two more times.Truth be told, I've written and deleted at least three paragraphs trying to describe this game, and I still can't do it. My recomendation is simple: buy it and see for yourself.			"

It is a really fun game for only 79p (default price) or as part of the Developer Alliance Bundle (4 games, this included for about £11) This is a really beautiful game with a wonderful soundtrack, but, it is easy to miss some important tips since most people tend to skip the chat boxes.

												Well, the first thing that met me when I started the game was a screen that wanted me to fill in an email address to get a 'free game', and the launch screen for Out There Somewhere didn't even start before I submitted an address. Then my antivirus gave an alarm about identity theft. After I let the antivirus fix the problem, the game itself finally started.The game itself is kinda nice, with innovative mechanics, but anyone trying to play this without some anti virus protection installed is probably royally screwed. Hence, I really, REALLY can't recommend it.An hour after I stopped playing it, the anti virus went off again. The game still tries to do something illegal in the background.Well, at least I got it for 0.02 euro.			"

												A short, but entertaining retro puzzle platformer.Actually it has retro graphic, which I dislike, but the fun gameplay mechanic - jumping, shooting, teleporting to solve puzzles make up for it. The gameplay basically is a platformer where you have to go through multiple rooms containing threats like aliens and lavas by utilizing your teleport gun and pistol. Some thinking and some fasthand are required, though it's not frustrating or hard like Super Meat Boy.Chiptune music is cheesy, but it's alright.It's in-arguably a bit short, though. Some people even have beaten the game in ten minutes or so, I did it in one hour. Well, forgive me. Game runs fine in my toaster laptop, 60 FPS straight.Controller support sucks, but at least I can remap my Dinput based controller F310 Logitech. It also has Steam Achievements (incentives for people who want to replay the game) and Trading Cards, good value overall.96% off at the moment - 0.20 USD equivalent, well worth every penny.Definitely recommended.

												This game is a masterpiece.  I bought this game not knowing if it would be a waste of money.  The It may be short, but the game mechanics are solid, and I quite enjoyed the momentum mechanic on the teleport gun, and it was a real challenge to get all the achievements. So worth the 5 dollars.			"

												A true Diamond in the rough.  With all of the nonsense getting through greenlight recently, it is nice to see an intelligent platformer that tests both your mind and dexterity skills, whilst managing a simple 'find the engine part' scenario after getting trapped on an unknown planet.  Things are kept nice and easy to begin with, but soon become more challenging as the game progresses.  Platforming is the genre type and the game benefits from responsive controls, good collision detection and audio feedback.Graphically - Nothing brilliant, but a competent throwback to the 8/16-bit days of the 90'sSound - Simple effects.  Nothing obnoxious - Once again, 8-bit styled around the PC engine eraDo I recommend?  I bought this for 19p on a sale and I have to tell you, it was a steal!  If you can get it for around £1 ($1.70) or less, you'll have a great little budget gem worthy of any retro-style platforming fan out there			"

I finally beat the game! I played the 2nd half of the final boss stage (in space), and it took nearly an hour to finally beat him! This game was one of the best puzzle/platform games i've ever played. The maps were challanging and it took a while to get used to all the tactics, but it was worth it in the end! Outstanding game!

I'm sure I'll do another playthrough just to talk to some other aliens since the encounters can get funny from time to time. The puzzles are fun, they're not too hard but you will have to think out of the box from time to time. You should definitely give this game a try since it offers a good amount of fun for a rather cheap price.			"

												This game is for those interested in speedrunning, looking at what your indie project could become, or a literal example of many game design teachings that stick out like a sore thumb. I would say that this game has its moments, but really, the game does nothing much to make itself have moments of impact.It's a metroidvania game that lacks bosses, powerups, or smart puzzles that offer diversity over difficulty. You'll get tired of it unless you enjoy games like the Witness for its puzzles alone. There's no climax other than getting minor upgrades or entering your ship for the final boss. There's no control of pacing aside from locking off features to your character. A new game+ mode would've really helped, where it lets you explore the game world past the final boss considering how the map makes a complete circuit but the game decides to be far too linear, and for that I think it fails.It's a short combination of megaman and portal without the gripping soundtrack, hardcore gameplay, or unique narrative. If you're a sucker for gameplay that doesn't dip in quality, then sure, pick this game up for the dollar (or 25 cents) it's worth. You get it's full worth for what you pay. It's a short, but mildly sweet experience. It's got cute character designs, neat gameplay designs, but when it comes to anything more than puzzle solving and waiting for monster cycles, it falls short. On the plus side, it's short, and easy to speedrun with the in-game timer mechanic.As far as minimally priced games go, this is one of the better ones, but you could always save up your money for a fantastic 10 dollar game over the short-lived ""experience"" of this one.

												A brilliant combination between a charming bullet hell game and a challenging 2d platformer.You play as an astronaut that goes between planets (2d platformer) and is being attack by aliens on the way (bullet hell 2d space fighter).Great music and sound, interesting pixelated graphics and cool story.Must have!

												One of the best ""Cheapest games"" I've ever played. Out There Somewhere is an underrated game that's not heard of often and people will look at games such as Out There Somewhere and say something along the lines of: ""This game looks cheap and the price is cheap so it will be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game"" But thats not the case with this game and I was proved wrong. I bought this game under 20p (So that will be something like 30-40 bucks worth) and the game was pretty decent! They did a good job with handling the platformer, retro and puzzles, in a way it made me feel nostalgic.Pros:It has a good amount of content for a game thats under a pound/dollar.The puzzles are a bit thought-provoking but are fairly alright once you know what to doHas good level designs Has a nice soundtrack to it (Love some 8-bit or 16-bit feel or whatever bit it is)Nice artwork Some good enjoyment out of the game (Especially for those who like retro feel, puzzle and sci-fi setting types)Boss fights have a Mega Man type of feel to themNice sound effectsSteam Trading Cards Cons: The ending of the game is predictableThe story is alright at best but it's a basic sort of story Wanted more but again it's a cheap made game that prices itself for under a pound/dollar so I understand thatIf I had to rate this game on a scale out of 1/10 it would be 6/10 I recommend it despite the score I gave it but that's understandable.

Inventive unpretentious 2D platformer6/10 ★★★★★★☆☆☆☆Let's make 2 things clear - I do not fancy platform games (I am not a six-year-old) and I do not long for pixel art graphics (an insult to my GPU). Having said so, Out There Somewhere is both and I can't stop enjoying this game.Gameplay seemlessly joins skills and wits, thanks to one simple, but innovative machanics.This blends nicely to the world and the story, and turns the game into an unpretentious and surprisingly coherent adventure.Graphics is simple but ejoyable pixel art, fitting the the game idea. Audio is ok. This is a bugdet product and does not bring visual fireworks. And thanks to the great mechanics does not need any.Out There Somewhere came to me as a surprise. I did not expect much and, boy, how wasn't I prepared for so much fun!.Summing upWell-executed platformer with inventive gameplaypositive good idea for gameplay, well developed into mechanics good, upretentious execution good, pixel-art graphicsnegative just a 2D platformer  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯A little, budget gem. Highly recommended. "

												Speedrunner with a teleport jumping difficulty curve.(i'm not a big fan of this genre of gaming, so go easy on me. don't take this review to heart)This game goes from simple to annoyingly jumbled with little to no help along the way. Expect to be confused and a little frustrated from the beginning. I think that a more helpful tutorial should of been in place, especially for newer players and people who aren't familiar with speedrunners.Most of the levels are really easy, but a few in between are just plain hard, from jumping and teleporting with miliseconds of error to jumping and dodging enemies while firing teleport shots across the map, it ramps up really fast. You also have to repeat a lot of content if you mess up, which is often due to the quick timing required.Easy game to play, difficult to master.The game is really short, only lasting around 2-3 hours. The game is only 1$. Anyway, this is my short review on this game, I didn't like it but I had to give it a try. I hope this review does not upset you, it is simply my opinion.Personal Rating: 1/5			"

												Do yourself a favor and just get Cave Story.This game is too short and relies on a teleportation projectile for all the puzzles. Which is fine, if it were of any decent length. It can't take itself very seriously. There are mixed pixel ratio issues in some areas. There's only 3 minor enemies if you count the thwomp clones. It ramps up the challenge, but not enough to warrant someone's time or money.			"

												I gave up on final boss as the difficulty spike proved too much for me and I haven't found the game engaging enough to try and overcome it. To the contrary of what it says on the Steam page, this game has nothing to do with Cave Story or Super Metroid. It's just a short puzzle platformer with an interesting mechanic. The teleport gun is fun and there were a couple of interesting puzzles, but overall the experience was unsatisfying.			"

												Uh, are you kidding me? 1 hour of gameplay? Really?! I'm glad I didn't spend a whole lot on this one. To the designer's credit, the game was incredibly fun, despite being incredibly short and linear. The teleportation and platforming puzzles were excellent. The retro cut scenes were hilarious. However, I was hoping that when they said ""inspired by Metroid"" they'd actually have some Metroid-esque RPG elements. No such luck I'm afraid. If you can get this title for less than a dollar, I'd say go for it. At least you get steam cards and an hour of fun. Otherwise, this is a hard pass.			"

												Reminds me of Gateways and Xeodrifter a little bit.  Fire your gun and appear where it hits. Took me 2 hours to beat, puzzles definitely took some lateral thinking. Finding the secrets made me feel like a genious. A very satifying little platformer puzzler with a very light story.It begins and ends with a space shooter but most of the game is a platformer.			"

												Beat this in less than an hour. Really fun to play around with the teleporting and what not. But seriously beat in an hour? Comon I thought maybe there was more because how easy it was. Only bought this because it was in a bundle and it was basically like 40 cents. Just WAYYYYY TOOOO SHORT.			"

												1: It assumes that all English-speaking countries are the United States. I'm Canadian, damnit!2: You have to use the arrow keys to navigate the main menu, the mouse isn't an option for some stupid reason.3: The first boss is unbeatable, you have to lose in order for the story to progress.4: If you don't like puzzle games, you won't like this.Wasn't worth my one dollar.

												Controls are too weird, cant swap to wasd so i have to use arrows, i cant use the mouse, but even so, its too awkward to use only the keyboard. this is a controller game only, i dont even see why they enabled keyboard support.the game starts off ok, and there are weird ""puzzles"" but UGH THE CONTROLS FOR KEYBOARD, i was struggling on every puzzle because x and z are not my prefferd jump and shoot buttons, i prefer space to be sump and x for shoot, or mouse. there is an option to change controls, space is not able to be used, mouse buttons arent able to be used. i give this game a 2/5, there is work put into it, i can at least see that, but the controls are horrid, not only that, but the volume control is horrindus as well, i mark of 2 stars for that, and 1 star for no immediate backstory, from what i can tell, you're a spacecop and you gotta fight to protect your mother planet, there is no story as to why or anything so........

												The game is OK, but the lack of custom controls in unbearable. You use left and right arrow keys to move, and then Z & X to jump and shoot. For me it creates a akward flow of movement. You can change the jump and shoot key binds to a very limited number of keys, which still feel awkard. If the added more options, would be a good game.			"

												I'd love to be able to recommend this game as it looks really fun but can't from my own personal experience. My experience is it's not possible to actually play it. I emailed the developers a couple months ago asking for help but haven't heard a thing from them.The problem is that the controls don't work using gamepad or keyboard & mouse. Once the start screen has loaded up, it's like there is a stuck key for pressing left and also up and down are reversed. So after eventually getting the game to load, your character immediately goes left and thats it ! the level is supposed to progress to the right so that screws that up, 2-3 seconds of seeing a sprite move to the left of a level isn't a good game in my books.I have googled the problem and searched forums but found nothing to help. So I'd avoid this game as it will be a gamble paying anything for it.			"

												and i thought that kirby's nightmare in dream land was short, this is even shorter and easier. its soo easy in fact that its like a tutorial throughout the whole game, i thought i would do space travel as if in a hubworld to go to other places, getting a crew of space people and play with cool weapons, but there's only one world, one boss and you have only one life...i also don't understand the praise the soundtrack gets. actually it feels like a bbt level playlist that isn't rage inducing.its cleverly designed but damn its soo short. is this going to be a demo for something or this is it, just look at my playtime andyou can tell this is short, or maybe i missed something?please tell me.4/10just play an actual nes game, they're even longer than this.

												If you go into this game thinking that it will be a Metroidvania game based off its description you will be dissappointed. It is extremely linear and can be beaten in under an hour on your first playthrough with no prior knowledge of the game. I was only stuck on one of the puzzles for a long time. Art style is alright but nothing to be shocked by, basic chibi pixel. The soundtrack only had a few songs in it and some of them were pretty good. If I had to tell you my favorite part of the game I would say it is the bullet-hell shooters. Unfornately these are short segements at the begining and end of the game. For 2 bucks it is a resonable price, however I could get better games for 2 bucks on a smart phone.			"

												The game lacks any form of tutorial about the teleport mechanic besides vague level names and brief dialogue leaving you to button mash to see what happens.  Very frustrating, especially when looking at guides and reviews that point out that the telejump mechanic works 75% when you do it right and I'm having difficulties trying to replicate what I did in the last room.  Thankfully for me I bought it for 19 cents so I don't feel so bad about ragequiting to go nurse my sore thumb.			"

												If you want a way to blow a few bucks on a game that's less than 2 hours long this is pretty good. The game ends way too quickly and the concepts introduced are barely compounded upon in the late game. There is little story and just when it feels like the game is going to take off and start getting serious... it' over. It feels like an hour long tutorial to a more complicated game. The music isn't that great at all and it isn't really an ""artistic"" game either. It's a neat idea but there isn't any meat to this game at all. It feels like this game was thrown together real quick to make a quick buck.			"

												Pros:-Metroidvania with matching art style-Interesting teleporting mechanics with different beams that do different things-Starts difficult, which makes it reminiscent of older games and their difficulty-60FPS?-Good soundtrackCons:-Pits of death. EVERYWHERE. And they're so open that it's hard not to fall in them during a puzzle.-Vertical Platforming that, if you fail one part, you will fall down a screen back to nearly the beginning every time.-Actually, all the puzzles make you restart them in one way or another when you fail one part.-Soundtrack doesn't really match up with the mood of some situations-NPCs are borderline useless to talk to, despite you being consistently encouraged to talk to them-WAY too many tutorials. Every time you see a new beam, the game wants you to know what it is. Every time a pixel on a graphic is shaded differently, the game has to bring up a slow-moving dialogue box to tell you. LET ME FIGURE IT OUT.-Puzzle mechanics are interesting, but they get bland very quickly, so to remedy that something new appears every screen or so in the beginning. This, however, will make the game even more bland in the end because there's way too much involved into the game that it's too complicated and ends up being uninteresting anyways.-Every once in a while I get lag spikes for some reason. I'm running on an Intel i7-4500U with 8GB RAM on Windows 10 (Home Edition) 64-bit. There is absolutely no reason this game should have any lag spikes. Also why does it claim it requires 512MB VRAM on the store page? Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst and Revolution require the same specs and is more graphically demanding in every way I can think of than this game. Also 1GB of RAM does seem like a lot to ask for with this sort of game Possibly unoptimized engine or code? I mean, I'm sure it can run on most machines decently, but if the developers here were working for a publisher for a larger-scale game, it would be unacceptable if they were to make the game require way more resources from the computer than it really should.Conclusion:Not really worth $1.99, you'd be better off paying around half of that for the game, or less.

												Out There Somewhere claims to have been inspired by Cave Story and Super Metroid, but those games raise expectations in my mind that I feel the game did not meet. The game is far shorter than expected, my first playthrough lasting little more than an hour. It is also not nearly as varied as Cave Story and other Metroidvania-style games; you will spend the majority of the game with just your teleport gun and a normal gun. And while the puzzles involving the aforementioned teleport gun are definitely interesting, the claimed inspiritations led me to believe I would have a bigger arsenal at my disposal.Another issue I have with the game is the use of bullet hell-like portions of the game. These sections feel very out of place in a game that is otherwise essentially a 2D version of Portal.Out There Somewhere is a decent game, considering the price, but the tauted inspirations to me implied a set of standards that the game did not deliver. Like I said above, this is 2D Portal. If that is what you want, then this game will do. But if you're looking for something Metroidvania-esque, look elsewhere.			"

Posted: April 24, 2015
												This review is based on the first few levels, but already I'm impressed by the music and the 2D portal mechanics, which utilizes your teleport gun.The story consists of Captain Yuri, a generic anime space cop chasing a generic fugitive alien warlord (named Grigori for whatever odd reason) onto the surface of the planet that they have botch crash landed on. Noticed the typo did you? Yeah there are a few in the game as well. I'm going to get to why I changed my review from a positive to a negative by the end of the game, but first we have to look at the positives:Pros:Silly fun and cool acheivementsOutstanding music, seriously it's never annoyingClever easter eggs and referencesFun ""2D Portal"" platforming, yes there are a lot of portal copycats, but this one is done wellSounds great, right? How could I not like this game after saying all these nice things about it? Well here we go:Cons:The plot is recycled barf, not that I expected much from this type of game, however this particular execution of ""You're the hero, he's the villian, go duke it out somewhere... IN SPACE"" was tired at best, which doesn't lend itself to the story like a Metroid game, or hell, even Portal's story was better. ""We're here to do research on portals, oh just kidding, I'm a sociopathic computer that has been trying to kill you this entire time!""This ultimately results in the one and only boss battle in the entire game. Did I mention this game was short? Yeah so with such a great game so far, guess what they went with for the boss battle, the one and only boss battle? How did JonTron put it again?Oh yes.Simon ♥♥♥♥ING says.Grigori goes from the left wall to the right every three times you hit him, and the only gun you have in the game you get in the second act (this game is not long enough to even have a third, mind you) and it's not a bazooka, it's a tiny little pea shooter that kills normal enemies in 4 hits, and Gregori needs half a bazillion to go down.Then Grigori decides it's time for round two in some spaceships that you've both miraculously had time to repair, and get this - during the game you were supposed to have picked up power ups you can only use in this one battle, but they are barely explained to you, and I don't think I picked up more than one. Oh what to do... Can't go back for them, so onwards you go for some more....SIMON ♥♥♥♥ING SAYS... BULLET HELL MODE.Yes, I ragequit that boss, yes, speedrunners have beaten this game in a clean 17 minutes...Maybe I'll go back and kill the dumb boss later...No, don't get it unless it's on sale, if for nothing else but the music, or just buy the soundtrack if it's available.Final verdict:3/10 - Cool (OK borrowed) concept and music with nice pixel visuals, but it all goes down the drain due to a tedious and unforgiving boss fight, and the lack of content or emotional investment/story development overall.

												I literally beat this game in 54 minutes. When I beat the first boss (the only boss) the credits rolled and I thought the developers were making a joke. This is probably the shortest game I have ever played, and I was greatly disappointed by that. This game describes itself as taking the pages out of Super Metroid and Cave Story, both very long games with enormous worlds to explore, but this game is nothing like them at all. It's a shame, because what is in the game is awesome. Everything is built just right and it's something new I've never encountered before. But, this game is virtually a tech demo of what should have been a much more expansive game. If the developers made a sequel to this I'd buy it in a heartbeat, but this game by itself just isn't long enough to merit a purchase at its listed retail price.			"

												This game is ok, but I have a few problems-1. The keys are so dumb. jump is z. Like what even. You can rebind them, but not to something sensible like up or space.2. The levels are repetetive. I'm already bored with the art style and level design3. The game brings nothing new. If you're looking for a retro platformer, look elsewhere. The classics are far better than this. Shovel knight did it right, but this has a lame story, dull characters, and nonexistanct plot.4. Did I mention that the levels are repetative?5. I beat the game in under an hour. I'm no speedrunner either. It's certainly not worth $5. You'd be better off playing some flash games.The soundtrack is pretty good though, but I mean, isn't that expected of modern retro games by now?tl;dr- Repetetive, frustrating, and terrible keybinding that you can't use up or space in. Brings nothing new to the genre.(I got this for 20 cents though so if its on sale get it then farm the cards :D			"

												This will sound like a very strange criticism, but the game is too dark. My IPS monitor is calibrated for accurate colors and brightness and this is the only game where I can't make out what's what. Many tiles are dark violet and are almost indistuingishable from the black background.I could make the monitor brighter, but then I would have to calibrate it back again after I finish the game.Other than that it's a simple metroidvania where each room is a puzzle (or a series of puzzles). But without ruining my screen calibration it's unplayable for me.			"

												About 5minutes into the game, you end up in a dead room. The game fails to explain its own mechanics. Apparently the trick is to jump right before your shot hits the wall (so you end up teleporting and then going into the air). This is a hugely ""trial and error"" mechanic with very little point in mastering it. PROS: -? CONS:-Bad controls-Trial and error ""portal jump"" mechanic that is essential to finishing the game-Low budget-Crap graphics			"

I can't remember how to spell that word, but you know what I mean. I will just call it EOA from now on as that will make it sound like an MMO.This game is not an MMO. At least... I don't think it is... I can't remember this game.Why am I reviewing this title? I don't even own it.

												Out There Somewhere is a waste of time.  Everything about it is uninteresting.  The puzzles are never challenging and the teleportation mechanic is berely explored.  Most enemies can be ignored and killing them is a chore because the gun fires too slowly.  Instead of being engaging, each obstacle only serves to inconvenience you.  The colors are so same-y, all the envoronments blend together, and so dark it's sometimes unclear where enemies and platforms are.  The music is generic and the writing is boring and entirely unneccessary.  Things were only put in the game because games usually have them, not because they add anything to the experience.  All they add are a few seconds to the game's paltry length.Everything in this game has been done better in a thousand internet flash games.  Instead of spending money on this, go online and play one for free.			"

												This game is completely broken and does not seem to run correctly, if it ever does.  What's more, it actually breaks your Steam session as it crashes in such a way that Steam thinks that the application is still running.  This keeps you from launching other titles or uninstalling the game.There are WAY better games for a couple bucks that were actually developed correctly.  I'm honestly shocked this is still being sold in such a broken, steam-detrimental state.			"

												Finished the game in just under 1h30m... It's way too short. I expected 4-5h of gameplay. Game mechanic is fun though. Way... Way too short. I'm Quite disapointed...I thought it was a space shooter + land exploration adventure game. There's only 2 small part with space shooting which are quite boring (no ship upgrades, etc...).This is more like a demo than a full game. I really have to wait for reviews on these indie games in the future. You never know what it's going to be like from the video presentation.			"

												The game is ridiculously difficult, even with a gamepad.Update:It turns out all i had to do was git gud. Once i figured out how to double jump, the game was a breeze. I even did a second, much quicker run of the game where i was able to get nearly all cores and artifacts, upgrade the ship, and defeat the bad guy, in 40 minutes or less.So... the game is actually pretty decent after all: cute graphics and music, and fairly interesting puzzles and secrets.By the way, the secret to double jumping is that the character must touch the floor and jump right before the teleportation. So, just time the jump to land before the pellet hits the wall, keep your eyes on it, and jump right before it hits.			"

												A fun little puzzle platformer, featuring 2d side scrolling with a teleport gun. (Think a portal gun, but only a 1-way 'port.) Pretty short if you blitz through, with the majority of game time being in exploration for all of the different collectibles. Very charming graphics and soundtrack. Story isn't terribly strong, but the gameplay is great enough to make up for it. Difficulty felt just right - difficult but not too punishing and not discouraging.Overall, a very fun experience. Would definitely recommend!			"

												A very unique and enjoyable platformer centered around using a teleport gun, almost like a 2D Portal. The puzzles are well-crafted and clever, with more than one way through many of them. The biggest downside for me was the length of the game or, more accurately, the lack thereof. This game is very short. The 1.6 hours I have on record was a single full playthrough, beginning to end. The only replay value is in the achievements, if you're into that sort of thing. If you're like me, and couldn't care less about the achievements, you may find yourself thankful that you got the game on sale and only paid $0.19 for it. I recommend the game - not the price. $5 is a little steep for a game that's over so quickly. What's there is worth playing, but it's not worth the asking price. Even with as challenging as some of the puzzles are, requiring multiple attempts, I managed to beat the game in 90 minutes - and I'm pretty terrible at platformers.Get it on sale, and you won't be disappointed. Pay full price, and you might find yourself a little irritated at the shortness of the game.			"

It is a good one go game if you have 1 hour to play video games. It was fun and the ending was very repeatative and easily won once you his moves. The space battles were easy however the setup for playing on the planet could ahve been done better in my opinion. The story for the game was very good. The friendly aliens threw me off but aside from that they played a good part and also made you feel like a badass hero.All in all for the price I payed and also the brain teazers for certain levels I recommend this game for anyone wanting a fun and casual game that they want to draw out or just try to speed run.

I have played through it many times, trying to get all of the achievements.Note: The trailer is misleading because the space ship shooter minigame is only at the start and end for only like 1 minute.What is good about it: GREAT game mechanics, catchy music, funny (and slightly cheesy) characters, secrets that are fun to find, controller support and steam trading cards.What is bad about it: The controls took a while for me to get used to and the trailor.If you see this game on sale, don't hesitate to buy it.

												I'm one of those rare idiots who did everything he could to beat the opening area, defiant of the 'no-win' sccenario. Trust me, let yourself get beaten. The real game starts the moment you fail.What plays out after you crash is one of the more charming retro indies this side of Steam. While not quite Portal, the puzzles revolving around the teleportation gun are fun and mind-bending. Some of the toughest ones are optional, but its a fair challenge throughout. A full run will cost you little more than 2 hours, but there is a lot of little things to stumble upon, and the game is worth playing through multiple times simply for the extra challenge, and the chance to see what you might've missed. On top of all this, there is an utterly lovely soundtrack with a great sound design over all. Rare is it that brevity can be counted in a game's favor, but Out There Somewhere knew when to take its leave. There is plenty of optional stuff to mess with too mind you, but for the cost of a chicken sandwich you can experience a truly remarkable little gem. One of the few games I truly wish I could give more money to.			"

Do yourself a favor.. get the game.

												First off, I bought this game on a whim for when it was only 19 cents, because I had some spare money from the steam sale, and this looked like something that wasn't a ripoff of Minecraft, see 7 cent 'Uncrowded'.I played it through to completion, and though while the puzzles are phenomenal, using a set of mechanics that really support the platforming, and give a whole new spin on it by the end, there are somethings I dislike about this game, and will mention below.First off, all the tacked on mechanics, i.e. the space battles, which are the first and last things that happen in the game.  They're contrived, really have no point, and if the game ended with the final battle that tested your skills, then that would be amazing, not the 'This is my final form' bs.And second off, the story will rub you the wrong way.  It will.  I recommend skipping all the dialogue, because its a McGuffin plot that thinks it's more than that.  (See risk of rain plot development, or lack thereof)Buy this game on sale, if nothing else.  Its short 2-3 hour campaign is just long enough to excite, and leaves you eager for more.			"

												Would definitely recommend, but once again with many games on Steam it's only worth buying when it is at 20 cents. About 1.5 hours on first playthrough and thus the only thought going through my head was that it was equivalent to a really well made flash game online. Now that we're past that...Pros:Great opening, captured the retro feel in both the cutscene and sidescroll space shooter part, especially the forced death trope was done nicely. Gameplay is smooth, fun, and rewarding. It definitely takes inspiration from VVVVV though, but no problem there. Sound is amazing, the soundtrack is great for a 20 cent game. Also a nice bit of collectibles that are well hidden, so it is good for speedruns too.Cons:A bit short so once again buy it on the cheap. The idea of the teleport gun is somewhat cliche and some parts (such as the first part of the final boss fight) felt like a lame flash game made by some 12 year old, in which the boss has only 2 moves and both are really easy to avoid. Overall this game is mostly fun aside from a few ""eh"" moments, so buy it on sale.			"

												I don't agree that this game is anything like Super Metroid or Cave Story. Don't expect to upgrade your teleporter or gun, gain extra abilties like double jumping or branch into different areas as I have not encountered anything like that half an hour into the game but do not be surpirsed if it does show up. If anything, I would describe it as Super Meat Boy (Lite!) with Portal, although with a different physics mechinic in place of flinging.It's not kidding when it describes its other elements, though. It really is a refliex-heavy game. Often, the player may solve the puzzle long before he or she actually completes it because of the timing and aim required for the exeuction. It's honestly pretty satisifying, as a result, to get through a room because I managed to not only figure out the crazy, over-elobrate plan where I need to let some beam idle for 4.5 seconds before activating the second beam, destorying a boulder on the far right, teleporting to a platform on the left using the first teleporter, waiting for the first beam to deactivate (as beams block each other), and then using the second beam to get to the door.  This, however, can be frustrating if a player wishes to rush through the game or something. That is all the game has going for it.The chiptune music doesn't really motivate players to take their time, being ridicalously reptitive and loud, and the setting and story isn't memorable or worth paying attention to so far in my playthrough. I do not even know the name of my pro- oh, it's Yuri. My male protagonist's name is a common tag for lesbian storylines in manga. Hooray. The artstyle is, well, more of what you see can see in the store page.It's fun but nothing more than an extended flash game to me. It doesn't have the humor of Portal and so the only really motivating to keep playing is to complete more puzzles. Get it when it goes on sale for less than 50 cents. "

												Awesome platforming game that's really really short. Enjoyable for what it is, left me kinda wanting more as there's a lot of disillusion in the game. The game kinda toyed around with a lot of ideas that it ended up making me ask ""is this the actual game?"" the entire way though. I never was very certain about what they were leading up to, and the fact that it did it so well makes it worth playing through.The actual gameplay was great. Tight platforming controls with a bit of a twist on how you approach platforming puzzles. Don't expect a long play through.			"

												I'll be honest here, I just bought it because I saw the discount (0,19€ at the ime of this review), but I have to admit, it's a pretty fun experience. It can be a bit frustrating getting used to the silly controls (default X & Z for jumping and firing portal gun and you can't set jump to spacebar or arrow up key - in fact, you cannot change movement controls at all), but once you get the hang of it, it's quite satisfying when you land a double reverse jump whateverdoodle trick.The art style is very likeable and the soundtrack is nice and chill, all in all making for a fun little game.10/10 would rage at control options again.

												A nice little platformer game that combines a Portal-like idea with 2D platforming genre. It took me 2 and a half hours to beat it, though there are achievements to beat it under an hour and to beat it under 20 minutes. That may sound short, and I have no idea how one is supposed to beat this game under 20 minutes, but for what this game is, it could have been bad if it lasted longer. Overall, this game is good and quite fun.Side note: There are two 2D space shooting segments, one at the beginning of the game and one as a second (last) phase of the final boss fight. Keep in mind that this game *is* a 2D platforming game, so don't get confused, angry, discouraged or something else like that when you find yourself in space. It's okay.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a laid back puzzle platformer. The main mechanic is a teleportation gun which allows you to teleport where you shoot. The gun is similar to the one in The Swapper but time doesn't slow down when you fire it and you can't make multiple copies. The difference is that this teleportation gun preserves momentum. So if you fire it at a wall and jump right before the projectile hits you'll be jumping when you teleport.This leads to some interesting gameplay the first time through and some very interesting exploring on the second playthrough. The game clocks in at about 2-3 hours for the first playthough but it's almost better the second time through when you're better with the mechanics. It has a couple shmup sections but they are brief, which is bad if you're a shmup fan but good if you suck at them like I do.Overall I really enjoyed this game. If you like puzzle platformers with interesting mechanics I'd definitely recommend this to you.			"

												Simple gameplay leading to a much deeper gaming experience than you may think.There are a few challenging mechanics to master if you're going to make it to the end, but they're not too tricky, and it's well worth it.There are also plenty of secrets that most players won't find on their first playthrough. Exploration is very strongly rewarded. There's also achievements for beating things extremely quickly, giving goals and motives for multiple playthroughs. This game was purchased for 19 cents.

												The thinking man's platformer game.Yes this game is short, but it has everything you want out of the mechanics. It makes you think, and lets you have fun. When you solve a certain room/puzzle the game lets you know you did well with an achievement, which is both corny and delightful.While this game is not open like VVVVVV, it has many of the same basic charms. Every screen is like a small puzzle, and you can not get stuck where the game experience has not taught you the skills required to succeed in the later parts of the game.It looked like there could be more from this game, and I would be happy to see it. Many of the puzzles were good and never repeated quite the same way twice. The two (three?) boss fights were interesting enough.I'll probably replay the game to try for 100%, even though there was not a progress label, but I did notice I missed a few things on my first run.

												Short puzzle platformer.Your character fall on a planet while chasing the big bad, and has to find parts to repair it.You have a gun that teleports you to the place your projectile hits, which is a really well used mechanic throughout the game.Pros:- The visuals are nice if you like pixel art- The controls are tight and responsive- Great soundtrack- The achievments inspire you to try different things giving the game a nice replayability- Charming characters and the story is nice throwback to more simple days of heroes and villains.Cons:- Short, you may finish it in under an hour in your first playthrough- May get boring to after, finishing more than once- Some rooms require a lot of of trial and error, which can get tiresome after a whileA must but if you like platformers.8,5 "

												Amazing game, worth way more than 20 cents. I think the 5 dollars is a reasonable price. It's fun albeit short, and plays smoothly. You should beat it in approximately 1 and a half hours on your first playthrough, but if you try to get all the achievements you'll be playing for a lot longer. Developers: make a sequel. I really enjoy this style, especially since the actual Metroid series isn't doing so great at the moment, this made me feel a bit of that feeling again, of exploration, adventure and space.The platforming is certainly different, but reminds me a bit of shinesparking, especially the really difficult sections.I personally haven't played cave story so I can't compare it to that, and I feel like the only thing really taken from portal was the teleport gun, so as far as I'm concerned, if you like metroid then certainly get this game. This games only downfall was its length, and I would happily play more like this. One of the best aspects they used from Metroid was sequence breaking. This is when you speed run and find ways to skip certain sections of the game (kinda neat how one of the achievements is exactly this, Shortcut) or have an item earlier in the game than you are supposed to (Daredevil). Finding out these things on your own, is what makes this game like metroid.One let down I felt was the text. Now I understand how complicated the portal gun is, and that the text is mostly necessary, but I felt that I didn't connect to the maini character as well. Super Metroid is a classic example of a game that needs almost no text, in fact the only text is at the beginning to explain what happened in the previous two games. But this is only a minor complaint, and a tip for the Devs if you are planning to make a sequel.Nonetheless, this game is very enjoyable, and I'd just like to say thank you for helping me connect with Metroid again. To everyone else, I highly recommend this game, especially for the price it is right now.			"

You are a lone astronaut that crashed on an unknown planet where you have to survive by thinking you way through many platforming puzzles, armed only with your trusty teleport gun. The 2D perspective is key here and thanks to the clear 16 bit graphics these 2 create an excellent contrast and dimension for navigation puzzles. The soundtrack is amazing and keeps your blood flowing and your brain working. And your brain should keep working cause puzzles start easy and tend to get harder with each new screen passing. A must play for any fans of Portal or platformer puzzle games.			"

												When i first got this game (in the bundle to be exsact)  i thought it'd be a 10 minute game, but boy was i wrong.The games main gimmick of teleporting makes room for so many secrets and puzzles, and when you get the the gauss gun it allows you to dispose of monsters at a grindy pace, but if you ignore every checkpoint and find the room titled ""you are so god damn stubborn"" after you get the guass gun, and getting the upgrade for it in there turns it into a machine gun.Then there's the achievements, some are easy, some are hard, some ask for skill, some promote speedrunning, some promote you to kill everything you see, some are pointless, and some ask for collecting Ancient alien artifacts and Abandoned cores. all in all it's a great game, well worth the small amount of money you have to pay to get it, jsut make sure your good at puzzle-platformers and old arcade space shooters.10/10 would rage at dying just to get a collectible to make the end of the game easier on myself again.

												Fun little platformer! Not particularly long, but had excellent music and graphics, if you're into the 8-bit sort of stuff - it's a got a nice cave story vibe going. Only complaints are that the plot isn't particularly great and it could use a boost in difficulty.			"

Pros:+ high quality retro graphic and music+ responsive controls+ fun and interesting mechanics+ frequent save points (noob friendly) + fair price Cons- very short (my 1st playthrough around 1 hours and 15 minutes)- lack of difficult levels (easy once you figured basics)- unable to turn off hint/tutorial massages (gets really annoying during later playthroughs)			"

												Fun side scroller with a teleport gun. SImilar to Portal in that phyics are taken into consideration when you teleport, specifically momentum.Trying to figure out the puzzles can be fun. I started over once I learned more mechanics because I realized I missed some items. If you see platforms leading you off screen there is usually a reason. A little shorter than I expected but still a very enjoyable game.			"

												Simplicity and charm at their finest! The teleportation mechanic is explored quite a bit, with almost every room requiring something different from the player. Great music too.The game encourages multiple playthroughs in order to discover every secret of it. The only underwhelming thing is the end boss; he could have been a llittle bit more challenging, but maybe this is part of the game's charm: it's not meant to frustrate players.Definitely recommending this one.

If it was longer it could have been another Shovel Knight/Super Meat Boy/Freedom Planet, but as it is it just feels unfinished. Pity.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a short but complete experience in the puzzler style of Portal. Rather than drag out the game by building up new powers or encountering more and more contrived obstacles, the core mechanics are introduced quickly and the designers' clever riffs off of their interesting interactions carry the game through to its conclusion.Take two to three hours out of your week to play through it; you may be frustrated but you won't be disappointed.

												The is kind of deceptive!  It starts as a classic arcade shooter style game, but once you lose that bullet hell, you start the platformer part of the game to make an attempt to repair your ship and get back into the space battle.  Armed with your trusty teleport gun, you have to find ship parts and character upgrades.  It's a fun time, but it's also fairly confusing at times.  It can be frustrating, and you may find it too difficult to navigate some of the platformer screens.  Overall, I like it, and I think you'll like it, too.			"

												I wanna move out there... somewhere...What I can say about this game - classic platformer with control points. Also - hard a bit. As usual,Well. Proc... maybe plot... I don't even know... I skip it almostly. Damn, is that all? What the @#=%?!Darn... Now about cons1- Music! The main irritating aspect of this game is music. Bit old-type melody I was awaiting, just like in Super meat boy game, shocked me. It was biting my ears, but the worst was that this melody sounds all damn time!!! Thank goddness I found option for muting this horrible noises.2 - Gameplay! This is piece of... big bad. Your hero moves slow, but your reaction must be quick!!! This is not SMB, where after hundreds of trys you will have automaticcally moutions  pressing all the buttons to reach final. In OTS every next try is like a reborn! ""This is may be good"" - can argue you! ""NO, DAMN!"" - answer I - ""After dozens of efforts I wanna see a result, my success, not every time single patters of hero dying/falling/restarting ect."" Also a lybirints build by crazy desighnirs of the game, but I can forgive them for their work done.3 - Video! I don't know. what they wanna do, but Mario seems more preety and smooth than this game. A lot's of colors with chaotic order of them placed makes my eyes bleed! Just see screenshots and remind my words.About my oppinion. I recomed this game. ""What the hell?!"" - you may ask me. ""I don't know"" - will be my answer.I just like this game. As much, as I hate it. We maybe have misunderstandig now, but... If you'll see this game on a sale - don't be greedy, buy it, and play, you'd like it, I swear.			"

												I bought this game not thinking very much of it at the time. When I got into the game my view for Out There Somewhere changed drastically. I found myself loving this game. Out There Somewhere mixes a bullet hell arcade shooter with a platformer. All of this is done with well crafted sprites and backgrounds and is accompanied by a stellar 8 bit soundtrack that never seems to get repetitive.Out There Somewhere excells with its platforming and space combat. However the platforming combat was quite dull and the characters movements were a bit sharp at times. Beyond that the teleportation gun added a fun addition to the 2D platforming style and allowed there to be puzzles in the game.The game is about an hour long but has replay value for those who want to complete everything. When I got stuck on certain areas I wasn't stuck for long as the puzzles are relatively easy. Overall I enjoyed this game and I recommend this game to all platforming fans, 8bit fans and indie fans. Out There Somewhere is a fun twist on the classic 8bit metroidvania platformer.Score: 7/10While having good graphics and a great soundtrack the platforming was a bit stiff and this game does not stand out from others of the same genre, but still a fun game nonetheless.

You can only change settings on the main menu.• The game just shows a black screen infinitely when you launch it after you've bought it. You have to reboot/restart your computer in order to play the game for the first time.• The friendly aliens that you can talk to have no purpose except sometimes revealing information while most of the times they say something utterly useless.• Too difficult at some points.

												Small cute puzzle platformer. Good fun, but very short and simplistic. Other than the ""teleporter gun"", there's nothing new we didn't see before. It is possible to complete it in less than hour on the first try, exploring nearly everything, getting more than half of the achievements, but missing most of the well-hidden bonus objects. Getting those may require more meticulous search or a walkthrough, but I don't see a point in doing that.""Inspired by"" Metroid and Cave Story doesn't mean it is even remotely comparable to those. Unlike these games, it is short, mostly linear, only has few health and one gun upgrade, rudimentary story and mostly focused on jumping puzzles, not fighting.But at least it did not overstay its welcome.

												A well made and fun platformer, until suddenly for no reason I am playing a galaxian-type boss battle. Having no part except a small intro sequence in this format and then to expect the player to beat a boss in this format is completely unreasonable. I'm assuming due to the premise of the game it's the final boss, but after spending almost as much time on the fight as I did playing the rest of the game, I put down the controller in complete frustration. It ruined the game for me and I can say after uninstalling I won't be playing it again. 4/10.			"

												Let me open by saying this game is cheap, but is it worth the price tag?Yup.I recently played(and reviewed) a similar puzzle platformer, VVVVV or some nonsense, which I didn't find was to my liking.  As such I had some apprehension about Out There Somewhere.  I'll tell you that was some misplaced anxiety.  This game has a teleport mechnic that allows it to progress beyond simple muscle reflex puzzles and actually assess all the factors on a screen before proceeding with a solution.  After I completed the game, I felt satisfied.  I felt like I had accomplished some pretty interesting puzzle platforming, and I felt like I kind of wanted to play it through again.All that being said, this game isn't very long.  I don't know how much time I spent playing it, currently, but I think it was about an hour(Edit: 54 mins...)  which was actually perfect since I was on a flight and after I finished we were close to landing.  I see myself playing this again on my return trip and probably enjoying it just as much.One interesting thing I noticed in the options was the feature to turn on a timer, which seems an interesting little contraption to let you time your runs.  There's also a few areas I can think of where I may have been able to explore but they were early in the game before I really learned the capabilities of the teleporter gun.That's another bit that's interesting.  They don't throw new items at you through the game to make places accessible, with the exception of a gun near the beginning.  Anything you are able to accomplish late game with the teleporter you can do at the start... provided you grasp the concept fast enough.  The gun you obtain later is really only to destroy blocks and enemies, but it seemed to me (nearly) every screen could potentially be accomplished without killing a single enemy.The last bit I'll mention is that I played this game entirely on the Steam Controller, I've yet to find a platformer that doesn't work well with it, but I'll say playing a game on the plane was MUCH more comfortable with a controller in hand, rather than playing the part of a contortionist to access the keyboard wedged in front of me, though this is just commentary and doesn't affect my review of the game. Addition: OK, so since I was in an airplane and didn't pay for wifi, steam didn't register the time I'd played the game and wouldn't let me post a review with 0 minutes logged.  I started up a new game and can confirm in the 12 minutes of extra play time I found 3 screens I didn't even register existed on my first play through within the 'tutorial' section of the game.  So if you happen to be an achievement collector, or just like the game you can easily double that hour play time going through with a replay. Its worth the standard price(which is cheap as it is,) but if you find this game on sale, don't hesitate to nab it if you enjoy puzzle games or plaformers.  It's got some interesting mechanics.			"

												Plenty other's have gone over this game's good points.  I instead will list two early issues I have.  One is about how the game and its DLC sountrack are listed.  I tryed buying both but steam wouldnt let me, thinking I was double purchessing.  eventually I bought just the game without the DLC and checked and the soundtrack was included.  This is super confusing and hopfuly will be fixed soon.  Seccondly, in the opening of the game you start off in a space shooter game and face off against what seems like an unbeatable boss, afterwhich your ship falls to a planet and the story/real game commences.  If this is indeed an unbeatable boss, goodness please make it absolutaly clear, because I plan to replay the heck out of the opening to try to beat it XD			"

												Im not to big on platformer puzzle games. But I really love this game. The concept of a teleport gun gave the level design alot of potential, and the developers definitely took advantage of most of this potential. Although some puzzles in the game could be completely by passed by either time a jump just right or soaring across a good chunck of the map by leaping off of a giant beacon tower thing, most of them were really engaging. Some of them really made me stop and think and plan things out. And most of the levels not only required you to think about the puzzle, but also made you react while performing this level. This concept isnt new, but it is in the game and really complements the gameplay. Being such a short game as well, the ending boss battle comes very quickly. The entire game took me 50 minutes for me to complete on my first attempt, but the boss battle was insane. A good kind of insane. And although very difficult in my opinion, it was definitely one of the most enjoyable boss battles I have encountered.     I got the game on sale for 19 cents, but the game is definitley worth its full $5. I would have loved to pay the full $5 dollars to support the developers and get some more content! But it is for sure worth your money. "

There are secrets scattered across the games levels to aid you in beating the game; such as health increases, a sub machine gun, and ship upgrades.  Sadly though, when a game has an acievement for completing it in under 20 minutes, you know it wont keep its exciting edge the third time around.			"

However I was expecting more out of the boss fight at the end. With the overall difficulty of the game up to that point I thought it would be much harder than it was. In fact it was probably the easiest part of the game. Overall this game is great, great retro style graphics, great mechanics, great gameplay, great music, meh final boss. 9/10			"

												This game is everything I have ever wanted in a short, cheap Metroidvania puzzle platformer. Don't buy it for $5, but for $0.19 it's a steal. A very cool and not at all gimmicky teleport gun mechanic, controller support, and a campaign that takes 90-120 min if you don't know what you're doing, 60-90 min to 100% if you know what you're doing, and 15-25 min to speedrun if you know what you're doing. I've played through the game start to finish about 5-7 times and I still don't have all the achievements. The collectibles are extremely fun and there's only one that I had to look up where to find it (the 11th core). All in all, I recommend this game to any fan of Metroidvania games and puzzle platformers. My only complaint is that backtracking is severely limited, but it's OK because the game is so short. Great replayability, great value, great game. 9/10.			"

												*NOTE: This review was written by an individual who purchased the item at the time when it was  obscenely discounted (96%)!*Portal + Metroid (NES) = Out There Somewhere.  This was a great little game, and I would have loved to have seen it last longer.  It took me about 2 hours to beat the game, but there is a marginal amount of replayability if you push for acquiring all of the Steam achievements.The game is 2D Metroid (NES) style and is very linear, with a few optional detours for special items if you feel up to it.  Each side-scrolling screen you pass into plays out as increasingly difficult Portal-type, platforming puzzles.  Near the 2/3 mark of the game, there were perhaps 2 screens that were difficult enough that I had to cave in and check a walkthrough for and when I found the answer, it was a slap-upside-the-head DERP answer I felt like I should have obviously known, but some spots do require some brain-power, which were refreshing.*DISCLAIMER: Everyone and their dead dog needs to buy this game while it is only 19 cents to purchase!  That being said, although it is a ton of fun, I personally would not recommend it for the full $4.99 price tag due to the overall lack of bang for your buck.*			"

It can be a bit frustrating getting used to the silly controls (default X & Z for jumping and firing portal gun and you can't set jump to spacebar or arrow up key - in fact, you cannot change movement controls at all), but once you get the hang of it, it's quite satisfying when you land a double reverse jump whateverdoodle trick.The art style is very likeable and the soundtrack is nice and chill, all in all making for a fun little game.10/10 would rage at control options again.

												Definitely not worth 5 dollars but is good. Probably would pay $1 for this at max. Its a puzzle platformer that would talk an hour or two to finish. Could breeze through it if you had a guide. OK writing for the few characters that appear on screen. Have a qualm or two with the final area. Once you beat the boss theres no turning back. That's all I'll say.			"

												If you're wondering, it's nothing like a Metroidvania. It's more like Cave Story's side-scrolling + Portal mechanics + VVVVVV with an even more minimal story. Regardless it's surprisingly a pretty fun game which, despite lacking originality, makes up for it by being well-thought through and challenging without being soul-destroying.Of course there's only about 100 minutes worth of game there but, honestly, any longer and it would have been too long given the lack of any remarkable plot, development, characters, or, well, anything but gameplay. 3/5			"

												Out There Somewhere is a nice puzzle platformer that genuinely feels like a mix of Cave Story and Portal. The game is pretty short - and it's fully possible to beat it within 20 minutes, which is one of the game's hardest challengest - but there's a bunch of things to collect that provides replay value. I got it for 17 cents when it was on sale, but it's honestly worth the money whatever the price.The music works with the setting and the graphics are done well and the gameplay is fair, but challenging. My only complaint is the shooting segments. While it's not hard to pick up on, it really clashes with the rest of the game's gameplay, and the fact that it's the final fight bizarre since your only experience with such segments is at the very beginning. But overall though, it's a great cheap game.			"

												Wellll, I found this game shooooort and quite frankly it just doesn't live up to the epicness of metroid, possibly not even meatboy -- I beat this game in a couple hours and you can only shoot in one direction and no suit upgrading happens here. The teleport mechanics are nifty and make for some mind bending puzzles. The combination of side scrolling shooter and platforming is nice, but again the both sections are short and only a few enemies. There really isn't much outside of that that makes this game appealing. One thing it was really missing was gamma control. I'm giving it a recommendation because it was only 50 cents, but this really needs some fleshing out.			"

If you enjoy platformers and/or Portal, you'll definitely enjoy this game.Beware that the 'story' is relatively short (~1 hour), but that achieving 100% might take some more time. This game turns any amateur suddenly into a speedrunner. Otherwise it has nice gameplay, great graphics and music. It's good value for money. Please note that some people are upset about the shortness of this game, about the repeatedness of some puzzles and about the rare & sudden difficulty spikes.

Also, the hidden pickups and achievements (at least one of which requires you to traverse most of the game without hitting a checkpoint, providing a fiendish challenge) give the completionists among us something to do.

												Love it. It`s like Portal meets Metroid. You are a lone astronaut that crashed on an unknown planet where you have to survive by thinking you way through many platforming puzzles, armed only with your trusty teleport gun. The 2D perspective is key here and thanks to the clear 16 bit graphics these 2 create an excellent contrast and dimension for navigation puzzles. The soundtrack is amazing and keeps your blood flowing and your brain working. And your brain should keep working cause puzzles start easy and tend to get harder with each new screen passing. A must play for any fans of Portal or platformer puzzle games.			"

												A pleasant surprise of a game that I bought on super sale. Not really a Metroidvania, more a puzzle-platformer with a bit of exploration thrown in. The main mechanic - a teleport gun - is mined for all its worth. When I finished my first playthrough I was eager to take on the challenge achievements.Don't be thrown off by the R-Type opening sequence. It's easily the game's weakest feature and not representative of the quality spritework in the main game. Overall a solid game well worth its low price.			"

												Awesome platforming game that's really really short. Enjoyable for what it is, left me kinda wanting more as there's a lot of disillusion in the game. The game kinda toyed around with a lot of ideas that it ended up making me ask ""is this the actual game?"" the entire way though. I never was very certain about what they were leading up to, and the fact that it did it so well makes it worth playing through.The actual gameplay was great. Tight platforming controls with a bit of a twist on how you approach platforming puzzles. Don't expect a long play through.			"

												I don't agree that this game is anything like Super Metroid or Cave Story. Don't expect to upgrade your teleporter or gun, gain extra abilties like double jumping or branch into different areas as I have not encountered anything like that half an hour into the game but do not be surpirsed if it does show up. If anything, I would describe it as Super Meat Boy (Lite!) with Portal, although with a different physics mechinic in place of flinging.It's not kidding when it describes its other elements, though. It really is a refliex-heavy game. Often, the player may solve the puzzle long before he or she actually completes it because of the timing and aim required for the exeuction. It's honestly pretty satisifying, as a result, to get through a room because I managed to not only figure out the crazy, over-elobrate plan where I need to let some beam idle for 4.5 seconds before activating the second beam, destorying a boulder on the far right, teleporting to a platform on the left using the first teleporter, waiting for the first beam to deactivate (as beams block each other), and then using the second beam to get to the door.  This, however, can be frustrating if a player wishes to rush through the game or something. That is all the game has going for it.The chiptune music doesn't really motivate players to take their time, being ridicalously reptitive and loud, and the setting and story isn't memorable or worth paying attention to so far in my playthrough. I do not even know the name of my pro- oh, it's Yuri. My male protagonist's name is a common tag for lesbian storylines in manga. Hooray. The artstyle is, well, more of what you see can see in the store page.It's fun but nothing more than an extended flash game to me. It doesn't have the humor of Portal and so the only really motivating to keep playing is to complete more puzzles. Get it when it goes on sale for less than 50 cents. "

												First off, I bought this game on a whim for when it was only 19 cents, because I had some spare money from the steam sale, and this looked like something that wasn't a ripoff of Minecraft, see 7 cent 'Uncrowded'.I played it through to completion, and though while the puzzles are phenomenal, using a set of mechanics that really support the platforming, and give a whole new spin on it by the end, there are somethings I dislike about this game, and will mention below.First off, all the tacked on mechanics, i.e. the space battles, which are the first and last things that happen in the game.  They're contrived, really have no point, and if the game ended with the final battle that tested your skills, then that would be amazing, not the 'This is my final form' bs.And second off, the story will rub you the wrong way.  It will.  I recommend skipping all the dialogue, because its a McGuffin plot that thinks it's more than that.  (See risk of rain plot development, or lack thereof)Buy this game on sale, if nothing else.  Its short 2-3 hour campaign is just long enough to excite, and leaves you eager for more.			"

												Oh... My... GodYey Yes Yes all the yaaaassGot this game for 19 cents, and it was more than worth it.So, I'm gonna tell you guys why I loved it so much.Visuals- One word: Pretty. Done in an 8-bit fassion, and done well tooGameplay- Also done well. It gave me a portalgasm, and that's always goodDifficulty- My main man, fair challenge. Enemies are better avoided than fought, and the platforming is very dynamic and will take any gamer several tries at some point. And in the whole game, I didn't die once where I didn't think it was my own fault.Price- At 19 cents, totes worth it. At 2 bucks however, not so much. It was short, but amazing, I played it in one sitting, but I think 1$-$1.50 is a fair price.Overall: 8/8 Best indie game I've played in awhile.			"

One part of it your in a spaceship flying around shooting everything up, the other part is you adventuring on a planet having to find your way past obsticals. Sometimes you have to stop and think about what to do next. Other times you just dodge your way past enemys. This game is over all very fun even though sometimes you will get stuck and get frustrated.			"

												Very short cute game. You can finish it in two hours. Graphics is not bad, but not incredible. Mechanics with jumping and teleporting make the game enjoyable. Story very shalow. Villain attacks your side, you have to go after him all alone. We don't know who your side is. Could be evil intergalactic empire populated by good ordinary people doing their jobs and the villain a freedom fighter who dares to defy the ruling empire. Of course he is used to being on the other side of the law so he looks like a pirate and its given him a bad rep. While you the hero are  a overzealous enforser of the said empire and you don't see how in the long run the empire is trampling on the lowest developed worlds while the prosperous worlds keep getting prosperous. Like I said shalow story, lost potential. Get the game at a discount and it doesn't matter its short. TL;DR Fun platformer game. Very short. Find it on a discount and buy it.			"

												I can't really recommend this game at regular price (2 bucks) but at it's current sale price (50 cents) I guess you can go and nab it. The game's mechanics are sound, the music is nice, and the overall presentation is pretty good, but the major, major flaw of this game is it's length. The whole game from start to finish is a mere hour in length, though if you're a huge completionist you can get some more playtime out of it. When I got to the end of the game, I expected it to continue onward, exploring another world or something, but instead it ends at a cliffhanger and left me wanting more out of it. That would be fine if this was like a demo, but for a full game? Not acceptable.			"

												I'd recommend this game on sale, as it's horribly short.If you rush through it you can complete it in under 20 minutes, even without good knowledge of the levels.There is a fair amount of secrets, but save for ""no checpoint"" bonuses, you should be able to find them all in few hours even without a guide.Puzzles are extremely easy to figure out, making the ""stuck"" achievements look like a reward for having a dinner mid game [One I unlocked was obtained accidently this way].But it is really a fun thing to play, it doesn't feel like a half-a*sed flash game ripped from newgrounds with a price tag smashed on it. Even though it's a short fun time, it is a really quality fun time. On a bigger discount [or not if you're less of a cheapstake than me :P] it is definitely worth a buy. Chiptune soundtrack sounds really cool too, enough that I'd listen to it outside of the game.			"

												This game is worth a lot more than it's price. Don't be fooled by the 199 cent price tag this game is good. Maybe even great. First off the soundtrack, is great, it's refreshing, catchy, and motavating in whatever area you are.While the story is simple, this doesn't really make it worse, as the game is mostly reliant on it's puzzles for quality, and that's a good thing too, because the puzzle are pretty good also. They're all sentered around this portal gun that beams you to wherever the bullets hit. From there, new elements are added to modify gameplay slightly, but overall, the basics are the same. As far as difficulty, this game is a medium, although there will be certain rooms that are so strangely difficult and out of nowhere that you'll be tearing you hair out either trying to find the solution or trying to figure out how to put that solution into action, but most of the time it's a pretty smooth, slightly difficult challange.Overall, I deffinetly recommend this game to anyone who likes platformers.8/10.

												Pretty good. Teleporting is not really my game. Bought it anyway on sale (for point something money) played for a couple of minutes before quitting, like I knew I would. Let it sit on the shelf for some months. Then played again, continued and finished. Not too difficult. Rather short. Which is okay for point something money.I've played a bunch of similar games before, and I especially love the ones where you upgrade yourself. Like you get double jump, get jetpack, learn to breathe underwater, get more life and so forth. In this game you get a gun at some point and that's it. I was a bit disappointed. But for one money I'd get it. Will never play it again though.			"

												After enjoying completing the game with 100% and just some cards left to collect, I decided to give this fine piece of software a review.So what's this game anyway? Basically it's a platformer, with minor Shoot'em Up parts both at the beginning and the end of the game. Armed with a teleport gun and a space suit you control Captain Yuri on his journey to defeat the evil Grigori.Simple control scheme: arrow keys and 3 others, Z X C by default, Europeans might want to swap Z with Y prior to starting. The game does have controller support, I used a keyboard though and had no problems.Over the course of my several playthroughs and experiments I only encountered 1 or 2 minor bugs you wouldn't experience without specifically looking for it. Even if, none of them was game breaking. Otherwise it's got smooth and clean animations, perfect hitboxes and overall fair difficulty. There's no real tutorial but is streamlined on directs you perfectly through the mechanics, the growing complexity should be no problem for the average player.If you want all achievements though, you're in for a tougher challenge, brace yourself and activate your thinker.As for the design, it's an adorable small indie treasure, you won't get 10 hours of excitement but instead you'll get challenging fun packed into a small platformer. Nothing looks out of place, everything fits into this colourfully bright (but not bilindingly bright) small universe. Even the music is brilliant for such a small game, it's repetetive but it doesn't get boring, this way it's even fun waiting for the ""delay"" Achievement while doing something else. Only downside is there's no transition when the BGM changes but hey, it's not like that would hurt anyoneMy first playthrough took me an hour and roughly 15 minutes, the only thing that really got on my nerves was clicking through Yuris messages on my playthroughs after the first one...Bottom line: whatever you pay, it's a bargain			"

												I've never left a review for a game but this an exception.  I picked this game up on a whim, and it didn't disappoint.  While the game is short, especially on subsequent playthroughs, I'd say it's about the length of the first portal game maybe a little shorter.  The gameplay is excellent except a couple spots where you don't realize where a platform is, and I thought the final boss, while fun, was just way too different from the rest of the game.  The music and art style is quite fun, with the few cutscenes having a distinct almost robotech flare to them.  This is a great and fun game, and I highly suggest checking it out, and I look forward to more from Miniboss.			"

												This game can be pretty enjoyable for a few hours, and it's somewhat memorable. I'll go over its notable aspects here.StoryThe story is pretty much as basic as it can get, cliché even. However, I was satisfied with how they handled it in implementation. Whoever designed the story segments was well aware that nobody would care. Instead of shoving some bland exposition down your throat while you slump lifelessly over your keyboard and wonder if playing through this game is a commitment you're willing to make, it provides the story in short, quickly skippable (or quickly readable) lines of text. You can get through it in a few seconds, and you're not missing much if you ignore it entirely. The gist is that you're a spaceman on a foreign planet and need to kill some guy. Narrative gold.GraphicsThe pixel art isn't bad. It's not anything special. It's not too repetitive. Sprites gel pretty well with each other, but tile sprites stick strictly to their square shape and corners aren't adorned in any way to reduce the jaggedness of such defined tiles. All of the main character's animations are so beautifully fluid, though, and the walking animation is adorable.AudioThe music is pretty average. Sometimes it gets better, but it gets redundant and loses its charm as it loops. In the game's store page description, it throws around names such as Cave Story. If they're going to tote around a reference to a game like that, I think it's only fair to interpret that as a standard to hold their game to. It falls abysmically below this standard.ControlsControls feel fine and function as intended. Some precision is required, but it's not unforgiving.MechanicsThis is the good bit. The game is based on traversing through puzzles using a simple mechanic: You can fire projectiles horizontally. When these projectiles impact something, you are teleported to the point of impact. Combine this with precision platforming and quick thinking, and you can pull off some neat stunts. New objects are introduced that add more depth to the puzzles. For example, there are colored beams that can destroy, obstruct, or even redirect your shots. These can be toggled by switches or obstructed by objects. I think the store page description's comparison of this game to Portal is actually pretty fair. While the mechanics and dimensionality are different, they require the same kind of problem solving and reflex. The teleportation gun is ineffective as a weapon, however, which brings us to...CombatAt first, you have to avoid enemies entirely because you lack a means of removing them. At some point, your character aquires a new tool: a firearm. Now, the first thing you'd want to do is go out and start packing heat at anything that looks like it could accommodate a few bullets, but you'd soon find out that your shiny new baby isn't very empowering. There are only a few types of enemies. Some exist to serve as barriers in the puzzles, and your weapon is only a tool for removing them. The rest exist just so that there are enemies. They're usually not challenging or unique, but I suppose they do add some variance. You can collect hidden items to increase the number of hits you can take, but health isn't really something that needs to be managed. Other than the boss battle, the combat isn't explored past this.I'd like to point out that the store page description also points to Super Metroid, and again interpret such a reference as justification to compare these games both ways. Again, it's not even a close comparison.At the end, you have to utilize both your teleport gun and firearm to battle the main antagonist by moving around the room to dodge attacks and position yourself to have a clear shot. This part is actually quite well done, but I was not at all prepared for what came next. That's covered in...Level Design and ProgressionPuzzles can be pretty creative. They're typically not too difficult, and checkpoints are generous enough to ensure that you're not getting frustrated about replaying the same sections. Puzzles frequently introduce new ways to utilize the tools that you already have, rarely feeling repetitive. If you're observant and think a little more to get to alternate paths, you can get rewarded with items, even if they're not always useful. The puzzles are overall satisfying and engaging.The largest and ugliest flaw of this game is its length. When I reached the end, I was unsure if I was just misinterpreting what was going on. It was just so absurdly short. It was a decent ride, though.Now, I'd like to explain how it pulls off this ending. In the last section, I mentioned a boss battle in which you use what you've gained to take out the main antagonist. After he's defeated, you get out of there, walk a screen or two, and then it slams into you so unnervingly hard. Suddenly, the quite enjoyable puzzle platformer I was playing now has me careening through space in my ship, toe to toe with another.I am now suddenly playing a side-scrolling shoot 'em up sequence. There is no similar puzzle mechanic or anything. There's just dodging and mashing to spam bullets. I personally do not enjoy shmups. I barely play them, and when I do, they do not entertain me. I didn't know that I was in for this when I played through a puzzle-oriented ""action platformer,"" as the store page describes it.Anyway, maybe I just suck at these things, but I didn't have the motivation to power through that final boss battle. I got someone else to help me out with the mashing part, just for the sake of completion.RatingI've decided to rate this game positively for two reasons: I picked it up on sale for a nice price, and the majority of the game's mechanics and level design were pleasant and impressive.TL;DRI originally intended for this to be brief, but yet again, I rambled far too long. Basically, the only good selling point is the great puzzle-based gameplay. The game is incredibly short (a few hours at best), so it's best to pick it up on sale. I wouldn't advise paying for it at full price unless you're an afficionado for this stuff.			"

												K, I finished it. Its a great little game. Because Im a cheapskate, I like games to pay only for games that are replayable but I got it at a major sale of 96% off, (19 cents). Because the game is only 1.5 to 2 hours long, I would not reccomend it for full price of 5.00$. As a game itself though, it was great! Its a mixture of the old style look of games like metroid and a little of a Portal like idea.  A great strategy game, kept me on the edge of my seat. Not extremely frustrating, but at times not easy at all. I Loved It! I would only reccomend it though at a most pricepoint of 3.00$ in my opinion, but if your bored and you got an extra five bucks, dive in! I love how it switches from strategy to (for a very short time) a galactica type of game. I actually wish they would expand it so that say you would need to go onto different planets, gather parts and then launch back up where you would again engage mid space. AMAZING SOUNTRACK, SO CATCHY!!! I LOVE IT!!! WHERE CAN I BUY IT?! Great Little Game! (-1 due to full price evaluation) 9/10			"

												It's a really nice, little game. The pixel art is interesting through adding little effects here and there, like how the background is always moving, yet it's not distracting. It makes a cool visual. The game's setting has an oddly not-so-desolate, metroid-like, planet as a setting, which I'm also a big fan of. Another thing I enjoyed was that all the NPC's were nice little guys, and came some interesting lines, if you went the distance to talk to them. The soundtrack is also really nice, it fits the space theme without being boring. The puzzles (stages that have you use a portal gun to advance) were difficult, but never so hard that I gave up. That was a big one for me, and it probably had to do with how well you could see the puzzle in whole, and the simple mechanics. I really love the puzzles. The story is... not very exisistent. There is some bad guy, Grigori (ugly fellow), who is a total jerk, he blew up your ship, you wreck, so now you have to find him on this planet you wrecked on (I don't know why the bad guy is there, I think we were trying to go to the planet to attack him, buy it's not well explained). It does provide an objective, but it isn't very complicated. In whole, I bought the game for $0.16 (an awesome price), and was surprised. However, the game is really short. My 3 hours were all I needed to beat the game. But, if you're okay with short games, it's a lovely experience. I was only upset at the length to be honest. It feels incomplete,  like a greenlight game. I really want more cool puzzles and funny creatures, but then the games over. I also beleive that with more time it could have a neat little plot to help tie the story together. I just want more. An update with a story that goes somewhere (maybe to other planets) would solve all my issues with this game. There are collectables and an achievement for completing the game under an hour, which make the game more replayable in its defense, but it just won't fill the void.			"

												Very begrudgingly, I recommend this game. Very begrudgingly! I did enjoy this game. It had fun mechanics, a nice look. Some good little humor thrown in here and there, but it didn't really have too much of a drive towards it. Near the end of the game I forgot I still had a nemesis to beat... and that his name was Grigorio. I was just concentrating on getting that orb... thing. And the main bulk of the gameplay is Portal-esque 2D puzzle platforming, and it's puzzling that doesn't just require know-how, it also requires good timing and patience. This game has a big difficulty curve, and you really need to think outside the box in order to beat it. My biggest complaint would have to be... the last boss. The game only has you do the 2D sideshooter for the first minute of the game, then expects you to hop back in knowing exactly what you're doing, right when you have to kill the final bloody boss. Thank you game, I have a brain, but not as fast of an adaptable one as you may think I do. With the main push towards patience, timing, and creative thinking- Out There Somewhere pushes it right out the door with the fast-paced, shoot-em-up with the final boss, and I did not like it. At all. But for what it's worth, the main bulk of the game and its gameplay is very nice. A fine throwback to old-school Nintendo games... but with a much nicer look.			"

												Got this game for 21 cents. Best deal ever!This game is like metriod meets a portal gun. Except a little diffrent. When you shoot your gun when the ""teleshot"" as the game calls it, hits a wall, you instantley teleport there. Sounds simple, huh? Well just like portal, it gets crazy. Your teleshot preserves movement, so if you fire and then jump at the last second, you will jump at that other place you just teleported to. This can be used to jump, fire, then as soon as you hit the ground jump again to do basically a double jump. Theres also a bunch more mechanics as well, such as 3 diffrent beams, enemies, glass and wood, mirrors, and a bunch of other stuff. Also the achievments are pretty challanging (all but one) to get and can add hours of gameplay if you're into that. Overall, great mechanic, great soundtrack, love the metriod style, and challanging achievments. 9/10.Edit: theres a HUGE difficulty spike at the final boss, one misclick and you're screwed. Thought i'd mention that.			"

												I bought this game  on a sale while it was priced 19 cents .My primary intention was getting cards .  This game drops 3 cards which will cost you more than game price if you try to buy it from market. I wasn't interested in playing this at all. I thought I'll keep it minimized after playing  a minute or so - just to see the gameplay mechanism.--------------------------------------Well , after almost an hour I am still playing . And All I can say is - ---""This game worths way more than 19 cents. Period.""Just if we can assign any buttons for button remapping . I can't assign Spacebar or numpad keys .Anyway, For a simple flash game,  I'd give it a 10/10 .			"

												A very unique and enjoyable platformer centered around using a teleport gun, almost like a 2D Portal. The puzzles are well-crafted and clever, with more than one way through many of them. The biggest downside for me was the length of the game or, more accurately, the lack thereof. This game is very short. The 1.6 hours I have on record was a single full playthrough, beginning to end. The only replay value is in the achievements, if you're into that sort of thing. If you're like me, and couldn't care less about the achievements, you may find yourself thankful that you got the game on sale and only paid $0.19 for it. I recommend the game - not the price. $5 is a little steep for a game that's over so quickly. What's there is worth playing, but it's not worth the asking price. Even with as challenging as some of the puzzles are, requiring multiple attempts, I managed to beat the game in 90 minutes - and I'm pretty terrible at platformers.Get it on sale, and you won't be disappointed. Pay full price, and you might find yourself a little irritated at the shortness of the game.			"

												 Great all around. Great Art. Great Soundtrack. Great Story. Great Gameplay. Great Boss Fight. Great Fun!The teleportation mechanics are very interesting and unique. This was where I struggled in the game. During my first hour of Out There Somewhere I couldn't manage to progress at a good rate because I was getting stuck not understanding the best way to jump. It was simple after I got the hang of it but before that it was a struggle. I even had to resort to walkthroughs to see how they position or went about doing a series of jumps.I got this game on sale for 29 cents kinda on a whim. After playing through it though I would for sure recommend it at full price although if you are slightly unsure just wait I'm sure it will be on sale again! And the last two or so lines of dialog at the end of the game made the whole experience just.. I don't know how to put it.. AWESOME! Definantly check this game out!			"

												A fun little platformer with interesting jumping/teleporting mechanics and smart level design. I bought it for $0.59, and it took me about 1.5 hours to beat it for the first time. Didn't collect everything or go for all the achievements, but that's probably double or triple the time. Anyways, it was totally worth the meager amount of money I spent on it. Beautiful graphics, tight controls, and quality sound design. Soundtrack was very enjoyable. If this was one level in a larger game with maybe 3 or 4 levels, it'd be a legendary platformer. As it stands, while it's short, it's also pretty cheap, so I'd definitely say it's worth the purchase. I highly recommend it.			"

												This is a mix between Portal and Super Metroid.  The controls are tight and the gameplay is original.  Using the portal gun in this game really makes you rethink standard platforming conventions, and when you get the hang of the controls the game is a lot of fun.  I got this game on sale for 19 cents and it was certainly worth more than that.  However, I beat the campaign with many secrets in under an hour, so I'm not sure it is worth the full 5 dollar asking price.  Replayability is in trying to unlock all the secrets, although even unlocking them all during a second playthrough only adds another 30-60 min of gameplay.  In all, this is a really interesting game and I'd certainly recommend it during a sale.			"

												Like many others stating the fact, I too bought this little gem during a sale. It's quite entertaining, the gameplay mechanics are obviously well thought out, controls are responsive and suit this type of platformer very well. Visually and audially, the artistic integrity is to be respected if not admired. Obviously the developers are well aware of the requirements of the genre, having managed to create a charming and addictive game. This is particularly refreshing in an age where just having some ""sense of retro"" thrown in the game is thought by many devs to be sufficient to deliver a fun experience. Overall, it's not only creatively unique but delivers consistently captivating gameplay. As a side note, the game feels very natural with an Xbox 360 controller's analogue stick. If you have a controller, use it.Highly recommended.			"

Also, the soundtrack for this is really good, everyone who likes retro tunes should check it out.There's also a lot of achievements for those interested in them. Even if you want to 100% the game you'll be done with it quickly but the achievements do motivate to play through it 2 or 3 times just to see if you can find all the collectibles or beat it in under 20 minutes (it can actually be beat quite a lot faster actually).I bought it for 19 cents on a ridiculous discount and had a real fun evening with it, I definitely recommend this. The short game length didn't really bother me, everything about it felt well designed and I'd rather have a short but fun experience than a long tedious one.			"

												It was pretty short (will probably take you about 45 min to 1 1/2 hours) which is why I would recommend putting it on your wishlist and waiting for it to go on sale (I got it for like $0.19).  Besides the overall length of the game the gameplay was actually way fun and the puzzles were very well thought out and difficult due to time and effort put into them, rather than just being annoyingly hard like many games.  Great game, and if it had maybe 1 or 2 more hours of playtime I would say it was worth that full $5.00 price.  Honestly for $0.19 I was super surprised and loved it because honestly I was expecting a giant pile of horse♥♥♥♥♥♥for that price!			"

												I liked this game, but it's incredibly short as lenght, which is a negative trait in a metroidvania (which this game hardly qualify as, though).On my first playrun, I managed to finish it in 30 minutes, even if I didn't go to do the 100% completion rate.Considering that so far I know there are no alternative endings or bonuses for collecting everything at 100%, I do not believe it's worth the hassle to do so. (especially as you may have to go around the planet 2/3 times to get all the things)So, let's get to rating...Music: 8Good music, good sound effects, but nothing to write home about. Enjoyable.Gameplay: 7This game has been dealing well with the whole teleporting gun jig. Sometimes confusing, but in the end it was fun.Graphics: 8Good pixel art in there, though not the best one I have ever seen. Still, executed greatly.Replay value: 4There is no big reasons to keep going much further if not to get the 100% (for completionists). This one has been lacking in both duration -and- replay value. Good for players that are completionists, but nothing else.Total: 6,75A good title with interesting mechanics, but way too short. "

As far as puzzle platformers go, you could do better (VVVVVV), but you could also do so much worse. If this game goes on sale for 19 cents again, make sure you get it. Even if you don't like it, you can sell back the steam trading cards and practically break even.			"

												I'll be honest, I didn't expect much at first, but it was actually quite a great little game. There's only one serious flaw I could point out - the game is severely short (~1h if you don't rush through it and actually try to collect everything). And after playing it, I've wanted so much more of it in terms of locations, story, enemies and other types of content - it *feels* like a skeleton of a great game that lacks flesh. I'm hoping they'll make a sequel one day...			"

												Short, and sweet, and to the point.  The puzzle are just challenging enough to keep you entertained, but not difficult enough to ever become frustrating.  Without a built in world map, you're probably going to need a walkthrough if you want to 100% it. Note that the game is only ""inspired by Super Metroid"" in the loosest sense. There is minimal exploration, and the progression is very linear.			"

The only problem is the length of the game, but that really isn't one when you consider what is in it.

												Out There Somewhere is a game that feels like an homage to action platformer games like Cave Story and Metroid. It is on the short side of gameplay (about an hour or two), but I had fun the entire time and wanted more when it was over. It also has plenty of hard-to-reach areas with secrets that require some prior planning and well-timed actions once you have a feel for it on your first playthrough. It is a great game that brings back memories of early platformers with some new, creative elements of its own.I'd highly recommend this game to anyone with a couple of hours to spare and a desire to play something that's just plain fun.

Now, you can speed run this thing in about 15 minutes or so, if you're good, but there's tons of little secrets to collect.Honestly, it doesn't feel like a finished game as much as a proof of concept.

												Out There Somewhere is an action-platformer where the primary gimmick is a gun that teleports you to where you shoot it. It's quite short — my first playthrough clocked in at just over an hour — but even so there's a surprising amount of depth in the game's platforming challenges, as well as a few secrets here and there to discover. I legitimately tried looking for as many as I could in that first playthrough, only to discover at the end that I had missed around half of them. Additionally, for the speedrun inclined, there is an option to display a timer, and it is entirely possible to finish the game in about 11 minutes.The game doesn't feature a complicated plot — it's the simple tale of a space cop who has to shoot up an evil alien dude. If you're a huge nostalgic memelord you might enjoy the blatant Zero Wing references. Graphically, the game resembles Cave Story with extra frames of fluidity added to the sprite animations. It's nice to look at in general, and the alien friends are charming. The chiptune music is also pretty good, save for one annoying track near the beginning of the game that seemed to only last like 20 seconds before looping.There are several minor issues I suppose I should mention. For one, there are many screens that cannot be returned to once they're left, and frequent checkpoints, while normally a boon, mean that if you've missed a collectible, you've probably also lost the opportunity to get it. Considering that health upgrades are part of these collectibles and you only have one health to begin with, it is entirely possible to end up past a point of no return where you have to finish the game as a one-hit-wonder, or just restart because it's too annoying to handle.Along with that, there's also an achievement that requires having 30 teleport gun shots on screen at once; the only apparent way to do that causes a cacophony of ear-piercing sound effects unless the game is muted. I can't imagine this being an oversight, and since I'm a jerk I found it sort of amusing, but still ow.Nitpicking aside, Out There Somewhere is a solid title for anyone in want of bite-sized platforming fun. It is also literally $0.19 during the Steam Summer Sale, and the 3 Steam Trading Cards it drops should recoup the bulk of that price. This game is a must buy before the sale ends.p.s. i just noticed that the developer's logo mascot changes colors on every start up and that is an odd feature i don't know if anyone but me would notice but i like it thank you			"

												There's a lot of junk on Steam, specially in the 2-49ct category. I bought this game for 19ct and I'm overwhelmed at how good it is. It's basially an 8-bit style platformer where Portal-style puzzles are solved with the help of a teleportation gun. The graphics are neat, the dialogs funny and the music is very retro, though it could use some polishing (the transitions between the loops are not very smooth and the music start to be very repetitive quite fast). Nevertheless, Out There Somewhere is a nice, challenging little game with NES-style graphics and music. Grab it if you see it in the bargain bin: it's totally worth it, or of course at full price, if you're a retro puzzle platformer geek. You sure won't regret it!			"

												Out There Somewhere is a fun, indie, action, puzzle, adventure platformer that is SUPER fun. It's very unique, and reminds me a lot of Portal and You Have to Win the Game.In Out There Somewhere, you are Yuri, who has gone out to kill Grigori, when your ship crashes on a mysterious, and mildly hostile planet. You soon learn that Grigori is on the planet as well, on your search for the one thing that can get your ship running again: the Light Orb. It is a very good plot, and it controls really well. I found it easier to play with controller, rather than with the keyboard. The achivements in the game aren't that difficult to get, and the game doesn't really take that long to beat. There are two types of guns that you weild: the teleportation gun and the guass gun. The teleportation gun is pretty self-explanitory, and the guass gun can be used for killing enemies and breaking ""unstable"" blocks. Also, this game has an amazing soundtrack. It's one of ny favourites in a long time, but Skyrim, Mario, and Zelda's soundtracks are still better.Overall, this game was a LOT better than I first imagined. The game is also child-friendly, so people of all ages can play. I highly recommend this game to everybody. You won't be disapointed.			"

												Ridiculously tight, well implemented 2D platformer that runs with the idea of a teleporter gun & mashes it with near perfect controls, puzzle design, and learning curve. You'll die, sure, but it's because you suck, rather than the game wanting to make you feel like you suck. What makes this is inspired is how well its gimmick, the teleporter gun, is implemented - you fire it, a bullet goes off traveling, and when that bullet hits something, you'll be instantly transported to that point - continuing your current momentum. That's what's key. You get eased into these simple 'jump up & shoot towards this platform you can't jump across to' puzzles & then suddenly you're jumping up, firing it off across to a wall, landing & jumping again in a different direction just as it hits, then repeating all that immediately in a different direction, but with none of the stress of a lot of these dumb modern-retro platformers.  It rocks.			"

												A really clever little game with interesting momentum based puzzles, amazing music, and fabulous pixel art.The puzzles can sometimes be tough to pull off or just be downright confounding when you try to start working your way through it, but it's a good, refreshing kind of frustration (akin to Portal's frustration) that leaves you feeling like a genius and a platforming master by the time you get through it.The spaceship portions are tough but simple bullet hells that killed me a LOT, but I just blame my poor dodging skills and it's by no fault of the game's mechanics or controls.Although I was able to ""finish"" the game in around a total of 2-ish hours, I still have a looong way to go; especially if I hope to make a dent in the considerable list of achievements (and as if to add a cherry on top of this, the achievements also have more of that gorgeous pixel art! I love it so much).And along with everything else, a big bonus was the price I paid for it - just $0.49!So this game gets a really solid 8/10 from me.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a wonderful game. It reminds me of Super Meatboy mixed with Cave Story and a little bit of the classic Metroid games. It has an amazing ost, the best 8 bit ost since Shovel Knight. The telaporting gun thing works really well and is used for some very challenging puzzles, that will most likely A: Make you relize the game is a little unforgiving to B: I want to ragequit, but I can't since the game is too addicting. I guess the only problem could be the 8 bit graphics since thats pretty overdone at this point by most old school 8 bit indie games like this trying to recreate what it was like to be a gamer in the 80s or 90s, but graphics are not everything if a game is fun. If theres any thing I'v learn from games like Earthbound, CaveStory, Undertale, and the old NES Mega Man games its that a game does not need to focus on the graphics if the gameplay is fun. Yes a game does need to have graphics that are appealing, not saying that any of those games are not appealing, its just that Out There Somewheres graphics should not be the foirst thing you at as critizism since that would make you miss out on a really fun not very well known indie game. It is currently 49 cents Steam so I recommed you check it out and buy it.			"

												Holy hell. I\'m a big fan of Metroivania games, and this one definitely packs in everything I loved about Super Metroid and say, Portal. It is by no means a long game (~1-2 hours), but it\'s a sweet experience. The teleportation mechanics are fun and refreshing, and the controls handle supremely well. I\'m just hoping for a sequel or DLC content (please!).			"

												This game is short but smart, with replayability value (for completionists) up the wazoo. The core gameplay mechanics are solid and polished, the pixel art is tight and sexy, and the music is very sweet – it fits the mood, too, and never gets annoying. Which is always a good sign for music.""Out There Somewhere"" is a 2D action puzzle platformer that includes a teleport gun that quickly grows on you. There's plenty of secrets, and the best part is that you get to live the circumstances yourself under which the space cop Yuri engages the pursuit of the bad guy Grigori.9.0/10.0			"

												This was a fun game, definitely worth the price. It's an engaging platformer with a novel twist, that provides some interesting puzzles throughout the game. It's a bit short, but nearly all of it is awesome and fun to play, although I would have loved more puzzles at the ""difficult"" level (i.e., for the puzzles to be more challenging for more time). But, if you play through trying to find the hidden items, the game becomes even more interesting and provides new challenges. That can keep you busy for a little longer.			"

												This game is absolutely awesome! And for the same price as a bottle of Tesco Value Cola, you've got yourslelf a keeper of a game.Pros:- Soundtrack kicks da butts- puzzles are just the right difficulty- nice amount of little extras in there too for replayabilityCons:- Game isn't long enough!Don't get me wrong, this game is a nice length, I managed to complete it in under an hour, but the game gets so fun you WISH there was more to it. The story is simple - you crash, find your ship parts, stop the bad guy, you win. The really nice 16-bit graphics and music give this game such a nice retro touch! I LOVE this game, and I think I'll be replaying this at least a few times more. On a side note: There needs to be a release of the soundtrack for this game, It's incredibly addicting.P.S. This game is so good, I bought copies for all my Steam friends.			"

												Out there somewhere is a simple yet interesting 2d retro platformer. It has some cool mechanics that are easy to understand but hard to master. The level design is good, the levels are moderately difficult while remaining mostly good looking. The music and sounds are reminiscent of the sounds of old 8-bit and 16-bit titles, allmost to an anoying extent. The main selling point of this game however, for me, was the incredibly low price. Get this on sale if you have 20 cents to spend.			"

Even though it's a short game, for the price you can get it for right now, which is 19 cents, it's more than worth it. Plus you get trading cards that you can sell on the market.By the way, for all the achievement hunters out there, once you master the game's mechanics I think you'll find that if you replay it, you'll know how to get to areas you hadn't been to before, so that's totally worth checking out.

However even though the game was completely different from what I thought it was, I was pleasantly surprised with how much fun I’m having with it, and my only complaint is that I’d like it to be longer.

												The is kind of deceptive!  It starts as a classic arcade shooter style game, but once you lose that bullet hell, you start the platformer part of the game to make an attempt to repair your ship and get back into the space battle.  Armed with your trusty teleport gun, you have to find ship parts and character upgrades.  It's a fun time, but it's also fairly confusing at times.  It can be frustrating, and you may find it too difficult to navigate some of the platformer screens.  Overall, I like it, and I think you'll like it, too.			"

												True to popular description, Out There Somewhere is highly reminiscent of classic retro-style platformers like Cave Story: it's fairly challenging, it isn't very long, it has catchy music, and it plays like a dream.The teleporting mechanic is difficult to master but rewarding once you get it down, so much so that you'll find yourself using it even when the situation doesn't call for it (much like we probably would if we could teleport around at will). The controls are tight, and unlike Cave Story's Quote, Captain Yuri doesn't feel very floaty when he jumps or falls. A lot of the platforming puzzles in this game involve well-timed drops that Super Smash Bros. Brawl-styled gravity would make far too easy to perform, so this is a very good thing.Out There Somewhere is great. Get yourself a copy!			"

Puzzles are challenging and make you think about the portal gun (which works differently enough from Portal's to feel like it isn't a pixelated ripoff) in different ways. Combat is minimal, and the boss battle (singular) is kinda annoying, so it's really just the puzzles and the collectibles. But it's still fun for the less than 2hours it took me to beat it.			"

												This game's just about long enough to finish in one sitting, with puzzles just challenging enough to feel satisfying. Even at full price, it's a nice deal - but on sale it's an absolute no-brainer. The music & atmosphere & graphics are all spot-on retro goodness. I'd snap up a sequel to this without a second thought.			"

												I got this amazing game for $0.18.This is the cheapest game I've ever bought, yet it's fun as hell!You earn trading cards too, so you practically earn your money back with cards you can sell if you buy this game on sale.96% off of a game that's amazing! I love it.Pros:• Hours of fun!• Amazingly cheap on Steam Summer Sale! $0.18 (or $0.19 depending where you live)!• You get trading cards which you can craft badges from, or sell them and earn more money than what you paid for the game.• Levels don't seem repetitive as there are new items and mechanics that appear every so often.Cons:• Awkward controls and you can't change them.• No settings in pause menu. You can only change settings on the main menu.• The game just shows a black screen infinitely when you launch it after you've bought it. You have to reboot/restart your computer in order to play the game for the first time.• The friendly aliens that you can talk to have no purpose except sometimes revealing information while most of the times they say something utterly useless.• Too difficult at some points. I just rage quit because I can't complete a level, lol.The cons aren't that bad. I bloody love this game!It's a crime for a game so good to be so cheap, even on Steam Summer Sale.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a nice puzzle platformer that genuinely feels like a mix of Cave Story and Portal. The game is pretty short - and it's fully possible to beat it within 20 minutes, which is one of the game's hardest challengest - but there's a bunch of things to collect that provides replay value. I got it for 17 cents when it was on sale, but it's honestly worth the money whatever the price.The music works with the setting and the graphics are done well and the gameplay is fair, but challenging. My only complaint is the shooting segments. While it's not hard to pick up on, it really clashes with the rest of the game's gameplay, and the fact that it's the final fight bizarre since your only experience with such segments is at the very beginning. But overall though, it's a great cheap game.			"

												Out There Somewhere is an okay little platform games with minimalistic retro pixel-based graphics and music. The game mechanics is based on jumping and a teleport gun that teleports you to whatever you shoot with it instantly. There are some blocks and beams that react differently to the teleport shot and you conserve momentum, so that if you jump before being teleported, you will be going up at your point of teleportation.It's a simple and decent mechanic. It may be a bit hard to understand at first, but you get the hang of it quickly, and when you do get the hang of it... the game ends.Yeah, the game is really short, I beat it in 32 minutes of game time. I didn't try to do a speed run or anything, I was just solving screens one after the other. Maybe there are optional paths I didn't check out, but it didn't feel like it. So, yeah, very short, but it is a very cheap game, so I won't complain, just adjust your expectations.			"

												First hour:I don't rememebr buying this game; nor installing it.  Pressed Play and was happily surprised.  Music is catchy.  It's level design is nice and hints at Metroid-style exploration/revisiting new paths.  The puzzle mechanics are ok, but haven't gotten old.  My only frustration was with certin enemies, but you later get a tool to deal with them, so I'm fine now.  The SHUMP intro was fun, but needs some polish, and the main protagonist monologue hasn't been annoying.  My only real complaint is that the ""Launcher"" is just an advertisment for the publisher's other games. Very tacky, but is limited to the launcher.It's asking $2.  Yup. It's a $2 game and you can do far worse than this for half-a-Starbuck.			"

												Short but very fun; totally worth the two dollars.I beat the game in about an hour and a half, and within another hour and a half found all the secrets and unlocked nearly all achievements, so it's not something you'll spend more than an afternoon on.  But the price makes the time more than fair.The game plays solidly.  The graphics and music are good.  The game is neither taxing nor unfair.  And quite simply, it's fun.  Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised with how much fun and rewarding the game was.			"

												When i first got this game (in the bundle to be exsact)  i thought it'd be a 10 minute game, but boy was i wrong.The games main gimmick of teleporting makes room for so many secrets and puzzles, and when you get the the gauss gun it allows you to dispose of monsters at a grindy pace, but if you ignore every checkpoint and find the room titled ""you are so god damn stubborn"" after you get the guass gun, and getting the upgrade for it in there turns it into a machine gun.Then there's the achievements, some are easy, some are hard, some ask for skill, some promote speedrunning, some promote you to kill everything you see, some are pointless, and some ask for collecting Ancient alien artifacts and Abandoned cores. all in all it's a great game, well worth the small amount of money you have to pay to get it, jsut make sure your good at puzzle-platformers and old arcade space shooters.10/10 would rage at dying just to get a collectible to make the end of the game easier on myself again.

Also, when you first unlock the weapon that actually hurts enemies, it does little to no damage (considering it's a one-hit KO on you), and one of the first enemies you face after getting the gun is one that flies around trying to get you. It makes it a lot harder when those ones are around.It's still a great game.8/10			"

												If you're a fan of pixel art platform games there is no excuse not getting this game. It is pretty short but it's very appropriately priced and it has great replay value. The controls and mechanics are very fluid and the difficulty is well balanced; it's challenging but it never feels frustrating. The soundtrack is good and while the ending can feel a bit abrupt I never felt the story was the main focus of the game. Don't go into this expecting Undertale-level storytelling, but rather a really solid, mechanically challenging platformer.The only real downside I can think of is that the dialogue boxes could be smoother.

												This game is such a fun game and a challenging one. With this game you will try what you think fail then try again fail then rage quit and then try again but this time think ahead what to do and do it and react quickly then fail try around 5 more times fail and then get it and feel amazing. I loved this game just because of how challengin it was. The last level is the worst it is so damn hard I had to try maybe 50 times (no joke) to beat it. I was playing around my mom and she was worried because I was just hitting my computer and smashing random buttons. Now when you read this (if you even bother) you will think this sounds like the crappiest game ever but you are wrong. Every time you exit the room and enter the next one you feel so happy especially when you beat the final level. 10/10 such a fun game. NEVER GIVE UP IT IS WORTH IT.P.S. BEST 25 CENTS EVER!!!!!!!!

												Best 20p you'll probably ever spend. Well designed levels and nostalgia-inducing 16-bit graphics and sounds make this a brilliant little game. A couple of hours per playthrough make it a good evening's entertainment, that's not shoved full of filler quests or monotonous grinding to flesh it out.10/10 - would play again.			"

												TL;DR Mario banged chell from portal and their kid turned anime and♥♥♥♥♥♥ Now baby mario is going on his own adventure to find Samus.What would happen if Mario (aka jumpman) finally made it to the castle, and didnt find peach. Instead, he fell down a long tunnel, and woke up in Aperture™ Sciences and found the portal gun. Then he got stuck in a time space portal and woke up in an anime space cadet simulator. This brave new frontier is what we now so lovingly call ""Out There Somewhere""; a direct refrence to the plot of this game. I have yet to find it, and the replay value is practically nil. But its a nice game for the monies, and I would rather buy a whole new game, than a CS:GO case key anyways.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a great game. The game offers good soundtracks on each level. The levels are puzzles which can take around 1-10 minutes to do depending on the what level you are on in the game as they get harder. Each level is unique and gets your mind working to solve them, I loved the feeling of solving the puzzle of each level and completing each one. There is a text anolog which is each to read and follow to understand. You can talk to characters in game which can say funny things. There are saves so you don't need to start fro mthe beginning. You can control the character easy with the keyboard. Overall it's a great game to relax and it does take around 1-3 hours first time to compelete at first, after that you can complete it in around 30 minutes, I've completed it 3 times it's that entertaining...

It probably took less than two hours to complete and it was only slightly difficult. I was notified that this game was 90% off, which is why I bought it. But either steam lied and it wasn't on sale, or the full price is $20, because I spent $2 on it. I would probably recommend this game for two dollars, about a dollar an hour is not bad.			"

												I saw this game on steam for 0.24 euro with a 76% disscount. So I decided to buy it because it was very cheap.And I am glad I bought it. This game is very well made with nice music that fits to the style of the game.The puzzles are amazing and a lot more it definetly deserves more recognition and a higher price on the steam market ( it goes for 1 euro) while we have games like grass simulator that goes for 5♥♥♥♥♥♥♥euro. The only cons I can find is: 1) Make an option where you can return back to previous checkpoints ( there where a couple of times that I missed some secret rooms and I wanted to go back but I was stuck at the new checkpoint that I accidently stepped on there was no way of me turning back ).2) On the last BOSS fight make the fire button automatic because it is really difficult to avoid all the bullets and at the same time pressing the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the X button. :D. I hope that I helped you guys I recommend it 100%.			"

With your trusty teleport gun, get through dangerous puzzles and monsters to once and for all defeat Grigori, and save the universe from domination. I think that's the story.			"

												What a game, man.  I jokingly sold cards in front of a friend that didn't know you could do such to play it, just because why not?  Three hours later and I've enjoyed it more than most games, it held my attention because the achievements were something most games achievements aren't: fun.  I did all the ones I care about, no way am I going to get the ones that require me to suck, because those are dumb, but whatever.It's great, and if it's on sale like it is right now, 19c is little to ask for something that's actually somewhat inventive.  I mean, I guess it's all been done before, but the flow of the game is pretty unique with the techniques the portal gun employs in this.  Just check it out, if you like puzzling platformers, there's no reason not to.			"

												Bought Out There Somewhere on sale for $0.19, it regularly sells for $4.99. It's worth the regular price, because I'd probably spend that much in quarters to beat it. I have 1.7 hours on record, and that was one playthrough to finish the game. The teleportation mechanic works well with the level designs. A few of the puzzles can be skipped easily with well placed portal shots, but they don't require enough effort to feel like more than small victories over what seems to be the planned route. A decent amount of that 1.7 hours was spent experimenting with routes through different areas, and found that the developers were a little bit amusingly playful, though I don't want to spoil the experiences for anybody who may be pleasantly annoyed by them.The game isn't really about fighting. It feels as though some schmup tutorial project was thrown into the project to add meat to the game, but its difficulty amounts to how quickly you can mash the fire button, especially with the large amount of life you're given during the schmup portions of the game. The Gauss gun is used in some decently challenging puzzles, but not really necessary for any combat.The music is reminiscent of Cave Story. I caught my head bobbing a few times, and had to look around to be sure nobody was up to catch my inadvertant dysrhythmic neck spasms.I described the movement on my twitch stream as being something between Super Mario Bros. 3 and Mega Man, with better air control than Mega Man, but maybe some more friction than SMB3. The controls feel tight and responsive, even though it requires about 1/4 to 1/2 of the game for me to develop a habit for good teleporter jumping.I finished this game wanting more. Definitely check this out if you enjoyed Cave Story, or any platformer that requires tight and precise movements using combinations of buttons.			"

The gametime I have on this is the time it took me to beat it the first time around, had to watch someone else do a couple of these levels on you youtube to get further in the game, so it is challenging.  Out There Somewhere really gets you to think how to use your teleport ability to its full power.  It has a very retro/indie feel.

When a new puzzle style is introduced, your character will explain it and it will give you an easy example to get it down. There is also a part where you have to find a secret tunnel, but once you explore a little bit two people tell you that the tunnel is there. you are never completely confused on what to do i loved this game and would recommend playing this game for anyone with a little extra money. Also, you can speed run this game if you are intrested in that.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a retro-looking puzzlegame in which you navigate a 2D environment by the use of a gun that teleports the player around.The game binds together puzzlesolving aspects that are mostly based on thinking and reflexes. Despite a mediocre plot, the gameplay itself was enough to make me play it through. The music was very catchy and I was glad to find that the soundtrack was included when my friend bought me this game. Pros:- Good puzzles- Originality- Music- GraphicsCons:- Short- The story could've been developed more- Not much replay-valueSo is this game worth getting?Yes. Despite the length of the game (1-2 hours, give or take) I find that you get quite a lot of enjoyment from it while it lasts. If you like the retro-style and enjoy puzzlegames, I'd recommend picking it up. Especially during sales, this game is an absolute bargain.			"

Really interesting game with a unique gameplay.Soundtracks are magnificent, graphics too.It is a pity only that game not so long, and ends somewhere in two hours.			"

												I was not expecting to enjoy this game as much as i did. Controls are tight, Puzzles are challenging, Soundtrack is unexpectidly enjoyable to listen to. I highly recomend this game to anyone that just wants to have fun and literally spend the next hours finding achievements.			"

												For what money I paid for this game, it was extremely impressive. The momentum mechanic and the clever level design makes this game exceptional. It's a very thought out game that I recommend to anyone looking for a puzzling platformer.			"

												A funky little pixel graphic platformer with a teleport gun that takes seconds to learn how to use and hours to master.  I've only just finished a single run through, but from the available acheivements I can see that there is much more to this game.On the down side, some save points were spread to thin, making me replay the same challenge multiple times even after I'd beaten it.  Also sandwiching the platformer between a space shooter seemed a little odd.			"

												What happens if you mix Mario with Portal? Portal Mario. or this gameOut the Somewhere is awesome. one of my favourite indies at the time for the price of only $0.20Very entertaining and very cool mechanics. I've only played a bit of it, but a assure you that a really have fun, and i'm not a fan of this types of games. it could get a little grindy sometimes but it's not the most of the cases.8.5/10			"

												This game is like a combination between puzzle game and to a much lesser degree R Type (a 2D space shooter). Your character starts off in a ship on a mission to destroy enemy ships. After battling for about 5 minutes, you crash to the surface of an unknown planet where you try to find a power core to get back into space. On the planet, you encounter unique obstacles and gain powerups that aid in the collection of parts and the upgrading of the ship. Much less time is spent battling in space than being on planets to collect gear; that might be different later in the game and I will update my review if it is. Overall a decent game if you are into platforming games that have many puzzle elements to them.			"

												A platformer with one trick. You can shoot a teleport shot. Where it hits you're character will end up. It's a solid little game that a good player can play through in an hour of so. There is some replay value to it with some ""hidden"" items you cantry to grab.			"

												I think I paid maybe 50 cents for this game.I really like the ideas here, and the platforming is great.Puzzles are challenging enough, without being obscure or hard to discover the solution.  The challenge is more in actually doing the task hahaVery well made game, and not too pricey either.  Other people will likely define the gameplay or style in more depth, I am just trying to give a thumbs up here.			"

												Cool game.  Story is short but it's a fun puzzle platformer.  After my first playthrough I still have half of the achievements left to get, so I'll probably play it again.  Neat old school feel with cool 8bit graphics and a great soundtrack.			"

												A well made and fun platformer, until suddenly for no reason I am playing a galaxian-type boss battle. Having no part except a small intro sequence in this format and then to expect the player to beat a boss in this format is completely unreasonable. I'm assuming due to the premise of the game it's the final boss, but after spending almost as much time on the fight as I did playing the rest of the game, I put down the controller in complete frustration. It ruined the game for me and I can say after uninstalling I won't be playing it again. 4/10.			"
