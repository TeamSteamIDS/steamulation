												War of the Human tanks plays like a sort of grid-based strategy game in the vein of battleship, but with significantly more tactical options and threats than the board game classic. Unit abilities can light up fog of war, kill enemies at greater range, self-destruct your unit for a wide swathe of, well, destruction, and so on. Between missions, you spend supplies gained from previous sorties to upgrade and replenish your army, increasing their effectiveness, area of effect of attacks, range, and so on. Its titular unit, the human tanks, are mass-produced military personnel who for some unknown reason look like cute young women and charge fearlessly to their doom at your command. If that sounds too weird for you, this game may not be for you. But if you can look past that strange outer layer and the (gasp!) DREADED ANIME AESTHETIC (the horror!) this game offers a lot of fun and deep tactical gameplay. The plot is presented in a visual novel sort of style between missions, so you will have to do a lot of reading. But there is plenty of (dark) humor to be found, and some surprisingly deep themes for such a wacky game.Also, its soundtrack is seriously catchy and unique. I personally ADORE this game, and if you have any interest in tactical RPGs like advance wars or any other strategy title really, I think you could do a lot worse than War of the Human Tanks. If nothing else, try the demo - it gives five levels of playtime, plenty to decide on whether this game is for you.			"

												War Of The Human Tanks has quite the weird premise in that, as you can guess, that the tanks used in battle are human or at least things that act and look human. The game has been developed by Yakiniku Banzai and published by Fruitbat Factory, and you can tell inspiration has come from the classic game of Battleship with an evolution to the formula. a bold task to undertake and one that has been well executed. It’s hard not to compare War Of The Human Tanks to battleship where you place your pieces on the board, while the AI does the same though neither side can see where the enemy positions are. Your pieces are combined of Command units which if destroyed means you lose the battle,Shock units that are basically bombs,Assault units that are the basic infantry, Battery that can do long range damage, Scouts which do recon, Interceptors which defend your units from incoming missiles and finally the Samurai/Knight tanks which are the only units that can evade attacks.These seven types are unlocked over the course of the campaign, and after each battle you can upgrade them by developing units with more weapons or modules that give certain advantages to different tanks. It's a good system to have because it keeps the game interesting as you decide how to shape your army as the battles get tougher.The actual war is mix of anticipation and luck.In War Of The Human Tanks the pieces move around, so at one point you may discover where a unit is then the next second that enemy could have moved onto one of the unknown squares.Its a mechanic that can lead to some tense battles, but they never stray into frustrating.In fact when you lose a battle it doesn’t seem unfair but instead a lesson, as you work out which tanks the enemy is fielding and figure out how to counter them. The game’s campaign is designed like it is a TV show with intros and end credits present before and after each battle. There will be story scenes before the battle giving both a background and adding more depth to the characters, then scenes after the battle showing character reactions. What I also liked is that outside of key battles you didn’t have to win them for the story to progress.If you’re looking for a cheap strategy title then this is definitely for you.			"

												Human-like Tanks: what's not to like. Gameplay is easy enough; I found it to be like a watered-down version of Advance Wars, with one of the largest divergences being tile size = hit points (1x1 unit is killed/destroyed by one hit, with a few exceptions).I liked the storyline between battles too. If you read in other reviews about how the cutscenes were too long; you can speed it up by holding down Spacebar, if I remember correctly. You can also unlock and replay maps, if you're not into the main storyline.Get the game, or you'll make Heshiko cry a second tear.			"

(If you really wanted to though you could skip past it but you'd be missing out imo)It's a bit easy so far (I haven't beaten the game or anything though yet, so this might change)Edit: an unintentional bug gave me unlimited money, it's already been fixed probably why it was so easy haha (this shows good support for the game too!)

												War of the Human Tanks is a charming grid-based tactical game. It features a set of colorful character archetypes (the strict Satou, the easygoing Choko, a shut-in genius, and a bunch of awesome 'Human Tanks'. After playing for over 30 hours, here's what I think..Pros:- upbeat soundtrack- large unit strategic variation- challenging bonus maps- multiple routes- easy to learn- great character designCons (sort of):- the campaign was too easy (common in a lot of games that emphasize difficulty in bonus content)- the tutorial was a bit lacking- there's a fair bit of farming involved (as with most Japanese games)- there is no way to significantly speed up large actions (you can cut out animation but it still takes a while to do hit confirmation for a large target area radius attack)**The game has a lot of dialogue in it. If you are solely interested in the tactical combat, there are several skip features implemented to aid in this.Overall, the game was really enjoyable. It would have done just fine with a little less farming but that's not much of an issue. The campaign does not take long to complete in case you are interested in the story behind it all. I am definitely interested in playing the other titles in this series once they get on Steam!Oh and for those of you who like achievements..

												This is a weird game.You don't really need my review to see this, it is after all a strategy game where all the tanks are at the same time anime girls and the setting completely accepts and incorporates both aspects of this somehow.I know that these anthropomorphic representations of war vehicles are not unheard of in anime / Japanese media, but for me it took some getting used to.Don't let the look of the cutscenes fool you though, this isn't really a visual novel, nor will you end up dating your tanks. It's not quite that far out there. This is, first and foremost, a tactical strategy game.Your troops are deployed (at specific positions of your choice in the landing area) in a hexagonal grid representing the battlefield, and you move them around in a turn based manner. The presentation is very clean and static, with no real detailing on terrain or anything. This isn't necessarily a good thing, but I managed to look past it eventually.There are various classes of human tank, each fulfilling different roles on the battlefield. From reconnaissance scouts to suicide bombers to artillery installations to the run of the mill tank.Each of these types can be improved with resources won from battles, allowing you to construct direct upgrades to the original types (usually slightly more expensively than the older one).There is plenty to unlock, and some of the unlocks even have story tied to them when you manage to get there, but getting everything can be quite the grind.The story takes place in an alternate-history Japan, where two factions are fighting for control of the land. You are a lieutenant in charge of a recently reinstated branch of the imperial army, and manage your human tanks with the help of your trusted mechanic and a newly assigned advisor / observer sent by high command (both also anime girls, because of course they are). The story takes some twists and turns and was a lot more interesting and entertaining than I expected, basic anime clichés aside, and I was happy with how it was brought to its conclusion.I got one of, I think, four possible endings and the player is free to start over after they've reached an ending and take their army as-is into a new game. Between missions you are also able to replay any previously cleared mission (and a variety of side missions), which I feel is a nice touch.I would recommend this game to players looking for a decently long, very Japanese strategy game with a solid focus on story and replayability.There is a sequel out as well, I have not yet had a chance to try it but this first instalment forms a complete, stand alone story.

Battleships and chess with lolis.Fantastic fun, interesting story with many twists and several endings, engaging gameplay that demands strategic thinking and an incredible soundtrack throughout.The game's story is told through visual novel format, which sets the state of affairs and the stage for the battle to follow. Battles are fought in real-time, but with a sort of turn-based system that runs on ticks, for example after giving a unit orders to move you must then wait for it to radio in asking for new orders before it can be moved again. Battlefields are presented as a grid of octagons, and before the round commences you must first place your units as in Battleships. Each unit has it's own special properties and characteristics similar to chess, for example some may move 2 spaces at a time whereas others may only move 1, or one unit might only be able to attack horizontally whereas others must attack at least 2 spaces ahead of itself. The aim of each battle is to eliminate the opponent's 'Command Tank' before they destroy yours which, regardless of how many units they have remaining, wins you the battle. The battlefield is covered by a shroud as seen in most real-time strategies with sight range varying between your different units, so early game tactics may usually consist of Battleships-esque artillery strikes into the dark hoping you'll hit something, as your units gradually advance closer to the enemy, thinning out their ranks until their command tank is within firing range.Very nice little strategy game, with several challenging achievements to really push your tactical prowess. (You don't know pain until you've watched your entire platoon get demolished by a cat)I also throughly recommend purchasing the unbelievably extensive soundtrack, 91 tracks with a runtime of exactly 3:32:23. Three and a half hours of various funk, electronica, pop, rock and other genre-bending music that's really worth a listen if you're a true connoisseur of music.Great game, I personally managed to lose 73 hours to it and I've already pre-purchased the upcoming sequel, ALTeR.Definitely recommended if you like strategy games and/or visual novels and/or lolis.

												I'm a long time fan of the Fire Emblem series, as well as the Final Fantasy Tactics series. I'm one of those people who'll get mad and reset whenever someone dies. In my fantasy wars, my army destroys it's enemies mercilessly without any casualties.This game did some bad things to me.One of the first units they gave me blew herself up all in the hopes of taking a few enemies with her. I reached out, a soft no escaping my lips before her final warcry, a deafening explosion, and a heavy silence.War of the Human Tanks is a comedy game of give and take, managing your expendable human pawns in an effort to make sure the enemy loses more expendable human pawns. It's brilliant. I expected this game to start preaching at me about war and death and the value of life and it never did, because the game recognized that those things are probably common sense, and instead we could have light-hearted, yet dark humor develop interesting characters. I got the game to slake my thirst for grid based tactical combat, and also received a surprisingly deep narrative along with it.The most notable feature of the combat is that it takes place in real time, with your light, kamikaze units often being the quickest, and your heavy, blow them up from a distance units being a bit more sluggish. The game uses fog of war to keep you on your feet and a wrong step into enemy territory is certain death. Not for you, but sometimes you feel pretty bad when your terrible decision making gets your innocently little scout shot to pieces. Most units die with only one hit, but units that are larger-and thus also easier targets- must be hit in each of their segments before they die.If I had to complain about anything, it's that once you get certain units you're basically an untouchable god of death. When you can literally bombard an entire half of the map with just one unit, you're probably not going to lose any fights. But then getting to that point is rewarding the first time you actually get to do it, but that said, the challenge maps usually laugh at simplistic strategies like that and send you straight to hell. Well, not you, so much as your pawn tanks, but still.Pros- Hillarious, surprisingly interesting narrative, combat is simple enough to pick up quickly and deep enough to stay interesting for the long haul.Cons- Some of the sound effects (mostly death cries) get annoying pretty quickly, not too hard to get over-powered, and I wish there was a competitive multiplayer mode, even if it was just local.5/5As a final note, this game has a demo, so there's no reason not to at least give it a try.

												One ending down and 3 more ending to go.This is a game about war and it's weapons. Usually when we battle in war we ignore the life of our weapons. Yet the weapon serves us faithly and to their very end. It's common for soilders in war to gain an attachment to it's weapon and because best friend.In this game the weapons are alive and they are called human tanks. Mostly devoid of emotions they fight in battle and sacrificse themself without a second thought. So on the first glance surface this is just a cool anime game that use hex-grib battle system. Yet the story and background give deeper meaning to the deeper thinkers.For most of us it's a very light hearted game that's basic anime drawing character with real-life photo style background most of the time. The Graphics is likable and sound is well done. Gameplay is actually quite hard unless you spend time grinding for crates and keep your tech generation ahead of enemy forces. Scouting is very important and a priority. 8.5/10 for a really fun and enjoyable hex-grid war game.			"

												At first sight, you can think this is strange game, since the tanks are humans. But if u are fan of Kantai Colection or Upotte, this isnt a problem; well if in Kancolle have Shipfu and Upotte have Gunfu, maybe u can find your Tankfu here. Its a vn game mixed with strategy game, so the battle system is strategy based in turns, where every turn u control your human tanks and need reach certain objectives to win the battle. In your standby phase, u can dev new tools to upgrade your tankfu since they can be destroyed or you can dev new tankfu models. For story, is very funny and hilarious. Pros:- Well, in otaku world have every type of waifu, so why not Tankfu?- The story is very funnyCons:- If u are a neko lover, dont play this one in mission bonus; because they are a hell cat, with few turn they can destroy your army. But if u win, can have neko as ally.			"

												An odd but great doujin game by Yakiniku Banzai! or Yakiniku Oh! Yeah!Basically, a full scale war breaks out in Japon between the Imperial Army of the Empire and the Royal Army of the Kingdom. The primary weapons of war are artificially created beings called Human Tanks who are designed for the sole purpose of dying and combat. They are treated as weapons and have no humane rights whatsoever. You play as the laid back general of the Empire, Shoutaro Daihon'ei, as you push the overwhelming Royal Army away and strike back.The game flows and plays very similar to the Super Robot Taisen series and most of the Strategic RPGs (SRPG) out there including Fire Emblem, Advance Wars and FFTactics. That is, you start with the story full of dialogues then you get into gameplay then the aftermath with more dialogues then finally an intermission; rinse and repeat. Unlike such Strategic RPGs however, its gameplay is in Real-Time. You can only move your tanks if you have established a connection with them or when ""Connect"" shows up. This means that you'll need to be on high alert AT ALL TIMES, making the game feel intense than other SRPGs. The game does tell you what you can do in the game and what to do, but certain crucial tips such as modules don't happen until slightly later so I highly recommend doing trial and error as you play. Futher, almost every tank dies in one hit; The only tanks that take a few hits are the ""big ones"" that take up more than one square; much like battleship. The object of the game is to either take out the enemy's command tanks, much like the king in chess, or achieve dominace on the battlefield, forcing them to retreat. During Intermission, you may develop stronger tanks, purchase new ones, or enter a free battle on maps you've fought on. Playing through free battles for funding or crates is somewhat a grindfest and the enemy does little to change its tatics. However, I encourage you to play the free battles a lot it allows you to try many combinations of tanks that you should've used, experiment with new tanks, and find the most effective tactics that nets you a strong victory without casualties. It feels very rewarding when farming enough crates to start building tanks that are equipped with ridiculously powerful weapons enough to annihilate half of the playfield or tanks with a beacon that allows satellite cannons to fire and wipe out everything in its sight. Try not to point these to your allies though! The graphics in this game are between decent to quite good, depending on people's tastes. Nevertheless, its charm is undeniable. However, there is a heavy lack of diversity between tank models. Asahi and Tsubasa for example have identical appearance but one hits a single square while the other does a twin rifle salvo hitting 1 square further around. Tanks that have large equipments on their backs are an exception. It would be slightly better if they were given different hair color or accessories.The music in this game are mostly techno, funk, rock, and hip-hop. However, they are very catchy and fit incredibly well in every situation in the game; The custom theme heard while deploying your tanks sums up the overall themes and oddities of the Human Tanks in general. Unique to this game from other SRPGs and even most visual novels is the anime openings and endings between each chapter in the story or episode. Not many may like these videos however due to its seemingly bland vocals and animation. I feel that its presentation is intentional however and the vocals reminds me of the vocals of most anime openings and jpop of the mid 80's to the early 90's which I am quite fond of.War on the Human Tanks is a simple yet addictive game but first impressions on the game and its overall presentation depends on people's niche and taste.  That aside, I dare you to beat the first map in free battle with just Heshiko or only shock tanks! What else? Oh yeah! When playing this game, beware the Cat!			"

												What a bizarre game.  The devs took a disturbing, morbid concept and turned it into something downright silly.  The writing isn't going to win any awards, but it's entertaining enough for a budget title.  Similarly, the strategy part is hardly the deepest game around, but it's deep enough to be fun and even a little addicting (as long as you don't grind enough to become overpowered, which isn't that hard to do).  And I quite like the novel idea of having the story branch not according to deliberate choices made by the player, but according to whether certain key battles are won or lost.  It doesn't exactly have mainstream appeal, but if it piqued your interest and all the chibi hasn't driven you away yet, you probably won't regret buying it.			"

												I can't really recommend this game. I know there are plenty of people of love it, but it's not my cup of tea. Aside from the long cut-scenes, the combat is really minimal and lacks depth. It's basically first-hit, first-killed. This places a huge advantage to the recon class who can reveal enemy troops on the board. Once revealed, you can easily shoot and kill them using your assault tanks or the barrage tanks. Near the end of a match it can turn into a hunt and peck game as you try to locate the one remaining enemy tank. You can level up your tanks using surplus rewarded at the end of a match. Again, you are better off leveling up your recon and then barrage tanks since they have a large advantage.			"

Very Japanese.The music is sometimes quite good, sometimes absolutely dreadful, and sometimes plain weird.The graphics are quite poor, sounds are OK at best.The story is nice, but also kinda weird in its Japanese way.It does what it says on the box pretty well.Human Tank/Tank.Not recommended for people that are afraid of cats.

With multiple endings - even though i haven't got to the end as of yet - the story can really take differents paths depending on victories/defeats. Overall I would recomend this game.			"

TL;DR: A battleship with movable pieces that doesn't take too serious the story at first, but has multiple endings and stuffReviewI don't know why I got this game, it was on sale, I found it weird when I played it for the first time, but I don't regret it at all.War of the Human Tanks is a visual novel with strategic battles similar to Battleship, the battles are fine, but you need to keep in mind that this game is highly story driven, and you'll have to eat around 10 minutes of dialogue until your first battle (which is really short and you won't do much since it's the tutorial), the ""tanks"" are also some kind of tiny anime girls that will scream funny things when attacking or dyeing.The story doesn't take itself too seriously at first, and the tutorial battle is kinda boring in a way, however, once you get to put your own pieces, make the tanks you want in battle and start making your own little army you'll find the battles enjoyable.The story is quite interesting once you get into it, the first chapters might not be very interesting but the story develops as you progress, not you mention you have two different main routes and two different endings on each one making a total of 4 different endings in the game, this is kind of common in visual novels, but I like the way is implemented in this game, unlike in most (if not all) visual novels, you don't have room for choice, no one will ask you questions, instead, the route you'll follow will depend on whether you win or lose certain specific battles, losing a battle is not always a game over, some will give you different endings and so, there is also some detours that will not affect the story and will only act as a bonus battle.The difficulty of the battles is harder as you progress in the game (that's expected), but it's possible to beat the game without having to repeat any missions, however, this also adds some extra challenge but some people really enjoy that. If you do get stucked in some part or just want to have easier final battles you can repeat some battles to gain extra supplies, as I said, this is not needed if you use your supplies properly and do good in your battles.There are several different units, all of them belonging to 6 different classes: Command, Assault, Barrage/Battery, Shock, Scout and Interceptor with some extra surprices here and there. You might find Barrage and Scout units really useful at first and eventually drop them, you always need 1 Command tank in battle, and if it gets destroyed you will lose, Shock tanks are suicidal and if you upgrade them can destroy pretty much everything in the map (including you), you can only use a certain amount of tanks per mission, but you choose which ones you bring so that makes the battle really interesting.On top of that you also have ""modules"" that will add some extra stats or features to your tanks, they are also really expensive but there are a couple that are really cheap and can make your life easier by a lot, once a tank dies, it's gone for good, but you get some supplies from the salvage.Once you finish the game story you unlock some extra stages that are even harder than the final fight, so once you finish the story this is something you can do (and get all endings as well).The game is really interesting, it has some hard to get achievements and some of them may require you to make a new game, of course, you don't need to complete the game 100%, but is something that is not that hard to get once you have the experience in the game.I really don't know why I bought this game, but I really enjoyed it, a good game but keep in mind, highly story driven (unless you totally ignore it, that's possible as well), there are also another 2 sequels here on Steam if you want more Human Tanks fun :P			"

												I will be honest here. I looked at this game and thought to myself ""Hot damn... this is cute as all hell."" and that is all I thought it was going to be. Now with that out of the way let me get down to brass tacks. War of the Human Tanks is a fun strategy game that is easy to pick up, but hard to put down. The game has an easy to learn control scheme and despite its tutorial being pretty bad; the game is very easy to learn. The game has a story much resembling many other strategy games. *Don't worry. There are no spoilers here!!* You are an elite commander that has been thrown into the field as a last ditch effort to save the damned war. The difference is how funny you are! Our great commander is a man who enjoys anime, video games, and can't cook for his life. *Sound like anyone familiar?* The story is broken into episodes and plays out well. There is a serious story but with so many lighthearted moments you will be grinning to yourself.Now the game has a nice art style *Can someone say cute as hell?* It is clean and in battle animations are smooth. A little cut scene when attacking is really the only moving part of this game. The story is told with vectorized picture backgrounds and facial expression changing characters on screen. There is also dialogue... A LOT OF DIALOUGE. Though it is done well and if you really don't care about the story *shame on you* there is an ability to skip to the next battle.Upgrades are administered in between battles and honestly do affect unit performance... I was honestly surprised. You can also fight past battles in the 'Free Battle' option. This allows to you to scrape up some credits before moving onto the next episode.The soundtrack fits in very well and is honestly catchy. I normally play my own music while playing games but this is a major exception. I honestly wouldn't mind buying a few for my collection of game soundtracks.TL;DR: War of the Human Tanks is a fun, easy to play, addicting, game that is entirely worth it's *cheap* price. You don't even have to be a big strategy fan to enjoy this game. The only reason I can see someone not liking this game is if they hate anything cute, fun, or strategy games. So if you like anime, and games or are just looking for a fun game to sink your teeth into for a low price this is the game.Overall score: 9.9/10-Could use some more moving animation.Edit: There are two more coming out. R.I.P My wallet.			"

												Let me tell you about War of the Human Tanks. It is a war involving human tanks.In short, I was intrigued by the demo of the game, tried the demo, treated the game as a joke at first until I realized I was nearly 2 hours into it and enjoying every bit of it.The protagonist is a weeb who just so happens to also be a prodigy first lieutenant. The story likes to switch between serious mode and whimsical simple comedy mode at the drop of a hat. Having said that, the plot development is definitely there alongside the silly nonsensical and relatively cliche slice-of-life antics of the characters, so there is an advancing story going on. On a side note, the game kinda resembles an anime in that an opening movie (that slightly changes as the story progresses) plays when you start a chapter, and the credits scroll when the chapter ends. It is very worth noting that these are 100% skippable if you don't want to watch them every time.Gameplay is like Fire Emblem in that 70% of the game is dialogue and the other 30% is permadeath grid-based combat. Fortunately, (most) units are expendable and can be replaced. Combat takes place on a top-down fog-of-war grid with your units placed in a certain section on the board. You have to wait real-time to give each unit an order, in which you can move the unit a few spaces and perform an action. As such, I'd classify it as a turn-based-RTS hybrid. The fog-of-war is for vision only; you can attack spaces you can't see if you want. If you do and there's an enemy tank there, then congratulations on your free kill.In conclusion, War of the Human Tanks is a rather unique game that I can understand why it's a hit-or-miss for many. I've read through several negative reviews of this game (I usually read those first), and all their claims are accurate; some people may not like the combat system, or the fact that most of the game is spent reading dialogue. I personally enjoyed these aspects (which are also reflected in the demo) which is why I recommend this game.			"

												If you like anime, grid-based tactics remniscent of Battleship, and a fun mixture of humor + cuteness, you will really enjoy this game.There is quite a bit of text to provide the story in between battles, but I - admittedly - have skipped through it because I always want to get right into the next battle. The voice acting is in Japanese and the music and aesthetics provide a nice anime-feel with the cute, cartoonish character models and backgrounds.The learning curve is fairly marginal for this game, as the tutorial helps you understand the fundamentals of the game very quickly. It is important to remember that every unit dies with one hit from any other unit (think Battleship, and all your ships cover only one grid point).During the preloadout screen, you can deploy your troops in the allotted grid space. To field troops, you have to pay credits (at a very reasonable price compared to your post-battle loot, which means grinding is very balanced) to train them. In order to unlock the next tier of troops, you must research them, and they will be available to train after the next battle. There are also modules, which are either persistent or one-use equipments, and you can also research new modules and build them in the pre-battle setup. Some examples are permanent modules that allow your equipped character to move +1 extra grid space or have +1 improved range for their attack, and and example of a one-use module is a long-range scanner that reveals a large chunk of the grid map (also with a vast range).The troops you can deploy include a commander/general unit (killing these units end the game in victory or defeat, so fielding more may be beneficial) that also provides a ""connection"" mechanic to every human tank. A general's connection speed determines how fast or slow it will take for your units to be ""connected,"" which makes them active and allows you to issue commands to them. There is a shock trooper unit that self-destructs to do damage to all grid points directly above, below, and to the right/left. A recon unit can scan an area, revealing any enemy troops on those particular grid points. You reveal grid points on the map by scanning with the recon (other units can recon, but at significantly less efficiency [ex: artillery can only reveal 1 grid point, at a very short distance]). Your units also reveal a small radius around them, so moving them will provide holes in the fog of war.There are general soldiers that will be the stormtroopers of your army, advancing rapidly and attacking at a short-medium distance. Artillery provide long range support and are very useful when synchronized with careful recon scouting.As you research and unlock higher tiers of each unit, you will notice numerous things improving like total movement points, attack range, and ability range.You have the option of replaying free battles or continuing with the main story. Grinding is very quick and easy in this game.The game has a lot of charm and humor, and it does a great job and making you feel like you are in an anime. In between battles, there is even a short intro/theme song sequence that is pretty funny. There are also those ad-style pictures that come before and after commercials in an actual anime. The voice acting is very anime-style, and characters will express themselves when they attack or die.If you are a fan of grid-based strategy and/or like anime, then you should definitely give this game a try.Recommend!

												Summary:War of the Human Tanks is a unique turn-based strategy with a very malleable turn-order, a grid-based combat system, and has a surprisingly deep story that is both humerous and light-hearted, but able to take a more serious tone where needed.  I whole-heartedly recommend buying this game, even if you dislike the art style.The Pros:- Lots of tanks and modules to toy with, making for lots of customizability.  You can tailor your troop to your specific play style- Replayability.  Two different routes and four endings.- Story.  Very light-hearted but also very serious at times.  Fleshed out characters and antagonists.- The story missions are very nicely scaled in difficulty.- A modifiable transmission stat that lets the player know how soon a tank's turn is, resulting in a very malleable turn-order.- Simple, easy-to-learn grid-based battle system.- Multiple tank types that each do specific things and have specific jobs, giving the feeling of a chess board when it comes to strategy.- Battleship-esque combat.  One-hit destructions.  Larger tanks require more shots due to taking up more space on the board.- Every stat and module, (for both your tanks and enemy tanks), is viewable on the battlefield, allowing for on-the-fly changes to strategy.- Many bonus battles and the ability to reply previous missions at virtually anytime.- Decent AIThe Cons:- Art style. ""Chibi"" characters that may not be your thing.- Decent AI.  The AI has trouble guessing where the player is and using Line of Sight.- Evasion.  Some modules allow a tank to dodge attacks.  This is chance-based and there is no counter.- Grind.  If you want to get all four endings, you have to play the game four times and lose specific battles.  If you want to beat all the free battles, you will also need to grind a bit in order to be competitive with the heightened difficulty.- Supply system.  It is never really explained how much enemy tanks are worth to kill and certain battles seem to give disappointing rewards while others give oddly high rewards.			"

												A grid-based tactical game with major fog of war mechanics. Comparisons to battleship are apt. One hit is one kill in general, so things can get tense and turn around real fast. Downside is that the unit management mechanics encourage grinding to the extreme. In a game like this, an extra point of range or movement is invaluable.			"

												I thought I would like it, since I'm a huge Advance Wars/round-based strategy nut. The upgrading, deploying bit is fun, the actual game not so much. Basically you wait until your units are ready (which isn't indicated anywhere, you just have to figure it out), then move, attack or recon (the whole map is fog of war-ed, only the hexes you are standing next to or did a recon on are visible).The whole system doesn't appeal to me, sadly. And even if I don't care too much what a game looks like (as long as it plays well), the blurred photos during the story bits are just lazy and plain ugly. And there is WAY too much unnecessary talking going on. I know it can be skipped, but I usually don't like to do that. In this case though...			"

												Okay, there is already tons of reviews out there for this game. Most good, others...not so good and unhelpful.When I first played this game, I was pretty much confused at first as I assumed (incorrectly) that it was turn based or something. That thought went away the moment I lost my first unit when I was trying to figure out what I was supposed to do from a shock-unit blowing her up.Logic set in and I find that this game is not too hard to play. Use scouts to reveal areas, run in with assaults or blow areas up randomly with barrage. Easy peasy. Just make sure to play sort of fast as there's time limits and playing defensively is just asking for trouble.The story is simple and kind of funny. That's all I'm willing to say.For a person who's tight with their cash, best wait for a discount to happen. If not, then consider trying this out for a spin anyways.			"

												Well apparently human tanks have no human rights10/10 for the kamikaze unitsThis game is basicaly a mix of battleship and chess. Like chess this game has its own king a.k.a. the command unit but unlike chess you can turn them into killing machines (with the right equipment) and send ""them"" (you can have more than 1) on the front lines. Like battleship the enemy's location is unknown so you're free to blind fire or you could just replay the level and shoot where you know they will spawn as their spawning location doesnt really change (rather game breaking). I was wondering where the VN part of this was since taking detours doesnt affect you're ending until I found out that you actualy have to lose some battles to get different endings.Well overall the game was pretty fun and I must say I find it hilarious when the kamikaze units say they dont wanna die as soon as i have them explode.

												This game is amazing, absolutely amazing. it's worth more than what it's being sold for (not complaining)Pros:- Good Soundtrack- Great mechanics-  Replayability is amazing, after you get one ending (theres 4 in all) you can continue from your old save at the end of the game and start it over again, keeping EVERYTHING you had (All developments, units, crates, etc.) - Funny story- Nice charactersCons:- It's a bit confusing at first and could have the tutorial explain a bit more (it doesn't take long to figure everything out though)- Cannot play in windowed fullscreen (not that big of a problem but I like playing fullscreen games while being able to click out of them since i have to monitors, I don't want the entire window to minimize just cause i want to respond to a friends message)- Gandhi (it's a running joke in my reviews okay?)In all it's an amazing game that is quite touching, it has ""detours"" that you can take if you wanna challenge yourself to an extra mission for laughs (That is if you haven't beaten the game yet...BEWARE OF MR. CAT HE IS NOT A VERY NICE KITTY)If you are thinking about getting this game, get it, if you enjoy strategy games (and anime) then you HAVE to get this.Cola/10 would get slapped by my little sister and my staff officer again.

												I wanted to like this game pretty badly, as the reviews and description for it had me kinda hyped. Unfortunately, I just couldn't get into it enough that I would recommend it to anyone. The main issue is that you spend more time clicking though dialogue than fighting, and where that may work for Mass Effect and similar games, this one has nowhere near a strong enough storyline to support that. I felt like I was trapped in a bad anime- everything was over-cliched (seemingly on purpose- I hope), and there was no interaction or input from the player at all. This is coming from someone who likes both anime and anime-based games, as well. I feel like some sort of dialogue options, main character customization, or ability to make decisions regarding the story might have done a lot to make me feel at least slightly invested, but as it was I felt like a passenger just along for the ride, and lost interest quickly.I also feel the story is too silly and over the top to try to throw in existential questions about the humanity of your human tanks, or to make you try to feel bad for seeing them die in combat- it just ended up feeling so out of place, like they were trying to tell two different stories at the same time. Which is overall sad, because I think those things if better executed or embedded in a less silly story would have been great hooks for a player's interest.The combat is okay, but it's not deep or complex enough to save you from the story. Directing your units in combat felt clunky in some way I can't quite put my finger on, but probably would have become familiar enough over time to not be a concern, had I been engaged enough to continue playing.In short, I don't remember how much I paid for this game, but unless it was under 2$, I feel it was too much.

												A great game for strategists. You are a commander of an army in the totally not Japan country called Japon, where they use Amasson to carry parts around.The gameplay is simply complicated. In that I mean that it's simple that you can either send your units to attack a spot, move them, get them to reveal some map space, or do nothing. However, as simple as that looks there are a lot of factors. Different tanks excel in different areas.The main types are ""Commander"", of which you need a minimum one, and if you lose all of you lose.""Shock"", which can be divided, but generally hit an area around them, but also blowing themselves up in the process. ""Recon"", which can reveal large areas of map, move far but are generally bad at combat.""Assault"" which usually are destructive, but otherwise all around.And ""Artillery"" which have insane range, at the cost of low mobility and speed.Now, at the start of a round you can use any mix of tanks you've made, all of which are made to be human-like, but usually without questioning orders. As you do missions, you get resources to make more. However, if a tank dies, it's permanently dead, excluding your default tank Hishiko, as well as a few select specialty tanks (Which is an important part of the plot. Unless you're Mr. Cat. Then it's just the embodiment of evil). So managing your tanks in a way to prevent them from going down as much as possible pays off. (Ie. Better strategy always pays off more than trying to brute force things with kamikazes.)The game itself isn't too hard, as long as you take the time to plan things out. In fact, it seems most people beat the story without a loss 99% of the time on their first playthrough. However, there are more stories to be told based on how you do missions (If you fail certain ones, specifically), so it's worth a second playthrough to find these. The characters are also very interesting, as they make you question your character's motives. Is he a good guy? Or is he right in his name of ""General From Hell""?A lack of multiplayer is a let down, especially in a game like this. Granted, it could obviously tip the scales towards a player who has more time in the game, but all the same they could have had a type of draft you could do, or had ___ resources to use to make your army.In summary, it's a great strategy game with a great story. A lack of multiplayer is a let down, but it's easily overlooked.			"

												If you're old enough to remember the days of Advance Wars on the GBA then this game is worth your time. While not exactly turn based it's also not as hectic as RTS can be. Each unit is on a transmission speed, the higher the transmission speed, the faster you can make each move with it,Now I love humor just as much as the next guy and this game has that quirky humor in every cutscene and theres no voice overs so you don't have to worry about bad voice acting. The only sounds you will hear is in the tranisitions and when you use units to fire or when they're destroyed.I got the hang of this game fully but the 4th level simply because it doesn't overwelm you with infomation. In the first tutorial level it tells you the basics and thats it, after that it explains each unit including new ones that you use and the ones you face. Just be careful not to shoot your own units. (Although it's hilarious when the Enemy AI does it)Each unit is unique and well balanced. You've got Assault, Shock (Self destructing or Melee), Artillery, Scouts and Interceptors. My personal favourite is the interceptor when it's fully researched and with +3's on both range and area coverage, never worry about artillery with one of those babies. It's really rewarding to research and if you're in need of some extra supplies, simply grind out some free battles and you're set.Another feature is the line of sights, very similar to the Fog of War from Advance Wars. If you scout an area, that area will be seen until your scout that you used can be used again so you can watch for incoming enemy tanks. Giving your scout that extra range and area coverage though modules can really help. Hell, if you have good enough units you'll never need to hit the max capacity for tanks on any given level.My only downside that I've found is the campain. It's only 13 missions long (Excluding the few side ones and the free battles) but still tells a moving story within that time. It doesn't feel too rushed considering you're gonna be doing some grinding before some of them. You get the chance to go back and redo the campain which is not that bad when your units carry on as does your research. So it gives you plenty of time to obtain everything, plus it becomes easier with each pass of the campain rather then the opposite. (Be warned, the 13th mission is nightmare fuel, it gave me a jump when I first saw this thing)Final score leaves me with a 9.5/10Also, ♥♥♥♥ Mr. Cat. Just ♥♥♥♥ that thing. You're gonna need some serious grinding if you want to 100% that♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												this is... actually pretty great, it's like much simpler x-com with a bit of chess with a bit of cute girls doing cute war things and dying horribly for the glory of their empire.the only problem is that the campaign is really short (even counting the 4 endings) and once you've completed it there's no challenge mode unlock (the ♥♥♥♥ing cat doesnt count) so there's nothing that keeps you playing which makes the game really short (about 10h to complete)then again, quantity doesn't necessarily mean quality, and i certainly dont regret spending those 10 hours sending cute tank girls to their fiery deaths.

												 War of the Human Tanks is an excellent rts game, with a great story line that kept me playing just so that I could uncover more of the history of the human tanks and the parts played by  Shoutaro Daihon'ei and his forces.  I would easily recomend this as well as the sequel War of the Human Tanks: Altier as a great game.			"

												Strange, but in a good way. I'm not sure if War of the Human Tanks is supposed to be some sort of allegory, but you can enjoy it regardless of the metaphors. The player manages an army of ""human tanks,"" which carry rifles or artillery and so forth, and the objective is to defeat the enemy by destroying all of its command tanks in an active time battle (ATB) format.The concept of human tanks forms the basis of the story, which has the touching parts characteristic of anime-related games. Much of the character development happens in the multiple storyline endings, but I wanted to learn so much more about the characters' pasts! (I haven't checked out the rest of the trilogy yet; I hope there are more answers there.) The dialogue makes up most of the game, but I wouldn't mind at all if it were twice as long, for more character development and to let the emotional parts sink in.Overall, I'm happy I took the risk of trying this really peculiar title, and will definitely play the rest of the trilogy.

												For those who like some weird, interesting, and somewhat unique games, this game is for you.  War of the Human Tanks is a Visual Novel and Strategy game that is kinda fast-paced with some weird and dark humour in it.  It is not exactly the most polished game judging by the screenshots, though.  I will get into details at a later date.Update: It has certainly came a long way with sequels and stuff.			"

												Progress: Storyline complete. Significant endgame content unfinished. Time: ~ 16hrsI'm recommending this mainly for the story. While the initial antagonist is somewhat lucklaster, the main character and other supporting characters I found very relatable and engaging. The concept of human tanks and the story behind them while unfurls as the game progresses.The gameplay was interesting enough and the ratio of fights vs. cutscenes was more than enough to keep me wanting to reach the next chapter and find out more.Just to clarify, the story here is not deep and rich - this is no game of Thrones. It's a relatively simple game with a relatively simple premise. But if it is something that you connect with, you may find like me that this was a very satisfying experience. Even an emotional one, as much as I feel embarrassed saying it.As for the rest of the game:Cons:- repeated cutscenes between chapters are somewhat annoying- Strategy lacks some versatality. Predictable tactics by the AI result in somewhat dissapointing replay value.Pros:- Interesting if limited soundtrack- Cute character designs gave me a desire to cherish my units. Contrasting with the fact that right from the start one of your units is a living bomb creates a tension that I found very enjoyable throughout the game.All in all, if a story about human tanks, and a game involving simple turn-based, grid-based chibi tank combat appeals to you, buy this game. If it doesn't, try something else ^^. Here's to hoping that someone else has a great experience like me though!			"

												I bought this on a whim after hovering over the ""Buy"" button two or three times previously. I wasn't expecting much, but War of the Human Tanks absolutely hurdled the low bar I set. Then it started doing backflips over the bar, while thumbing its nose at me for not believing. Then a Samurai Tank beat me to death with the bar.The strategy is deep enough to be enjoyable while being light enough that it never feels overwhelming. It resembles Advance Wars in terms of strategic depth, although not in actual gameplay--it resembles the ATB systems in certain RPGs, where a bar fills in real time for each unit, with the unit able to take its turn when the bar reaches maximum. Killing enemy tanks and winning victories gets you supplies, which you use to build Human Tanks to send into the meat grinder. Using your tanks and spending supplies lets you develop new tanks, as well as equipping your better tanks with stat-boosting modules. The story is pretty engaging, although it took a while for me to warm up to it. The writing seemed a bit stiff at first, even a bit hackneyed, but it came into its own later--its clear the writer was playing with certain anime cliches, though whether it can be called a parody is up for debate. Its not Shakespeare, but it is amusing in places and unsettlingly dark in others. I'm really psyched for the sequel.If you are considering buying the game, definitely grab the version that comes with the soundtrack. Even after everything I just wrote, the soundtrack is probably the best part of the game. How'd they make the beat so damn funky?!			"

												A cute little gameplay VN. Story is nothing too special but not entirely bad either. But the real reason to play is the RTS section. It plays sorta like battleship and chess combined but is more fun than it sounds. If you think you'll have a fun time strategizing how to destroy the enemy's little girls before they destroy your own little girls then this is definitely a worthwhile pickup.			"

												I initially only tried the demo of this because Fruitbat Factory also localized one of my favorite steam games, 100% Orange Juice. After an hour or so, I just had to buy the full version. The story and characters are very likable, which is a good thing because there's a lot of dialogue to read. The battles aren't highly technical so far but you have to do a lot of thinking on your feet as your units only act when you command them to, and the battles don't stop for commands either. (similar to the ATB system from old final fantasy games) There's a similarity to battleship in that neither you or your opponent can see each other's units. Attacking gives away your position, of course, so you have to scout and plan very carefully. Winning battles gives you crates based on how well you did, which are then used to either create new units or upgrade existing ones. Give the demo a shot. The story was definitely what won me over at first, but the battle system is very fun as well. It isn't a very graphically advanced game, but it's fun to play. Can't wait to try the sequel.			"

												I’ve finished one of the multiple endings in War of the Human Tanks.  This game was far more enjoyable then I was expecting it to be.  The music is pretty enjoyable with tons of variation. The story was interesting with a good cast of characters driving it.  I still need to finish the other endings but would recommend this game to anyone wanting something tactical that you can complete all the story sections in what I’d estimate what would be about 30 hours.  The game has some extra elements that would probably largely extend your playtime if you get into it.  The game play is somewhat like battleship.  Attacks will always hit (one exception) and when your tank has been hit it dies.  Larger tanks however require hitting all of their segments before they die.  You move your tanks and the enemy moves their tanks every few seconds.  The faster you utilize your tanks the sooner you can have them perform an action again (kind of like Chrono Trigger’s active system) there’s no turn order which gives a little bit of urgency to the game.The game has a demo up on steam go try it out and if you like the combat I would recommend picking up the full game.

													Although I am not interested in strategy games that much, I find this game to be very enjoyable. When I bought this game, I bought it for the art style and the whole “human tank” concept. Then when I played the game, I found it really engaging. The gameplay is very unique for a strategy game and the story has more depth than I expected for a game revolving around “human tanks.” When I first started playing this game, its pacing was okay. It was a little slow, but still in enjoyable. When I reached the latter stages and upgraded all of my tanks completely, the game was so fast paced it was insane. I was able to kill entire armies before they even got a chance to move! I personally really like the music for this game. Although, I can see people really despising some of the songs. So I recommend for anyone just getting into this series to just buy this game solo. Then, if you like this game and its soundtrack, buy the second game with the soundtrack bundle. Both soundtrack bundles share the same soundtrack anyway.			"

												I am the General from Hell, Shanon'ei or something. Even though I am pretty uninteresting except for being very good at anime, games and being lazy, my ability to be serious for a few minutes and not act careless to my soldiers has made me the perfect anime protagonist for every girl I come across to either want me or to pretend not to want me.My side kicks are Chiko, the cooky amazing genius who can assemble anything once someone bothers to ask her, Satou, the stereotypical mother who fusses over the protagonist while also wanting to chow down on his joystick and Heshiko, the comedic foil to everyone elses comedic antics.The game becomes a game of hide and seek where the first people to find the other gets the kill. It's turned based, but also works in real time, so you wander out and hang about for a few minutes while people walk up to you and shoot you in the face. If you're lucky, the person next to you may decide to shoot them first, or they may just watch you die in an explosion with joy.Basically, stick your Command Tank in the back of the field, and then begin a thorough carpet bombing of the area with your insanely overpowered tanks. If you're not quite over-powered enough, you can grind, but honestly, the game throws resources at you that you'll not fall behind the power curve. Occasionally, the game will mix it up, but eventually you'll discover that nothing is as good as area of effect attacks, since they have all the benefits of a single shot but all the benefits of levelling a quarter of the stage in a single shot, killing everything that you may or may not have known is there.You have suicide units... in a game which limits how many tanks you can take. A one-use unit, or a tank which can flatten a street is your choice. I think I may have the suicide unit twice in the game. As they ran up the enemy, they were shot. Huh.It's a pretty fun game, you can run it in a window and listen to a podcast (I like to think this was the equivalent of me in the game basically saying ""Time to win this war... Satou, have the entire army bomb the crap out of the enemy. I'll be here fiddling with my iPod and listening to Queen. Let me know if something happens). This is not a bad side; it's engaging enough and quick enough that you can fit it in between sessions or a lunch break or during a Skype conversation where the Internet keeps breaking.As for the story, well, there is a Royal Army and an Imperial Army in a land of Japon, not Japan, Japon. The two armies are effectively indistinguishable, you fight them because... well, they're on the other side of the battlefield and that's the point of the game. There seems to be some kind of underlying conversation about whether or not a Human Tank is actually worth treating well, but it's hard to tell a deep conversation while you're also have a little power fantasy and then your Command Tank walks in and it's funny because she is stupid or something.Oh, the whole Human Tanks thing? Basically, tanks don't work anymore, so they decided to make anime girls fight each other with weapons and call them tanks, a slight lobotomy to reduce initiative and then a tendency to explode if someone looks at them; later you can get tanks that require to be hit in four places to die, and as long as you bomb the enemy first, most of them should make it through.It's a nice little game, and I had fun, and that's enough. I'd say £5 or whatever heathen money you use is definitely worth getting it. It has a New Game Plus and alternative endings, but the gameplay isn't THAT good and neither is the story. But it is solid and the anime is nice, and it doesn't have any bloody panty-shots, so it's the good kind of anime, not the kind that governments seem to be trying to outlaw recently.			"

												I actually had this game long ago on an old computer that died. I was pleasently suprised to find it here on Steam, and that it had sequels as well.This is probably one of my favorite games out there. Beneath the cutesy, simplistic exterior lies a tough RTS with a suprisingly in-depth story, mutliple humorous moments, and a deep sense of respect for the adorable, loveable, suicidal human tanks. Much like playing Fire Emblem, I've had to reset a stage more than once just to not lose a tank I enjoy using, and the traffic insurance module is one of the first modules I researched. And even in the very beginning, the game can be challenging to complete. Many maps have random enemy placement, making it all the harder to best if you're not careful, and a shock tank appears to blow your strategy to hell.It may not have state-of-the-art graphics, or awesome animations, but I do still love this game.

												This is a nice and pretty laid-back strategy game with a (to me, atleast) fun storyline.The units are easy to understand and master, making it quick to pick up.Resource gathering is also pretty simple: depending on how many enemy units you destroyed, you get resources (called supplies) awarded at the of of a mission (even one you lost!).The game starts off simple, with missions that can be won with little or no casualties. But after the third mission it starts to increase in difficulty (albeit slowly) so be sure to research new units and equip power-ups to your tanks.There are three main methods of attack: fast close-quarters ""kamikaze"" units, medium speed short-range assault, and slow but long-ranged artillery (Personally, I feel that attacking with the kamikaze tanks is basically trolling the enemy, so I only do that for sh*ts and giggles).Scouts and anti-artillery units add depth to the gameplay due to their early warning and defensive capabilities, respectively.

												An amusing mix of real-time strategy and japanese visual novel. The story part is presented as an episodic anime with lots of light-hearted humor, but also deep topics such as humanity, loyalty, sacrifice and betrayal. It has two very different plot branches and four endings, inviting you to do additional New Game+ runs. And then there's small things, like varying company logo animation / voice acting, the intro video getting more revealling as you progress through the game, and 8+ unique chapter outro videos.The strategy part has combat, resource management, a long research tree, various unit types and lots of equippable upgrades. It is really well done. There's also a lot of bonus levels of varying difficulty that you can play during intermission between chapters. Things can get repetitive when farming resources for R&D to get 100% completion, but there is a good guide on how to deal with that. (Don't attempt to do the $99,999,999 bonus upgrades without a memory editor cheat, you'll go insane =D)Finally, there's a ridiculous amount of music in this game. Almost every map has its own fast-paced soundtrack, each consisting of 3 tracks depending on your state on the battlefield (cornered, balanced, dominant). And the story sequences also received their share of tracks, so enjoy.			"

I really enjoyed the different endings : the story was, at the end, supprisingly good with some twists to what I expected. It starts really slow though.Play the demo before, but know that the battles becomes really more interresting after that, with more options and financial limitations. The two last batlle from the demo (if I'm not mistaken) begin to be interresting and give you a good feeling of the game. If you resist the tentation of easy cash with free battles the quite is quite hard at the end. After the end you unlock great new maps, which are really difficult and you can play quite a lot of time trying to inprove your army to beat them. It's nice to play for alml the endings but you have to do again really dull battles, and wining your fourth ending will be really easy with all your cash and development. I like the silly character design but yeah, backgrounds are ugly.  "

												The first time I saw War of the Human Tanks, I was put off by how obviously low-budget it is; that was a huge mistake. Apparently, the art style just needed some getting used to, because once I got into it, I thought the graphics were actually pretty good. There's full voice acting, fun animations and even some really catchy music that makes me itch to buy the soundtrack.But what about the meat of the game? That, for me, comes in two packages (or perhaps Amasson boxes): the story and the gameplay. Let's get this out of the way: The story is awesome. I loved it. This is definitely not a ""skip-the-dialogue"" kind of game; in fact, after a certain point, the story became the main appeal. It's simultaneously lighthearted and grim, with a really interesting setting that ends up being much more detailed than you might suspect at first. There are four endings (two main paths, with two endings each) that all end up being pretty radically different and are all fantastic in their own way. I'm really in love with the setting, and all the little things you can learn about the rather disenfranchised battle-androids they call Human Tanks; the story really exceeded my expectations in every way. The translation is great, and the writing is clever, funny and serious when it needs to be; some of the big twists were huge gut-punchers. I'd definitely say the story was maybe the best part for me, and it'll stick with me and inspire me for other personal projects for quite a while.Finally, the gameplay itself: it's great. My first playthrough was fantastic. The active-time battles with a heavy focus on recon and fog of war really keep things interesting, and even after you've played a battle a bunch of times you might still find yourself having trouble. There are plenty of different unit types that can switch up the way you play (though I tended to shy away from the poor Shock tanks because they just break my heart when they yell ""I DON'T WANT TO DIE!"" before exploding) and the long and rewarding research lines kept me grinding away at the free battles for a long time. Even the grinding was fun, though! I found myself enjoying the battles no matter how many times I played them, even when I got them down to a science. The AI is fairly challenging, and even with heavily-upgraded units, the later battles can really surprise you with how they masterfully crank up the difficulty. Naturally, the New Game Plus makes you feel a bit overpowered, and once you get to the highest levels of tech, your units are laughably broken, but that's kind of part of the appeal, and at a certain point I was just using the beefed-up units to fly through battles and get to all the endings anyway, since the story was really compelling. There are incredibly, incredibly challenging extra free battles, and you can play any of the myriad different story missions any time you like. I think my only complaint with the battle system was the 'evade' mechanic; it's basically just a random chance that, for no real reason, your attack just didn't work. It was pretty frustrating having sound strategy and fully-upgraded units but still missing because of a roll of the dice, and the evade mechanic never seemed to do me any favors either, but maybe I was just unlucky with the RNG. Either way, seeing as I put 35 hours into the game over just a couple of days, it clearly didn't dampen my enthusiasm that much.After all that, my opinion is pretty clear; as of now, this is the only game I've bothered writing a review for, and it's because I loved the gosh-darn heck out of it. The story is fantastic, the gameplay is both super unique and endlessly engaging, and even if it looks a little low-budget at first, the entire game is surprisingly polished and clearly has a lot of heart behind it. I'd heartily recommend this to anyone who's a fan of military strategy, Fire Emblem-type games with a compelling narrative. Please, give it a spin-- and for god's sake, be nice to Heshiko!			"

												War of The Human Tanks is a very genuine strategy game as of now.  It does have a hybrid feeling of Chess and Battleship which adds a sort of nostalgic feeling to it,  I recommend this game to people who would like a good strategy game and would enjoy themselves with the humerous scenarios that take place both in and out of combat.  In some aspects it may or may not be for everyone as some people who would hae a different taste in games.  The long scenarios/cutscenes before battle may make a person skip or stay and get a few laughs out of it.The idea of being able to assemble, outfit, and place units prior to the battle's start is quite a unique feature.  With a nice view of the map, players can plcae certain units that specialize in certain areas of the map.  Also each unit has its own particular role in combat if used properly, a player can easily dominate the enemy with little time and units.  The battle music can add a nostaligc feeling when commanding your units. Although certain levels, the music varies in terms of being ""Cornered, Balanced, and Dominant.""There are a few concerns though for this game such as, having an update that would allow the steam client to function properly in the game i.e the steam overlay.  Future updates or DLC that could include new units, maps, additional story, and even maybe multiplayer.  Overall I think this game is very amazing and once more I recommend this ""Moe military mayhem"" game.			"

												War of the Human Tanks is basically what happens when you merge battleship with speed chess. You take command of various types of Human Tanks in a bit to wipe out the enemies Command Tank while keeping yours from blowing up. Its a very unique game that I think everyone should try at least once. The story is good, albeit slightly unoriginal, and there are branching paths in the story depending on which battles you win or lose (not all battles can be lost, mind you, but certain ones can be. I'll let you search the internet to figure out which ones they are.) The visuals are anime inspired and each type of human tank clearly shows their personality by appearance alone. Especially the Bomb Tanks who know exactly how their lives will end. Again, I think this a game that everyone should at least once and there is a demo if your hesitant to take my word for it. Give it a shot!			"

												War of the Human Tanks plays like a cross between Stratego and Battleship.  The battle gameplay is pretty engaging, combining tactics, positioning, and planning with occasional bursts of rapid interaction.  The characters are entertaining and the story plays out like a season of a TV show.  The game can be played with a few spare minutes or over the course of several hours, making it very accessible.While four potential endings to the game give it some replay value, I do not feel an immediate need to go back through everything again to collect the other endings.  I will however be purchasing the soundtrack if I can catch it on sale.			"

												This is a great game, for a discounted price.Keep in mind, this is no 100% Orange Juice and although the humor is there some of the time.. it's kind of a gamble when that's going to be and when it is there.. it seems like they drag it out a bit too much. The storyline took way too long to get into the actual gameplay.The gameplay itself is.. ok. It's like minesweeper.. sort of,..with tanks? If that makes sense? You build tanks, you deploy tanks, you kamikaze tanks.. you distract tanks, you guess at enemy positions, you recon spots and find enemies, etc. You can build essentially buff items too.That's pretty much the game. Pretty simple, not too bad for maybe $2 to $3. $10 is far too much as the game is far too simplistic. If you want a game from this company I would recommend 100% Orange Juice more. It's much more fun and has tons of replayability.. this does not. This is one game unless it's on extreme sale for their sequal.. I will not be getting.			"

												This game is fantasic apart from the EXTREMELY LONG chats. (Good for story-line + background info though)This game has female chibis as human tanks which is ADORABLE. (Although it will hurt when they get killed </3)Although it's a bit hard to understand at first, it's extremely easy to learn what everything does. You however may have to grind a little bit to get improved units.I highly reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys a little bit of soft-RTS and people who enjoys anime.However- be warned that this game does NOT have multiplayer and is purely single-player.

												I found out about this game from a friend while looking through random stuff, and I noticed it looked a lot like the random flash games they add to some VN collections like Muv Luv and that it looked ridiculous so I went out on a limb to try it. I pretty much liked it from the very beginning.It's not exactly an 'impressive' game, but more importantly than that it's a fun game which totally trumps that anyway. The characters aren't exactly novel quality, but they're quirky, amusing, and likable which makes them interesting in their own right and the game itself is simple and easy to understand but requires you to play well if you actually want to win. It doesn't have a ridiculous list of mechanics and gameplay bells and whistles, but the simplicity of the system doesn't make the game boring. Honestly I much prefer games that focus on simple gameplay and making that gameplay immersive over games that require tons of mechanics just to make up for the fact that the game itself is generic and boring throughout.In short, it's not a ""AAA title"" but it's an actually enjoyable game that's worth it's price tag if you like quirkiness and simple gaming.

												I thought I'd like this game, but then I spent the first ten minutes clicking through the most inane and fairly insulting conversational cutscenes. Then I got to fight in a battle that I won in a couple clicks, and then I was treated to another ten minutes of conversation that I couldn't bear to actually read. I eventually gave up. Maybe it would get better at some point, I didn't have the endurance for a Shojo style wargame. For the love of god, just let me skip your awful story and play the game. As far as I could tell the story revolved around 'human tanks' which are some sort of robot with no rights who like to drink soda and watch anime. They seem frustrated with the general stupidity of their species.  I was too.			"

												This game is exactly what it says on the tin. It's got strategy elements reminiscent of Battleship and chess, though, unlike both of those, it is not turn-based (it has ""action bars"" that you can't see until they're full up). You can adjust the speed of battle, though, and on the slowest setting you should have a decent amount of time to figure out what you want to do. Doing each mission for the first time is pretty exciting as you find out where everything is, but on subsequent playthroughs of the same mission you'll find that the enemy force uses the same machines and start in the same locations each time, and may only make different choices in movement from behind those ""Unknown"" spaces. This means that when you grind those missions later on for additional crates -- and you will, because you'll probably want to see just how powerful a tank your little sister can build -- you'll be able to breeze through just based on prior knowledge, and it may start to feel like a chore. Fortunately, if you just want to beat the game, grinding is only slightly necessary, depending on how many of your tanks die from enemies you didn't see until they popped up right in front of you.Of note, the game seems to be structured like an anime, of which the protagonist Shoutaro Daihon'ei is a fan. Each mission plays out like its own episode, complete with an OP, a title card, a story segment, another story segment afterwards and one of several different EDs. You may find the OP and ED sequences annoying, but they're easy enough to skip over.Also of note, the music they chose for the game isn't terribly fitting at times. I repeatedly found myself wondering what kind of mood they were going for in certain scenes. This is also easy enough to disable, if it bothers you as well. Ultimately, if you like quirky doujin games and simplistic strategy games, then this one'll do you pretty well.			"

												  Played the game for a bit and I think this game is pretty decent game. It's a bit overpriced, in my opinion. On the Steam store it's $10 but if your able to pick it up for a $1 either from other sites or on a Steam sale it's worth a play or two.  It's a bit long winded with it's dialogue and really didn't care for the cut scenes. I couldn't get in to that but maybe some people will enjoy it, as for my experience it was a bit odd to say the least. The art and battle animations are a bit different when you think of strategy games but I guess that it's suppose to have an Anime appeal. The actual gameplay though is some what satisfying. It's a very simplified grid based game but instead of turn based, each unit has a timer for when they'll be able to make a move. Which is a bit different from most grid based games.    Other then that, it's pretty straight foward pick between recon, assault, shock, battery  and command tanks to make up your army of human tanks. There's a fog of war which keeps thing interesting. There is no terrain modifiers, which was surprising for a grid based strategy game. The thing that I thought was most interesting was that you can upgrade your tanks with ""modifiers"" which give them certain augments in battle and also the fact that when your units are killed they don't come back. You have to replace them with parts which can only be gained in battles won, so you'd want to keep your human tanks alive. At least in the main campaign which progressing through so far, is similar to an RPG to an extend.  I like that they have a customizable deck that you change, RPG element and the abilty to lose units in battle as the campaign progresses. It would have been nice to see it more polished but for what it is, it's an alright game. If your looking for more a of a traditonal strategy games I'd suggest Unity of command instead. This is really a niche game and would suggest only pick it up if you really like Anime quirkness. Which appears to be the main selling point, in my opinion.			"

												This is basically Battleships with cute Japanese icons. There is nothing even vaguely resembling strategy, you just randomly fire at hexes and hope that something's there. If you have more than 1 unit you can recon as well, which is also just randomly clicking on hexes and hoping something's there. The ""tutorials"" consist of a single page of instructions which you have to memorize before playing each scenario.Then there are the cut scenes. Honestly, I think I might have gotten something out of this game if it weren't for these. They appear to be unskippable and are insanely annoying. They're done as JRPG style dialogues, where you have to click everytime someone talks. Even clicking through as fast as I could without reading anything I still spent more time clicking through cut scenes that I did playing the ""game.""There maybe a good game under all the god awful dialogue, but since that takes up 90% of the time spent it's impossible to tell.

												Gamplay is cut into two parts.There is the Visual Novel part which tells you a simple but funny story and then you have the battleship/chess aspect.The game have found a nice balance between showing you the story part and at ample oppotunities allows you to switch tobattleship/chess mode.My only gripe here is that you can never seem to play until you've elimated all enemy units in ""Free Battle mode""Excellent upbeat music playing in background.The choice of music is upbeat and suits to up-tempo gameplay that it provides.The characters while basic are totally awesome.While in game mode they look like little pictures on a chessboard and the animation while in combat are always the same, it doesn't get boring.On the otherhand when in visual novel mode, They still look simple and cute but the background that have been chosen are really interesting and make it a blast to follow the story instead of simply clicking through it rapidly.I can highly recommened this game to all.Especially if you are into ""battleships"" type of game.

												This game is very story driven and feels a little bit like starting a new game of persona 4. But when you get past that, the gameplay is alot like battle ship guessing where the enemy is hiding and blowing the sky high, and fire emblem where allied units are lost upon destrction, however you are able to build and research more more powerful units. This game looks and feels like a nod to anime with it's catchy intro, memorable characters, and soundtrack (props to the final boss tracks, I really wish they were on the full soundtrack of the game). The only downsides that I could find is that there are way too many cutscenes that take awway from the experience, and overall the main story only thirteen level, however this is forgiven because of the multiple paths, alternate chapters/episodes, hilarious side battles, and unlockable tanks at the end that are a joy to use in battle. Over all this is a game rts fans and anime fans will love, and in my opinion a hidden gem within the gaming industry.			"

												A Grid Based Strategy Game, Simple art style though game mechanics make it very fun, I enjoy replaying missions to see how to do them better and to stock up on more supplies, The game in its most basic form would portray Battleship with your ships shooting at unknown grid places, of coarse with the scout tanks you can counter this by having them recon the area beforehand, The assault tanks being your main tanks are quite nice to use but remember battleship style so theirs no health other then how many grid blocks they consist off, most units consisting of 1 meaning instant death if shot, so be careful, Overall I have to say its good value for its price, Looking forward to what this game can offer, (havent finished it yet), So if you decide to buy it, I say thank you for supporting the devs, Hope You Have Fun.

												When visual novel meets strategy game, the result is this game: War of the Human Tanks. Its simplistic art style compliments its simplistic gameplay, making a good game to pass time.Like all visual novels the game has mulitple endings, however, here they are dictated through your performance rather than choices. The banter between the protagonists and his corp is that of slice-of-life anime, giving this war game a relaxed feel to it. As for the music, its quite good, most if not all of the tracks fitting the mood of the situation. However, there are aspects of the game that gripe me. One is the level of grind that one has to do to even develop most of the tech. This is further compounded by the fact that you cannot cut out the animations to save time, so even if you are speed running to farm money, it still eats up a bit of time. Lastly, the game is a little too easy. I personally would have liked to have seen a ""hard"" mode that most Japanese games feature, where you get to start over against more difficult opponents.All in all, a good game to pass time.			"

												It's often a fact that the games you play before and after a game can color your experiences with them. At least, if you're the type that plays large numbers of games like myself. War of the Human Tanks entered my library at a time when I was also playing another Japanese tactical game, Fire Emblem: Awakening. Thus it's rather natural that there would be a comparison.But I find it kind to warn prospective players: Many will compare this to Fire Emblem or Battleship, but it's definitely NOT. Honestly, while it IS a strategy game, it's actually a pseudo-real time strategy, not a turn based game. This caught me off guard at first, so I feel it's fair to warn people.Now, for those experienced with these types of games, it follows the pretty typical formula: You're in charge of an army, and your job is to accomplish objectives and not lose your command tank(s) before the match ends. The first matches are actually quite challenging as you get used to the systems, but once you start being able to field certain units, the game can become laughably easy. Don't get me wrong, the challenge is still there, especially if you're averse to grinding missions, but if you like the challenge you'll probably find yourself cranking up the difficulty and/or springing for the bonus maps.So if you like Japanese style indie games with a sense of humor and don't mind sending cute little tank-girls to their deaths (seriously, there's a unit whose specific existence is to suicide bomb the enemy. It's the cheapest unit, and screams that it doesn't want to die as it explodes.) this is the game for you.			"

												A fast-paced strategy game combined Advance War + Battleship classic game.Your moe gal army want to literally die for you.Command them as a faceless protagonist through this a bit heartless story.My rating : roughly 6/10Reasons of playing:- Moe gals (...but of course, the most rightful reason)- The kind of gameplay you don't see often.- Actual skippable story with few branches, not just battles.- Not too high in price. It's worthiness comes from how much you enjoy gameplay and features.My experience:- Completed the game 10 times, beaten all stages, too lazy to complete research.- This game can get pretty grinding over time, but you don't actually need to grind in order to complete the story.- Breeding cats is hard but rewarding (or game-breaking, up to you).- Advance war element: Grid battlefield with every actions have their own range and area.- Battleship element: Shoot into the unknown hoping it will hit, then expect attacks from the unknown hoping it will miss.What I like:- Moe gals (let's drop this already...)- Good battle system and well-thought research line.- Decent plot and story. Some things are predictable, but still well-written.- Decent older-styled musics... most anyway. Some could use a bit of improvement, the opening in particular.- I'm not gonna spoil anymore than this.Most of the fun is from personal taste as well as gut.I reccomend this if you have them.What I don't like:tl;dr Three things - Evasion, Grinding, and Strange pacing.- Evasion... While it does give excitement for the game, I don't think they should resort to RNG just to make the game more difficult and challenging, especially when there's nothing to counter this evasion.It also makes many units you can research in a late game seem like a joke. Also, having evasion means that the possibility of 'not being able to hit anything even after the 3rd set of 10 shots' and 'not being able to evade anything the enemies shoot' exist. (spoken from experience where I got an unexpected crushing defeat even with 6 cats and a few units with Diet Cola boost).- Grinding... To keep this short: Most income per stage ~5-6m, Most expensive stuffs ~100m minus 1. While it's true that you don't even need 1m clear the game and 10m to complete everything else, it just means you can't exactly 'truly complete' the game without passing a hellish test of gut. Also, imagine how long and how hard can you get that 5-6m.- About pacing... Sometimes it is too slow, like having to check every single grid in a target range. It's a pain for most units with 13 grids (3 in diameter) and some units with ~100 grids for their target range. Remember, you'll be grinding. Sometimes, it is too fast. You can't take too many actions before your opponent gets one. I have no problem with this because it's more fair to the AI.Something else to say:- Some stages take longer to beat than one would expect. Some enemies will give you surprises. Some developments raise your desire better than others. Some plot may make a twisted turn. (The characters all kinda twisted already anyway...) Expect these on first playthrough.- Have trouble breeding cats? Reduce Battle Speed to Minimum, drink cola and feed them radiotoxic.- By the way, there's no random or custom maps, so things can get old fast.			"

												Gamplay is cut into two parts.There is the Visual Novel part which tells you a simple but funny story and then you have the battleship/chess aspect.The game have found a nice balance between showing you the story part and at ample oppotunities allows you to switch tobattleship/chess mode.My only gripe here is that you can never seem to play until you've elimated all enemy units in ""Free Battle mode""Excellent upbeat music playing in background.The choice of music is upbeat and suits to up-tempo gameplay that it provides.The characters while basic are totally awesome.While in game mode they look like little pictures on a chessboard and the animation while in combat are always the same, it doesn't get boring.On the otherhand when in visual novel mode, They still look simple and cute but the background that have been chosen are really interesting and make it a blast to follow the story instead of simply clicking through it rapidly.I can highly recommened this game to all.Especially if you are into ""battleships"" type of game.

												It's not a battle game. It's a visual novel. and a horrible one at that. In retrospect I wouldn't even pay five dollars for this.This game turned out to be a big dissapointment despite what I had expected of it. I thought I had bought a cute tank game with cute characters cabable of entertaining with an underlying theme of Japanese militiarism and imperialism. I love war games, especially those in which you can play from a Japanese perspective. This game is far from having any historical grasp and instead has no relevence or significance to anything. This in itself can be easily excused however since taking historical viewpoints can be taboo and perhaps lead some people to avoid a game for something more palletable to their sensibilitie. However, actual battle simulation is a complete after thought. Instead, the game is hardly even a game, consisting primarily of visual novel content. I wasn't expecting this game to be a poorly-written visual novel.The visual novel aspects of the game are horrible. The plot is so crushingly bad and the characters flatter than those found in an Ayn Rand novel, setting aside the obvious problem of a) why the hell this has to be a visual novel and b) why muh tank game needs characters with agency to begin with. THEY'RE HUMAN TANKS. I SHOULD BE THE ♥♥♥♥ING COMMANDER AND THAT'S IT. I could express how ♥♥♥♥ing bad the vn is but experience serves best. Spare yourself by not gaining the expereince.Don't buy the game. If you do, skip all the ♥♥♥♥ing dialog. All of it. This is a trash vn with a tiny bit of user controlled combat in between sledgehammer prose and cliche, one-step-below-novice writing. If I could skip everything else I'd just play the battle sequences. In fact the entire game should be the battle sequences, WTIHOUT the destitute attemmpts at plot and characters. And without renaming Japan to Japon. And without Splitting the Empire of Japan into the Empire of Japan and Kingdom of Japan. Just u ♥♥♥♥ing wot m8. What's the purpose of any of this.If the game were just the battles it would be good. The battles could also be a lot better but obviously weren't the focus.edit: changed one little grammer error that didn't convey the correct meaning but left other unchanged			"

												If you like tanks and engaging stories with a healthy dose of turn based strategy games (similar to advanced tactics)... you will love this game. The only annoying aspect is that the tanks you lose in battle will not return, so it is very possible to lose the game by not having enough tanks (or resources to make tanks) to win battles so that you can get resources to make tanks (a viscous cycle).There is also a tech tree for getting better tanks.I am part way through the game, but the tank research seems way too expensive in relation to the resources you obtain from victory... and the really good tanks that can still die in a single hit seem way too expensive to gamble with!Just remember to save before every battle!

												An amusing game that has some decidedly deep moments.  I'm sure that it's not intended to send a message in any way, but you may have to wonder how a dehumanized war can change the face of conflict and create its own little stories.This game is rather interesting because you get to see an actual arms race in action.  Starting from the beginning where both sides are equal.  You then decide to play some free maps to earn some crates.  Until you get the very latest in technology, you end up thinking that the enemy is cheating since they're outspeeding you and dodging everything.  It turns out that they have some serious equipment instead.			"

It doesn't really have sexual content per se, but late in the game there are weird tanks featuring naked chibi girls (covered by their arms and such). This is very annoying to me as I'm on a constant search to find anime stuff without this kind of content, and I thought I had found a great example all the way up to the very end... I'm not recommending it for that reason, but the game is great otherwise. Great combination of real-time stress and turn based battles.			"

												It's like Battle ship :o but you can move the ships around and try to locate where the behtches are ~ so yah :3it's fun ~ for a while o-o .... but what's really annoying.. is how when you loose a character in battle xD ... you have to purchase them again... it's fun for the first 3 rounds.. then it just dies out... so yahhh..... purchase this when the price is worth it :3 not that bad ~ but I woldn't really return to it that much..

												A boring strategy game with light RPG elements that happens to be attached to an insufferably anime storyline and aesthetic. Something of an anomaly; who was this being marketed to? I wasn't aware there was a significant overlap between tedious, strategy grognards and basement-dwelling amber alerts.It's very existence is baffling to say the least.			"

												I  know I havnt played this game much, however I played enough to know its terrible. Most of what I have played through was minutes of clicking through text only to reach combat that lasts a 1-2 minutes. Not to mention that combat is unimaginative and dull. After a couple fights I completely lost interest. There are no moving animations at all. This really feels more like a 2-3 dollar title. Ive seen free flash games with better execution.			"

												Oddly entertaining game, I found myself enjoying this game a lot. It's simple which makes it much easier to enjoy compared to games with cramped up huds and thousands of different hotkeys and commands, not that those aren't fun either. It also provides a challenge though the main campaign is mostly straightforward, the bonus maps are much more difficult.			"

												Best See-How-OP-You-Can-Make-Your-Units Simulator I've played this year! Not since Disgaea have I had so much fun modding out my units to insane levels. Assault Tanks that can nuke half the battlefield? Scout Tanks than can recon the entire map at once? You can do all that and more in WotHT.I've sunk about 30 hours into the game so far and still haven't beaten it. I was a little hesitant to write a review early on since the game seemed rather simplistic and I was worried it would be too short or not have enough variety to last but the tank development and modding always keeps things fresh and if you like buffing your units up until they're crazy powerful, you'll get plenty out of this game. It may not be as pretty or complex as games like Disgaea or Advance Wars but it's still good in it's own right. I do have some minor quibbles, though. 1) The UI is very unintuitive. I could make a long list of minor tweaks that would make it very much improved but after playing for a couple hours you get used to it. 2) The game is pretty easy. Part of this is due to the fact that you can develop your tanks at your own pace, regardless of the story progression but even then, they could have made the missions more difficult expecting you to develop strong tanks. 3) The game is a little grindy. If you want to keep up on tank development you tend to go through a cycle of: beat a new mission, replay that mission 3 more times to stack extra supplies, proceed to the next missions, beat the new mission, replay that mission 3 more times to stack extra supplies, repeat. It's not terrible since, like I said, the missions aren't that difficult but I feel something could have been done to make replaying missions a little more interesting.Overall it's a fantastic game, though. I highly recommend it if you have any interest in strategy games like Disgaea or Advance Wars.			"

												This game is cute, funny, and surprisingly hard. It can feel a little unfair at times, but not enough to make it unfun. It does require some level of patience to play, but it's good. It's challenging, but you can save the game before each battle so, if you wish to, you can reload your save and try again as many times as you want. You can't save mid-battle though, so there's a limit to how much you can exploit your saves.The story will at first feel silly and perhaps even a little dumb, but if you pay attention you'll pick up on some surprisingly dark and even thought provoking undertones.It is certainly a strange game, but so far I have no major complaints. It's certainly worth the price in my opinion.			"

												This game had me gripping the edge of my seat, although it is a short game. Maybe 4-5 hours long with no detours, the story was fantastic. It never took itself seriously either and when it did, it was still funny enough to not be serious. I must confess, there were parts that made me sad. [/spoiler]Such as the end when Satou gets shot and you think she's dead.So let me give a rating eh?Audio 10/10 The music fits very well with the game, such as upbeat music when you're dominating and cornered. The opening Theme is just great! Gameplay 10/10 It's a bit clunky at first, but what RTS game isn't? Once you get used to the way things work, it's just a matter of turns until you win, and upgrading never gets boring! Mechanics 9/10 It's like I said, a little bit clunky, and time could pass by faster. Story 10/10: The story is very gripping and well layed out with tons of comedy. Some cliches, but what isn't a cliche today? This game brings new to the table. Overall 9.75: While it's an almost perfect game, the mechanics could use a tiny bit more polish. It's definitely a must play by anime fans everywhere, it's got a little bit of everything for everyone!			"

												I haven't finished playing the game as of this review but i will proboly finish the game after the reveiew has been posted as far as i have been playing the game, i am enjoying it very much being a commander of human tanks. I have been a big fan of startegy RPG'S and when i looked at the screen shots it looked really interesting and cool. So i bought the game on sale and i was hooked the story so far is okay nothing too impressive but rather really good so much is focused on who your character is and why is he going back to being a comander instaed of being lazy and watching anime all day. Overall the I would give the game 8/10 for anybody that enjoys JRPG's, Strategy Games or Anime in genreal it so worth the price of 10 bucks and if you can get it on sale better because it has so much replay value that you will always be coming back to the game for some JRPG Goodness. Can't wait to buy the next game of the series and as well when the third game when it comes out.			"

												Basically a much more complex version of Battleship with a story and an amazing soundtrack. It's surprisingly fun to play and while the story isn't excellent, it's fun to follow due to how silly it's majority of the time. Plus the soundtrack is great. The combat is quite fun and it feels rather fair. And most importantly, the soundtrack is awesome....Did I already tell the soundtrack is stunning? That's enough good reason to play the game (or to buy the soundtrack).			"

												A very clever grid-based strategy game where cute anime characters kill each other. Feels like a much older game at times, but is still very playable. See it in action here:

												This game is cute, funny, and surprisingly hard. It can feel a little unfair at times, but not enough to make it unfun. It does require some level of patience to play, but it's good. It's challenging, but you can save the game before each battle so, if you wish to, you can reload your save and try again as many times as you want. You can't save mid-battle though, so there's a limit to how much you can exploit your saves.The story will at first feel silly and perhaps even a little dumb, but if you pay attention you'll pick up on some surprisingly dark and even thought provoking undertones.It is certainly a strange game, but so far I have no major complaints. It's certainly worth the price in my opinion.			"

												A great game, if you're into anime, visual novels and a battleship like game. Easily one of the most fun games i own on steam and definitely could easily kill some free time if you're looking to play a quick game. Intense fights and the story is well done with many different upgrade trees for all the different tanks you can make and combos you can use in battle10/10 would recommend to others.P.S 2 more installments of the game are coming soon~			"

												The graphics are incredibly cheap. However, it passed an important test: I had a really hard time stopping once the game startedThe programmer of this game knew what he was doing. Despite the cheap graphics, there is a polish to the game. The gameplay overall is solid, and the story is actually somewhat good. An easy game to underestimate due to the presentation, but overall enjoyableI can't help but be reminded of Paw Patrol for some reason			"

												*War of the waifus. Title error that steam made. If you've played any grid based strategy game before you'll probably like this. It's like Battleships, but with waifus. No tutorial, but the game isn't very hard to figure out how to play. One thing that bothers me is that your units don't move very far very quickly, but this game is a lot of fun			"

												War of the Human Tanks is a game I really really really wanted to like. Seriously, it's awesome! However, a few things really killed my interest in continuing this game any further than I did.First, the game really shines in the story and character development department. It had me completely interested from the get-go. The story centers around a war between two empires using human tanks. They're pretty much just machines that look like humans. They are fully at the command of the leaders to live and die in battle, despite their human appearances. You play as the army unit that's just been released from a 'frozen state' to help take back critical objectives. A bunch of ... oddballs that are completely hilarious!! haha.The music in this game? AMAZING. You can hear some of it in the trailer above. I really enjoyed what i heard throughout my time with the game. The art works well enough too! More of an anime-ish look to everything.However, the gameplay is where I really struggles to enjoy this game to the fullest. You run around on hexagonal tile sets, where fog of war really rules the surrounding area. Think of a game of battleship, where you fire into unknown areas and hope to hit something. Everything in this game dies in one hit. It works well enough but your units only move a couple of spaces at a time so it feels really slow. Then on top of that, you have a strict time limit, so if your RNG is bad ... you run out of time and fail the mission. Honestly, it happened more times than I would have liked and I grew frustrated with it before long.I still recommend playing this game because you might not mind the gameplay as much as i did! It's an excellent little indie game that I got on sale for $3 and still managed to get about 3 hours of game time in.			"

												It's a nice little indie-strategy game, that has it's mainfocus on fog of war and one-hit kills per unite, making it more of a game around vision then anything.The story, while beeing a little weird, was overall quite enjoyable and the unites all felt rather unique.My mainproblem with the game was the optionsmenue, like many anime-style-games you can't really get it to a good resolution easily and many other funktions from the options seem to be rather lackluster as well, but the game is still playable and said problems are small enough to still recommend this game.

												This game is really solid. Good soundtrack, fun gameplay, and it has anime tank girls. The characters are fun, too. It plays a lot like the GBA game, Advance Wars - which i have many, many fond memories of. So if you liked that game, you'll love this one.			"

												You know, when I first read about this game and the idea of ""Human Tanks"", I thought it was just pandering. You know, take a military game but make everyone cute anime girls, because Japan. But in actuality, the whole story is built around that they're not quite human and they're not just tanks. It's pretty nicely done, and creates a nice light-hearted atmosphere towards a war game without going the Advance Wars route of just acting like people aren't getting repeatedly shot up.I really like this game overall, actually. It's not amazing at anything in particular - the gameplay is very simple, the story isn't particularly complex or witty, and the art is really basic - but it's got a buttload of charm and it's still fun to play! Do give it a try, but don't expect to like it as much as I do.I do truly regret 100%ing the achivements though. The bonus missions were a pain in the ASSSSSS!			"

												Art Style: Okay, The characters were very cute and the backgrounds match the setting. +1Combat Style:  Pretty Good, semi turn based  on a grid location.  Your units have a speed value, that value is how quickly your units can act.  while your units are charging, so are the enemies, so they can act just as you click a unit, if it was fast enough. +3Story:  NICE!:  Didnt think the story would make me feel, well anything, I was very wrong.  I actually felt bad when I lost tanks reguardless if they were a special unit or a suicide tank (only used them when I had no choice Ex. Cat and achievements). +4Tech Progression:  A combination of using money (mostly) and older model tanks to get stronger/bigger tanks.  There is also a requirment of a tank you can only get from continueing the storyline.  Therefor with ""freebattle"" you can grind early for good stuff, but it also prevents you from getting VERY BIG stuff.  +210/10 worth $5-10, although i got it on sale for a few bucks. "

												I wasn't quite sure what to make of that game before playing it but it was surprisingly interesting.View range means everything. Until you get a Nozomi with +3 range and +3 area covering half the map with a single shot, that is.Or even better, until you get to enlist Mr. Cat (which you can obtain sooner and quite easily by spamming shock tanks like there's no tomorrow).

												Love this game. It plays like the most adorable match of chess, the story is very well put together and the characters are likable - which is pretty unusual for such a cheap game! Definently recommend this if you enjoy turn-based strategy games!			"
