Short version:Interestingly enough, the only thing that tells us that this is supposed to be a season finale is that the scope of the events escalate rather quickly towards the end; otherwise, it is one of the most generic TellTale point ‘n’ click episodes. A good one, but not as great as Episode 4 was.Long version:Sam & Max return from the edge of space and time, only to discover that their neighbourhood has gone to hell. Literally; Hell has opened its gates and most anyone who we met during this season ends up in a predicament or two, including a few who are suffering some kind of torture in the bowels of the netherworld. So, it is up to Sam & Max to save them, whether they want it or not.Gameplay follows a similar setup as the last episode, with several separate small stories next to each other. Since this is a TellTale game, these are all required to complete some central task, or in this case, two: first we wreak havoc in Hell, then we try to deal with its new management.The problem is with the latter, the second half of the episode. It lacks proper weight, something that would show us that it ends and entire season of adventures. Instead, it feels like just completing one of the random tasks in any other episode, only this time there is nothing after it. It hurts the general quality, even if the writing is still funny as hell.But, in the end, it is still a solid Sam and Max story, and I have to admit, probably a little better ending for the season than the one from Season 1.

												Sam and Max, Freelance Police! ... are back in season two.(You can never have enough Sam and Max!!) - and yes, they are just as good in Season2. And if you thought they couldn't go further than season 1... you will be surprised.Note: You really need to play these games in order. The story builds, characters are introduced, and if you haven't played previous games, you won't understand the backstory.Hilariously imaginative, well-written, and adorable. Recommended! 9.5/10			"
