Early Access Review
								Shall keep this short.Some nice ideas but feels like a group of friends have thrown a canvas together for testing purposes, not much more as it stands. When you boot the game it does state ""this version is a pre-alpha prototype"" which pretty much hits the nail on the head but doesn't sound nearly as charming as 'early access' now does it. :)Fingers crossed this project doesn't get abandoned like lots of other 'early access' releases. Will definitely be kept installed to see how it progress but for now I would suggest holding off. Unless you have the spare cash and don't mind supporting 'ideas' and not expecting a complete or close-to complete product.@devs Keep listening to the community and pumping out the patches and content, because it could well turn into something lovely. Got a very risen/gothic vibe about it and I say this in the nicest possible way.edit: This review was made with the inital version of the game. I have not had the time to go back and see whats been changed yet. afaik progress so far has been more behind the scenes work for future content. I would still advise to wait and see what the team produces in the future.			"

First, let me just say that most other reviews came from a while ago, and dont reflect recent changes, or don't mention the unstable alpha branch that has been updated. With that in mind, please continue.I'd like to mention something that has been gone over in other reviews. Yes, at the time, this game is not complete yet, and it has a ways to go. The official release branch has not been updated since February, and the devs were quiet for many months after that.However, the dev team has gotten their engine overhaul almost complete, and have begun an unstable alpha build that they've been releasing updates for on Steam quite regularly. With the updates that I'm sure will be soon added to the game, I'm confident this game will be worth the $20, but if you expect a mostly feature complete game, do not play this yet. Buy it, hold on to it, and play it once it's closer to release.I'll make sure to update this review once sufficient changes are made.			"

								You'll notice a lot of the negative reviews are from a while ago and don't really reflect what this game has evolved into.  The devs have really been hitting the updates hard and the game has made tremendous strides.  The graphics alone are breathtaking and the combat and gameplay are really starting to come along. Currently, there is a lot to do and explore in the game and it's fun to just lose yourself in the beautiful world they created. I honestly see great potential in this game as it moves forward and I'm excited to see what each new updated brings.What's great about this early access games is the devs are really involved.  They update the game regularly and take feedback from the community.  Just go to the discussions and you see the devs interacting with the players and taking their suggestions and implementing some of them in the game. I don't get the feeling that this is some fly-by-night group, and they seem to care about their product. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase and I highly recommend this game to open world RPG enthusiasts.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is Early Access. Early Access. Pre-Alpha. I might even go so far as to say its just post-Prototype. This is not simply playing a game, for now it is mainly just testing the game systems and giving feedback and reporting bugs. The main quest only recently got implemented because they ugraded to a newer version of CryEngine, which honestly has made the lighting effects and general graphics of the game much more beautiful than its earlier version. This game is Early Access.The game is challenging, enemies hit hard, you have to roll and block. Hacking-and-Slashing will get you dead. There are only 2 spells in the game currently, a heal spell and a light spell, however I believe the developers have said that spells will be receiving attention sometime within the next month. This game is Early Access.There are framerate problems and certain things still need to be balanced. Animations are meh. However, they update this game consistently every other week, in fact, its more common for them to provide an update of some sort EVERY week. This is a team of maybe 3 to 5 people and its clear that they are working hard.This game is Early Access.Please do not buy this game if you are going to clutter the forums with complaints about how its in an early state. Its advertised as being in an early state, it says Early Access in bright blue all over the reviews and the page. There are features that haven't been implemented yet, such as Co-op. Please DO buy this game if you want to support an indie developer in making a beautiful, third-person, open-world, Co-op RPG and you want to offer suggestions and feedback.TL;DR This game is Early Access.

Early Access Review
NOTE: While it is to be expected, and apparently many didn’t get the memo, that an early access game is not the same as pre-purchasing one. It’s a different yet rewarding and enjoyable experience to be part of. Plus, the devs are awesome and always willing to answer your questions or receive any feedback you might have for them here in the forums or over at their twitch stream channel. I've really enjoyed playing the game, interacting with the devs and other fans, and you could too. The devs deliver on their promises and right now is prime time to back this game! When thinking about whether or not you want to purchase this game, keep in mind the following:Do you hate paying for DLC and would rather enjoy free content updates in a game? Check!Are you like me who wants to explore and conquer a gorgeous and an already huge but ever growing open world universe? Check!Isn't it great when the Devs actually respond to your feedback on the forums? Check!Would YOU like to help shape an Open World RPG universe? Check!Isn't it satisfying when your play style wasn't given the short end of the stick? Check!Do you enjoy games with deep combat systems which gives you a real sense of dynamism and strategy? Check!Would you like it if no effort you put into your character will be wasted? Whatever you do will permanently improve some aspect about you! Check!The following features are currently being developed:Want to be take part in guilds to earn the top title to wield influence over others? Check!Want to be part of a modding community for the game? Check!Do you like crafting and mining to create new and exciting equipment? Check!Want a multiplayer experience where you can play alongside or against your friends and other players? Check!This and so much more is just waiting for your support!My time with The Memory of Eldurim has been a satisfying and rewarding early access game experience that would satisfy any serious gamer with a patient eye for epic role-playing games. It’s obvious that the team at Liminal Games are passionate and talented developers who are committed to making this game the absolute best it can be. Their commitment to this game is proven by the frequent quality updates like this: improving upon already existing features; adding in new and exciting ones; updating their placeholder animations with professionally created ones; and also by adding new HUGE and beautiful areas to explore and conquer. It’s always exciting to see what future updates will bring us!It's great to know that these guys are serious about delivering us the best experience possible. You know that you're getting your moneys worth when you buy this game, and the piece of mind that they'll continue to pump out great content as they have been and continue to invest in this game with the money they make when you buy it. The future looks bright for the MOE. Brighter still when you decide to join us :DDid I mention Multiplayer? Yeah, how sick is that! Who wouldn’t want to play Skyrim with your friends? Well, you will soon get your chance at such an experience with this game!I highly recommend you support this great game now and not wait to buy it! "

								An Early Access Pre Alpha Game!!!   That being said if you love Elder Scrolls especially Skyrim and can't wait for an Elder Scrolls VI (not ESOnline, and actual ES6) and if you have the time and patience to help these guys develop a really nice game with a huge amount of potential then defenitely get this game. I've only been playing a little bit, and have already noticed a bug or 2 and had a crash, but I do really like this game and the potential it has. As I said before, this game can be truly awesome. Please, if you have the time and patience help this game to reach it's true potential buy buying and playing it.			"

								Should you buy The Memory of Eldurim?YesIf you love Open-World Adventure games like The Elder Scrolls series or The Witcher series then you'll love The Memory of Eldurim.  The game drops you into a village and tells you to go do what you like.  So far there are no real quests, except ones that you make yourself.  The game's graphics are beautifully realistic, as only the Cry and Frostbite engines can offer, but not to taxing on your computers hardware, meaning my med-tier laptop can handle high settings and still maintain 40 fps.  Finally, the alpha state of the game means that anything can change and anything can be added.  Maybe the next update will include dragons.  Maybe trolls and dwarfs.  Or maybe even Tom Hanks.  Only time will tell, and I will be spending that time playing this game.EDIT1Due to some recent changes in the game my framerate has now dropped to a staggering 13 fps.  While this puts me off from enjoying the game I still am excited about the recent updates and I hope to see some optimization patches for the game so I may continue playing.			"

Early Access Review
								This game looks better than some triple A games currently out, which is kind of saying something for an indie group. It reminds me of Skyrim with the feel of farcry. I could see this being a game where after you gain an intimate knowledge of the layout of the terrain it gains a sort of nostalgic quality. Maybe because it has this appeal to kind of wander around and explore, AND since its more vibrant than Skyrim it has a minimal copypasta feel to it.The combat mechanics are a good mix of RPG and action elements. And I'm happy to see this game has an asymetrical magic system that is different from the typical kind of system where players get a fire spell and an ice spell and the only difference is the color. My main qualm with a lot of other games with action and RPG elements is that they usually tend to gravitate to RPG or Action, whereas here we see a true blending. The formula looks like it has deeper potential than even Skyrim or Oblivion. In fact its like they took the best lessons from Skyrim and Dark Souls and are blending them in a hardcore fashion.Clearly it looks far from finished though which isn't a bad thing (because its obviously already beautiful), it means there is a lot of room for growth. I think its worthing buying as is, and definately worth buying just to see what it becomes.One last thought to expand on my first comment:  Most indie games sacrifice great graphics in favor of faster development cycles and thoroughly fleshed out game mechanics. Almost all 2d platformers, Minecraft, terraria, Don't Starve, FTL: Faster than light etc. are some examples. Therefore I have to give major props to this team for attempting to sacrifice nothing for a great gaming experience. Its a huge challenge. I develop software professionaly too in a non-game industry and I'm aware that a lot of triple A games will have entire teams of guys dedicated to graphics alone, teams probably larger than this entire dev team who also is doing all the different aspects involved in coding a game not just the graphics. It means too that since they have accomplished so much already I can see that they have majorly invested themselves in finishing. Now or later this game is going to be a finished bomb-shell and people are going to wonder how it snuck up on them.			"

Early Access Review
								I wish there were a ""Not right now"" option for recommending a game, espeically with all these early access games, but for now I will just say I do not recommend this game. Don't get me wrong, it has a TON of potential. I can really see where the game could go...in a few years. Which is exactly the problem. It will take quite a long time for this game to really reach its potential. I say give it a year at least, maybe two and see how things are then.I know it's early access, but I didn't realize it was quite this early. I would almost not call this game in an alpha state just yet. It is more like a pre-alpha, behind closed doors only test phase in its current form. For me it was just too early access.The good:The enviornemtns look awesome. They are creative, varied and make you want to just explore around, since it's an open world you can definitely do just that.The combat has a decent start. It has a sort of Dark Souls vibe with how attacks work and change with each weapon you use.The spells seemed interesting and I liked that you could use two different stones to get various different spells for a decent level of customization.The bad (most if not all of these will probably be fixed at some point):No quest log. There are quests and the quest log is there, but the log is currently not working so it can be hard to remember what to do unless you write it down.No interactive map. It's basically just a still image. At least an indicator of my current location would be awesome.No voice acting. I don't want to totally put the game down for that. Obviously voice acting is a huge undertaking and maybe the game will eventually have it, maybe it wont. Just be aware that you will have to do a lot of reading here.No customizable controls. That wouldn't be so bad, but the hotkeys (in my  opinion) are very strangely set up.No controller support (yet). I don't know if controller support is planned but this game really would feel a lot better with a controller in my opinion.The game doesn't save your position. When you quit or the game crashes or whatever, you start back in the hut you started the game in. You do keep all your items though, so I found it kind of strange that it doesn't save your position when you quit.The game crashes fairly often. I had two crashes in about an hour.Enemies are a bit easy. While I said it did have a Dark Souls vibe, the AI is a bit weak. The first several enemies I ran in to just walk at you and attack. If you time it right you can use this huge greatsword I found and one shot the enemy before it even gets one attack off. This changed a tiny bit when I ran in to a few shield enemies but it still wasn't that challenging.There are several areas you will explore just to find nothing there. I went in to a cave with some skeletons, worked my way to the back and found...a wall with a crack in it that looked like it had something behind it but I couldn't break it no matter what I tried. So then I found another path in to the same cave but at a different area. That path had no enemies and led straight to a dead end with nothing in it. So I turned back around, found yet another cave, walked through it, killed an enemy or two, swam in some water, and found a way out. It led to this high narrow bridge like thing. I followed that all the way to the end and...nothing, the bridge just suddenly stops at a massive drop off.			"

Early Access Review
								I feel like I've played long enough to give a fair review now. So, here's my thoughts.First of all: The environment. The mountain, towering up from the earth, and the temple on top. The bridge, spanning from said mountain to the archives on the other side - and of course, the newly added Archive itself. It's just stunning to look at. I've been staring at the environment far longer than I usually do in games. I hope to see many locations as beautiful as this with future patches.The graphics are superb, too. Nothing to complain about there. The sounds are a bit generic, but as far as I know, devs are implementing sounds as the development progresses. The sounds will surely be better once the game is released.What about gameplay? The combat is.. well. It's hard. It's fun and tactical, but it's hard. But then, I usually suck at combat in these types of games unfortunately. A suggestion: difficulty slider.I have only tried magic on occasion, and never in fact tried fighting using it. There's an illumination spell which I fairly often use, and the magic system is pretty interesting. Instead of mana, you have something called Ikhor. Pile up enough of it, and you die. You gain Ikhor by using spells. It's like mana in most games - but instead of just running out of mana, you'd die. You also collect shards, which contain certain spells. There are equipped on your arms/gloves and makes you able to use said spells. Quite an interesting concept, and it works too.As it is right now, you just resurrect at nearest bed/camp when you die. You don't lose anything(as far as I know), and that's just good for me, since I die like 10 times everytime I play the game.Overall, I think this game is worth the 19 euro they ask for it. I won't give a score at this time since it's so early in development. I do recommend it if you like games like Skyrim, ie open-world RPGs.Sorry if this review is muddy or something, I've been awake far too long. It should, though, get most of my points through.			"

								Does everyone remember how awesome The Elder Scrolls Oblivian was when it came out?  This game, though a work in progress, has that feeling.  The mechanics along are the reason why I bought it.  However, it also has good graphics (becoming amazing every patch), rich and fufilling combat, and the possability for so much more.  The developers listen to the players, and they really care about their work.  So if there is/was something you care about in this game they will hear you out on it.

								Athough this Open World game is Early Access and in only in Pre-Alpha, you can still have a lot of fun with it. The Devs are hot on combat mechanics and you have to earn your kills, not only by moves but also knowledge of which particular weapon and weapon spells work best against each enemy type. You play either in 1st ot 3rd person, changeable at the scroll of your mouse wheel, I find fighting easier in 3rd person with this game. There is very little ""hand-holding"" and you have to find out a lot of stuff by yourself, or cheat and go on the forums if you are really stuck. Currently only one very large Island is available but it gives a good few hours of gameplay.The graphics are pretty good and slated to get better, something I really like to hear. Crafting is high on the list for future Updates as is mining. Check out the Liminal Games site for more info.			"

								I'm going to make this short and sweet.This game combines the open world exploration experience of Skyrim with the combat of Dark Souls. Also, despite it being listed as single-player, the devs have indicated in the forums that they are going to implement co-op (isn't a co-op rpg skyrim/dark souls experience what everyone wants?). This is an extremely early access game. There isn't a lot to do in it right now. However, the concept behind it is genius. Go check out the forums. The devs seem to be listening to their community. I recommend this game despite it's incomplete status because of its concept. I see a few reviews saying things of the sort ""I don't recommend it right now."" However, we need people to support this game so that it can achieve its potential. If your looking for a completed game, then this isn't it (hence early access). But if your looking to back something of the sort I've described, then give it a shot. I could see this game, easily going for $60 at full release. I know a lot of people have been burned on ""early release titles"" lately. This is one that I'm willing to risk it for.			"

								In understanding that this game is very early alpha, it could result in a worthwhile game.  I do support their effort and encourage financially supporting the title.  The skill progression based system where even stamina is increased upon running is akin to morrowind/ultima online.  There are a few exploitable NPCs right now that give amazing gear immediately upon login.  I've found one boulder throwing boss in a cave that was tough for a bit.  Lots to explore.  Let it be known that I can't find a way off the first island, as I think there is no additional content yet.			"

Its obvious that Liminial Games is commited to continually updating and improving their game. The environment is beautiful, which makes it enjoyable to explore every aspect of the map. The combat system keeps on improving and they keep adding more spells and items. I also like that there is no traditional leveling system. The only way to improve a skill is to use it. They more you use each skill the better your character becomes at it. This is a game you want to get early because it just keeps getting better!			"

								This game has a lot of potential. It has great visuals accompanied by brilliant sound assets however the character animation is somewhat stiff and unnatural and the combat is dull and repetitive, I realise this game is unfinished and is being develpoed by an indie team, the game can amount to a lot but I won't make any assumptions. I do not recommend this game to someone looking for an immediate solid gaming experience, I do however recommend that you invest in this game if you like the concept of and open-world action rpg, that is reminiscent of Dark Souls. Something worth mentioning is that I feel as if the game is hard not 'Dark Souls hard' but this game is unfair, the combat is not fluid and responsive enough to allow you to play the game with the required amount of skill. Having said that the game is in early access and I am very optimistic about this game.			"

It is obvious that the developers are working really hard to make this an epic game, and, from what I see, they are actually doing it.

								Well it is as the Description says a Open world ""Action RPG"" so you are not bound to Quest, you can explore on your own with no boundary. This game got many promising features they either already implemented or will be implement in the future, like a mastery system which allowes you to decide how your character will evolve, maybe you want to be a powerfull mage then you will use your spells, and as you use them they will slowly ""lvl up"" same goeas for swords, if you use your sword all the time your character will master Sword fighting in no time :)There is NO lvl-system as in games like Sacred, Torchlight, World of Warcraft and co. This Game is still in Early Developement, thats why the Content is not realy that much at the moment and there are still a few bugs ingame.But from Patch to Patch this game is getting better and better, the Developers are working with the Community to eleminate all bugs as soon as possible.For now we will get presented one Big ""starter-Island"" which presents you at least some hours of playable content (if you like to grind a bit to get equipment).Graphicly speaking is this game build on the powerfull Cry-engine which delivers a higly detailed world with a day and night cycle.I will Update this Review every now and then when this games Content will be updated.

								Wow, impressive for only an EA game. The visuals are phenomenal and has really solid game-play. I didn't encounter any major bugs at all. You can tell it's a really well done game when playing. I was able to fight with swords, axes, maces, and a spear. I hear bows are going to be part of the game in the near future. If you like to be a mage, there were plenty of really cool spells to choose from with a really unique and interesting way to manage your mana that I haven't seen before. So far it's looking really great, and I haven't even seen or done everything yet! If you like like oblivion or skyrim, this game could easily be the next big RPG! So fun! Keep the updates coming!I'm definitely going to keep playing this one, you should too :)4 out of 5 stars "

								This game is a fantastic game. It still needs some work here and there, but the developers are working very hard.Good:Visuals are stunning and they are very well done.Weapon combat reminds me of dark souls - very tactical and much like a game of chessSkill system makes sure that every time you swing, you become stronger (i.e. weapon damage increases)Needs work:Some bugs here and there pop up concerning items and AIThe magic spells seem underpowered and not useful (but I'm sure they will get better with time)Overall, I have been enjoying this game thoroughly, and I'm excited to see where this game goes!

								Purchased this game around when it came out, said it had multiplayer.. Bought it for two accounts because it looked good, only to play the game and find out that it didn't have multiplayer. This was before the refund system, and after looking this up it said they intended to add multiplayer later on.. Now it's a single player game and they've gotten rid of all of that completely. I feel cheated by this company, do not recommend.			"

								First impressions: http://www.cublikefoot.com/the-memory-of-eldurim-first-impressions/Oh man, I had a lot of fun playing around in The Memory of Eldurim. Even in it's early access state, the game is fun. There may be plenty of room for improvement, but the game seems to be heading in the right direction and I can't wait to see what happens with it.Currently, there are plenty of flaws. I was able to slaughter all of the peasants in the spawn town, some even right in front of guards, who obviously didn't care for the town's citizens. I found that quite amusing, but hope that it will eventually be a bit more realistic. It's also a bit unfair, in a way. You're able to spawn right after dying, which doesn't set back time at all (like most RPGs, that load from save states). With this in mind, I was able to continually go after the same guy several times until he died.Graphically, the game looks fantastic. The Memory of Eldurim makes use of the CryEngine, the first indie title I've ever seen using the engine. I really enjoy the game, but it's going to need a lot of improvement before it's ready to see the light of day. I can recommend it in its current state, but don't expect too much content-wise. Hopefully we'll see some updates in the future.

I play for hours straight some days (don't know why it doesn't show on steam) becasue it is so addicting trying to find new equiptment and such. I'm am having trouble killing the first boss though. I was mostly done with him, then died in one attack. Great game overall, minimal bugs for what I have played. A brightness setting would be good though.			"

								I have owned this game for a while, but have hardly played it because my video card was not sufficient enough to make the game enjoyable. I upgraded my video card and the game has also been updated. Now it runs smoothly and looks beautiful.I have not played too far into the story, but so far the game play is excellent. It is a cryengine game and it shows. The graphics are beautiful, the action silky smooth.At this point, I would say that if you are a fan of the elder scrolls games or the Gothic series of games, this game is worthy of your attention. The only question left in my mind is not ""will this be a good game when finished?"" Instead the only question I am left with is will this game be merely very good when finished? Or will it be  an indie classic? The potential is there.			"

								Now that the game went through several updates, it is finally starting to feel more playable. Still I don't understand why you can't find the controls in any menu. Those are quite critical to know when you want to play any game. Turning on vsync makes the game run smoother and less heavy. Compared to how the game was in February, where it certainly wasn't worth 18 €, it is an ok price at its current state.Let's hope the updates keep coming on a weekly basis instead of the 5 months waiting at the start of the year.

								Some things may have chnaged since i originally wrote this review but I won't reinstall this till it is full release.Game has improved greatly in recent times but is still not ready to be played. Buy it now and play it later it will be worth it.ProsGame looks REALLY good like amazeballs good.Game has an amazing amount of potential.One thing I REALLY like, kill a bandit wearing Leather armor ALL his armor shows up in his inventory CANNOT stress how much i like that.ConsChange the text for bodies and objects on the ground from red to white FFS.Gamma control slider please.Can't save the bloody game, pretty much the most basic of all game controls, does not exist. which means every time you go in game you start from the begining.If your gonna use campfires to make a save point then make that the save point when i start the game.Mostly I'd say it's worth it with the hopes they continue to work on this game as i feel it really could be the next Oblivion. I will be waiting till they do a conciderable amount of work before I attempt to play again though.Buy this game and wait till they finish it to play, it will be worth it.			"

								Wow!!! I bought this game when it first arrived on steam to support the devs cause it looked like it was going places, and boy was I right! It looks amazing! The textures for foliage, land and architecture are truly amazing. Everything is carefuly hand placed to get that unique fantasy vibe. Don\'t get me wrong this game is far from finished, but if you don't mind only being able to explore a beautifuly crafted island without much gameplay features, and helping the devs finance this amazing project then your not going to be disapointed. This is so far the most beautiful well crafted Place that I have seen, and  I don't mind spending  an hour or so every couple of days wandering around and exploring.Edit: Seems all work on this game has stopped and been abandoned. Do not buy this game!!!			"

								I've really enjoyed my time with this game so far and I've found it hard to quit playing at times. Immediately after getting tossed into the world of Eldurim, I got the same feeling I got from playing Skyrim: I felt compelled. I wanted to explore every nook and cranny of this beautiful place. The world is detailed, intricate and super unique. The combat is straitforward and simple, but super satisfying and impactful. With some refinement to the overall character animations (which I expect we'll see soon), we're gonna have some top notch gameplay on our hands. The music is absolutely beautiful - 'nuff said Haven't delved to far into the story yet, but I'm excited to learn more about what's going on in the world of Eldurim Definitely one of my favorite EA games now. It's easy to tell that the developers are devoted and passionate and I absolutely can't wait for the future of The Memory of Eldurim. P.S. bugs and framerate issues are a thing here but haven't stopped me from enjoying the game. And as we can expect, these'll get ironed out soon enough.			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game yesterday, marking the first early access game I've ever bought on Steam, and thought it might be interesting to give my view as someone who doesn't really know how they hold up to fully finished games.Even playing the game with the settings as low-end as possible to keep my ailing computer happy, this game looks startlingly good. The textures are lovingly designed, the water looks beautiful, it's bright and vibrant and colourful, and the few enemy models that I did find in the game each looked distinct and striking. And the Shroud engine the game uses... oh my, it's beautiful. The lack of story doesn't detract from what the game's main goal currently is; exploring a beautifully designed world to see what it has to offer. With the game being updated constantly I was always pushing to find new areas to explore, and never disappointed in what I found. The combat is simplistic but solid, and the game's magic system of ""Ikhor"", which functions as a kind of reverse mana, where too much of it limits your spellcasting, is certainly innovative. A few control tune-ups with the swimming would be appreciated, but besides that the game functioned perfectly.The game is coming along extremely well, it seems. Two and a bit hours in, only, and I'm hooked to see what the studio makes of it. Beneath the graphics which more than once made me just sit back and take them in, there are the bones of a very solid game. And while I'm not usually a fan of worrying over graphics first and letting the gameplay fall by the wayside, the game's aesthetic makes it a joy to explore, and it's something to keep coming back to as features get added.

Early Access Review
								The Memory of Eldurim is an Action RPG in a fantasy world. As it is still in Early Access, the game has a few bugs and other imperfections here and there, but the developers are quite active in the game community and are willing to take a look at things where they can.The gameplay itself is mostly what you'd expect from an ARPG. However, there is a fair bit more strategy and planning your attacks than just running in mashing the attack button. You will die, but each death teaches you a bit more about what the particular enemy  needs in order to be beaten.Visually, it's very nice. There are drops in the framerate from time to time, but I'm sure that further updates will help to optimize it and improve the stability of the framerate.Sound, for the most part, is pretty sparse. The main town has music,  but except for the occasional orchestral chord swells, there's not much in the way of ambient music outside of town. Battle music is also present at times, but don't go in expecting hours of music to get stuck in your head (not yet at least).Overall, this is a good game with the potential to become a magnificent game. I am looking forward to seeing where it goes.P.S. An update for controller support was recently released. If you have a controller, I highly recommend using it.P.P.S. The game has gone on the back burner for now as far as updates go, but the game remains a fun little sandbox to explore.			"

								If you base this game on its look alone...it would get a good rating. Unfortunately that is all you really get, some eye candy. A very small world...couple of villages which are pretty much empty. A few small quests. Nothing remotely close to what is discribed about the game. I know...early access. But nothing updated or touched in nearly a year as of this review. I can't recomend this game. Unless the devs pull one huge rabbit out of their♥♥♥♥♥♥in the near future. Early Access started out with good intentions. To support game devs. Now it has become a haven for devs to get money, and run. The devs for this game seem to have taken their money and left the game. Two years and this game hasn't gotten very far. And likely never will.			"

								This game is early, but there's enough content here to have some fun, and see where it looks like the game will someday be.   The combat is fun, the quests vary between completely awful to fairly interesting, and the loot is quite creative, but where this game really shines is in the world design.  At the moment the entire game takes place on a fairly tiny (by modern RPG standards) island.  But this island is packed.  You can tell they took an awful lot of time hand crafting everything, there's a ton of detail and secrets, and really a lot more creativity than I've ever seen in a medieval RPG world.  The joy of exploring the various locations is why I'm so willing to recommend this game, despite it's early state.  If you're the type of person that likes looking through every nook and cranny in a map and are delighted when there's actually stuff there to find, this is definitely a game for you.   There are definitely a lot of wrinkles to smooth out, but it's completely clear there's a gem here that can already be enjoyed.			"

								This game is dead!Do not buy it!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well I wanna say something for you guys,I buy this game so I definitely support it.1.This game has the most beatiful scenery I have ever seen especially the distant view and the light reflection.2.The movement responses are good .The character can jump ,roll, block,tap and smite no delay.3.Some notes:1)This game is too quiet.No character voice at all.Maybe simply because it's still in development.Hope hear it in the future.Voices mean so much in a RPG game.(If your budget is limited I can find some time do it for free but I assume that will be a lot of accents LOL)2)The design language is simple and weird...I walked into some houses most of them just have a bed or a bed and a fireplace I dont know what season it is,it looks like summer or spring... but the fireplace is on fire!!!And as I said it's weird...so is the lamp hanging on the outside of the house even in the daylight it sparkling as hell...unreal..3)The story may be worth a shot.I just played it half an hour.Some guys will say that it is too short for telling a story.But for me that's enough ..Think about some other big RPG games like witcher skyrim dragon age blah blah blah .These games will tell you a story in the first place  as you lost your memory,you are a criminal,you are a very common person but after one battle you will know something about yourself that you may have some strange power or you've got to find something about your own....In this game I know that I am a survivor of a horrible shipwrecked and that ship  probably loaded reinforcements for the village to protect them from the bandits...4)I swam across the sea and landed on another place but not far...I met up some guys I tried to talk to them but they didnt give me a chance they just took out their weapons and chased me to the end of the world...why...Are they bandits?I just want to talk...Please Please add some Steam cards for this game!

								I had high hopes. I was hoping this would become a sort of modernized Morrowind. It has some of the basic ideas, but no content whatsoever. I bought this game so long ago and they added maybe two major features since then. Character creation is nice but give me something to DO.In my hour of gametime I did some flailing around, killed some random wandering knights. Most of my deaths, or rather, ""Reloads"" is when I fell into water and could not find a way out at all. Kudos for not giving me instant water death like older games, but kudos immediately lost when I spent ten minutes swimming around trying to find ANY kind of surface to get back on land.I keep checking back up with this game only to find that they haven't updated in more than a year. Wish I could refund, but sadly far beyond the two week limit. What a waste.(In the event this game has some major comeback, I'll edit/delete my review to reflect that.)			"

								There are some really interesting aspects to this game, it looks as though it has great potential. That being said, let me offer some advice to those who are about to download it. You will need a near infinite amount of patience for the game to load. In the time it took to load the game (not download, just load), create my character, and get to gameplay I had rallied 2 towns in War and Order and beat 3 unpoppable levels on Bloons TD 5 on my iPhone. However, once the game does load, you will instantly be grateful that you waited for it to complete. The graphics are superb and the amount of gameplay I have had so far (though I have died 2x) has been very exciting.			"

The rate that they are working at makes me think that this game will eventually slow to a halt and become dead. I could be wrong but they need to be alot more productive. I would like to leave the game in my library and wait and see but too many Early Access games are sitting dead in my library for me to trust it.  So i have no choice to return this game and spend my money elsewhere. HOWEVER, I will repurchase this game if the devs could make some major strides in this game. Pros: Graphics, enviornment, that Dark Souls feel and combat, the Shard spell system (one of my fav aspects) and how i dont feel like im a train on the tracks with story line. No class or weapon restrictionsCons: No quest log, no tutorial, no journal to even remind a player where they have been or gone, the silent combat where i dont hear my swords slashing or even hitting with my shield. For time its been out there isn't enough material for me to feel comfortable that it will last or even go into beta. Also the issue of save wipes and such also bugs me whenever devs do that but thats my own peeve i do realize as a beta/alpha tester that this is something that is common in the evolution of the game.I leave this game with a positive review that could change just because i realize the vision and potential but dont feel comfortable investing into this game time or cash wise			"

								What I love about this game is the realism and attention to detail that it has. I love that what you do is what you get better at. The loot is very fun, and makes the game more exciting. I watch my library for updates to see what new fun is in store for me.			"

								As of this writing, The Memory of Eldurim is in early access, so the issues I have with it will probably be taken care of by the games actual release. With that in mind, it's not worth purchasing right now. The foundation is there, but it definitely needs a lot of work before it's actually worth spending money on. The combat has a familiar stamina system. It operates very much in the same was as Demons/Dark Souls, with one stamina bar thats used for both attacking and blocking. It's neither good or bad, it's just a point. The wieght of weapon swings feel off, though. Swinging something like a simple sword is just as slow and cumbersome as swinging a claymore. While this may be great for people who like big heavy weapons, it defeats the purpose of using a smaller, one handed weapon. The only upside to one handed weapons is the ability to carry a shield in the off hand, but the blocking also leaves quite a bit to be desired. Actually raising your sheild to block takes an embarrassingly long time, which is absolutely unforgiving early on when you come across the occasional monster that can't be interrupted. Furthermore, even if you do manage to raise your sheild in time, they hardly block enough damage to make the effort worth it. Instead, I found it was often a better choice to just dodge, even though it eats up a suprising amount of stamina to do so.  Back on the offensive side, the weapons feel appropriately powered, but the hit detection is all over the place. It doesn't take a whole lot of damage for anyone, player included, to fall, so it's a definite problem when one in three blows actually land, despite standing directly in front of your target. The game world is well crafted and beautiful, but it feels very empty. Right now it's pretty routine to find buildings that you can enter with absolutely nothing inside them. There also isn't quite a lot of story yet so there isn't a lot to draw someone. Again, these aren't really issues so much as just something to acknowledge. These things will surely be fleshed out with the actual release.As it is, there is just enough here to jump in, explore and hack down some enemies while gaining loot. The loot is satisfying, but it's still not enough to make up for the poor combat system. There's no mistaking this for a fully fledged product, but the foundation is decent. I'll definitely be coming back to check it out again once the issues are addressed, but I couldn't recommend spending money on it in its current state.			"

								This is a great game.  While playing it I get the feeling I am playing an Elder Scrolls game in terms of moving around and following directions.  The combat system is different when other computer games.  Though the leveling of the system reminds me of Final Fantasy II, a game that I had a lot of fun playing. The graphics look great on my laptop.  I always look forward to updates because I like to find the new items and areas to explore.  So I highly recommend getting this game. I have recently got a new computer and the whole game has improved for me.  When I installed Fallout 4 it plays in Ultra graphics this incredible game play's in High graphics.  As I have said this game is great.  I enjoy it a lot, I do like that the game has a mix of difficult and easy enemies.			"

Combat is a little trickier than I like but it is also refreshing that you can't just blow through everything and you need to be a bit more cautious while advancing through the game. Magic system seems interesting and I look forward to playing through updates especially ones that make interaction with NPCs a little more intuitive.			"

								The developer sent us a code for this game so I was expecting something terrible! Tbf, it isn't bad. The graphics look great! The world looks beautiful and the idea for an open world questing game, with no real STORY just go and explore is a good idea. Unfortunately, since it is in early access the game has it's problems. The animations are pretty janky and there's no quest log which is a bit of bummer. BUT if the developer sticks to it I'm sure the game will come along nicely. Here's our video:

								Good start, mechanics felt like the witcher 3 in terms of combat, but a bit more clunky and much more bare bones. The controls are a bit clunky as well. I liked my time with it, then I got stuck after falling off a ledge, so guess I'll end my current playtime here until the game gets more updates.The RPG systems seem to be in their infancy, only gear and a neat magic system seem to be available at the moment. The quests a bit meh, the writing could definitely be more concise and precise in what the characters want you to do instead of just implying it. Also greatswords sell for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, so pick them up whenever possible. Also the only town that seems to have had much thought put into it is the first one, the one I found beyond the stone bridge was basically just houses and squashes and that's about it.Wouldn't buy at this point in time, it's not worth the money, imo. However maybe 6 months or a year down the line I think this game could really be something to see. It has a hell of a lot of potential, and I just hope the devs don't squander this potential. Will change this review to recommend when I feel I can justify the price of the game, until then it's probably not worth the purchase unless you want to get in on the ground floor for whatever reason.

Early Access Review
								i want to love this game but i dont.  right now i dont think its worth the 20 dolars they are asking for it. The games potential is out of this world but as of now falls flat of anything other than amazing graphics and an atmospheric walking simulator with a decent amount of people to kill. if its on sale for half off id reccomend it or if you can find it on a sale site like listia or something of the sorts for cheap.pro or con depending on your view- when using your doge/roll (press ctrl) you can climb anything you please. forget about countless hours jumping at cliffs dodge roll and fly right up them. i found this out when i accidently fell of the side of a cliff and got stuck in a hole in the mountain and dogeed and flew right out and climbed all the way to the top.- no mana you have ikhor that fills as you use magic, use too much you die.- no oxygen while swimming, your part fish!- nostalgic quest system, you have to use every dialog option with every character and take there slight hints to go to a mountain with a statue near a water fall, and find what it is they were after.- some dialog errors, missing endings to words or just off wording- boss rewards dont feel balanced to the challenge of the boss. it takes so long to find them and they are decently challenging and you dont get much in return.- i adventure a lot, also used the roll trick a lot, and found some really intersting hidden places, that had enemies and chest, but lacked any actual reward or reason. one lead onto the 3 tier aquafere and it just leads to a dead end, but droping down to the first tier i found a single chest with nothing but basic, white, gear.- ive picked up a lot of items with the trait to do 0 (zero) fore damage over x amount of seconds. ive never tried any of them to see if it was a text error or not.- tons of buildings to find and explore but they are all entirely empty with no purpose.- You take no damage fromn fires in towns and camps. stand in there and get warm all you please no damage will comme to you.PROS- the graphics are mind blowing. the world is beautiful and its extreamly atmospheric and it really draws me into the world.- surplus of enemies almost any where you go and theyre all unique, its not just draugger after draugger. - relaxing atmospheric music and sounds.- the animations for movement, swimming (when it works), fighting and all that are crisp clean and beautiful.- decent amount of armor and weapon styles. and an endless supply anytime you die enemies respawn and you dont lose your inventory. stock up go to the store and sell it and load up on cash, you cant really buy anything besides for what the one shop ive found holds, with a very limited stock but hey it cant hurt right?- unique and intruiging magic system. you find stones that make you able to use different elemental spells that you equip to your wrist, your still allowed to have your weapons equipped as well.- simple easy to figure out ui.CONS-sprinting while dual weilding weapons, the iron swords for me, causes them to clash and cause a dust animation and an irritatting and annoying clashing sound while sprinting. its made me avoid spriniting or mute my game to avoid this.- leveling system doesnt work or takes a lot to level it shows attributes you can increase but as much as i have played i havent leveled anything up yet and there is no obvous experience gain showable any where.- the swimming mechanics are terrible. you practically fall to the bottom of the map and keep popping back up to the surface randomly. ( sometimes it works beautifully.)- when you press your b key it uhh... makes everything vanish besides the ground and the npcs? until you move or do anything other than look around.the game could without a doubt surpass skyrim there is a thrall of different enemies that i have already found but the lack of direction, story, progress, and quests is a bummer to me. i have enjoyed exploring but that only keeps my attention for so long with out a purpose.the success of this game is eminent if the devs keep up with the game and fix these issue. im only going to reccomend the game because of the potential and that it is playable and decently stable.

								I was gifted this game because I made the mistake of putting it on my wishlist. The game is unplayable at this state (and I know it is early acces so shut up you people out there). Sure you can swing your sword back and forth but that isnt what I really came for. I wanted a story to get emeresed in and learn of a new culture and history I would have never been exposed to before. To mention also the full combat system isnt quite done, it LOOKS like they spent most of their time on graphics and not gameplay (default set to untra high). It wasnt much fun to play with a little lazor and not much else to do or go on... It has great potential but with no tutorial or much of any story I recomend you wait until the game is actualy finished. ALSO TO NOTE BUGS!!Woke up on the wrong side of bed and fell out of the freaking map world. Good Game *(claps), good game.I attacked a guard out of bordom and I got knocked into a tree and spazzed the hell out. Im sure my arm reached the top of the castle.			"

								The only thing good about this game is the graphics, they're REALLY nice.  Other than that the game isn't worth playing yet.  the combat is very basic and repetitive with overly simple animations that do nothing to make combat exciting.  Also very basic sound effects.   Add in the no tutorial of any kind and a very slow mouse/turning speed that can't be adjusted in settings and this game feels like it still has a very, very long ways to go before it's worth the $20 they are asking.

								I've had this game going on 4 months' now.. I guess the developers decided they got enough money from the people that wanted to assist them with the stupid game. Graphics are awesome. Everything else about The Memory of Eldurim is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Don't waste your time, or your money. Borrow it form a friendly site for a demo if you want to test it out.			"

DO NOT BUY THIS... THING!There's a lesson to be learned when 18,99€ is asked for a pre-alpha Early Access game that is buggy, broken, incomplete and bland, and that's hardly been updated since it's release seven months ago.I walked straight into their trap those seven months ago and I really wonder why...  :I			"

								This is one of those games that is and never will be finished. Basically, a couple of lazy programmers (if you can even call them that) took the Crysis engine and made the most rudimentary RPG you could ever imagine....there is ONE town. You start in this town...there is NO voice acting, there are no actual items to speak of. There doesn't seem to be any sort of skill tree or leveling system, (at least not that I could find). It's basically a rip off of the Crysis engine and beyond that, a VERY pre-alpha version of a generic role playing game. If you enjoy running around a Cryis-like environment, killing a few monsters with the most crude combat system known to man and generally doing NOTHING else, this game is for you. It's original release price was 35 dollars...this game isn't even worth trying for free. Avoid it at all costs. It is definitely NOT worth 19 dollars. Mind you this game has been out for about 2 years...and they have not done ONE update to it...this game is a pure money making scheme, and nothing more. The developers should be ashamed of themselves.Edit: Oct 28th. One of the developers claims they update this game weekly...but there hasn't been one update in months. Be VERY weary of this so called game. Unless they offer it for a dollar or less...do not bother.			"

								Horrible! Doesn't work! Essentially unplayable. Only after they get your money and download the game does the box pop up saying that the game is in alpha testing or something and please give comments to help them out. So you pay for the privaledge of working for them.			"

								Update: 6/1/2016Game has received small updates, but nothing major.I was excited for this game, but at it's current rate, it'll be out in 2020. See you then.--------------------Fantasy RPG's are my FAVORITE kind of game, I go all out with them. Skyrim, Kingdoms of Amalur, etc. Tbh I generally pirate before I buy, so my hundreds of hours in KoA/Skyrim aren't recorded on Steam. However, with this being one of the only (if not THE ONLY) 3D open world fantasy RPG in Early Access, I decided to give it a shot.You start out in this little shack, you've been washed ashore from battle and are miracously alive. (Kind of cliche, but whatever) The magic system for the game consists of shards, you can hold 2 shards (one in each hand) and these shards give different abilities. You can use these abilities along side your melee combat abilities.As of this review there are the following things in the game...- 3 Bosses- Several Quests- 2 medium sized ""maps"".Now I rank early access games based on how early I feel they are in their development cycle.- Pre-Planning ( This means the game has no direction and they should have figured it out before development  )- Early Development ( The idea is set for most of the game, they are working out details and framework )- Tech Alpha ( Not many bugs, features, or really anything. Just a showcase of what the game could be. )- Alpha ( Many features have been implemented, but still lack depth and are very early )- Closed Beta ( The game is about 70-80% there, but mostly working out bugs )- Open Beta ( Stress testing, bugs, etc. )On this scale I rank this game as in the Tech Alpha stage.So why a tech alpha?There's enough here to classify this game as an early demo, but not really a game. Once you've bashed your head against the deathblood (the first boss),  you'll move on to a single side quest. Once you complete that, you'll go to the valarian camp, aggro the second boss, but since he's too hard and you can't obtain gear ANYWHERE else to beat him except off him. You'll either use some sort of exploit or glitch to beat him and get his gear. Once you've done that, you'll move on to the tree boss. (Who is much much easier than the other 2 bosses in the game.) Where you'll get, basically, a free legendary sword for knowing how to dodge.Then that's it, that's the game. It's fun while it lasts.Pros:The game is developed enough to find out whether you would enjoy something like this or not.Showcases possibilities correctly.Some unique features have already been implemented to show the thought process of the development team.I'll list cons and go into detail why these are currently cons.Cons:Animations and clunky combat. Viewing Distance.Armor/Spell BalanceIn melee combat you have three defensive options. Block, Parry, and Dodge. All of these use a resource called ""Stamina"", this resource is also used when you swing your weapon. Due to the input lag and animation time, parry is basically  useless. Blocking is difficult unless you already have the key pressed down seconds before the attack. YOU CANNOT BLOCK IN BETWEEN ENEMY ATTACKS, IT WILL FAIL THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME. What really irritates me about this is it doesn't matter how fast YOU are, your character will still be very slow in reacting. At first I thought this was because I didn't have a certain stat or skill up, but that's just the way it is right now. The majority of your time in combat won't be actually fighting, it will be dodging/kiting/blocking. Even if you have the absolute best weapon and armors in the game. Combat feels clunky in the respect that you can't try to defend yourself mid combat, you have to back out and get ready to strike again. (Dodge back, strike, dodge back, strike, dodge back, strike, dodge back, strike, etc.) Spells such as tremor which knock the enemy back, animation lock you for so long by the time you get out of the lock, the enemy is already attacking you again.Viewing distance. Grass and other objects don't render until you get REALLY REALLY close to them. Right now, there's no option to change this. Things ""popping"" into existance constantly tends to give me a bad headache, which excludes me from playing this game for lengthy periods of time. Those of you that played Kingdoms of Amalur will recognize this popping, except in TME, it's 10x worse.Armor/Spell balance, right now spells don't really rank up with you or have different shards. So the healing spells you start out with, will no longer be useful an hour down the line. You'll be forced to use potions, find food, or wait constantly for your health to regenerate. After lengthy periods of playing, since nothing respawns until you die or logout, it can get frustrating. The item set in the game right now is limited, which means the bandits you fought in the starting zone drop the same gear as the bandits in the second map, even though they're 10x harder.""So... It sounds like you're pretty negative about the game, why the recommendation?""The game is going in the right direction, the developers are active, and they've displayed enough here to say.. ""Hey, we won't waste your money."" Maybe this isn't something you may enjoy in it's current state, but if you enjoyed any of the Elder Scrolls games or Kingdoms of Amalur, this is something you'll enjoy when it's in a more complete state. However, to get to that complete state, the developers need funding. That's primarily the reason for my recommendation, I had a lot of fun with the games current content,  but it falls short. With more content and funding, it can be a great game.			"

								Has lots of potential and one of the most beautiful worlds I have ever seen. A good example for an early acess game. Of course there are some negative aspects like the looting system (in every chest I found only a leather armor) or the loot in general (there are only few weapons, items etc). But these are fixable problems and I am sure that these problems will be resolved in sooner updates. And last but not least (if you didn`t notice it)- THE GRAPHICS ARE FANTASTIC!!!			"

This game has gone nowhere since its release, and its trajectory isn't going to change anytime soon. This is the worst thing that can happen in an Early Access game. Don't support it.			"
