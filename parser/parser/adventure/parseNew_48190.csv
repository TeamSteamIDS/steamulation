 Disclaimer: I would like to thank the random kind stranger who has given me this game as a gift.  Plot  -Before you play this game, I highly suggest that you play Assassin's Creed 2 first. As this game will start off exactly where the previous game has ended. I honestly felt that the story was short, you can easily sense that it is about to end soon. Compared to Assassin's Creed II, wherein I've poured atleast 26 hours of gameplay to finish the whole story and that includes some puzzles and some few side quests, it only took me atleast 18 hours to finish Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. I'll admit that I've done more puzzles and side quests on the previous game than this one, but I think the difference from 26 hours and 18 is just too big. But given those comparisons, this game still has a story worth playing. And it is an essential part of Ezio's story rc, which is great if not one of the best storylines this franchise has. Environment and Design  - The game takes place on Italy, featuring its greatest city, Rome. It showcases some of the famous landmarks like  The Colosseum ,  Pantheon , and many more. And these aren't just for a show off, you have the option to purchase this landmarks to increase your income. Because of the extensive land size this game offers, parkouring over the roofs may not be enough to roam the whole city on your own. Hence, they introduced horse for you to ride on and help you get to places faster. But to make travelling more faster, there are underground tunnels that would take you to different parts of the map instantly.I have mentioned earlier that the town feels more lively, and it is also because of the townspeople. There are more happenings around you, more idle animations and no more  just walking  people. And this may seem a small detail, but sometimes even the smallest detail can make a game better. Gameplay  - The game may be short, but the side ques and activities is what made this game the way it is. Given its land size, there are alot of areas to conquer to increase the size of your brotherhood. And you may call this recruits during fights to help you assassinate the guards in the area. Or you can send them to different missions for them to earn experience and some gold for yourself. In terms of combat, everything in this game has been improved, from hand to hand combat to picking off enemies silently. You can now chain kills when using either a sword or a small weapon when timed correctly. Not only this but you may also combine the use of this with long range weapons, you can now use the Hidden Gun while using a sword or use small weapons together with your throwing knives. As for the stealth, new long range weapons have been like the Poison Darts, which has the same effect of a Poison Blade but for long ranges. And the use of a Crossbow, which is basically a stealth version of a Hidden Gun, preventing the guards to be alerted when fired.As for the parkour itself, everything seems just the same as to the previous game. But the most downside for me is when they implemented the synchronization. Its a side goal that they give you in each mission, normally everything is doable and reasonable. But what make its annoying is when it prevents you to be ceative of your own kills, because a failure to do so on the given side goal would only result a half synchronization. And it doesn't stop there, for me, the most annoying side goal is when you're in a dungeon full of obstacle course and puzzles, and they will give you a time limit. That is very frustrating, as if the game doesn't want you to explore the whole area to gather chests hidden somewhere. And a true gamer always want to get lost when exploring an area. Controls  -The game still punishes you if you're a little bit hasty and wants to do things on a fast pace. As usual, I ended up falling alot of times again due to rushing the obstacle courses. I've also lost alot of side goals due to being impatient. But thank god they finally fixed the UI for controls shown on the top right. Instead of the weird icons, that I have no idea what key they represent, they now show the representing key. It maybe too late due to my experience to the previous, it is still a nice touch. Conclusion  - Finish Assassin's Creed II first before touching this game and you'll appreciate how the story continues. The game may feel more focused on other activites than the main story but its still a game worth playing. Everything from the previous game is well improved.Since this game requires Uplay in order to be played, I suggest that you turn off the cloud synchronization as it may result your save file to be corrupted on accidental shutdowns.Thank you for your time reading this review that I made. And I would highly appreciate it if you can rate it to your liking. Below are the links for my other reviews that would complete this story arc.Assassin's Creed II - ReviewAssassin's Creed: Revelations - Review "

AC Brotherhood: more isn't always betterAssassin's Creed: Brotherhood is only the third game in the Assassin's Creed series I've yet played: I keep to the order in which the games were initially released. Ubisoft got this game, the second one featuring Ezio Auditore as the protagonist, out in March 2011, three and a halve years ago. Having played it relatively soon after the original Assassin's Creed II, I feel it natural to compare the two games to each other. This makes even more sense since the story of AC II really coninues in Brotherhood: not only do the same characters appear in both games, chronologically too they follow nicely upon each other.Brotherhood starts off splendidly, with a recapture of the final sequences of AC II which flows naturally into the new twists which the well-known story of the struggle between Assassins and Templars about world-changing artefacts takes. After the initial (short) part of the game that functions as a tutorial, I was taken straight into the city where almost all of the action takes place: Rome. The fact that there is only one major city here, compared to the two (Firenze and Venice) and the countryside of the original game, makes for a huge difference. Rome of around 1500 comes to live in Brotherhood in the most fantastic imaginable way. First of all, the map is HUGE: there are 12 districts (including the Vatican and some outer area's which have a rural sense about them), and running from one side of the city to the other would cost you at least ten-fifteen minutes (happily, horses are allowed in the city and there is a well-thought-off fast-travel system). Secondly, the development team has obviously taken the utmost care in analyzing how Rome anno 1500 looked like - and that's really quite different from modern-day Rome. During the first ten (!!) hours or so in-game, I mostly just walked around, discovering the city, marvelling at all the details in the buildings and eagerly reading the information provided for almost every single church, Roman building or other landmark. During my entire playthrough, I felt like being a tourist catapulted 500 years back to a place I love so much. That's quite some accomplishment, and I would even go so far as to call Rome the main character of the game, not Ezio.That's not only because of the painstaking detail with which the ""Cità Eterna"" is being depicted, but it's also due to some problems with the concept of the game. Not only is the world almost entirely accessible from the start of the game, the number of side-missions is daunting, certainly compared to the main-story missions. Since I am a curious gamer, I tried some of these, than more of those missions, mixing it all up with the main storyline. Wrong! Almost every mission gives even more options afterwards, unlocking new factions or side-story lines, and they are of course all indicated on a over-cluttered map (which I had to zoom in really close to be able to read every sign on it). After a further ten hours or so into the game, I started feeling overwhelmed: there was SO much to do, to explore, to try, and it could all be done at my own initiative. Now this open-world concept may appeal to many gamers, but I like more of a narrative element, or at least a good backbone of a main story. And this exactly where Brotherhood tends to falter at times. Only by following the main story mission after mission (which I started doing after quite some time), did I refind the feeling of actually being Ezio Auditore, a feeling that had been so strong in AC II. Once I really plunged into it, the main storyline proved to be quite good, though not so compelling as the one in the previous game, and certainly much shorter (although this is more than made up for the number of side-missions and -excursions).In all other departments than the identification with Ezio and the overdose of side-activities, Brotherhood does shine, just as I had hoped for. The walking/climbing/jumping and whatever more of Ezio is so fluent, that I actually felt becoming ""good"" at it, but as with the other AC games, using an Xbox 360 controller really is a must. Combat has been greatly improved upon alreay in AC II, and this game even adds more possibilities, all very natural. The biggest change is the addition of the Brotherhood: a group of Assassin's I could train by giving them missions abroad, and whose help I could call for when needed. Graphically, the game still is a gem, also after a couple of years. Only musically things could have been better: the music could have used a bit more variety.All things put together, Brotherhood is a worthy successor to AC II, but it is flawed by trying to do too much, and all of that at once. It's not on the same steallr height as its predecessor, but it's still a very, very good game. Buy it if you tried and liked AC I and/or II, but I wouldn't recommend it as a first dive into the realm of the Assassins.Gameplay: 24/30 (would have been higher with a tighter storyline)Graphics: 18/20Sound: 7/10Technical: 8/10 (I don't like Uplay as an extra ""shell"", but that's just how it is, and otherwise it's very stable)Longelivety: 9/10 (there is some MP which is mostly out of use, but SP alone gives you dozens of hours of gameplay)Steam-integration: 5/10 (as with almost all other Ubisoft titles: they try to promote Uplay...)Personal appreciation: 9/10Overall: 80/100			"

												AC Brotherhood is so much like its predecessor, AC II. It continues the story of Ezio Auditore and offers a fewer minor, but noticable improvements over the previous title. The most obvious improvement is the ability to recruit a band of assassin's and deploy them on various missions throughout Europe or even assist during actual gameplay. There are also a plethora of new weapons, paintings, armor, investments, and various Leonardo da Vinci gadgets that continue to make this a fun series to play. I also noticed I didn't find myself cursing at the combat system like the previous titles so they had to make some improvements in that regard as well.The main story takes place in Rome and while it is a much bigger city, the story seemed to be quite a bit shorter than the prior two games (for me) and this one left an obvious wide opening for the next game in the series. There did seem to be a larger variety of side missions though. Graphics and voice acting are top notch as usual.While I've been a little slow at playing the more recent AC titles, the first three Assassin's Creed titles have been an enjoyable series thus far.

★★★★★ ACB★★★☆☆ AC1 was rough around the edges, both story and gameplay wise, barely tolerable, but this was acceptable, because it birthed multiple new genres (open world parkour, counter based combat, and map towers) and iconic new concepts (hidden blades, white hoods, and bales of hay).  An engine with ultra realistic climbing and combat animations.★★★★☆ AC2 fixed every problem with the original, while at the same time making huge new additions to the series.  Ezio, currency, equipment, upgradable village, sidequests and more.  ★★★★★ ACB fine tuned things even further, and added yet more content and features.  It was impressive, the pinnacle of the series, before AC lost it's writer and then transitioned to a new engine; 1shot1kill meaningful combat, dual hidden blades as a combat weapon, upgrade the entire world now, build a brotherhood, unlock guild perks, unlock gadgets with leo, perfect openworld replayability with rewardingly sensible bonus mission objectives, tons of little touches like free jumping or poking out your hidden blades for vanity, and much more.  This game also added unique cat/mouse multiplayer, though I didn't much care for it.  * AC2 is quite possibly the only sequel in gaming history of legitimate value, aside from maybe the Final Fantasy series, which hardly qualify as sequels.  This wasn't just a L4D2 adding 4 new maps and 4 new survivors,  or an RE4/5 where the entire game was changed, or Dead Risings offering a new mall, or Farcry 3 and 4 being practically identical games, and lets not even get into CoD; it was an improvement and expansion of every idea in the game.  Even Arkham City, which is a 5star game and grand improvement over Asylum, could have been treated as a simple open world expansion on the original.  Most sequels are more like DLC, and most actual DLC is a total ripoff.  ACB, while an improvement, could have been an expansion for AC2, and the games only go downhill after that.★★☆☆☆ ACR removed many features, added nothing meaningful, and had a blatant change in writers.  Not only had the tone and setting changed for the worse, but the previous games were practically ignored, even though ACB ended on multiple cliff hangers. ★★☆☆☆ AC3 moved to a new engine, while it was graphically superior, the gameplay became floaty and overly simplified, with practically none of the depthy features that made AC good, and climbing animations that looked as if they were captured by Twilight's laughable wire team.  The writing was also poor, with a seemingly motivationalless, unlikable, unrelatable, bipolar main character.  The ship combat, however, was amazing here, probably the best ship combat ever put into a video game, sadly only treated as a minigame.★★★☆☆ AC4; PIE RATS.  The story is a bit better here, the engine is a bit better here, the ship combat is a bit worse, but more integrated.  Overall an OK game.  ????? ACRogue; Missed this one, heard it was the best of the newer ones????? ACU; Skipped this one, can't comment, heard it was terrible.★★☆☆☆ ACS; Still using a floaty engine, this time with poor performance, combat has been reduced to mindless stat based button mashing, parkour has practially been removed as you can simply zipline around the world.  I don't like the setting either, and the story wasn't good enough to keep me interested.  This isn't even AC anymore.* Controller required, which is why I owned most of them on PS3 instead of Steam "

												Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is an action-adventure stealth game with open world environment from Ubisoft. Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is a sequel to the previous game Assassin's Creed 2.Desmond is on the run again. This time, Desmond, Lucy, Rebecca and Shaun visit the ruined Auditore villa on Monteriggioni and make it as their new hiding place. Desmond has learn much from Ezio, but he still need to uncover more information from Ezio, so there he goes again, and again, to the Animus.Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood gameplay is pretty much the same with Assassin's Creed 2, but is now focused on the city of Roma, where Ezio battle his way to eliminate Cesare Borgia and liberate Roma in the process. Ezio needs to liberate each sector in the city of Roma by destroying the Borgia towers. Doing so will free the sector and let Ezio rebuild the sector, such as reopening blacksmith shops, doctor shops or banks, gaining income in the process. The game also let Ezio to recruit Assassins by helping troubled civilians who can then help him to fight guards or kill his mission target. Recruited Assassins can gain experience as they are being called by Ezio or by completing contracts. Also, for the first time in Assassin's Creed franchise, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood feature multiplayer game.The graphics of the game still pretty much the same too. There may be some slight improvements but we won't notice it somehow. At least there is no downgrade.Overall, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood has taken the next step in Assassin's Creed franchise by introducing recruitable Assassins, while retaining the open world feature. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

												Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood continues right where Assassin's Creed II finished, so if you haven't played Assassin's Creed II I'd highly recommend playing that game first. Not only was it a good game, but it's almost essential at this point to play it so you can understand the story. This may not seem important, but for me the story is the most intriguing element to the entire franchise.The gameplay continues to improve game-on-game, but it's pretty much the same mechanic we've seen since the first Assassin's Creed game. Sure they've removed the terribly rigid design to the missions where you MUST scale this tower before you can do anything else, and I'm personally grateful they did this. However, overall the gameplay isn't that amazing. It's fun, sure, but at the same time it's played it's course now. Don't get me wrong, you can still scale the towers to remove the fog of war, but now it's optional.In fact it works well within what is slowly becoming a very sandbox style world, and this is another area of the game I'm starting to enjoy with each Assassin's Creed game. Ubisoft seem to be aware of what people enjoyed from Assassin's Creed II and disliked from Assassin's Creed and have done a good job of doing more of the same, and removing the offending elements of gameplay.Gone are the insane amount of collectibles, and instead we have more Tombs/Lairs to explore, Glyphs to discover and solve and an entire city to manage. While these elements aren't essential to complete the game, and at times they don't seem to to do much to the story at all (and I personally found the city management side of the game to be over before it begun), it's nice to see that there are options there for people who wish to slow things down and invest into the Assassin's Creed world. It's not all roses though, there are a few elements to Brotherhood that confused me. I'm hooked into the story, I want to know more, I want it to expand and progress, and sadly Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood never truly felt like it got going. It felt that it was one long prelude into Assassin's Creed: Revelations, with most of the Memory Segments feeling more like tutorials for the new gameplay mechanics or refreshing into franchise staple gameplay mechanics (most of which any Assassin's Creed fan would hopefully already be aware of). It's a minor fault, and if anything it's something of a Ubisoft Trademark to have excessive gameplay hints/tips/tutorials throughout the game.It doesn't really distract from the game, but it does slow down the buzz and adrenaline that has built up after the huge climax to Assassin's Creed II. Now that I've finished the game, I'm not too concerned about the lull as I can fool myself enough to believe it was perhaps intentional pacing to bring you backdown to build you back up for Brotherhood's ending (which was decent). Yet, I'm still left feeling 'what really happened' during Ezio's memory segments. I know who the main target was within the story, but you have so little interaction with them directly that you don't really focus on them (unlike in Assassin's Creed II where The Spaniard is referenced and featured in most segments). Sadly there is one element to the game that is lagging behind Assassin's Creed II and that's the soundtrack. I was convinced it was a new composer as it just felt alien compared to the previous work of Jasper Kydd. I just couldn't connect to it. Also, once again the character modles have changed ever so slightly but strangely noticably. A minor point of annoyance. Overall Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is a fun game, and somewhat fast paced (almost to the point where it feels like it's over before it even begun). If you're hooked into the series by this point I'd recommend buying Brotherhood as it continues the story in an easy fun game. If you didn't really enjoy Assassin's Creed II, I think it's best you bow out of the series now and leave Brotherhood, as it's more of the same.The characters are slowly developing, and the plot is thickening. I also know that some people don't enjoy the 'future tech' side of the game, namely the areas outside of Ezio (such as being Desmond and the whole Animus side of world). I personally enjoy the mix of history and Sci-Fi within the game, so I don't find this to be a problem; however for those who do find it a problem there is a somewhat large/significant portion of Brotherhood that centres around the 'adventures of Desmond', so again it might be best to avoid Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

												Assassin's Creed Brotherhood offers modest but welcome improvements over the previous entry in the series, Assassin's Creed II. Graphically, it's very similar. I did notice a new day/night lighting cycle, and greater variety in character models around the city.However, the gameplay has been tuned significantly. I found the free-running much smoother in this game; I spent less time jumping accidentally against walls that I didn't mean to climb. Brotherhood seems to know where I want to go much better than AC2 did.But mechanics aside, it's the new mission structure that really impressed me. Brotherhood takes a lesson from the Grand Theft Auto series -- the city of Rome is huge, and there's always something nearby that you can get involved with. The major missions come more naturally; you don't feel funneled towards them in Brotherhood like you do in AC2. You can take them on early, or muck around in the city for a long while before addressing the major story.And - the story. The Assassin's Creed storyline is still wonderful, and improves in Brotherhood. The cut scenes are well-balanced so they don't dominate gameplay. The body models are expressive and evocative, and the voice acting is excellent. I find that I really care about these characters and what's happening in the story. Also, Brotherhood really improves Desmond's meta-story. Last comment - Assassin's Creed has the best cities in video games, hands down. Brotherhood takes place almost exclusively in Rome during the renaissance. The city and nearby countryside is massive! But the attention to detail is remarkable. You see different NPC character models in different parts of the city, and they change between night and day. People mill about in a realistic fashion; some have places to be, others chat in the shade. The ambient noise is fantastic. And never a loading screen as you move about.So... Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is over 4 years old as I write this, so I doubt I'll convince anyone to play it who hasn't already. But it looks great, plays great on PC with a controller, and really delivers a satisfying experience. It's definitely worth your time. "

												Brotherhood picks up where Assassin's Creed II left off, with late-fifteenth-century master assassin Ezio having just defeated a sickeningly corrupt pope. He returns home safely, but is inexplicably surprised the next day when the pope's son interrupts his awkwardly animated sex scene with an army.After a tedious segment outside of the Animus, Ezio travels to Rome to dislodge the tyrannical establishment. It's here that the open-world game starts for real, and the plot congeals.As in AC2, the story progresses through a series of Ezio's memories. The missions are varied sequences of stealth, combat, and story-driving dialog, and even the seemingly garden-variety escort missions are well done.The free-running and combat do take effort to master.The more I played, though, the more impressive my acrobatics became.As fans of open-world games would expect, a lot of the player's time will be occupied with missions and activities that don't necessarily advance the plot. It's easy to get sidetracked for hours finding treasure chests, taking on assassination contracts, doing missions for the various guilds or trying to level up your relationship with them, exploring the world or climbing landmarks like the Coliseum.Leonardo da Vinci is back as an ally too, and once again provides weapons for Ezio. Turns out he's also been pressured into creating war machines for Cesare, so it's up to Ezio to destroy the plans and prototypes. There are three major changes that try to switch things up: the assassins' guild, the tweaks to combat and the ability to ride your horse anywhere. Recruiting assassins who can be called upon with the press of a button is obviously the big one, and it works very much as advertised.It's also worth mentioning that looting dead guards' bodies now yields far more valuable items than it did in ACII. You can top up on smoke bombs, crossbow bolts, poison, bullets and medicine with relative ease.Perhaps the biggest surprise of the Brotherhood package is the multiplayer, which is refreshing and inventive.Multiplayer matches are simple but challenging stealth manhunts, either as lone-wolf assassins or teams of killers.Overshadowing even that, Brotherhood's biggest improvement is that it requires only one-time activation, as opposed to AC2's “always-online” DRM. The game itself isn't notably superior, especially in terms of story, but all of its additions put it on par with the last, and it's a hugely entertaining sequel.Overall 9/10.			"

Introduction:If you are a fan of Assassin’s Creed II, you are going to absolutely love this gem! If you have not played Assassin’s Creed II, I highly recommend that you start there, as Brotherhood and Revelations are direct continuations of Ubisoft’s 2009 predecessor. While Brotherhood is a sequel of a sequel, it continues to bring multiple quality elements to the table. This game is, without a doubt, my personal favourite in the series. Like the original installment, Brotherhood is an atmospheric historical fiction action-adventure sandbox. One that you will not be disappointed in.As a general warning, you should not read this section if you have not yet cleared the predecessors, and have the intention of doing so. There are minor spoilers ahead, for those of you who have not cleared the first or second installments of Assassin’s Creed.Story: Brotherhood follows Assassin’s Creed II nicely, and cleanly picks up where the last left off. Desmond flees the scene of the latest Templar attack, and follows his team to Monteriggioni: their new hideout. Desperate to locate the Apple of Eden, in hopes of preventing a global disaster that had been predicted to happen later on in the year, Desmond rushes back into his genetic memory. For Ezio, it is 1499, and he still cannot explain what he had seen inside the vault. Unfortunately, he is not given much time to mull it over before the actions of the Templars push him back into action. He spends most of the game struggling to cripple the Borgia influence in the capital, and then begins the process of training other Assassin’s to aid him.Gameplay: Allow me to start off this section of the review by stating that Brotherhood is a huge game, offering more content than Assassin's Creed II. There are a lot of places to explore, both above and below ground. While some players share the mindset that ""more isn't always better"", I am a firm believer that the fans of the beloved assassin Ezio Auditore will have a blast checking out this game... Especially taking into consideration that there is a huge pool of returning characters, including Leonardo DaVinci and Machiavelli. There are a number of recognizable, yet staple mechanics worth mentioning, that have been recycled in Brotherhood: The original (if not improved) free-running system, eagle-vision, hidden messages, looting, buying, and investing. Furthermore, Brotherhood keeps the modernized and improved quest system from its predecessor, which permits Ezio to hire courtesans, thieves or mercenaries.The combat aspects of Brotherhood are mostly recognizable from Assassin's Creed II. You can still cycle through your weapons, and choose whether or not you want to execute a clumbsy public chase, or a stealthy and well-planned kill. Combat aesthetics are gorgeous, and make just about any fight seem brutal and bloody. Like it's predecessor, weapons and armor can be both obtained and repaired at blacksmith shops - Each offering their own selection of kill animations.However, there are also new aspects of combat. For instance, mounted combat is possible. While running through crowds and across rooftops is entirely possible, Brotherhood now offers the option of horseback riding through cities (once the stables have been purchased), permitting the player to jump from a horse, and straight into an assassination. Leonardo DaVinci has a bigger role in this game, along with optional DLC. In fact, he offers stand-alone quests that require Ezio to go after his four war machines in order to lessen the Borgia's military strength. While getting to each of Leonardo's inventions might seem a bit repetitive at times, the objective following locating the machine is always exceptionally diverse. No two missions to destroy Leonardo's inventions are the same.Finally, I  saved the best implementation for last. The Assassin's Guild. Ezio is eventually able to recruit civilians, and train them up by sending them on their own quests, to become assassins. Once they have been obtained, they can be called upon to assist Ezio in combat so long as they are not deployed on a mission. While they are extremely powerful, I thought it was a lot of fun to recruit and train them, and I guarantee that you will likely feel the same.Controls: If I am not mistaken, the controls are entirely identical to the setup in Assassin’s Creed II. You still cannot re-arrange your buttons, though I guarantee that playing with a gamepad will be much more friendly than playing with a mouse and keyboard.Like the previous establishments, Brotherhoods targeting remains a bit on the tricky side. You can’t ever be 100% certain that you will hit your target, but it is something that can still be worked around. However, from time to time you might still end up changing your camera angle, and inadvertently kill a civilian or something, oops!Graphics: Brotherhood offers beautiful graphics that focus heavily on its environment. Virtually every area has been polished to reflect the games atmosphere. I’ve said it a million times before, and I’ll say it again: It is really hard to nit-pick this aspect of the game, because the visuals are so fine-tuned.Sound: Having played II, Brotherhood, and Revelations - It is my firm opinion that Brotherhood offers the best of music and voice tracks. Ubisoft continues to uphold the tradition of combining dramatic scores of music to assassinations, making the experience more enjoyable for the player. Subtitles are still an option, and a huge help when it comes to fully understanding what is being said - I encourage you to use them for your own benefit. As always, the sounds only add to the atmosphere of the game, and in the case of Brotherhood: It is extremely well done.Replay Value: In my own opinion, Brotherhood has the highest replay value in the entire series. It introduces so many miscellaneous objectives, that the game never truly feels boring. While replay value is entirely dependent on the player, I am confident enough to say that any fan of Assassin’s Creed will want to play this one again.			"

												It's been a while since I've revisited a relic of my younger days that used to keep me up late. It's only been 7 years since this game came out. My lack of age is really showing right now, isn't it?Yeah, I'll admit it, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is an old favorite of mine. My first game for my PlayStation 3 was Assassin's Creed and this girl in my class let me borrow every subsequent AC release. I even asked her out. She said no. I'm a lonely man. Anyways, let's review this game!Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood takes place exactly right after Assassin's Creed II, both in Desmond's and Ezio's storyline. Desmond is being hidden in a new location while the Templars keep hunting him and his Assassin gang down, while Ezio realizes the consequences of NOT killing the main villain of the last game and has to fight his much more evil and powerful son.The story in Brotherhood is... alright. There are some highlights here and there like saving ""Jesus"" from being crucified, disguising yourself and your battalion as French soldiers to infiltrate a fort, and especially the final level in Spain are some real stand-outs. But the interweaving drama between these climactic moments is pretty dull. It's like Lifetime entertainment's take on what ""drama"" is. For some reason Claudia hates Ezio and La Volpe randomly doesn't trust Machiavelli. These subplots come out of nowhere and are so easily solved it makes you wonder why they were problems in the first place.While the story isn't A-grade material, what always attracted me to Brotherhood and had me replay it three times (yes, this is my third time playing this bloody game in 7 years), was Rome. This is, in my opinion, one of the best Assassin's Creed sandbox locations in their whole library. If anything even comes close to Rome, I'd say it's the Carribbean Sea from Black Flag, but that's a debate for another time and place. Rome has some real atmosphere to it. Rome feels like a dead city with real culture that's had a new culture come by and forcibly build their own monuments and villages on top of it. The poor live in the ruins of Roman architecture while the wealthy live in their Italian villas within the main city. Rome feels very interconnected and the music that changes whenever you go to different sections of the map gives the sandbox a truly unique flow. This is one of the most alive sandboxes I've ever played in an open world game.Of course, a great sandbox doesn't carry a game. And, unfortunately, this is one of the greater faults of Brotherhood. As a sequel to Assassin's Creed II it doesn't do a whole lot to improve the gameplay as a new installment. You can ride horses inside cities, maintain your own brotherhood, and have a new plethera of gadgets and gizmos at your disposal... but the core gameplay isn't changed that much so the new features feel really tacked on and make the game a f***-ton easier.The new counter system breaks any challenge in combat you could ever have in these games. It ranks weapons in stores like there's a difference between weight, power, and deflection but you can kill the same amount of guards in a fight with just your bare fists because of the counter system. If you kill one guard you can chain kills until everyone lies dead around you. Where's the challenge in that? Where's the fun?The Brotherhood mechanic also takes away a lot of potential fun. You can now train assassins to go across the globe and perform various tasks... that you can't watch. And when they return you can have them kill your targets for you. But, again, where is the fun in that?That being said, the micromanaging you do through Rome by maintaining your Brotherhood, buying out businesses and ruins, and going on various side-quests always managed to latch its talons deep into my brain. There's something about mindlessly running around and performing small tasks to accomplish a greater good that makes me forget about how mundane and terrible my own life is, and then I don't have to worry about the swirling abyss that is my inevitable death and I... oh god... no... NO! NOT AGAIN!*ahem* Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is a precursor of what was to come to this franchise that has been slowly drained by Ubisoft to this day. They keep thinking that ""innovation"" is just ""adding some more sh** on top of the formula"" and it works in this game. Assassin's Creed II was more like the child in the front of the class that took notes and got a fair B for its great effort, while Brotherhood is sitting in the back and just follows its friend's lead by barely scraping away with a C. And that's pretty much was Brotherhood is. Good... but not as good as Assassin's Creed II. A decent experience that has lost its charm and magic it used to have over me as these years have passed. I'm giving Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood a 6/10.			"

												This game is beyond words. I can't describe nor explain the depth it brings to the franchinse. In order to really get a sense of how the game works, you must play it. I bought this game cause I once had a PS3 but had to sell it and I never got the chance to beat it on my PS3. The lairs of Romulus were my favorite! The Da Vinci DLC was beyond anything I have ever played. Every penny I saved up to buy this game was worth it and I highly recommend it to anyone.			"

												It's that time of year again, suiting up in your best hooded outfit, cutting open a pair of black stockings, taping a butter knife to each hand and lurking around the neighborhood looking for Templar's to slay.  Ah, the memories of jumping out at the purse snatcher and jamming the butter knife directly into his ribcage..  The sweat dripping off my bald head, my heart pounding.. my face hitting the ground as I realized I'm not Enzio and the man I just jammed in the stomach is 6'3 and close to 300 pounds.. After a nice nap, I woke up in the hospital.. Not one to feel discouraged, I vowed to get revenge on that over sized Neanderthal.  After all he had knocked out my front tooth.. Enough about that..  It's time to talk about Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, or as I like to call it Assassin's Creed 2.5.  The Story:  Brotherhood picks up the story after the second game.  Enzio returns to Monteriggioni after he successful retrieved the Apple.  He returns to a hero's welcome, and numerous offers of ""ahem"" favors from the local town woman.  Our resident playboy settles for a night with Caterina Sforza.  All is going well for Enzio, he's a hero, he's gotten his revenge, he's got himself a sexy MILF, he's going to live happily ever after...  Since this is a game, we all figured out this wasn't going to happen..  Que the music...   (puts on Hammer Time by MC Hammer)  After some vigorous relations with Caterina Monteriggioni is attacked by a new Atagonist Cesare Borgia.  Needless to say the attack left Mario dead and Monteriggioni in shambles..  Guess a relocation is in order.Left with nothing Enzio is tasked with rebuilding the Assassin Brotherhood, while at the same time getting justice against the Borgia clan and reclaiming the apple once more..  This time around the game takes place in Roma.. better known as Rome, a very large and vibrant city.  You'll meet numerous people in your travels and back yet again is everyone's favorite painter and cheapskate Leonardo Di Vinci,The Gameplay:  If you've played Assassin's Creed 2, you know fully what to expect in Brotherhood, the few additions to take note of..  Money serves a fair larger role in Brotherhood, gone is the building of a city, now you are tasked with rebuilding an entire City-State.  You gain revenue from the various businesses and landmarks that you purchase.  A new feature are the Borgia Towers, which have replaced many of the view points.  You need to kill the Guard Captain, then make your way up the Borgia tower to set it ablaze.  As you take out Borgia towers you reduce the Borgia's power and open up new businesses and landmarks that you can buy.  Another awesome idea is building of the Assassin Brotherhood, you can recruit assassins..  The more Borgia towers you control the more assassins you can own..  I believe the max is 10.  Also this time around various guilds exist which allow you to climb their ranks (although aside from dropping the price to hire the various helpers (courtesans, mercenaries or thieves I didn't notice any other benefits).   You can send your Assassins away on contracts of various difficulties, these earn the assassins experience, and money for you.  Occasionally you'll be rewarded with items as well. The Combat:  Not much has been changed from the second game. The few changes are as follows.. You gain access to a crossbow!!!  A nice ranged weapon which allows you to silently kill enemies from afar.  Unlike the gun which makes noise and attracts attention, the Crossbow is silent and quite deadly.  Unarmed combat includes a few new animations for unarmed kills, such as a curb stomp, and neck breaking.  You can also chain kill this time around, which is very useful for those times when you are surrounded by 8 or 9 enemies, after you execute the first enemy, you can immediately focus and execute another without the need to fight them, repeat this as much as possibly until you need to counter attack.  The biggest change over all is the ability to call your Assassins into combat, or order them to take out guards.  Instead of having to get your hands dirty and risk tipping off the guards, you send in your crew, they clean up the guards then run off..   This is the single biggest game changer about brother hood..  Nothing beats having an army of 7 - 8 buffed up assassins at the ready for any of those large scale battles (although only about 3 - 4 of these battles exist unfortunately)The conclusion... If you enjoyed Assassin's Creed 2, you'll enjoy Brotherhood.  While the game itself feels like a rather large expansion, it has enough meat and potatoes to stand on it's own.  So buy it, enjoy it..

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is a parkour beat'em up adventure game. On the run from Abstergo, Desmond further explores his ancestor Ezio's memory to find where he had hidden the Apple of Eden, bringing him to the Papal Wars when he settled in Rome to rebuild the Assassin Brotherhood and oppose the Templars that controlled the Vatican.Pros: Once again improves on the previous one, introducing new mechanics early and giving a coherent reason for starting from scratch. Replaced multiple medium maps by one large open world: Rome and the surrounding countryside and villages, which you assist in rebuilding by investing in it. Looting enemies now gets you ammunition, more money, and actual loot which can be sold or traded to unlock equipment. The near-future is also more relevant, as Desmond can log out of the Animus and interact more with Lucy and the others. Oh, and another WTF ending!Cons: Rome is a clusterfrak to parkour in: streets zigzag incoherently while rooftops are so uneven it's faster to just run on the floor than climb up and down all the time. The loot you get is mostly clutter you'll sell, only a few of which you'll use to unlock stuff. Graphics didn't see much change at all. The last Ezio chapters are rushed.Verdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!Great sequel to Assassin's Creed II, but it's basically ""more of the same"" with some light improvement and more story. Don't play without playing the previous one first, and if you did like the previous one, you'll love this one, too!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

Pros:- Has everything you would want and expect from an Assassin's Creed game. - Lots of assassination tools at your disposal: medicine, poison, smoke bombs, throwing knives, crossbow bolts, and bullets.Cons:- Really easy game. I could take lots of enemies head on if I wanted to, but I shouldn't be able to because I'm supposed to be a stealthy assassin.- Can't skip the 15min ending credits.			"

												As my personal favorite of the series, Brotherhood perfects and expands upon many of Assassin's Creed 2's features. Riding through town, fast-travel points within the city, kill streaks, brutal new animations and mission-replayability are some of its many improvements, fixing a few negativities I found in the previous game.Instead of just rebuilding his family villa, Ezio is tasked with liberating a Borgia-oppressed Rome and bringing it to its former glory, with the help of not only a few old friends, but of a new Brotherhood as well. Assist citizens in need and watch them rise through your ranks, ultimately shaping Master Assassins to aid you in your quest. The main antagonist is ambitious, vicious and ruthless, stopping at nothing to achieve his goals, which, in turn, make his every appearance exciting.Unlike former entries, Brotherhood offers a wide variety of interesting side quests, such as excellent tombs to explore, advanced war machines to destroy and templar agents to silence, even though they mask the rather short length of the main story. Rome is filled with great sights, which help make every area feel distinct from the last, and, for the avid completionists, accomplishing eveything didn't feel as great a chore as Assassin's Creed 2 did, although the reasons for that may vary according to each player.Completionist Playthrough: 36 hours "

												Although the core gameplay of the Assassin's Creed franchise remains undoubtedly fun, enjoying AC:Brotherhood is made more difficult by an excessive amount of grinding and minutiae. Despite the lively environments, the game desperately cries out for an improved fast-travel system; at least half of the game is spent running between the start points of the various missions, which quickly becomes tiresome. The game is further padded out by a heavy reliance on collectibles which rarely offer any benefit even if you do catch them all. The conspiracy-laden plot that stretches imagination at times (if /everybody/ is involved in the secret conspiracy, how can they claim nobody knows about it?). The graphics were too subdued and could have used a splash more color; another victim of the ""real is brown"" design school. And a host of bugs and gameplay issues - including a flaky camera, AI scripting problems and a finicky jumping mechanic that far too often had me leaping to my doom rather than at the obvious target right in front of me - did nothing to improve things. On the other hand, the combat system was well done, with excellent and numerous animations, as was the parkour climbing that is the heart of the game. The level design were interesting, if too beige, and the voice-acting was excellent. Brotherhood shows that the Assassins Creed franchise remains enjoyable, even if it is growing a bit long in the tooth.			"

Note: As of now, this review covers only the single player portion of the game.Assassin's Creed II was, for all intents and purposes, the game the original wanted to be but fell short of, do to a variety of reasons perhaps most largely its own incredible ambition. With the sequel, Ubisoft managed to monumentally improve virtually every aspect of the series, giving us a tightly wound narrative, a charismatic lead, and refined mechanics that came together for one of the best games of the last few years. Following up this achievement is Brotherhood, arriving barely a year after the first and on the surface seeming little more than a retread of what we already saw, and an easy cash grab before a full fledged sequel can be made. In some ways this is accurate, as Brotherhood in many ways is incredibly similar to its predecessors, but to call it anything less than an entire new experience would be a disservice, as for how short a time it had in the oven it's just as large and engrossing as the games that came before it, while also adding an assortment of excellent new mechanics that push the game forward even when it occasionally stumbles in the wake of critical acclaim. Being a direct sequel, Brotherhood picks up mere moments after the end of II, with the surprising (arguably convoluted) events that transpired still fresh in Ezio's mind though it would appear he has finally arrived at a moment of peace after all his struggles. Of course nothing good ever lasts long, and it doesn't take long for his enemies to catch up with him, kill yet more of what little family he has left, and send Italy tumbling into chaos, leaving you to pick up the pieces (though for once you aren't alone).After the fantastic birth to assassin story of II, Brotherhood's more traditional tail of revenge mixed with some incomprehensible supernatural elements never quite manages to achieve the same level of intrigue and pacing. Though perfectly solid and enough to drive the experience, aside from the first and last few hours it meanders through much of its plot, spiraling off into dozens of disconnected tangents that feel more like side missions than an overarching narrative which left me feeling rather disengaged with everything that was happening. By the end I had lost the investment I previously had in these characters, and simply wanted it all to wrap up in a way that somehow made it all pull together, which again it unfortunately failed to. This isn't to say that Brotherhood isn't entertaining, or that the story is terrible, but it lacked the sense of urgency and tightness that exuded from every moment of II and came off a tad rushed.Thankfully, Brotherhood plays incredibly well, taking everything that worked with II and adding in enough fresh elements and interesting mission types to be just as engaging. The most readily apparent change is that of the scenery, moving away from Venice and into the sprawling city of Rome. It's a far larger environment, that feels more alive than ever thanks in part to the expanded town building system which now encompasses the whole of the city, allowing you to renovate shops and tunnels to provide income, more areas to purchase items, and fast travel across the map. It also makes it easier to feel invested in the city as you see it build up around you with each new renovation. It's a huge world to explore, yet every inch of it is packed with an enormous amount of things to do, leaving little idle space and a never ending stream of missions the vast majority of which are surprisingly fleshed out and enjoyable.As the name implies, Brotherhood no longer sees you fighting alone but instead building up an army of assassins which you can then send on contracts and call in when you need aid. It's a tad underdeveloped in its current state, but it nonetheless greatly changes how you can approach an encounter, as often times calling in assassins which can pop out of anywhere is far less risky than attempting to get close to a target yourself. They also work as convenient distractions, and add a layer to encounters that feels especially needed when the combat is still trapped in a fairly dull design that despite numerous cool kill animations never became very fun and was best avoided whenever possible.Other minor tweaks in takedowns, platforming, and general movement add some noticeable refinement to the series core gameplay, though there are still moments when the camera will freak out or the free running system will send you jumping randomly completely in the wrong direction. Animations in particular continue to stick out to me as incredibly well done, with Ezio in particular moving with as much grace and fluidity as you'd expect from an assassin. Lastly Jasper Kyd's original score is utterly gorgeous and sets the mode strikingly well at every moment, as if his music is deeply tied into the world and speaking to you as you traverse it.Despite its narrative shortcomings, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is by no means the sloppily churned out annualized rubbish it very well could be, instead a brilliant successor to what I would consider an utter masterpiece, and a remarkably well crafted game on its own measures. If you've yet to touch the series this certainly isn't the place to jump in, but if you were left wanting more after II, Brotherhood will certainly satisfy and then some.			"

												Fantastic addition to Assassin's Creed. Great story and setting revolving around Ezio in Rome, aguably the best character and story in the whole series. Not much different from AC2, but for me, that's a good thing. You can ride horses in cities, call them from anywhere, recruit assassins to your brotherhood, carry double-handed weapons, use parachutes, and play with Leonardo's war machines. Also has a few nice flashbacks to Florence and Venice. A few glitches and hiccups here and there, but the setting is otherwise stunning. Beautiful graphics and visuals, combined with a killer soundtrack, makes 16th century Rome look very enticing.			"

												Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood continues the story of Ezio Auditore in a single huge city (Rome) that is dotted with hills, ruins, narrow streets and platforming opportunities aplenty. The twin stories of Ezio and Desmond are some of the most effective in the Ezio trilogy. Marred by some poor keyboard & mouse platforming controls and bad implementation of v-sync, but there is controller support. If you’ve enjoyed other Assassin’s Creed games, this is a must-own. Uplay is required.You can view the opening of the game here.Total size on my hard drive: 11GBNote: If you are new to Assassin’s Creed games and wondering where to start, I’d recommend Assassin’s Creed II, not Brotherhood.Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood picks up right where Assassin’s Creed II left off: Ezio is in Rome, having just fought the previous game’s final boss, and Desmond et. al. are on the run after having their hideout crashed by Abstergo. Having completed the battle in Rome, Ezio returns to Monteriggioni to have sexy times with Catarina Sforza, only to have the idyll interrupted by Cesare Borgia laying siege to the fortress. After it falls, Ezio and his family flee to Rome, determined to destroy the Borgia’s near-complete control of the city’s districts, and rebuild the Assassins (and Rome) in the process. Several popular characters return; Catarina as previously mentioned, Leonardo, Claudia and Maria Auditore, and Machiavelli. Rodrigo Borgia has a few brief scenes as well, but the primary antagonist is Rodrigo’s son, Cesare. Now, instead of only upgrading your headquarters, Ezio is buying and refurbishing shops (and landmarks) all over Rome. Completing all the “Sons of Romulus” lairs unlocks a special dagger and armor. Completing memories with full synchronization unlocks hidden (“repressed”) Ezio memories of Cristina Vespucci’s fate. Leonardo is a minor character in the main game, but gets an entire DLC to himself (which is included). The Copernicus DLC is also included in the game files, but isn’t accessible to PC players without a mod (search the Steam forums). Add in the huge amount of loot found throughout the game which is used to unlock unique items at shops, the Animus “training mode” which is an arcade for honing your combat skills, and there is a wealth of content in Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood.The combat is the largest improvement to Brotherhood over the previous games. The addition of the chain-kill mechanic allows for the rapid dispatch of hordes of enemies. Combat in general flows quicker and smoother in the hands of a skilled player. A strange step backward, though, is the inability to use secondary weapons (like the pistol or crossbow) without selecting them in the weapon wheel first. Also, if you have a secondary weapon selected, doing a hand-focused act – like tearing down wanted posters – switches the weapon selection to unarmed. And the platforming was clearly designed for a controller. It’s doable with a keyboard and mouse, but not always intuitive. Expect Ezio to occasionally leap to his death without explanation.The graphics are among the best of the earlier Assassin’s Creed games (Revelations’ are better, but are also much more demanding). Maxing Brotherhood’s graphics settings and hitting 120fps at 1080p proved an easy task (I have an R7 260X graphics card). Texture quality, detail, light, and reflections are the biggest advances over Assassin’s Creed II. Brotherhood is marred, however, by the poor implementation of vertical-sync: turning it on results in horrific frame-rate micro-stutter. There doesn’t seem to be a fix, other than not turning v-sync on. Setting v-sync on in the Radeon Crimson settings didn’t help, either.These are small drawbacks, though. With swift and deadly combat, tons of things to do, and great stories, Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood is a fantastic second part of the “Ezio trilogy” of games. A superb sequel and a great game in its own right. It discounts quite low, too, so if you’re a fan of Ezio or Assassin’s Creed in general, there is no reason not to get it.			"

												While biased towards the series and this game in particular. This is still my favorite installment in the Assassin's Creed series so far and still keeps in tradition with a big open map (although there are areas blocked up until a certain point in the game), easy, fun combat, a cinemeaticstory, and lots of activities and challenges. It continues Ezio's story right after the end of AC2 as well as continuing Desmond's story (modern times). I very much recommend this installment.			"

												First of all Ubisoft failed at Mac-ing this game, WARNING: Mac Users Do Not Buy This Easily!!! Check System requirements!!I have mavericks and it took a long time to fix it, I had to replace several things including the game launcher. After I fixed AC brotherhood, it was quite awesome. A delicate open world stealth game, with graphics better than the games made in 2014, and of course frustrating parkour that makes u look cool.  Brotherhood continues the story of Ezio Auditore Da La La La in Rome, with intense main storyline, and lots and lots of side missions. Once again I have to warn mac users that before you buy this game think twice, or you can add me on steam, i'll tell you how to fix it.			"

												The third game in the Assassin's franchise, Brotherhood, introduces Ezio to well uhm the Brotherhood! The first few games of the franchise are the best in my own opinion, as they introduce a very interesting and different approach to the everyday game. Brotherhood stands out to its predecessors due to the fact that you can train other assassins and send them out to do missions. + Interesting storyline with real life-inspired facts+ Parkour and freerunning over the roofs or Rome+ Great progression of protagonist (he 'ages' as you play)+ Still has the Assassin's Creed vibe to it- The Uplay business is bearable but quite annoying- No Steam Achievements- No Trading Cards (Emotes/Backgrounds)- Some missions can be really frustratingPersonal Ranking: 8/10 "

												Like the rest of the series, Brotherhood is a great game and maintains the best parts of the previous two games.  However, the sheer size of the map this time somewhat takes away from the experience.  It's good for a sandbox-type game to be large and varied, but when it gets to the point where you're running for 15 minutes of gameplay, you get bored quicker than you otherwise would.			"

 Introduction Assassin's Creed Brotherhood takes placed in the 21st century.You play as Ezio Auditore, who is wiser and older than his previous game.This game is the second chapter of three in the ""Ezio Trilogy.""Continuing the story of Ezio, you innovate in new fighting techniques as you restore the Assassin order, and destroy his enemies: the Borgia family. Categories GameplayCombatStoryGraphicsOptimizationBugsPersonal ExperienceProsConsConclusion Gameplay Assassin's Creed Brotherhood's main source of gameplay in missions is generally tailing your target.Not much different from the second game.You can now have your own Assassins do tasks for you, or help you in battles. Combat The advancements that this game brings over it's predecessor would be smoother combat from what I can tell.There are more movements in your combat fighting, and enemies will fight correctly, unlike the other games.Overall pretty similar to the previous game, though has a few minor changes.StoryContinues from the second game, and is pretty interesting.You're trying to get back the piece of Eden, while taking down Templar leaders.Completing various tasks to cripple the Borgias', to slowly restore Rome to it's former glory. Graphics They're pretty good, with some nice lighting and overall a pretty massive improvement over the second game.Colors are nice, and no SweetFX was needed to correct or, give more color.I played in 4K DSR 60fps maxed, and the game looked quite nicely, aside from the low textures. Optimization Optimization has improved from the previous games, though there are some issues still.Frame rate jumps around 55-60fps constantly, and will occasionally drop down to sub 40s.My PC is very powerful, and should be able to run this game without a problem. Bugs Not optimized.Occasional invisible spots that you can't walk through. Personal Experience I've played this game a few times, well mostly.I completed half the game twice, to have my save get wiped from switching computers.After restarting and finishing the game, I enjoyed it aside from the very annoying tailing missions. Pros Interesting continuation.Great voice acting and character models.Good graphics. Cons Poor performance.Micro-stutters.Tailing missions. Conclusion If you played Assassin's Creed II, this is a must play as it's a two part game.I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in the Assassin's Creed franchise.			"

												Continuing my revisiting of the Assassin's Creed franchise, here comes AC: Brotherhood! Having previously played this game on the PS3 when it launched back in 2010, I can say it was a fun revisit! Gameplay speaking, this Assassin's Creed ""2.5"" adds more mechanics for playability, you can recruit assassins to join the Assassins' cause.Brotherhood continues the trilogy story of Ezio Auditore da Firenze and now focus solely on Rome. The city is big, really big to explore. Although, even if it is quite big, I much preferred the different locations in AC2 than ""only being in Rome"". There is a tons of collectibles in this game... too many for my taste. 101 Borgia Flags does unlock you the Borgia Cape, which sets the notoriety permanently at none. Same effects occurs if you completely rebuild Rome with renovations, you unlock the Auditore Cape. I had the Auditore Cape on my PlayStation 3 playthrough and it was satisfactory to go on a rampage without being chased by guards all the time. But you're more than likely to unlock that cape quite late in the game which makes it almost pointless.PROS:+Strong narrative, both in the present with Desmond Miles and in the Animus, Ezio Auditore da Firenze.+Graphically improved compared to AC2 albeit contains visual glitches at times.+Soundtrack is excellent and again, composed by Jesper Kyd.+Same as AC2, the voice acting is solid.+Improved combat system.+More weapons and you can now carry heavy weapons.+Recruiting and using assassins on targets.+Multiplayer ain't my forté in the AC franchise, but it is very original nonetheless.+Ability to replay missions.+High replay value.CONS:-Uplay DRM.-Horrendous WASD keyboard + mouse scheme. Play this game with a gamepad! (I played Brotherhood with the Xbox One controller and it worked without any issues).-AC: Brotherhood feels like a big filler and not a proper sequel or expansion.-Silly timer on pretty much every assassination missions. Very irritating!-Some stupid requirements during missions like to not be seen or it causes desynchronisation.-Draw distance in this game seems broken at times, especially when you see guards appearing right in front of you, i.e.-Rome pretty much looks like the same anywhere you go in Italy.-Steep learning curve for the Multiplayer mode.-The cliffhanger ending is very irritating.-Too many collectibles... however, once seen in Eagle Vision, it sticks on your map for later acquisition.-Annoying ""Full synchronisation"" on missions / side-missions that don't do anything except unlock Trophies (PS3) or Achievements.OVERALL:Brotherhood ain't perfect for sure. But if you loved previous AC games, you'll enjoy this game very much. If you're a newcomer in the AC franchise, you could love this game a lot as well but you're gonna feel lost in the story. My best advice, you better play the previous games or at least, get informed by reading / watching wikia and videos online or you're gonna feel completely off the track!This game adds a few great mechanics which is always welcomed. Although, I felt this game to be more of a filler than a sequel / expansion. It is a good filler that is well paced... right until the very end scene which leaves you in a cliffhanger!RECOMMENDATION:Yes, I highly recommend this game for anyone loving this playstyle. The story is very interesting and you feel quite engaged with it as much as the past and the future events. My favorite AC game so far is still AC2 but Brotherhood continues on the same premise so you won't feel lost when playing it.RATING:8.0 / 10And now, going to revisit AC: Revelations...			"

												The missions are much more varied than in AC2 and they added some pretty neat new gameplay mechanics, like the assassin scholars for example. On top of that, every mission now has a secondary objective you can complete for 100% synchronisation, which adds a fun extra challenge. The gameworld is not as interesting, mainly since you only have one city instead of the 4 featured in AC2.Also, in order to buy something at a shop, or unlock a fast travel location, you first have to liberate the district by lighting a heavily guarded tower on fire, and then buy the shop. You have to do this for EVERY shop in the game, which is incredibly annoying. This annoyance is however balanced out by the fact that you don't have to go all the way back to the villa every ♥♥♥♥ing time you want to deposit your feathers or collect your income.In order to get the best items in the shop, you have to collect specific items of vendor trash that are dropped by enemies and are found in chests. Luckily this is completely optional, since just like in AC2 you get the best armor in the game for free by completing enough freerunning levels.(Aside, someone needs to find the guy who thought it was a good idea to have sudden switches to a fixed camera in the middle of timed jumping puzzles, and grant him a swift punch in the stomach)The combat is a lot easier, since the window for counterattacking is a lot bigger and you can chain counterkills. There are also more ranged weapons and if you're lazy you can just press one button and let your assassins murder everyone for you while you sit on a bench nearby watching the fight while eating popcorn.As for the story, there is a lot less character development for Ezio, but the game does have way more interesting villains,  and there is a fantastic subplot concerning a conflict between the assassins themselves about halfway through. Especially Bartholomeo, Machiavelli and La Volpe get some nice character development. Overall, the pros and cons compared to AC2 pretty much balance eachother out, and it is definately worth buying.			"

												It seems a majority of these negative reviews aren't for Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, but are for the Uplay client. When this game came out, Uplay was in it's infancy, and it has undergone many updates since. Uplay is completely stable these days and hasn't given me a single problem in about a year.Whenever I hear somebody say Assassin's Creed II is the best game of the series, I just want to tell them to replay it. It's glitchy and controls terribly, especially after being used to the updated control refinements that AC:III and Black Flag introduced. That being said, This game doesn't control as well as the aforementioned two games, but the controls are tighter and, overall, the intuitive nature of the parkour/jumping algorithms are significantly improved.The graphics, while not a drastic overhaul from its predecessor, are quite good and there seems to be more attention to detail in the texture work within the environment. Also the lighting is noticably superior.I would say the only thing that may be worse in this game than it's predecessor is the story. But that's only because everyone loves an origin story, which was the heart of the first game. Although, the villains in this installment are far more fleshed out and it's really fun seeing the family dynamic of the Borgia's play out.In conclusion, this is an A game that refines it's previous entries shortcomings and is really the peak of the Ezio trilogy, if not the entire Assassin's Creed franchise.

												Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a direct sequel to Assassin's Creed 2. When beginning the game you start right where you left off in AC2. Without giving too much away you leave Rome only to return where the main game takes place. In Brotherhood a new mechanic was added that let you perform kill streaks much more easily. This new feature included easier kills and the ability to immediatly take out enemies one after another. This made combat a lot faster however it felt almost too easy. The city is quite large however it is lacking in actual buildings too parkour across once outside the region.Even though the main story was quite short it is made up for in the free dlc and side quests. Hope this review has helped you form an opinion on this game. :D			"

												One of, if not the best, Assassin's Creed games ever made, Brotherhood brings us to Renaissance Rome, picking up where the second game left off. While there are a few dull and frustrating moments, mostly related to insane 100% sync requirements in some missions (looking at you, Hell on Wheels), the game is very well done and very worth the price when it's on sale. However, I'd only buy the deluxe edition these days if you REALLY want the two short single player missions, since multiplayer is very dead. If I were you, I'd just buy the base game.			"

												One of the games that I finished 100%.Assassin's Creed Brotherhood begins where the previous part ended. If you are new to the series, I suggest to play with Assassin's Creed™: Director's Cut Edition first because of the story.Where to begin... History is playground.This game is one of the most enjoyable game I've ever played. The music is a masterpiece, I will buy the OST on Google Play. The cities are full of life, the environment and graphics feels real. It is now impossible for me to go outside without mentally assessing climbing routes and synchronization points over all the buildings in the historical downtown of my city. Brotherhood only gives a small extra to Assassin's Creed 2. I often felt this is AC2, but thanks to the small extras this is a step forward.Ezio is probably one of the best and well-written characters in gaming history, I was a little disappointed in AC2 last mission. After perfectly built large cities Ubisoft made a mistake to let Ezio go to ""Rome"", which was only a limited wall, a tiny part of the Vatican. Luckily Ubisoft finished what they begun, and we got a beautiful ancient Rome.This is not just a game. The cities has historical buildings, events, and people. In the game you can access information about the characters' life, the story of the place you are. You can find hidden signs to explore ""the truth"". You can access side missions, and you can collect and purchase items.All things considered this game is probably one of the best of the Assassin's Creed games, I highly recommend to buy it. Even it with Uplay.			"

												It falls short of Assassin's Creed 2, but It was better than Assassin's Creed Revelations and Assassin's Creed 3.In terms of gameplay it takes the same formula of Assassin's Creed 2 and refresh it.In terms of plotline, well, think of it as a really big stand-alone expansion to ACII.In terms of graphics, they ain't the best, but when the game was released the graphics were top of the line.

												Better than Assassin's Creed 2. After playing this I started a rerun for the previous game and I feel that as a game experience, this one is a lot more solid and fun to play. Rome as a city feels better for the gameplay than Florence&Venice. Also concentrating only on one city, the game area becomes more familiar and yet has almost as much to offer as all the areas in AC2. Also the ""subplot"" makes now more sense, although it still takes only baby steps. Animus interface and controls are less akward and running in the roof tops seem more intuitive and fun. I still don't like the idea, that some areas are unreachable until advancement in the main plot, but atleast it isn't as annoying as in the previous game.If you are looking an entrance to the series, this might be the one to start with. Although the subplot might not make much sense, it does not do that even with previous games played. So you might just enjoy this games main plot and then think about getting the other games if you like. I took the bit harder road and purchased AC2 first and almost didn't buy this because the flaws in it. Now I'm glad I did buy this.			"

Great characters, a lot of exploring and a bunch of collectibles for the ""extra challenge"".The only negative that you might see others mention: Uplay.... *sighs*But get it and enjoy it! :) Overall very smooth!

I can not think of any other reason why they should name this one Brotherhood, x-capt for your crip in which you be hustling together with the girls of the streets and 5-fingers of the subs when you are going to kick some dog's who go by their crip of the Wolfpack - Yo (Sorry, I got no idea where this is going)9/10 Assassin attack!

Assassin's Creed Brotherhood Retrospective ReviewAC:Brotherhood while a good game is a bit disappointing in a few ways. So after the so called “Gods-Not-Gods” you interact with at the end of AC 2, Brotherhood picks up shortly after that moment in what will become a tireless exercise for the series. The tireless exercise is that from this point on, Assassin’s Creed drip feeds you it’s story. If you thought the story was moving at a snail's pace, well AC:Brotherhood moves a heck of a lot slower which unfortunately becomes a common occurrence in the series. This is completely frustrating and really an unforgivable indictment on the series. In present time, a some plot threads from AC 2 are just dropped and forgotten. In AC 2 you learn that Desmond starts seeing things from the Animus in the real world, like glimpses or “ghosts” of Acre, which then turns into a dream that controls much like an Animus session except without all the help of the Animus. In AC: Brotherhood, nothing like that ever happens. As a matter of fact it’s a plot point that is dropped to never be returned to again. This strikes me as Ubisoft redacting certain story elements that would then converge into a new story that would allow them to drip feed the story from game to game. Also the present story is rendered moot, because there is almost zero emotional ties to what is happening. In AC2 you learn that Desmond is sorry for the way he treated Lucy at Abstergo and that Lucy believes in him. In AC Brotherhood you get none of that. Just exposition piled on exposition and it’s quite unfortunate. Ultimately the only moment that moves our characters along in their respective arcs is the ending which tries to ape the crazy ending of AC2, but is a lot less successful. This ending doesn’t help anything at all. All it does is raise questions and answers none of the ones that were raised last time. At this point, the more I think about the state of the present story, the more it pisses me off. Look, the present story in AC1 and 2 wasn’t anything to write home about, but it did give us a hook to latch on to. We could empathize with the characters and hope that they would get out of this okay, but in Brotherhood and subsequent iterations  or at least in Brotherhood, there is nothing that moves their arcs in any direction and it’s downright frustrating. When it comes to Ezio’s story thankfully there’s a lot less inconsistencies although they are still there. It’s thoroughly enjoyable story that shows us the weakness’ that the Assassins have. Ezio’s in particular. You see that he cares about people in a way others just don’t. It leads him to go out of his way to help his friends and comrades and make sure they make it out alright and he doesn’t leave them to just die. It endeared me to the character and makes him much more relatable. Also there is a lot less exposition, which helps. Lastly the inconsistencies are few, but still present. Ezio’s mother for example seems to have forgotten that half of her family has died. She is in a chipper mood and it just strikes me as unbelievable. This wouldn’t be a problem if the game took place years after the second, but it doesn’t it literally takes place right after the second. By the end of the second game, Ezio’s mother was talking again, but only slightly she was still mourning. In this game we see none of that, and I’m not saying that she should be completely depressed, but the fact that she is happy strikes me as odd. We are left to assume that she’s just over it, like the death of her family “is sooo last year”. Okay you can see that it bothers me, but it’s true.The gameplay is where Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood suffers the most. It’s entirely playable, but it’s much the same as AC 2. If that bothers you then you probably won’t find much to like in this game beyond the story and environment. However, there’s no criticism I can give that you haven’t already heard a thousand times before, but what I can say is positive things. Yes, Positive! For one the A.I thankfully is far more consistent. In AC2 it felt like every other enemy I sneaked up to would turn around like I was making tons of noise. Now, for the most part they will only turn around if you are making a ruckus, now I said for the most part, unfortunately there are still times that enemies will turn around even if you sneak up to them and other times where they won’t see you whatsoever. Now the game adds some mechanics that I thought were pretty fine, but some reviewers seemingly lambasted the game for. You eventually pick up a crossbow that shoots as fast and as far as a gun. This is great for the rooftop excursions where I just shoot a guard so it won’t just start chasing me. Also there is the chain kill mechanic in where once you subdue a foe you can then kill others by just clicking the button which will turn into a one hit kill for each enemy until you are interrupted. All these things might take away from the challenge, but honestly if I got two more AC’s with AC2 controls I don’t care. It makes the game less frustrating and then more enjoyable. Now the last thing I want to touch on is optional objectives. Some people don’t like them, but I never had any trouble with them, which makes me wonder why people are complaining in the first place. I loved them, because it forced me to actually be an assassin. It was awesome, even if it kinda forces you on a scripted path. I enjoyed them and I personally think they are a great addition to the series. Now  when it comes to environments, it’s as always awesome. I have actually been to Rome once before and when I went to Coliseum in this game, it was cool just, how much it was like the real thing. That’s pretty much it. Rome is a beautifully rendered environment and Nuff said.My experience might be unique with my system, but if AC 2 gave you graphical performance issues then you are in for much of the same in AC Brotherhood. The game would drop frames out of nowhere and for one stretch was stuttering uncontrollably. It was incredibly annoying. So it pains me to say that AC Brotherhood is poorly optimized with the caveat, that it might be unique to my setup, maybe you might have more luck. On the plus side it never gets to the point where the game is just unplayable. Assassin’s creed Brotherhood is a double edged sword. It’s is technically a better game than AC2, but it also suffers from some of the same problems, but as well as some new ones. I do recommend the game and it is a good addition to the series, but not a great one.  I played about 62 hours I got 86% synchronization I unlocked “The Truth” I played this game on an i7, GTX 970, Windows 8.1/Windows 10 computer When I switched to Windows 10 for the last 4 hours that I played the game, I didn’t come across the out of place        framerate drops.

												Man, that ending... You don't mess with assassins, but you definitely don't mess with Juno.Actual Review (no spoilers):AC: B improves on a lot from AC2. It's really fun, has an engaging story (with a few WTF moments), and the gameplay is MUCH better than AC2. The open world is GREAT. Worth the full price. Although I would start with AC2 because of the story.Haven't played the DLC (DaVinci's Dissapearance) yet, I'm planning to. Looking forward to beginning AC: Revelations and finishing AC: Black Flag!EDIT: Just finished the DLC (DaVinci) and before that, Revelations. The DLC was cool and had a fun addition of being able to run into people and not fall (like the later AC games). Check out my review for Revelations here: http://store.steampowered.com/recommended/recommendgame/201870 Note: I got this game for free, because I got it as a gift.Note 2: Some missions are annoying, but that is in all AC games and they don't really ruin the gameplay. If you're frustrated, just come back to the game in a couple of days and try that mission again with a fresh start! The game is worth finishing!Note 3: I wish people would start playing multiplayer again! Not this game in general, although it would be fun, but Assassin's Creed Multiplayer in general. These games include: AC: B, AC: Revelations, AC3, and AC: Black Flag. I'm not including AC: Unity, because people seem to think that that is the main multiplayer game of AC, so the rest should be ignored. That is not the case! Seriously, multiplayer deserves some respect! Otherwise, Ubisoft won't make multiplayer in their next game - AC: Empire (set in Ancient Egypt)!EDIT: Recently finished Revelations and I gotta say...Brotherhood is the BEST game out of the Ezio trilogy! Sure AC2 was great, but Brotherhood improved on so much and had multiplayer! Even if AC2 had the best story, it is really the blend of story, gameplay, graphics, music, etc. that makes the final cut as the best game and Brotherhood is it! Just do be sure to play AC2 for the story and gameplay, because even though it's an awesome game, you kind of won't want to go back to it after Brotherhood.Some people also complain that the ending (which was...WAIT I THOUGHT I TOLD MYSELF TO NOT GIVE AWAY SPOILERS? aww, but the ending is so great!!!) is a bit rushed. I'd say it seems that way, but it is much better than the ending of the previous game(s).			"

												AC Brotherhood is on the same level of quality as AC 2. It improves on a lot of things from AC 2 and it is overall a masterpiece in design and execution but I personally prefer AC 2 because I think the story was slightly better and I preferred Venice and Florence over Rome for the setting but I still really love Rome in this game. Just like AC 2 the recreation of the city really makes the world feel real and the attention to detail is just outstanding. The combat is much improved from AC 2 with the kill streak mechanic they added and it overall just feels more natural and free flowing. The animations are so fluid and on point it’s great to look at. The way Ezio dodges each attack when he counters with the hidden blade and then just going seamlessly between enemy to enemy is masterfully done. The combat in this game is the best in the series and it slowly started going downhill after this game to the point where I started to dislike the combat by the time AC Black Flag came out. Soundtrack is beautiful and just as good as AC 2’s. They added so many new little features and tweaks to the overall gameplay and design (just like AC2 did from AC1) that it feels like a whole new experience and not more of the same like the franchise ended up being called out for later. When people say this game is their favourite in the franchise I can definitely see why. 9/10 (Amazing)			"

												Finish AC2 and you'll know whether you want to play Brotherhood, which serves to extend the storyline and gameplay of its predecessor. As a fan of the epic nature of the series, Brotherhood was a satisfying experience, if somewhat tedious in parts (I found myself watching another screen while playing through the more mundane activities, and idled in-game for for several hours while AFK, waiting to earn income for city improvements), however by the end I was excited to continue the adventure in the ""Ezio"" trilogy finale Revelations.- Skinny from the Fat B*stard (curator link) "

												This title expands to what Assassin's Creed II so great, but also takes a small step back. And that step back is for the better. ACII wanted to make everything bigger and better. They made a lot of things better as opposed to AC1, but some of the cities and locations felt very empty. In this title (which in my opinion should be could Assassin's Creed III: Brotherhood) the entire adventure takes place in Rome. It is gigantic and very well detailed. It looks way better then Assassin's Creed II and there are some subtle improvements to the gameplay of ACII.The Story is not as good as the last two games in the series. The ending is great and leaves you guessing. Ezio is now becoming a Master Assassin and thus recruits new Assassin's. You can call these brothers in arms into battle whenever you wish. Yes, it's a cheap and overpowered way to get yourself out of a tough fight, but I love the way these Assassin's come out of hiding places just like Altaïr or Ezio would. You bond with a lot of characters and I love that.In other words, did you play the wonderful Assassin's Creed II and you want to know the next chapter in the story? Brotherhood is a very safe purchase. Fun, beautiful and exciting! Love it.			"

												TL:DR - If you liked Assassin's Creed II, you'll more than likely like AC: Brotherhood.Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood continues the story of AC2 right where you leave off. After Ezio fails to assassinate the Borgia Pope, he receives the message for Desmond in the vault. Confused, he returns to Monteriggioni to live a life of peace. That is shortly disrupted when Cesare Borgia appears and lays siege to Monteriggioni in revenge for Ezio's attack on Rodrigo Borgia. Mario, Ezio's uncle, is killed, Ezio is injured, and he flees. Ezio wakes up in the suburbs of Rome, mysteriously healed, and given new Assassin gear. Ezio must now meet up with the Assassins (or what's left of them) in Rome and seek revenge. Not only does Ezio have to do this himself, he must rebuild the Assassin Order. To take on the Pope, you'll need more than just a single, skilled assassin.The gameplay is very similar to AC2. Same type of missions, but with a few extras. Leondardo was forced to build weapons of war based off of some of his most famous drawings and Ezio has to go destroy them to prevent the Templars from using them for their nefarious means. The game also keeps everything in the extremely expansive city of Rome, which feels like it's a much closer scale replica than the other maps. The game even allows you to ride horses to help make the trip around Rome much shorter (although I ended up running or using the sewers instead). The game also introduces Borgia Towers, which prevent you from restoring various areas of the city and gaining income from it. You have to kill the captain in charge of the area and then climb the tower and destroy it. It's a nice little minigame, so many of the towers are blocked off by invisible walls (or basically the restriction of Ezio's memories) so you have to wait to be able to clear them all. The game also gives you another powerful set of armor to retrieve by going through and clearing the lairs of the Followers of Romulus, a pagan cult controlled by the Templars. So much of the gameplay is recycled from the previous game that it feels more like an expansion to AC2 rather than its own game. Building up the Brotherhood was not as exciting as it sounds since you basically rescue some random citizen in the city, they join the cause, and then you send them on missions around the Mediterranean to level up and become full-fledged Assassins. They can also play a role in fights, if you want them to, but I rarely used them, since it wasn't necessary most of the time.The story is in the game is compelling, however, as the story shifts from Rodrigo Borgia, the Pope, to his son, Cesare. It is unclear if Cesare is really loyal to the Templar cause, however, and it kind also seems to distract from the primary Assassin vs. Templar showdown. In fact, that portion of the story doesn't advance very much and few new clues are given. The whole story revolves around Ezio regaining control over the Apple so it's not in the hands of the Templars or Cesare, who wants to use it for his own ends.But Rome seriously makes up for the lackluster gameplay. The scenery was amazing, the landmarks recognizable, and just being in the Eternal City was great for a hobby historian like myself. You find yourself getting lost in the winding streets of the city and learning more about its place in the Renaissance world was fascinating.Overall, I think it's not as good as AC2, but if you liked AC2 you'll still enjoy Brotherhood. Enjoy your trip to Rome and continue Ezio's legacy!			"

												AC Brotherhood is the sequel to the highly regarded Assassins Creed 2. While they didn't reinvent the wheel with this game, they certainly improved and enhanced it.Rather than the game taking place in multiple cities across Italy, AC:B takes place mostly in the city of Rome. However, Rome is by far the most detailed location in the game up to this point. You can upgrade local buisinesses in the world, take out guard outposts and burn them to the ground, and  run a local assassin guild you build from the ground up. Among many other things. The game is also noticeably harder and basically expects that you already played through AC2 before this one. It also features V/R missions like Metal Gear Solid so you can test your skills in the combat and stealth challenges. There's plenty to do in this game and the focus on side content is very noticeable.So if you liked AC2, AC:B is the next thing to check out. On the other hand if you haven't played AC2, or didn't really like it I don't recommend this one. It expects that you have already played through AC2 and apart from the setting and the inclusion of a few new weapons it's virtually the same game.

												WOW! there are no other words to describe this game it is fantastic. Set between 1499-1509 Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood takes place immediately after the plot of Assassin's Creed II, featuring the 16th-century Assassin Ezio Auditore da Firenze in Italy and on his quest to restore the Assassin order, and destroy his enemies: the Borgia family. Intersecting with these historical events are the modern day activities of series protagonist Desmond Miles, who relives his ancestor Ezio's memories to find a way to fight against the Assassins' enemies, the Templars, and to also prevent the 2012 apocalypse. Assassin's Creed Brotherhood introduces rectruabile Assassins to the game. Ezio can now recruit new members to the Assassin Order by destroying any of the twelve ""Borgia towers"" around Rome where the papal troops are stationed, then by rescuing disgruntled citizens in their districts from the harassing guards.There are new enemy archetypes in addition to those that were seen in AC II such as the horsemen, arquebusiers, the papal guards and others. Horses now also have a much larger role in AC Brotherhood, not only used as a means of transport, but also as a component of different acrobatic sequences and also so much more advanced combat as well, allowing ranged weapons to be used while riding them.Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is also the first game in the whole Assassin's Creed Franchise to feature multiplayer which consists of three game modes, Free for All, Co-Op and Team. This game is just full of amazing detail in every aspect; The story, Graphics, ambiance, environment, sound and much more. I really recommend this for the mere fact that it's just always fun to play, and there is just so much things that you can do in the game. I absolutely cannot recommend this game to you enough it really is just absolutely outstanding. So once again I highly recommend that you get this game because I'm sure you won't regret it. I am definitely without even a single doubt 100% sure that Assassin's Creed Brotherhood will not disappoint you!.			"

PROS:+ awesome and long story+ good mix between historical settings and Animus UI+ huge map of Rome (4 districts)+ LOTS of side-quests+ main assassination missions+ Cristina side story+ extra content in The Da Vinci Disappearance DLC+ smooth combat with cool combos+ big weapon selectionCONS:- uPlay- really funky camera in some places- some annoying 100% requirements for missions- occassional graphical glitches- a couple of rare AI glitches- another cliffhanger endingComment:We continue our adventure with Ezio. While AC2 felt like a huge step from AC1, in this case the changes are not that big. Ubisoft left the basics from what made AC2 great and added a whole bunch of extra stuff. This time it is just one city - Rome, that is divided into 4 districts. Still present is a really good storyline where Ezio is already established but builds up his brotherhood of assassins. The game is still fun and has lots of side missions to keep you occupied for hours. However, some types become a bit repetitive and the 100% requirements for many missions are just plain annoying. But I guess this is to counteract the fact that once you have you assassins that you can call upon the game goes into easy mode. So the only real challenge comes from the artificial requirements of the 100% completion system. The combat is the same as in AC2. Main assassinations are again great and fun, each playing out a bit differently to mix things up a bit. This time we see more of the Desmond timeline of which I am a fan. Some flaws are funky camera placement in some cases and sometimes weird AI. I would complain about uPlay but you all know what playing Ubisoft games is like. You simply need a uPlay account. Otherwise the game itself is awesome and while slightly worse than AC2 it still is worth your money. Recommended!			"

												Uplay.I wish I could just put that in but I wont. So it was about 4am and i was a little tired. I went on steam and saw ubisoft having a sale and thought ""Why not buy assassin's creed?"" But of course I forgot about Uplay that comes with it on the pc. Basicly It is an add-on you have to download to play any ubisoft games and it is really annoying. I'm not trying to discourage assassins creed, it is a good game, brotherhood i've played on xbox and loved it, the same with black flag. But Uplay creates problems with gameplay.(Also takes up a bit of space in a Uplay folder it makes in your computer's Program files/x86.)  And it can be seen in all of ubisofts public reviews; 1.[i.imgur.com] : 2.[i.imgur.com]. This is part of the reason their games get poor reviews from the public due to non-needed add on's that make it hard to actualy get to the gameplay. (Example: EA's Origin or Rockstar's online social club.) If your going to buy a game from these companies I would strongly advise buying it on a Playstation or Xbox, but if your like me ond only like to use PC there isn't much to do about it.			"

												This is such a fun game. I've played through the main story, but still have more to do. I don't tend to think about reviewing games, but this is the game I've played the most, and enjoyed virtually every second of it. Some of the basic assassin's creed mechanics don't quite work, such as sneaking through open fields, but that really doesn't detract from gameplay. I love this game, and I'm just now realizing it's hard to write a good long review. Well, I suggest you play this game if you enjoy the franchise, and even if you don't, you'll probably enjoy it.

												Recommended! If you want some more of Ezio, that is what you gonna get.Let's see, its a very buggy game, not game breaking bugs but your gonna find yourself in situations where you expect the game to do something but you either freeze or the action your taking keeps repeating itself until you have the brains to turn your brain off for a few seconds and let go off your anger. Now to the good part, I very much keep enjoying the music, this time in only one city(Rome) so the game is very static in terms of music but it is a shorter game than Assasin Creed 2 so I was perfectly fine with it. 8/10 musicThe highlight of the game is again Ezio and Desmond, they are so damn awesome to follow around. They are not this amazing inspiring characther but they have the ability to make the journey from point A to B awesome.I cannot believe you guys killed X, I swear to god if Ezio or Desmond dies, there will be violence!Ps: The game could have done better connecting all the sidequest with the main story, I never got the chance to collect the ancient armour and now that the game is over I dont really care. That and it would have been cool if you had made us conquer some more Borgia towers like in one of those war games where you need to keep the city X colour and yu could win prizes by having X % of the city in your colour. It would make for a more insteresting game and longer without me finishing the game and be slapped with ""Here is 30 more hours of repatead free content that you already pay, dirty ♥♥♥♥♥""Ps2: The game was too easy, if there was a dificulty change option then perhaps I made a mistake.

												The multiplayer is super intriguing and enjoyable but is sadly devoid of most players in it nowadays.  Rome is a beautiful locale and the attention to historical detail (with a few liberties taken) is quite impressive.  The assassination targets are fun, the new abilities and such are fun, but the one thing that sorta makes things frustarting is the addition of buying property and shops for income, which just becomes a bit of a chore to do and doesn't offer a substantial reward.All in all the game is wonderful to play but is slightly hampered by some ""collect-em-up"" side objectives.

												The successor is a worthy one, rife with changes.Heavy weapons can now finally be bought, allowing you to weild big swords and axes whenever you please. You'll just not use them on a horse.The setting is different now though. Largely, you'll spend your time in Rome. A confusing change. Not only for you, but your horse too it seems. Horse AI never needed to be very intelligent in past games, but here their intelligence' true nature seems to really surface. It's limited to silly situations, thankfully.However, being one city, Rome is one big city to be in. You'll be busy renovating stores and freeing districts from Borgia influence. Which partly is entwined in the story.That said, the story becomes quite a bit more interesting. A matured Ezio is becoming the driving force behind the goals of the Assassins, and will later on be able to command a handful of his own trainees. This forms a new method of approaching a problem. You'll have assassin signals assigned to you, which you can use to send one of your apprentices out of hiding, and attack your target.Or, when you have enough signals saved up with enough aprentices, you can launch an arrow storm attack, killing almost all hostile in the vicinity. These signals slowly replenish over time.If the story of AC2 engaged you, you will not be hard pressed to enjoy it here as well. Ezio is the child you've seen from birth, growing into a confident and strong man.			"

												Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is what you come to expect from an AAA product. Granted it would be a daunting task to do a reasonable follow up to the ever-so-popular Assassin's Creed 2 however considering it's very slow and somewhat confusing start, stay with it as from sequence four onwards catapults this game into a newer dimension – not as much as from Assassins Creed 1 to 2 however it's a total blast to play. For a newcomer for the series, if you can handle the spoilers, this game is a wonderful entry point as it has a lot to offer. Overall I felt Brotherhood is a better game than AC2 however without AC2, there's no Brotherhood.Full review here: http://www.gamespot.com/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews/2200-12597266/9 / 10			"

												Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood is a direct continuation of Assassin’s Creed II, in pretty much every sense. The story picks up exactly where the last one left off (both in the past and the present), and the game mechanics are more or less identical. In some ways, the need for this game to exist seems a bit unnecessary (i.e. it feels more like the result of a corporate mandate to make an annual franchise than a creative decision). That said, it’s forgivable if only for the fact that it’s just as good as its predecessor, if not better. Part of what feels forced is the contrived story revolving around Ezio losing his Apple of Eden and having to retrieve it. But there you go... it is what it is - basically, a flimsy excuse to move to a new setting and do more cool things with a well-loved character. The game takes place in the early 1500s, almost entirely in Rome. While that may sound like a reduced scope in setting from the prior games, it’s actually not. Rome is huge. Like, really huge. There are also a few other places that you get to explore in some of the main story missions as well, so there is plenty of variety in the environments. As usual, it’s a lot of fun just to explore the city and discover its secrets. Brotherhood also greatly expands the role of horses (you can ride them pretty much anywhere), and there are some fun combat mechanics added as well. The missions in the game are similar to those from AC2, so nothing major has changed on that front. The other primary mechanics introduced in AC2 (notoriety, blending, etc) all return here as well and are also just as good. The main addition this game brings to the series is the titular Brotherhood. Ezio can now recruit citizens to the Assassin Brotherhood. As you progress through the game, more recruit slots are unlocked. Once recruited, you can call your Assassins to assist in combat or send them on missions in a sort of optional sub-game. Doing either of these things awards XP to the recruits and eventually they level up and become more powerful. Though hardly revelatory by any means, it’s a fun new aspect to the game and is a welcome addition. While Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood doesn’t really do anything groundbreaking or expand on the established formula in any major way, it is still worth playing if you enjoyed AC2. While it is essentially more of the same, at least it’s a *good* more of the same. Grade: A-Note: I don’t recommend playing any of the Assassin’s Creed games unless you have an Xbox360 controller (or equivalent-featured gamepad). The AC games have complicated control schemes and were clearly designed with controllers in mind, so proceed with mouse/keyboard at your own risk.			"

												Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is the third game in the series, and the second game in the Ezio trilogy (composed of Assassin's Creed II, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, and Assassin's Creed: Revelations). Mechanically, it's not very different from other games in the series - it is a third person open-world historical fiction action game, where you play as an assassin in 16th century Italy, working to improve the standing of your faction and reduce the power of your opposing faction.Like seems to be the case in this series, controls are improved over predecessors in that it makes combat easier, but that also serves to transition the game from being a stealthy assassin and more into being the sort of person who just jumps into combat and runs rampant. The primary change in this game is the ability to summon other assassins to help with combat/kills, which actually is pretty fantastic.I played this game on the 360, and enjoyed it a great deal - it's very much ""more of Assassin's Creed II"" with very minor changes. If that sounds like a good time, by all means - check it out. The game's a lot of fun. But by the end of this game, the mechanics and such were starting to wear thin - it's probably why I've taken as long as I have to get started in Revelations.			"

												Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is an extremely difficult game.  The combat is surreal in which you have to hit your mouse buttons multiple times on the 'Play' button to actually attempt to make Uplay work, and it's a never ending process as Uplay never works.  AC:B is one of those games where you have to make your own story.  One I made is that the main character (who I pretend is actually me) is in a world where when he wants to play a game, and the only way to play that game is through an extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing service named Uplay.  It's a really rivetting story of greed, greed, greed, and greed.10/10Origin is better (I can't believe I just said that.....).  ♥♥♥♥ing UbiSoft.....			"

												This game is better than it's predecessors in certain ways and worse in others. The shadow war between the Assassins and Templars seems to be happening in the public now, with Rome knowing about the Assassins.The story is the most simplistic in the series to date, and the main villain the same. Luckily the side characters are more actively developed and featured, and Ezio is shown as a leader, but we don't really see his development into that role. The gameplay, however, has been improved from the last entry into the series, with combat being more fluid and the side missions correlating more into the story.In this game you finally get a place to free-roam around as Desmond in, although it's small, but he also gets an interesting sequence at the end of the game.89/100			"

ACB is typical in how the franchise provides a rich historical background of the events during that period of Rome and also provides its usual outstanding landscapes and architecture.

												Initially, you get the impression that this should have been the DLC for Assassins Creed 2, but then they decided to stretch it into a full game. However, that is quickly shaken off and Brotherhood is a solid entry in the Ezio series. Playing as Ezio is as fun as always, possibly more so as he's got more gadgets than Batman.Theres quite a heavy emphasis on management, with rebuilding rome or recruiting your own assassins. I like this sort of thing, but if it doesnt set your world on fire you can pretty much ignore it once the training wheels are let loose. The graphics are good, especially considering this was released nearly 7 years ago. Rome can sometimes feel overwhelming, with there literally being tons of stuff to do - hundreds of side objectives are available. And this is where I feel it has overstretched itself, content for the sake of content. The plot is quite thin and tends to jump around, with no real sense of flow, just a series of disconnected objectives. I hold my hands up and admit that I found Assasins Creed skull-crushing difficult at times, with Altair dying more times than I could count. Ezio seems almost overpowered in this game, and sometimes battles can feel a little too easy when you perform a 15-count execution streak. Overall, Brotherhood is an enjoyable game with possibly too much stuff in it, but saying that, I suspect I will lose a few more hours running around Rome before I'm finished with it. .			"

												A good continuation of the Ezio's story. Roma is magnificent. Gameplay is fun and polished, but as any AC game it has many repetitive aspects, one of the reasons I decided to mostly focus on the story to not get bored. Multiplayer's hide and seek can be fun, though I hate players that hide within a crowd of NPCs that have identical character models. I always kill the wrong one :P Anyways, if you like the previous AC games you will this one too. Do not play this one if you didn't play AC2.			"

												Rome was a lot of fun to explore, but I felt I wasted way too much time on sidequests. Maybe some people will like them, but I just saw them as major filler without any really important benefits. Especially stupid were shop quests, which really weren't quests at all, just collecting junk from chests, to get certain items from shops. If anybody plays who hasn't already, take my advice and just stick mainly to the storyline.			"

												If you liked Assassin's Creed II and you want more of that, this is the game for you. It is more or less the same thing in terms of mechanics, with some additional weapons and the option to summon assassins to eliminate targets for you. You also get to head the assassin's guild which allows you to recruit new assassins, send them on missions and stuff. The world is, like in the previous game, amazingly crafted, with lots of areas to explore and rooftops to parkour on. Parkouring is fun, although you'll sometimes fly off a wall because the camera spazzed out or you were moving too fast to direct your character adequately etc. When this happens it breaks the flow and can feel quite frustrating. While assassinating targets remains fun (pulling them to their deaths when hanging off ledges or dropping on them from above etc), the combat is still awful (guards stand around you in a circle, waiting for their turn to attack), and the voice acting is just as atrocious as in the previous game, with a bunch of North American voice actors continuing to do an awful job at faking Italian accents... I suggest turning on Italian audio, it improves the immersion anyway.			"

												After an initial feeling of being stretched thin with so many things to do and tasks pulling in many directions, the game really pulls together nicely. I sincerely had been close to calling my time with it quits before finishing Mem Seq 1. It was just  an overload of content. But perseverance won out and I'm glad it did. Currently through with Mem Seq 8 and have completed the majority of renovations and purchases and have a couple assassins in my brotherhood - working toward that magic number 5. I'm pretty much just map-clearing before going on with the main plot thread to afford my brotherhood the chance to level up. I have the feeling that the rest of the story missions will go quite smoothly. Perhaps the opening interval made me wary of Brotherhood and its standing as a sequel to ACII, but I think it works out the kinks smoothly. A good romp through Rome.			"

												Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood (AC:B) should be considered a worthy expansion of Assassin's Creed II, but it serves as a standalone game that continues where AC2 left off. The game continues the narrative saga, but quickly becomes tedious in its constant parkour maneuvers and climbing. However, AC:B is the first of the series to offer a multiplayer mode which in itself becomes just as tedious. Still, AC:B provides a crucial extension to the AC2's story line that again leaves fan hanging on for more. Essentially, AC:B feels like a paid expansion to properly conclude AC2 and begins to really show the repetitive nature of the series.			"

												The Assassin's Creed series just keeps getting better and better. The first game was a solid start, but the missions got repetitive after a while. AC II blew me away with the number of things they added; a compelling plot and characters that felt authentic, interesting platforming sequences, and a real sense of humor!I just finished the story campaign of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, and I can't decide whether I liked it better than Assassin's Creed II or not.Graphically Brotherhood is obviously better, but it is not as big a difference as the change from AC to AC II. Also, 3D gaming is really useful while freerunning around Renaissance Italy because depth perception helps me to know whether I can make a jump or not.I think I preferred the story of AC II because it was an epic narrative of Ezio's journey over several decades to train and grow from a rather self-centered lady-killer young adult to a mature assassin (still a lady-killer). AC Brotherhood was much more limited in scope, as it takes place over the course of a few years in the city of Rome. Don't get me wrong, it was epic, but I liked the tangible progression that Ezio went through in AC II.However, I definitely preferred the gameplay of Brotherhood. They improved on a few of the things that had been iffy in the previous games (like horses!) and they added some really great things as well. The big one of course is recruiting assassins to help you out. I felt like a total badass whenever I walked by a group of guards, raised my hand and whistled, and a moment later they were dead. I also became rather attached to the recruits, and it made me very proud when they gained enough experience to become full-fledged assassins. Losing recruits didn't have quite as big an emotional impact as losing people in The Walking Dead did, but when I accidentally killed one it came pretty close.The endings of these games keep getting more and more mind-blowing; I have heard that Revelations raises the bar once again, and I can't wait to get there. One thing that definitely gave me the chills was the date that the finale takes place on. Ubisoft has intentionally been converging all events on December 21, 2012 and the final scenes of Brotherhood take place 72 days before that.So if you were to ask me which Assassin's Creed games you should play, I would say all of them. If you are short on time/money skipping the first one is excusable. AC II, Brotherhood, and Revelations make a nice little trilogy, so don't start after AC II.			"

												Assassin's Creed Brotherhood é uma sequência  direta de AC2, se iniciando logo após o seu final. O jogo trás algumas novidades em relação ao seu antecessor, mas não muitas, de forma que parece mais ser uma expansão que um jogo novo. Digo isto não querendo desmerecer, até porque se trata de um título de grande qualidade, mas se não fosse pelas cidades de ocorrência serem diferentes, facilmente poderia se confundir os dois jogos.A trama, como sempre muito bem elaborada, diz respeito a libertação de Roma do domínio dos Borgia, poderosa família de templários que além de tudo estavam no controle de um dos artefatos mágicos. No entanto, o final é meio desanimador, por ser totalmente inconclusivo  deixando o jogador com a impressão de que o jogo acabou antes do final.Entre as novidades, a que mais chama atenção é a possibilidade de recrutar pessoas entre a população e treiná-los em batalha para que se tornem assassinos, inclusive com ritual de passagem e tudo que tem direito! A Irmandade também pode ser usada para se livrar de um pelotão de inimigos inteiro com a chuva de flechas, caso estejam todos os recrutas disponíveis.Outra coisa legal é que existem desafios extras durante as missões, como, por exemplo, completá-la sem ser visto ou matar usando determinado item, criando assim um grande estímulo a rejogar para tentar 100% de sincronização.Além destas citadas, há outras novidades como uma maior utilização da economia, de forma que é possível adquirir prédios públicos e comércios para depois investir neles, na prática uma ideia meio desperdiçada. Para liberar os estabelecimentos para compra, é necessário destruir uma torre de vigilância próxima e matar seu capitão, para que as tropas recuem e parem de intimidar os comerciantes.Uma coisa chata é a forma de se adquirir as armaduras e armas novas, que precisam ser desbloqueadas através de missões para as lojinhas em que são vendidas. Essas ""missões"" consistem em encontrar determinado número de itens específicos, e feito isso a peça é desbloqueada.  Dá para fazer as missões mesmo sem saber que está fazendo, mas de qualquer forma é chato ficar dependendo de sorte para encontrar os itens certos.Outra coisa ruim é que, além de possuir apenas uma cidade disponível (muito embora esta seja enorme), as partes desbloqueadas a cada memória são inescrupulosamente misturadas, de forma que há locais no meio do mapa que só são desbloqueados nas fases finais e pedaços da ponta que estão disponíveis desde o início, tornando tudo muito confuso.No fim das contas, AC Brotherhood é um jogo divertido e apesar de parecer mais uma expansão que um jogo novo, não cai na mesmice e apresenta uma qualidade tão alta quanto o seu antecessor. É altamente recomendado para todos aqueles que gostam de um jogo com uma boa história. EXCELENTE (9/10). "

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood has its evens and odds (like Uplay), but the odds can be reasoned with. I like most of the game, but what bugs kme the most is that when you want to play it, you MUST go through Uplay: meaning that you MUST have or create a(n) account in order to play the game you just (bought and) want to play. But other than Uplay, I would reccomend this game, it goes for the win, so you should buy it! And if you're feeling nastolgic, then you might want to play this.			"

Ezio is back with even more clever and amusing ways to kill Italian (and later, French) guards throughout Rome as you strive to rebuild the city for its people, along with additional character development with Desmond.Perhaps the most innovative thing about Brotherhood is its introduction of a multiplayer deathmatch, where the objective is to find and assassinate other chosen target players throughout a town or other similar map.

												This games pretty cool, I liked the new features they added to it. Being a part of the brotherhood comes in handy and makes you feel like your character really means something. I would suggest this game to anyone who has played any of the assassins creed games thus far, I would suggest playing the second game before this one so the story line makes more sense.			"

												Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is an aging title but still contains the core gameplay dynamic. The single player story is good and follows Desmond Miles on his quest to understand his ancestors and their pasts. Despite it's age it's still a good pick up, especially when it's on sale!			"

												Brotherhood is AC II but with more to it. Theres more content, more missions of a wider variety and lets you ride your horse in town, which AC II flatly refused to do. Also introduces a fast travel which makes things a little nicer. The story is better (in my opinion) in this game than the AC II and has a far more interesting antagonist.I'd recommend this game to anyone, but strongly suggest you play Assassin's Creed II first, as the story really requires you too.A criticism, probably my only one, is that on my PC the graphics have to be right down, and there are still a few stutters in the video. The sound is also out of sync with the video, meaning the lips say their part 10 seconds after the character has. But I still think this game is amazing.			"

												The game expands on everything Assassins Creed 2 was great at, as well as add in a few minor details such as secondary objectives now. The singleplayer is also longer this time and is in more depth so there aren't as many tutorial sections now. The multiplayer is lovingly excellent, only a few ppl can play it at a time however it is a great cat mouse style of gameplay with unique characters and abliities, seriously buy this as it £15 in the summer sale.

												 Most of you have most likely heard of Assassin's Creed so I won't bore you with details about the series as a whole. Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is the third installment to the series leaving off where Assassin's Creed 2 left off. The game feels very much like the second in many ways but the most notable is that the main character is still the assassin named Ezio, honestly most of the time I think of this more as an expansion pack instead of a standalone. Even with that being said many new features were brought into the game, most of these changes are still in the most recent release Black Flag. The game takes the gameplay of the second and enhances upon it, for example now you can equip the hidden gun with the sword or the dagger with throwing knives. Combat is far less time consuming with the introduction of the kill streaks, although this is useful it takes much of the difficulty out of the game. This is also the game that introduces assassin recruits, although it feels less refined than revalations they are still a very welcome addition to the game. Also the game adds some replayablity by allowing you to revisit missions unlike the second game, it even goes as far as to give you a reason to go back with extra objectives in a mission to accomplish what is known as ""full sync"". Full synchronization is nice for those who are completionists and want more out of the game but sometimes they get frustrating. Last but not least the controls are still a little touchy at times you may jump the completely wrong way, this can get very annoying especially when you jump off cliffs. Sorry about the rambling there, honestly this may not be mechanically my favorite of the series but it is still one of my favorites from the series. The game introduces many mechanics that would later be some of my favorite aspects to the series after they were refined. This game definitely has my approval for anyone thinking of purchasing.			"

												One of the better games of the series, Brotherhood continues with Ezio Auditore and adds in several fantastic elements to gameplay. One the whole, the game is smoother for low end computers than ACII. The character interaction is fantastic, and the addition of killstreaks completes the improved combat, allowing it to flow more smoothly.  The addition of the Borgia towers, as well as the improved economy, add a whole new level of detail to the game and a second alternate goal, the rebirth of Rome's economy. Many of the additions are continued in Revelations, although the combat is not as fine tuned. Overall, Brotherhood is a wonderful game and a must play for anyone interested in the series. But play ACII first. Seriously.			"

												Ac brotherhood is ac 2 part two. I think brotherhood is just as good as ac 2.  The only reason why i would put ac brotherhood on spot 2 is because the story in ac2 was just a little bit better (almost no difference (imo))I'm a huge fanboy of the series. This is my opinion. Story: It's about Ezio Auditore da Firenze. He's an assassin. When the templars attack he descides to go to rome (roma) to make an end to thetemplars. It's a really goood story! I just love it.gameplay: The gameplay hasn't really changed. There are more side quests in this game. and you never find yourself lacking of something to do. There is one diference. You now possess over a couple of assasin novices. who can help you in you in a fight or in stealth situations. graphics: The game is old and doesn't look amazing. But i for a game from this age, i wouldn't pay attention to it. verdict: if you liked ac 2 you MUST buy this. If you like any other ac game, consider buying it. If you are a real fan of the franchise you should have played it already.			"

												+ The recruits system is a new, fun mechanic to help breathe some life into gameplay.  + The Borgia family controlling Rome is a 'bad guy' you can see the effects of.  Gaining control over the city actually feels like something that matters, as opposed to this vague assassins vs templars thing that has lasted for three straight games and still never gets anywhere.+ Made horses more important and can now ride inside city.  Can assassinate while jumping from a horse for example.+ Rome is huge and there are plenty of things to see and do.  Some side missions take you to other areas of Italy for a nice change of pace once and a while.- Trying to execute certain moves is messy sometimes.  For example, trying to do an assassination mid air will sometimes just cause you to open your parachute and screw everything up.  Or from a horse you may just end up falling on them without a kill.  I think it boils down to too many 'moves' and not enough buttons for them all.  Stuff like this is rare but it happens enough that it will cause you to fail a mission more than once.- Constant prompts reminding you how to execute certain moves/jumps and tell you what to do next.  This was borderline too hand-holdy in ACII, but in Brotherhood it goes far beyond that line.- The modern day story is still shallow, confusing, and poorly written.- The events in the last hour or so of the game.  It doesn't even feel fair to use the whole ""to say it was rushed would be an understatement"" cliche, because wow.- Exclusive DLC STILL only availible on PS3 after 4 years. Go ♥♥♥♥ yourself, Ubisoft.Other thoughts:I do like the recuit system but it would be nice to have more interaction with them.  Ezio is rebuilding the brotherhood, and is training and fighting alongside these recruits for years.  It'd be nice to see some sort of bond or something forming between them.  They end up feeling like just another button to press.Having treasure maps that help find some of the scattered collectibles is nice.  Normally I wouldn't bother with them, but if I'm in an area and notice one is nearby, I'll feel more impelled to look for it.  Although, from what I noticed, they are still meaningless.  I collected 10 feathers, which are important enough to have their own drop off point (and are important to the family which is brought up in ACII), and when I got them all?  Nothing.It sounds like a contradiction: how can a game have so much stuff to do, but end up feeling so repetitive?  Not repetitive in the AC1 way; that was literally the same 4 tasks over and over.  The missions in ACII and Brotherhood do feel varied, but after a couple hundred or so missions of sneaking and/or stabbing, you start getting the thousand yard stare.  You always have plenty to do but it wears thin. I'm sure the new direction Black Flag took helped freshen things up, but that's two whole games from now.  Woof.All in all AC:Brotherhood was an enjoyable game and I think it's easy enough to recommend for anyone to play.  I just think I'll be taking a nice long break before even considering playing AC:Revelations.			"

												If you liked AC2, you will definitely enjoy the continuation of the story in AssBro.Focused on one big area with only a few side quests away from Rome, but with new weapons and a paradise for achievement hunters.Remember to get the Deluxe version if you want the extra SP missions and MP items, as you can't buy them if you only have the regular edition!

												This game is packed with endless side missions, quests, and features. It brings back the best of everything from its two predecessors and adds its own improvements. If Brotherhood has any weakness worth mentioning, it it's that the main story loses a bit of steam in the middle; with all the other stuff to do, though, you probably won't care.			"

												Ac brotherhood is ac 2 part two. I think brotherhood is just as good as ac 2.  The only reason why i would put ac brotherhood on spot 2 is because the story in ac2 was just a little bit better (almost no difference (imo))I'm a huge fanboy of the series. This is my opinion. Story: It's about Ezio Auditore da Firenze. He's an assassin. When the templars attack he descides to go to rome (roma) to make an end to thetemplars. It's a really goood story! I just love it.gameplay: The gameplay hasn't really changed. There are more side quests in this game. and you never find yourself lacking of something to do. There is one diference. You now possess over a couple of assasin novices. who can help you in you in a fight or in stealth situations. graphics: The game is old and doesn't look amazing. But i for a game from this age, i wouldn't pay attention to it. verdict: if you liked ac 2 you MUST buy this. If you like any other ac game, consider buying it. If you are a real fan of the franchise you should have played it already.			"

												This is recommended for the good storyline and great character building of Ezio, however the last hour was pretty boring. This was also horribly gltchy for me. Allies behaving like enemies, following allies and they just stop in place, falling through the bottom of the map, teleporting onto the edge of a cliff and falling, people in missions not appearing, also the last minute of Desmond dosnt work for me it just feezes and wont go onto the next scene, also for a couple days the game did not start for me. It seems like im the only one with these problems so it may just be me. Altough the story still allowed me to look past all that stuff and still be a good AC game.			"

												This is a pretty decent sequel. It ties up the loose ends of 2, and I like that we get to spend some time in the present. It's got to be a stroke of genius that you get to explore Monteriggioni in the present as Desmond. Inventory management is a lot better, you can equip different weapons without having to go all the way back to your safehouse. It's also pretty neat that you get to form your own guild of assassins.One thing I didn't like is the ""shop quests"" system, which requires you to collect trinkets like wool and tomatoes just so you can buy a sword that's relevant to the game, and the specific trinkets are hard to come by. It requires you to grind and loot and hunt for chests which takes away from the fun.I also didn't like the addition of random encounters, especially since they increase notoriety. I don't want to have to digress from the quest I'm on to kill a bunch of guys and hunt down posters to tear down. It gets really old, really fast.			"

												Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is the third development in Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed series. Brotherhood continues the narrative of Ezio Auditore, the Master Assassin from Florence, introduced in Assassin's Creed II. As Ezio and his ally, Machiavelli are forced to relocate their guild to Roma (Rome) following persecution from the ruling party of Roma, the Borgia. Ezio continues his quest to secure the Apple of Eden and keep it from the hands of the Templars. Brotherhood has exhilirating combat, semi-fluent parkour, and a large basin of armour, melee and ranged weapons, equipment, and aesthetic colours to add to your ever-developing costume. Brotherhood introduced recruiting Assassins into the series, personally one of my favourite mechanics. Being able to send your comrades out on tasks for the Brotherhood, call them into battle to assist you, or have them rain arrows in defense of their mentor is quite appealing to the Assassin's Creed fan. You have the ability to increase your Assassin follower's armour levels by equipping them with sturdier armour upon leveling up, and equipping them with better weapons, all the while developing their skills as an Assassin. The game does encounter some relatively frequent graphical glitches and rare crash errors. Especially towards the late game, the cinematics will often not trigger or a required clause will not register as 'met', causing the need to revert to a checkpoint or restart a memory, which can sometimes be considered gamebreaking. In total, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a fantastic development in the Assassin's Creed series, which sets up the story for the fourth game, Assassin's Creed Revelations.Score: 94/100			"

												Another addition to the fantastic franchise that is Assassins Creed, this being the third in the series. After playing the second assassins creed and surprisingly enjoying it whilst sinking many hours into it, I took it upon myslef to play the only game in the franchise I had yet to play. The game is, fantastic, the story is gripping and engaging and the very fact that you are Ezio Auditore Firenze makes it that much better. The soundtrack has a kind of magic to it, that fits in perfectly with the atmosphere of the game.There is plenty to do, the addition of an economic system in Rome to which you can invest in is excellent, and managing recruits all the way to assassins is a brilliant part of the game.Other than that, this is a great game, will leave you entertained for many hours, and bring out the assassin that lingers within you....8/10			"

												If you definitely want to get this game make sure you play AC2 first because this game is a continuation on the story.So the best way I can describe this game is: it's enjoyable bs. I recommend the game because it's fun and entertaining and if that's what you're looking for then great but if you're a seasoned gamer then you probably want to avoid this; it's going to bore you. The combat is so dumbed down and an example of this is countering. All you have to do is press the counter button at the right time and your guy will automatically position himself and rotate to take out the enemy. Large groups of enemies pose barely any threat as they basically wait their turn to attack you. ""I see you're attacking my friend there, no problem buddy I’ll wait until you're finished before I start to attack you"". It's so easy, I haven't died once yet, and have barely lost any health. In fact I've lost more health from fall damage because he often wouldn't jump the direction I was pointing lol.The game is also so planned out for you. So much hand holding. Sneak in without being detected by guards. There just happens to be a big pile of hay to jump down into, and the only guard in the vicinity just happens to be standing in front, with his back to you for an easy kill.However, the story in the game is well done and there is quite a lot of depth in this game which is awesome. For example you can invest in places or you can hire and send assassin recruits on missions and you can train them up to help you in battle. That's why I recommend this game. It may be a bit simple but the fact is the game is still entertaining and I'm having fun playing it. "

												Remember when this game came out 5 years ago? Remember how much uplay sucked and people were frustrated and outraged? Well it's 5 years later, and nothing has changed or been fixed. Have fun not even being able to play the game. Fortunately I own a mac and a pc, and while I literally cannot log into uplay without it crashing on pc, it worked okay (not great, but okay) on my macbook. So while uplay is a massive pain, I'll try to stick to reviewing the actual game. The most important part of a game in my opinion is the gameplay, and that is definitely the best part of AC: Brotherhood. Freerunning around Rome, climbing all over mysterious ruins, and generally exploring and getting around the map, even outside of missions, is a lot of fun. Solving the various puzzles within the levels is also a blast. The combat is definitely too easy, and I could confidently take on dozens of enemies at once, as they just stand around yelling at me, attacking one by one. I understand why it is like this, where's the fun in realistically being beaten to death by dozens of guards at once, however fights with large numbers of enemies happens regularly, and it is extremely noticeable. As to plot, AC: Brotherhood has a decent story going for it, but I found it a bit over the top a lot of the time, kinda melodramatic, then again it's a videogame, and that's par for the course, almost required. The plot is definitely a good length, not cutting off too abruptly or dragging on forever, and outside of the story missions there is a lot to do. It's difficult to say how long the plot is, since my game time is not displaying properly. I've actually played through the game twice, and played a significant amount of the multiplayer, which isn't terribly active these days, but can be an absolute blast if you find a time where enough people are playing. There is some replayability to the game, but not tons. Going back through the memories and replaying specific missions that you enjoyed is a nice feature, so that you don't have to replay the entire game, can just enjoy the 'highlight reel'.Overall, I think the game is worth playing, and is one of the stronger entries to the series, but would Ubisoft please just kill uplay with fire already? Seriously...			"

												Rome is awesome.In AC: Brotherhood, Ezio travels to Rome to confront the younger Cesare Borgia for being an evil twit. The plot revolves around the Assassin brotherhood, and gaining ground in society. That was my favorite aspect of the game, the recruiting and training of the assassins.The actual plot involves Cesare Borgia, the son of the Rodrigo Borgia, or Pope Alexander VI. Cesare is a psychopath in the truest standards. He's relentless and lusts for blood.As you can imagine, the gameplay is much like the previous game, but with some fixes to the parkour. Also, the graphics look a little bit better. Not much else changed in technical terms though.It's a great game regardless, and the vast openness of Rome was epic, yet a little boring in the area south of the Coliseum.9.2/10			"

												The  parts of the game that I played are great, I played for 12 hours straight one day. Then I came across the Leonardo missions, and like many other people could not steer the bomber, I tried everything that was said in forums but none worked. But, that was just a side quest so I just said meh, who needs it.I got all the way to seq 9, and I was like oh♥♥♥♥♥♥boys I'm ready, I was staring down the head of the Borgia, but the fight wouldn't trigger and he was stuck there with no collision just fighting some random grunts, I tried again some of the things forums suggested but none have worked yet, verifing game cache right now.Along with moments of pure frustration when the controls make you jump off a borgia tower, it has to be negative.And I know that I most probably could fix my game but backing up my save and reinstalling, but why should I have to.But a positive is I didn't have to do anything to get a screen res for a 21:9 monitor.Requiescat en Pace my AC Brotherhood career.Update: Verifying game cache fixed my problem so it's back at it!

												I was pleased with AC2, and to be perfectly honest AssCreeBro is the same basic game under the hood. But I cannot recommend this installment in the series like I did its predecessor.The real shame here is that Rome has none of the charm of AC2's brilliant levels. Where Florence was towering and beautiful, Venice labyrinthine and mysterious, and Tuscany open and warm, Rome is just a dissapointment. It feels lifeless and indistinct, even small at times.Adding to the problem is AssCreeBro's story. AC2 got it right, by telling a straightforward story about the protagonist's journey from simple vengeance to deciphering his role in a larger mystery. AssCreeBro falters, picking up immediately after the admitedly weak finale of AC2 and going nowhere slowly. After the Borgia launch a counter attack that an idiot should have seen coming a mile away, Ezio heads to Rome to regain the Apple and thwart his enemies. The plan includes rebuilding the Assassin order, which plays out in a profoundly boring way. You meet bland, faceless citizens who are under attack, save them, then recruit them to your cause, where they become bland, faceless assassins who do nothing of plot significance. You'll slowly ""liberate"" Rome by climbing towers (and setting them on fire for some reason), and then buying all the shops in the area.AssCreeBro adds a few features (like the Assassin recruits). The disappointing part is that most of those new features are bland or unnecessary. The investment minigame seems to exist only to fuel itself. The missions you send your recruits on earn a tiny amount of gold and do nothing for the plot. New ""full syncronization"" challenges have been added to every mission, further restricting the way you experience this open world adventure (usually in arbitrary ways that don't make any sense and often with bugs).Without the charm of the setting or story, issues that have plagued Assassin's Creed gameplay since the original begin to take center stage. The controls are atrocious. On PC, the stronger option is to use an Xbox controller rather than wrestle with the horrible keyboard/mouse options. On the controller, one must hold the left trigger to perform all the most common actions. The X and A buttons on the controller are each map to dozens of different (often contradictory) context sensitive commands, and other buttons are under-utilized or outright ignored. Keep in mind, none of these issues is new to AssCreeBro, its just that without the distractions these issues swiftly come to dominate the experience.Its not that AssCreeBro is bad - its just not good enough to overlook the flaws. If you're already invested in the series, you might want to power through this chapter, but if not, I'd skip right past it.			"

Being able to send your comrades out on tasks for the Brotherhood, call them into battle to assist you, or have them rain arrows in defense of their mentor is quite appealing to the Assassin's Creed fan. You have the ability to increase your Assassin follower's armour levels by equipping them with sturdier armour upon leveling up, and equipping them with better weapons, all the while developing their skills as an Assassin. The game does encounter some relatively frequent graphical glitches and rare crash errors. Especially towards the late game, the cinematics will often not trigger or a required clause will not register as 'met', causing the need to revert to a checkpoint or restart a memory, which can sometimes be considered gamebreaking. In total, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a fantastic development in the Assassin's Creed series, which sets up the story for the fourth game, Assassin's Creed Revelations.Score: 94/100			"

												This is a pretty decent sequel. It ties up the loose ends of 2, and I like that we get to spend some time in the present. It's got to be a stroke of genius that you get to explore Monteriggioni in the present as Desmond. Inventory management is a lot better, you can equip different weapons without having to go all the way back to your safehouse. It's also pretty neat that you get to form your own guild of assassins.One thing I didn't like is the ""shop quests"" system, which requires you to collect trinkets like wool and tomatoes just so you can buy a sword that's relevant to the game, and the specific trinkets are hard to come by. It requires you to grind and loot and hunt for chests which takes away from the fun.I also didn't like the addition of random encounters, especially since they increase notoriety. I don't want to have to digress from the quest I'm on to kill a bunch of guys and hunt down posters to tear down. It gets really old, really fast.			"

												Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is the third development in Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed series. Brotherhood continues the narrative of Ezio Auditore, the Master Assassin from Florence, introduced in Assassin's Creed II. As Ezio and his ally, Machiavelli are forced to relocate their guild to Roma (Rome) following persecution from the ruling party of Roma, the Borgia. Ezio continues his quest to secure the Apple of Eden and keep it from the hands of the Templars.

												This is recommended for the good storyline and great character building of Ezio, however the last hour was pretty boring. This was also horribly gltchy for me. Allies behaving like enemies, following allies and they just stop in place, falling through the bottom of the map, teleporting onto the edge of a cliff and falling, people in missions not appearing, also the last minute of Desmond dosnt work for me it just feezes and wont go onto the next scene, also for a couple days the game did not start for me. It seems like im the only one with these problems so it may just be me. Altough the story still allowed me to look past all that stuff and still be a good AC game.			"

												Pros: you can raise litttle assassin ducklings and make them into full fledged badasses who can save you when you do something stupid like aggro every borgia in italy, you get to kill templars in increasingly clever ways, and shaun/rebecca is some good stuff.Cons: more forced camera angles. I do not enjoy when I'm running forward and ezio suddenly takes a sharp right and plummets to his doom. If you can get past that, I'd recommend it. I enjoyed the II characters that carried over, usually more than I did in II.			"

												Again, you play Desmond who plays a game set in the past in order to find clues in the future. Sadly still for Desmond, the character he controls in the game still likes to vere to the left when told to jump straight and assassinate bystanders standing behind guards. Though, Desmond seems to care little for those he kills in game as the Death toll really peeks in this game. In this title you rise up in the ranks from mere Assassin and owner of a small kingdom to the man who bought all of Rome through the proceeds of his personal vendetta. You earn followers along the way and can begin outsourcing much of the killing so you can focus on walking slowly through the streets and avoiding minstrels.Over time you will gain all the coolest gear that you had in the previous game but as with many games you are just handed a BFG for part of the finale and the tools you have earned can not be used in the lead up to the final pay off.  Luckily you hand that BFG and all your wealth to DaVinci and go in search of the bad guy at the end. Sadly, your posse of outsourced Assassins which you have earned throughout the game and painstakingly leveled up will not join you in the final battles so you will have to kill this final bad guy yourself.. and boy is it tedious. Why are the cowardly bad guys in games that throw wave after wave of guards at you always the most tedious to kill?4 stars.			"

												Starting immediatly after the ending of Assassin's Creed II, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood continues and finishes Ezio's story through Italy. Compared to it's predecessor, the story is much weaker, but everything else is greatly improved. This game also signaled the beginning of annual Assassin's Creed games, but this is a very good one. The map is shorter than all the combined maps of the previous game, but Rome feels more cohesive and alive, because the crowds are more dynamic and diversified. The combat is mostly the same, except for a new ""kill streak"" that makes it easier but more fluid. The stealth sections are also unchanged, but a new crossbow also makes it easier. This game also introduced a replay mission feature, optional objectives, and your own assassin's guild, making combat and stealth even easier, but it's a nice addition. A true sequel that feels both old and new in a good way. Even the Desmond sections are fun to play this time around. This was also the first Assassin's Creed with multiplayer, and although the servers are still online, almost no one plays it anymore, so i can't review it.Regarding Uplay, i also didn't run into problems this time (no cloud saving), but that doesn't mean that i still agree with it.

												Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is an excellent game. It offers plenty of playtime and a great city to explore. While it isn't much different from the gameplay in AC2, it does change and add a few new things. It does only offer 1 city (Rome) to explore while AC2 offers 4 cities (Venice, Florence, Forli, and Tuscany). For that reason and a few others, AC2 is the better game in my opinion. Nonetheless, Brotherhood is a worthy sequel to an amazing franchise. 9/10 Great Game :)			"

												Brotherhood is Assassin's Creed at its best. It takes what's best from AC2 and makes it even better, while changing the mission structure to be more open-world than previous games. I love the ability to call assassins at any time during the game. There's only one city to explore, but Rome is absolutely big and varied, and full of things to do. It's a great and geographically varied setting, ranging from rural areas to densely populated city areas. There's also some additional levels outside the city (Leonardo's war machines missions) and some nice surprises along the way. The secret locations from AC2 also make a return as fantastically designed Lairs of Romulus - these are some great platforming levels and completing them is a real pleasure.Brotherhood has a great cast of characters and the overall story is interesting. My only gripe is lack of character development for side characters later in the game - Claudia, Maria and Leonardo all suffer from this, leaving their stories a bit incomplete. What's great about Brotherhood is also the modern day bit of the story. It's fantastic - and you actually get to do things as Desmond.This Assassin's Creed outing has also introduced multiplayer for the first time in the series. Keep in mind that unfortunately multiplayer is mostly dead, as the player base moved to newer games in the series.One last thing: you can also unofficially unlock a free Copernicus DLC that was previously PS3 exclusive. Check out this guide for more information:

												Apparently I've played AC II Brotherhood way longer then AC II, which already speaks for itself.This game is awesome by all means, and has few improvements and new stuff not witnessed in earlier games of the series:Pros:- Storyline. Still captivating, interesting, with lots of likable and not likable characters. - If AC I was repetitive and AC II not so much, AC II Brotherhood is a mixture of the two, but in a positive way. If you like grinding (like I do, especially in beautiful Roman surroundings), there is a lot of it  (A LOT). And somehow it didn't bore me. On a contrary: additional quests were interesting, many of them different, only some of them felt lazy. Flags are back, and of course feathers and treasure chests. - Game gives you option to either buy maps which point to all the hidden stuff, but you don't have to buy them. You can grind them by yourself. Options are always a good thing.- Environment, architecture, Rome, graphics, music: sometimes you just want to ride around Colosseum with no purpose other then admire stuff around you and in distant perspective.- Eagle vision is still useful!- Leonardo's war machines quest line was one hell of a ride.- You will be able to rebuild assassins brotherhood, recruit your own people, train them and use their help should you choose so. This is a blast. One completely new instalment and it is awesome.Cons:- So many weapons, and majority of it still serves only as collection trophies.- I remember that throwing knives were useful in AC I. Somehow they are not useful here (as they weren't in AC II).- Combat is as it was. I think I got used to it, but it has not been improved. Oh, wait, you can kick people now to break their guard.- Freakin camera angle almost made me pull my hair out during few missions.- There is this new stuff I don't recall from before: full synch. To fully synchronize you are required to finish the memory in given way. Sometimes it will demand from you to take no damage (really? Where's fun in taking no damage?), sometimes it requires you to complete memory in few minutes (forcing you to get back to the location for full discovery which can take three times that long). The only synch requirements I liked were the ones that enforced stealth play (aka. not being detected). But I guess it's a matter of taste.- I don't remember any outstanding bug. Oh, but it's a cons section. I guess I expected them as a ""fun"" part of the game. Ubisoft is bending perspectives ;)Overall: I love this game. Brotherhood is also the first AC  game where you can play online. I have yet to try it, though I'm not very eager at the moment. Heading to part 3 of Ezio trilogy. "

												((Now, to start with; I should probably say that I played this game during 2013, so quite a long time after the initial release. So this review will not play on any nostalgia, whatsoever.I thought Assassins's Creed IV: Black Flag looked like a really good game, and as a fan of pirates I felt that it was something I definately wanted to play, but due to me being a massive lore nerd I felt I had to play all the predecessors beforehand. That hopefully explains my playstyle of this title, I just wanted to get thru it, doing only the odd side objectives, in order to get to the more recent games quickly.))After playing Assassin's Creed II, and even more; Assassin's Creed (I), I wasn't looking forward towards playing Brotherhood, (or Revelations). This mostly because I didn't enjoy the first two games; both of them had huge problems in pacing and storytelling. That said; Ezio's story (started in Assassin's Creed II) was a lot more intriguing, but dragged on for far too long to keep my interest up. As, already stated, I just wanted to rush thru these games, so I only saw them as an obstacle. But as soon as this game started up I noticed something different; the game didn't run like♥♥♥♥♥♥on my machine! I can report that the PC-port of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is far, far better than the two previous iterations. But the positivities doesn't stop there either! I guess ""Third time's the charm"" really is the truth. The pacing and overall story is also miles ahead of it's predecessors, keeping me intrigued and caring all the way thru. The main storyline is also noticibly shorter than it's direct prequel, more in line with the first game in the series, coming in at around 10 hours. Don't let this discard you from playing it tho, as this is really the perfect length for the game as you don't end up doing menial tasks for hours, which was the case for both the previous games. The parkour gameplay does also seem to be improved upon, but that just my be the cause of me feeling far more positive about the game. It also helps that the adventure, this time around, only takes place in one city; Roma (Rome). Making it a lot easier to grasp the scale of the game and keeping you on track.The biggest thing however is the Desmond storyline, which before only was uninspired and very hard to care about. Now, however it dragged me in considerably and when I finally finished it I instantly installed Revelations to find out how this storyline ends.In the end, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a far, far better game than both it's predecessors. And if you (unlike me) isn't a massive lore nerd, who wants to find out every twist and turn, you do get a quick catch-up at the beginning so that you won't feel completely lost, making the game possible for me to recommend.

												What is there to say about Assassin's Creed Brotherhood? It's definitely an amazing game that can entertain you for hours and still make you want to come back for more. It is such an open world game and the things to do sometimes can see limitless. The game definitely builds off of the success and completely bada**ery that both Assassin's Creed 1&2 had to offer. I played this game so many times on the Xbox 360 that purchasing it for the PC was just a must. The new additions to the game make it just even better than the ones before it and it just keeps building up in a positive way. Especially with the most amazing thing they could have ever added, but I won't spoilt it ;)If you have the extra time and money, definitely get this game. Especially if you love platforming, action/adventure, with some stealth here and there. It is very much worth it.I also recommend Assassin's Creed 1&2 as well.EDIT: I would also recommend to play this game with a gaming controller.			"

												The jumping puzzles were more obnoxious than what was in AC2, but the story was all around stronger to me, in that I actually understood who I was fighting and why, which is more than I could say about AC2. All in all, a good game for me. I enjoyed the city-rebuilding aspects and the crit-path chain isn't obnoxiously long like it felt in AC2. I did skip some of the side content, like the tomb explorations, since I hated those in AC2 and they're not critical anyway. Storywise, it ends on a definite cliffhanger, so there's definitely an impetus to head into AC: Revelations right afterward.			"

Brotherhood has the most enjoyable and free flowing combat system that truly makes you feel like a real master Assassin. Be sure to exploit every single crevice of Rome to find all the sidequests, because once you're hooked to this game, (which you will without a doubt be,) you will be thirsting for every drop of this game's content.

												Great continuation of the series.Like any other AC game, some of the missions can get boring, and a bit of the same over and over.But the story, voice acting and non-linear pacing helps for any play style.The ending is a real cliff hanger but really sets you up for the other installment, and continues the tradition of a great storyline.If you're into the AC story, this part is necessary.

												When compared to AC2, Sisterhood to a large extent is more of the same, although it brings back some elements from AC1 (flags, begging women, citizens tackling enemies, occasional trips out of animus to read other people's emails) and adds new things, too (most importantly, you're getting to be head of assassin's guild in single player campaing; and yes, there's multiplayer added). Instead of segmentation into many smaller cities though, the majority of the action is on one huge map (Rome) with heaps of side missions to chose from at any single moment so it has more sandboxy feeling.I actually liked this more than AC2. Mostly due to this game having more actual ""game"" in it. Gamification is above all present in the missions that sport an additional requirement for 100%ing it. Sometimes it gives real challenge like time trial, sometimes it actually limits your choices to specific weapons or angles of approach but sort of works to keep things varied. And the whole sandboxy aspect is also what I liked.'Cause yeah lack of challenge, mostly in the fights (guards actually hit harder now and there's more of them, but conversely you get more efficient ways of killing them so it's still too easy), and feel of an interactive movie instead or something, is a beef I have with the series. I guess I embraced it though by now and even started to somewhat enjoy those overpowered fights. Still missing focus on stealth, but I don't mind it either anymore (I adjusted my expectations, eh? :D some missions ask you to remain undetected but stealth never seems to be the focus, really, you just charge head on or literally flick your fingers to kill every enemy on screen)You still gotta love the parkour, rooftop jumping aspect, raiding tombs is fun too, there's a dash of puzzling involved tho not much, and story continuing present day and Ezio's day affairs still enjoyable, even though it doesn't really touch me deep on an emotional level.About the story... The side missions don't directly connect to the main arc of retrieving the ""magic apple"", they have more to do with Ezio going all ""I'm gonna pull the whole thing down. I'm gonna bring the whole f*n' diseased, corrupt temple down on your head"" on the Borgias or, rather, living in denial that he fudged up royally and instead explaining to everyone that you gotta have more systemic approach rather than playing the cutting-down-hydra's-heads game. Hence all the Rome rebuilding, winning minds of various factions and citizens etc.So the main story may feel somewhat diluted and I guess people mostly enjoying the story aspect may be bit underwhelmed. Like I said, I personally didn't mind and actually like the game more even though it seems actually less focused on whole assassin's creed ordeal.Oh, and Desmond Miles in present day finally gets some of focus and action, after all ac2 was supposed to prepare him for some parkouring in the present day so yeah, he gets some :3			"

												This game's alright. It's not as good as Assassin's Creed II. It's not terribly worse, but it doesn't really add anything. It continues the adventures of Ezio Auditore: the renaissance-y murder specialist and Desmond. Desmond deserves no description as he is blander than wet graham crackers. This might sound like I'm jumping on the Hate-Desmond bandwagon. I am because said bandwagon is warm and has free wifi and is GENERALLY CORRECT. This game is good if your a fan of the series and curious to see what happens to Ezio, but it doesn't do anything that interesting or new. As usual it adds some new weapons and a new setting. They have replaced the two fairly large cities of Florence and Venice with the pretty large city of Rome. You went to Rome briefly in the last game for an oddly linear mission, but it's back and fleshed out into a totally new map. Rome is neat, considering it has it's fair share of cool landmarks. The Colosseum comes to mind. Rome is one of the only things that is new though. You still follow the same group of modern day people: Lucy (who falls a bit deep into the uncanny valley), the british guy and the other woman. You still follow Ezio (now a bit older, with a beard, but still as spritely as ever.) The bad guys are still the Borgias and you still take down key members of the family in a quite brutal game of Family Feud. Money is back too. This time you have to renovate all of Rome, which leads me to ask how the f*ck does Ezio have permission to fix the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Colosseum. Anyway, the game's pretty good. If you plan on playing the Assassin's Creed series then I suggest picking this one up, at least to fill in the story holes. It's pretty fun, but doesn't do much. The name is a key indicator. It's not Assassin's Creed III (that's a different game). It's not a straight sequel. It's more of a time occupier. However, it's pretty good.			"

												Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is essentially a large expansion to Assassin's Creed II. However, do not let that determine your impression. Brotherhood is a fantastic game, building upon Assassin's Creed II while resolving issues from the previous title simultaneously. Renaissance Rome is also truly and remarkably beautiful, as is the seamless combat when finally mastered. The multiplayer support is a little shakey, at best, but the single player campaign is worth the purchase on its own.			"

												What is there to say about Assassin's Creed Brotherhood? It's definitely an amazing game that can entertain you for hours and still make you want to come back for more. It is such an open world game and the things to do sometimes can see limitless. The game definitely builds off of the success and completely bada**ery that both Assassin's Creed 1&2 had to offer. I played this game so many times on the Xbox 360 that purchasing it for the PC was just a must. The new additions to the game make it just even better than the ones before it and it just keeps building up in a positive way. Especially with the most amazing thing they could have ever added, but I won't spoilt it ;)If you have the extra time and money, definitely get this game. Especially if you love platforming, action/adventure, with some stealth here and there. It is very much worth it.I also recommend Assassin's Creed 1&2 as well.EDIT: I would also recommend to play this game with a gaming controller.			"

Assassins you can choose to go Amor, Weapons or both. You can choose to Dye your Assassin's with a few presets. You can send your Assassins to missions giving you money and them experience.-Alot of side quests-A big Variety of Gear-Controller support-Amazing Kill AnimationsNegatives.-Lack of Customization-Messy Keyboard & Mouse Controlls (at start)-Very low amount of Missions in the Real life-Full Synchronazition for Missions is very Minor-Combat is Very easy and Stealth is only Nececary in Missions-Collectable Prizes are nothing but Outfits and AchievementsAssassin's Creed Brotherhood is The best in my opinion 9/10			"

												Without any concernable doubt, this is by far the greatest game to ever grace the Assassin's Creed series. Brotherhood has the most enjoyable and free flowing combat system that truly makes you feel like a real master Assassin. Be sure to exploit every single crevice of Rome to find all the sidequests, because once you're hooked to this game, (which you will without a doubt be,) you will be thirsting for every drop of this game's content.

												((Now, to start with; I should probably say that I played this game during 2013, so quite a long time after the initial release. So this review will not play on any nostalgia, whatsoever.I thought Assassins's Creed IV: Black Flag looked like a really good game, and as a fan of pirates I felt that it was something I definately wanted to play, but due to me being a massive lore nerd I felt I had to play all the predecessors beforehand. That hopefully explains my playstyle of this title, I just wanted to get thru it, doing only the odd side objectives, in order to get to the more recent games quickly.))After playing Assassin's Creed II, and even more; Assassin's Creed (I), I wasn't looking forward towards playing Brotherhood, (or Revelations). This mostly because I didn't enjoy the first two games; both of them had huge problems in pacing and storytelling. That said; Ezio's story (started in Assassin's Creed II) was a lot more intriguing, but dragged on for far too long to keep my interest up. As, already stated, I just wanted to rush thru these games, so I only saw them as an obstacle. But as soon as this game started up I noticed something different; the game didn't run like♥♥♥♥♥♥on my machine! I can report that the PC-port of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is far, far better than the two previous iterations. But the positivities doesn't stop there either! I guess ""Third time's the charm"" really is the truth. The pacing and overall story is also miles ahead of it's predecessors, keeping me intrigued and caring all the way thru. The main storyline is also noticibly shorter than it's direct prequel, more in line with the first game in the series, coming in at around 10 hours. Don't let this discard you from playing it tho, as this is really the perfect length for the game as you don't end up doing menial tasks for hours, which was the case for both the previous games. The parkour gameplay does also seem to be improved upon, but that just my be the cause of me feeling far more positive about the game. It also helps that the adventure, this time around, only takes place in one city; Roma (Rome). Making it a lot easier to grasp the scale of the game and keeping you on track.The biggest thing however is the Desmond storyline, which before only was uninspired and very hard to care about. Now, however it dragged me in considerably and when I finally finished it I instantly installed Revelations to find out how this storyline ends.In the end, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a far, far better game than both it's predecessors. And if you (unlike me) isn't a massive lore nerd, who wants to find out every twist and turn, you do get a quick catch-up at the beginning so that you won't feel completely lost, making the game possible for me to recommend.

												So first off, Uplay. Ew. And figuring it out can be a pain. But Brotherhood is an excellent game. Traversing Rome (which is absolutely gorgeous) by way of the roofs, streets, or on horseback is enjoyable. The combat system is fluid and easy to master while still being fun. You start the game feeling like a badass and end feeling like an even badasser badass. Slowly taking over the city and recruiting and upgrading your assassins is gratifying. The missions aren't incredibly varied (though some differ incredibly, like the ones with Leonardo da Vinci's war machines) but they remain fun, because, again, you feel like a badass. I'd definitely recommend this game, even at full price.			"

												Like its predecessor, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a better game than its predecessor. It too, has numerous flaws and many shortcomings. While there is one game in this series that really stands out, this one, again, isn't it. What you have here is polished, prettier Assassin's Creed II. I'm not really sure how I logged 117 hours on it. I think some of it was me trying to convince myself that there was more to this game than there really is.In contrast to ACII's sprawling-conspiracy-web story spanned across several cities and decades, here we get a more tension-based story based in one city over about 5 years.That change is for the better, though the story doesn't improve -- we still get the same absurd plans. Befriend the courtesans then use them to acquire an outfit to follow a chest of money back to a party to kill 'The Banker' to cut off Cesare's funds to stop his war effort? What? Get a key to the Castello di Sant'Angelo by befriending the thieves so you can steal outfits to a play so you can sneak into the play so you can save an actor Cesare wants dead so the actor can give you the key? Again, what? The plot is nonsense.Fight Cesare to the death of his neck armor. His neck armor is endless.Particularly painful, and Assassin's Creed as a series is often guilty of this, are the missions where you are assigned the task of killing the primary antagonists early in the game. It is so obvious that you will not succeed in this task and that it will turn into a 'mission-gone wrong' situation that it's painful.Clumsily extending 1 memory in 1 sequence into 5 memories to make the game seem longer than it really is -- pretty common for this game. The soundtrack, while it does use some of AC2's great tracks, develops its own style. This style is sort of a lower, thumping, tension-building sort of music. It works, the game succeeds at developing its own atmosphere apart from AC2.Visually, the game is still gorgeous. The beautiful color saturation and the way the whites and reds stand out in this 1500s depiction of Rome really add to the atmosphere and feel of the game. Rome is great to look at. There is plenty of side content, most of it fun. Christina missions fill in some blank spaces about Ezio's past with Christina in AC2. Leonardo's war machines are entertaining but ridiculous -- destroy Leonardo's machine gun, tank, and air-cannon to stop the Borgia from using them. The followers of Romulus missions are similar to the crypt-exploration missions from AC2. There are also many thief, courtesan, and assassin contracts to undertake.So there is definitely plenty to do. I should warn that most of these things simply have little replay value. The novelty and enjoyment of completing these tasks wears off the first time you do them.The reason for this is that the game is incredibly easy and there is not much way of making it harder. Assassin's Creed has always lacked difficulty settings. In Brotherhood, especially, they would be appreciated. The simple addition of chain kills makes the game so ridiculously easy that some form of higher difficulty is really needed to justify playing through this game again. This is even without using your assassin recruits. However, higher difficulties often involves taking different strategies, new approaches, rethinking how you play the game. Clearly, every task in this game was designed for there to be 1 way to complete it. It's not really all that open in what approach you take.So, in the end, what we have here is a beautiful expansion pack to Assassin's Creed II that outdoes Assassin's Creed II in nearly every way. One can excuse it's horrible story because, well, every game in this series prior to this one also has a horrible story! What did you expect? Pick it up for $10 or less for a good time.			"

												This is the first  of the 3  Assassin's Creed's so far that gives some love to the pc version. Way improved graphics, user interface and the like.(the keys map to the pc keys for the first time).  The fiction, gameplay and aesthetic are all there again and I highly recommend Brotherhood if you enjoyed the last 2 at all.			"

												The best Assassin's Creed game In my opinion. 2 reasons which are the story and Ezio.Of course, the first Assassin's Creed is great, the story and all but the world is not like the one in the second and Brotherhood.I'd suggest you get this game if you like historical games, the gameplay is great, the story is amazing, the characters are superb.By the way, I've spent more than 100 hours on this game outside of steam, I've play from scratch many times.9/10			"

												Good game. Runs flawlessly. Combat is addictive. The continued plotline is fantastic. Game is let down by an incessant need to upgrade and purchase everything, which distracts from the idea of being an ""assassin"". Or at least for me this felt odd compare to the previous entries in the series. The highlights for me have always been the modern day sections out of the animus. I'd like it more if ubisoft played around a bit more with the character you adopt in the animus rather than fixating on ezio. Sure he's a great character but I'm getting tired and it's obvious that Revelations will still feature Ezio... when I wish they moved on. Still it's their project and not mine, so it's up to them to deliver what they envisage			"

												+) Epic ending like previous series. Actually more epic. I was in tears.+) Controlling became LITTLE better I suppose? Maybe it was just me who got a little more used to it.+) If I want to finish it, I'd say it's a fun game. However just like the previous series it has serious bugs and aggravating parts. So prepare yourself spilling some harsh language at Etzio. Ezio? Who cares. That stupidly running parkour maniac. PULL FASTER! You will know waht I mean if you play. Hahahahahaha.+) Action became much more efficient and smoothing.+) I liked the graphics. These days games tend to become requiring needlessly high spec PC but I'd say this, The Division, and GTA 5 is where graphics should stop and focus on programming you know? This is enough.-) Too many side quests! What the heck! Did you see the map? How did you even manage to put icons so close to each other like that? Jesus!-) Hey, if you're going to jump whole chunk of story because you spent too much time on side quests, just reduce it and focus on main quests! What the heck are you doing?-) Gliding quest was irritating as my grand mother.			"

												This is my 2nd game in the series I own after playing AC2 never thought I would buy another one. The Deluxe was on sale for $7.98 so thought I would give it one more chance. I can only recommend this series if you have patience which I seem to lack for AC. If they spent their money on better design in control and view angles this could have been a better series. I get tired of not being able to do what I want and fighting the game system. Can only take it in small doses as in 1 - 2 hrs till frustration sets in and have to  walk away for a day and try again. This series is not designed for PC and if it is I would be hiring new designers. I would only recommend this series on a %50 to %75 sale. It has its moments and graphics are better but was never the problem to begin with. To me they tease us with graphics and story and let us down on actuall game play and I would take game play over graphics. Story is important but what good is a story if playing is frustrating.On sale it is worth the challenging play.			"

												Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a great game. The setting is amazing. But as for my own opinion is concerned, I think Rome is not entirely remade as it should be in this game. The Capitolini is to the contrary of real life, in which it is way bigger. The Forum Romanum is just awfully done. The only thing the makers did well is the placement of all the buildings, the rest they just ♥♥♥♥ed up. The Pantheon and the Colosseum however are a blast to see and experience in ACB, they are pretty well remade. Just as much as in Assassin's Creed 2, I hate the storyline of Desmond and Co. Seriously, this is getting really annoying. Ubisoft knew nobody liked and cared about Ezio's story, but still they decided to put this son of a B. in another 2 games. This kills the fun for me. But still i love Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, even though it's a replica of Assassin's Creed 2 with a few adjustments just in another city, it's still a good game to play.Have fun playing.EDIT: It would be nice if you could actually skip the 18 minute long credits instead of waiting them through...

												Assassins creed brotherhood - это третья часть популярного франчайза assassins creed от компании Ubisoft. В этой части была изменена система боя, что облегчает сражения. Вам предстоит стать предводителем гильдии ассасинов, которая сражается против тамплиеров. Вы в любой момент можете вызвать их на помощь что тоже облегчает сражения.

Саундтрек самый лучший в игровой индустрии.В игре появился мультиплеер. В целом  похуже 2 части.			"

												Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is an impressive game, especially for when it released.  A true open world, that can rival open worlds in 2016 games easily.The game takes everything that was great about AC2 and improves on it. If you enjoyed AC2, there is not a single reason why you shouldn't play this game.			"

												Man, a Assassin's creed game from back when they were still good, and not just mediocre. There isn't much at all to say, if your a fan of these games, you'll be a fan of this one. I personally still think the second one is better, but this one isn't too far off. The game is fun, beautiful, has an engaging plot, and even sound nice. I can't say anything about this one is bad, but I can say it isn't quite as good as the two that cam before it.			"

												This connects exactly were Assassin's Creed II ended and spins down the story further.For me this one is the major part of the Assassin's Creed 2 trilogy.You get to rebuild the order of the assassins you get to manage the ""training"" of your new novices and have a whole lot to do to rebuild Rome. Rome, a big city, beautifully build and atmospheric. The characters are well made and known.It was a little bit too big I just couldnt achieve everything.Completion time about 25 hours.			"

												If you're really not into games like Assassin's Creed, then I'll tell you, even though you don't like it, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing! It's the best game in the entire Assassin's Creed series, if you ask me. The quality is even really good for when it came out, although I don't really care about graphics. I recommend playing 2 before you start playing this one, but if you don't care about storyline, than go on son, by yourself a little gift! It starts off in the year 1499 at your uncle Mario's Villa, where you start where you have ended in 2. After doing some small missions the Villa immediately gets attacked by a guy called Cesare and his army. It's totally recommended!			"

The single player campaign provided me with over 80 hours of entertainment (I'm somewhat of a completionist), and even after that, I just had fun free-running across the enormous open-world map. The storyline is extremely interesting and I don't have a reason to dislike this game. The combat is also extremely satisfying, with chaining kills together being easy to learn, but difficult to master.Overall, this is one of my favorite games from one of my favorite franchises.			"

The added ability to get outfits and weapons in the game for uplay points is cool as well.I should also mention that you should not get the dulexe edition unless you want 2 admittedly cool characters for multiplayer but noone plays it so theirs no point, you get a outfit for singleplayer, and also the songtrack of the game,and some more singleplayer maps.8/10 Get it on sale			"

												Why the hell I'm writing review backwards... Oh whatever...ACBro, as the title dictates, it's about the Creed Brotherhood and it's restoration after the collapse.As always, new series in AC is a level up in terms of gameplay sidequest and many more.For the story, in Ancestor it tells about the village that have been reduced to Ash, and there isn't any choice for Ezio to do so he travel to Rome to pursuit his archenemy and while at that try to revive the brotherhood.Many arsenal of weapon that can be built by Leonardo Davinci will help you in the way to assassinate enemy. The battle become more fluctuative too so it will not be as easy as the previous game.In terms of all aspect, I think ACBro is the best AC that have been made, the story is still makes sense and the gameplay is not over excessive.Definitely a must play game!!

												It's legitimately better than Assassin's Creed II.  While Assassin's Creed II may have had more locales to explore, Brotherhood's single locale is straight up better.  The samey environments of II can't stand up to running across aqueducts and seeing the Colliseum for the first time.  So as far as environments go, it blows II out of the water.Now I know you all like bullet points, so let me run some bullet points on you.ProsThe environment, which I already said, is supreme.Investing in Rome gives the game staying power, and the collectibles are more fun to search for.It's more of the same.ConsIt's more of the same.Ridiculously buggy.  Animations frequently tweak out, and it's prone to crashing.If you like Assassin's Creed, Brotherhood is a must.  If you hate Assassin's Creed, this game won't change your mind one bit.			"

												Sadly this is the final decent game in my opinion from the Assasins Creed Francise- Not only did it carry with it everything that was great from the previous 2 games but it added more game machanics and improved on what AC 1 and 2 brought to the table. I felt this was outstanding and an original masterpiece in it's own right - a game that stood on it's own completly. This is an all time classic and deserves to get a 9.5 out of 10. Sadly after playing all AC titles after this, they all suffered greatly from the cash grab syndrome, being released with numorous bugs glitches and sound desync bugs otherwise known as rush jobs.

												Assassins Creed Brotherhood, hmmm.. Assassins Creed Brotherhood is a Wholesome Gory, Enjoyable and Deadly Stabbing frenzy through Roma. Set in Renaissance Italy spanning 7 years of Ezio's life (1500-1507). Assassins Creed 2 was a work of art so naturally Assassins Creed Brotherhood follows in its footsteps and the style of combat is the same but improved drastically. Perhaps the best edition to ACB is Assassin Recruits. Assassin recruits are like Ezios entorauge, as you explore Roma you gain the chance to recruit new brothers into the brotherhood, hence the name. The story takes off from AC2 and Ezio must kill Ceasre Borgia. Along the way you must assassinate lower ranking Templars and work your way up.This is the best Assassins Creed game yet to come in my opinion. 9/10			"

												This game I thought had been just as good as Assassin's Creed II, with the exception that some of the scaleable walls don't look so obvious anymore, the graphics have improved since the last game, but does not make it easy to see knobs at all times. Sometimes there are weird camera angles, making it hard for trick jumps where they are required and controls get a bit mixed up with the camera angle as it is. Dying clothes and capes requires money, which wasn't required in the previous game. You can now have execution streaks which are always dead useful when you're surrounded, counters are now 100% guaranteed to work everytime. Some of the viewpoints are at the top of the Borgia Towers (makes sense) but Borgia Towers that are lv5 will have Captains that will run, which was a pain to catch. Lastly, the Armor of Brutus (the best armor in the game) just doesn't look very nice to me, Altair's Armor had been swag, but Armor of Brutus....eh. All in all, this was a great game and definitely should be fun for those new to the Assassin's Creed series, but if you are new, I suggest you start from Assassin Creed II since Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a direct afterward of Assassin's Creed II			"

												Honestly in my opinion so far one of the worst of the Assassin's Creed games for perfectionists and myself here is Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. Also probably gonna ignore multiplayer for this game and all other AC's so forgive me.WARNING:Contains SpoilersSTORY:Again you assume the role of Desmond Miles as he,Lucy,Rebecca,and Shaun head to Ezio's villa to escape Abstergo. You find the room where Ezio had attained Altair's armour and set up shop here but not without doing a little mission. After that you assume Ezio once again going into his final memorie where he fought the main antagonist of the game Cesare Borgia but Desmond is locked out of the memory. Just like AC1 he must go through the earlier memories before he can go back to the final one. This story honestly is one of the best, second to AC2 and better than Revelations it's gone it's own deaths, accomplishes, twists and turns. Again it wasn't as good as AC2's story but at least it was better than Revelation's story.7.9/10GRAPHICS: The graphics here are better than AC2, cleaner textures, better frames, ect. It's great for it's age (2010) and still in my opinion hasn't dated yet.9/10GAMEPLAY:Oh boy here we go where do I even start.......the gameplay was okay? If I just spill it out this game made me ragequit it multiple times, not for the main missions but for the side missions. The tank mission was horrible, one hit and you were done you couldn't get hit once or your full sync would fail. The young at heart sucked too, and those side missions where you only had 6 minutes to complete the mission or no full sync. Also to clarify, full sync is supposed to represent how Ezio did completed his missions and side missions but honestely Ubisoft shouldn't have integrated this yet because there was extreme difficulty issues in some missions. Yeah it would be a breeze for normal fans, but full sync fans would learn that the levels did not suit for full sync, they had to find that out the hard way and it was a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Sorry for the rant but the other gameplay elements are at least better than this, with you calling out Assassin's and taking out your enemies like a boss you truly feel like a grandmaster assassin also mentioning finding items to get armor, fast poison ect was stupid on Ubisoft's part too.6.5/10CONCLUSION: AC:B was honestly one of the most frustrating games I've ever played. There was too difficult side missions, finding ridiculus items to get other items, and full sync. But it balances this by putting in a good story, calling assassins and new gear and weapons but I still can't forgive it's frustratingness and hopefully I won't play this game again.BUY RANK:1-2 (Putting this in because the game is like 20 bucks)			"

I feel like it is more of a just an improvment from the last game, yet the game really stands to be great. The graphics are better, the characters still remain people you can connect to, and the scenery of course is excellent. Good game, really recommend this series.			"

												С Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood особенно приятно будет знакомиться тем, кто с самой первой части с любовью и пониманием следит за судьбой сериала.Начинать приходится с малого. Рим условно поделен на сектора, коих чуть больше десяти. За каждым участком следит ставленник Чезаре Борджиа. Убираем прихвостня, поджигаем башню, в которой он восседал, — и район уже под нашим чутким руководством и началом. На отвоеванной территории забот полно. В основном все они связаны с восстановлением недвижимости. Вбухаете в это благородное дело свои средства — и магазины, лавки художников, портных, врачей будут приносить вам стабильный доход. Обилие заданий, так или иначе связанных с оживлением инфраструктуры города, приводит в ступор — все внимание и львиную долю времени перетягивают на себя именно они. Что там творится на сюжетной передовой, уже вроде и не так важно. Да, мы непременно накажем злодеев — только вот еще акведуки возведем, чтоб по ним вода текла. Ну и дорогу починим… а еще необходимо Леонардо помочь. У него там такие устройства выдаются… танки деревянные, гондолы с ракетами. Куда уж тут до мести — город с колен поднимать надо, жителей накормить… в конюшне прибраться!..Плюсы: огромный Рим для исследования; куча дополнительных заданий; танки и ракеты Да Винчи; улучшенная боевая система — с арбалетом и зрелищными боями; шикарный мультиплеер.Минусы: Эцио теперь не столько ассасин, сколько скупщик недвижимости; уровень развития AI остался прежним.

												I changed my view on Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood. The game itself actually make me remember Italian landmarks easily such as Castel Sant'Angelo, The Pantheon, Colosseum and many more! I can learn something about this game and try to relate it with my history class especially The Renaissance. Quite a keen game to educate about The Renaissance. However, do not believe 100% of it as it is edited version. Only some or certain parts of it.			"

												С Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood особенно приятно будет знакомиться тем, кто с самой первой части с любовью и пониманием следит за судьбой сериала.Начинать приходится с малого. Рим условно поделен на сектора, коих чуть больше десяти. За каждым участком следит ставленник Чезаре Борджиа. Убираем прихвостня, поджигаем башню, в которой он восседал, — и район уже под нашим чутким руководством и началом. На отвоеванной территории забот полно. В основном все они связаны с восстановлением недвижимости. Вбухаете в это благородное дело свои средства — и магазины, лавки художников, портных, врачей будут приносить вам стабильный доход. Обилие заданий, так или иначе связанных с оживлением инфраструктуры города, приводит в ступор — все внимание и львиную долю времени перетягивают на себя именно они. Что там творится на сюжетной передовой, уже вроде и не так важно. Да, мы непременно накажем злодеев — только вот еще акведуки возведем, чтоб по ним вода текла. Ну и дорогу починим… а еще необходимо Леонардо помочь. У него там такие устройства выдаются… танки деревянные, гондолы с ракетами. Куда уж тут до мести — город с колен поднимать надо, жителей накормить… в конюшне прибраться!..Плюсы: огромный Рим для исследования; куча дополнительных заданий; танки и ракеты Да Винчи; улучшенная боевая система — с арбалетом и зрелищными боями; шикарный мультиплеер.Минусы: Эцио теперь не столько ассасин, сколько скупщик недвижимости; уровень развития AI остался прежним.

I'll try troubleshooting launching this game again tomorrow........Will probably uninstall it if unsuccessful..			"

												Here ends my personal journey with Assassin's Creed, having completed the trilogy and now Brotherhood.  And what a beast of a game, a series.  Was it worth my time, you ask?  Let's start at the beginning.Space expanded rapidly.  Particles gathered into hydrogen atoms, stars and planets were formed, and Assassin's Creed was made.  I played that game and loved it.  It was impressive technically and visually, on a level that only millions of dollars could produce, and perhaps more astonishing was the total commitment to their freerunning system.  Ubisoft promised players could freely climb and scale virtually any solid object in the game, and I say they knocked it out-of-the-park on their first go.  Not everyone agrees with me.  A lot of folks complained that it was too repetitive (a peeve of mine, but that's another tale).Cue the sequels and I'm utterly baffled.  You see, freerunning is the CORE of Assassin's Creed, its bread and butter, its heart and soul.  Almost everything you do somehow involves climbing on things.  Taking the original game as a successful prototype, with the primary complaint being that people want more of it, the natural path is to focus on the one thing that defines the game and use it to springboard to something more.  But every game in the series has taken bizarre 90-degree turns that don't add up to anything.  Consider:""There's a rad freerunning system and now you can construct a brothel in your villa!""""There's a rad freerunning system and now there's a simulated economy!""""There's a rad freerunning system and now you can play bocce ball with George Washington!""...And the games are praised to high heavens.  Is this what people really want?  It's a crying shame that the core gameplay remains constant while getting buried under a mountain of crap.  Are layered mechanics not more interesting than disconnected ones?  Meanwhile, almost every activity can be reduced to ""go to the waypoint marker and/or beat up some guys"".  The problem is the freerunning, and to some extent the combat, really carries the game.  Your fun is absolutely dependent on whether these two things are compelling enough on their own.And therein lies the crux of why I think the Assassin's Creed series as a whole, stinks, because they can boiled down to nothing.  ""Go here"" involves holding two buttons and pointing the stick toward the waypoint.  ""Beating up guys"" involves repeatedly pressing attack and occasionally pressing block as an enemy strikes.  Following this strategy will get you through most of the game.  Perhaps one could say the game is just too easy.  I used the stock hidden blades throughout the whole game, and never felt the need to purchase any weapons, upgrades, or gadgets (except for DaVinci's climbing gloves, bless his heart).Occassionally you will sense that Assassin's Creed wants to be a stealth game, and I think it could be an outstanding one, except it bungles this as well.  The game falls into the very unforgiving trap of instant failure if you are detected at all, even if you stab a guy through the throat as he glimpses you upon his dying breath.  More perplexing design decisions abound.  Don't get caught freerunning or the Roman Rooftop Gestapo will get you!  Why punish players for climbing and exploring?Of course the story context is a monster in itself.  Apparently Ubisoft was so wowed by their own material that they felt it acceptable to ram the story down players' throats.  The sheer quantity and length of cutscenes is unreal.  Now I ain't no literary scholar, but I think the writing throughout the Assassin's Creed series is abysmal.  You spend so much time watching one-dimensional characters standing around yakking endlessly about some garbage you don't care about.  Every other line of dialogue is contrived to get you to ""go"" and ""kill"", and there just isn't a story being told, which wouldn't be a problem if it didn't constantly interrupt the game.  You can hardly pick your nose without it bookended by boring cinematics.The main conflict feels equally contrived.  Antagonists are either ridiculously villanous or guilty by association.  Of course you hardly ever see any of the alleged wrongdoing -- you're just told that person X is ""corrupt"" for vague reasons and they have an unfriendly disposition when you meet them in person.  I also can't get past the grand irony of the evil Templars condemned by the rightous ""Assassins"".  They fight back by murdering hundreds of people.  Other moments of brilliance are wasted.  Fallen foes, in their dying moments, try to get you to understand their motivation, their ideology.  But Ezio doesn't care.  He doesn't reflect upon or question his choices.  There's no personal growth; the story takes no risks.  It's just... flat.  The overarching sci-fi plot is actually quite interesting but so sparse that it hardly matters.I probably ought to explain my beef with cutscenes.  They never sit right with me, but they are the most obvious way to tell a story.  The nature of authorship is such that it conflicts with input from the audience.  The more input, the less control the author has.  Thus, taking control away from players is the most direct approach.  I'm fine with this, but I begin to take issue when cutscenes are used as a crutch for sloppy game design.There's a depressing trend among modern games to take the mechanics and tease out narrow, compartmentalized segments of gameplay, which are then shuffled throughout the experience.  The result is a game which is ultimately simpler, more predictable, and presumably easier to develop.  The first example that comes to mind is the Tomb Raider reboot, and the game suffers for it.  You are either climbing things or shooting things, but never both.  However, Tomb Raider is somewhat forgiven because it smoothly transitions between gameplay segments with smart level design, pacing, context, etc.  Assassin's Creed, on the other hand, glues together disjointed segments of gameplay with cutscenes, jerking you all over the place.  Cutscene - CHASE - cutscene - KILL - cutscene - FOLLOW - cutscene - KILL... I hate this.  It's like Warioware without the creativity (or fun).  This is how you can tell a game's design is oversimplified.If you've never played an Assassin's Creed game, it may be too late for you.  There was a day when the freerunning was cutting-edge and the sci-fi story was a surprise.  My advice is to play the original because it's the most ""pure"" experience and the medival setting really fits.  Otherwise, ask yourself ""can the freerunning carry my enjoyment for another 10-20 hours?"".  Gamers will always mentally strip away a game's fluff and reduce its moving parts to an abstract model, and at this point Assassin's Creed immediately goes stale.  It just doesn't have enough complexity to last beyond the initial novelty.  Sure, the game is punctuated by interesting moments in its enormous story, but these moments are mere hydrogen atoms in the vastness of space.			"

												I just couldn't be bothered to finish this. Assassin's Creed 2 was long and tedious enough that even a fistfight with the Pope and a crazy twist ending barely justified it, and here we're right back to the map-clearing trudge. I might be missing another wacky ending or a multiplayer mode that does a nice reimplimentation of The Ship, but the core of the game is so tired at this point that I simply can't reccomend it.Play the first one instead, at least that one has tension and some charm between the sloppy mechanics.

												This game had a lot going for it but for me, fell flat everywhere. The story was more convoluted and even harder to follow than in Assassins Creed 2, and had one of what I consider the laziest cliches where there's an enemy (who I still don't know what his name is) you have to kill but all he does is run away and is always just barely out of your grasp until the final fight. The final fight was pretty cool, but it was a little sad having to wait around 15 hours for that.Like Assassins Creed 2 there's some secret caves you can explore to unlock some cool armor, but unlike in Assassins Creed 2 by the time you get all these caves unlocked, the end of the game is just a few missions away. It's hardly worth using that awesome armor when you've already done everything in game. They also managed to make the menus even worse than the previous two games, and while Brotherhood definitely isn't as obvious of a console port as Assassins Creed 2 the horrendous map mechanics make me wish I was playing with the terrible console port controls of 2.And finally, the ending (while good) was totally ruined by 18 yes 18 minutes of unskippable credits. It doesn't count as you finishing the game unless you sit through all 18 minutes, but I don't care enough to see whatever post-credit scene there might be so I just closed the game after using my phone for 5 minutes and realizing the credits weren't going to end anytime soon.It's sad that just minor things like this really downed my feelings on Brotherhood. It's ambitions compared to the last two and may even have more things to do in it than Assassins Creed 2, even if it's in a smaller world, but the all over the place story and honestly just the credits made me dislike this game in the end. If you're planning on playing all the Assassins Creed games then this review won't stop you from playing Brotherhood but if you want to get Brotherhood on its own, I don't think it's worth it.			"

												I'd only recommend this game if you feel like you _must_ experience all the AC games before moving on to the next one, otherwise - skip it.Why do you play any Assassin's Creed game? To see the plot nicely woven into the history as it was written. That's literally the only thing you can expect from this game.Main problem with this game is repetitiveness, it's just more of the same. Nothing new. Still, the world is beautiful and the fact that you get to focus on a single city and improving said city is very nice.The characters are paper thin, aside from Ezio, who sadly feels much darker in this installation and Desmond remains pretty unrelatable. What annoyed me with AC2 and this is still the infurating use of the in-between-english-italian with americans trying to do an italian accent and replacing random words with italian. It's not enjoyable - just annoying. Also with this game, there is a lot of jumping from one scene to the next with no understandable transition in between.Overall, it isn't worth playing by any means. Check the plot synopsis on wikipedia and move on.			"

Overall score is an average A step up from Assassin’s Creed II, The city of Rome comes to life in incredible detail. Animations and character models are beautiful. Controls are nearly identical to previous iterations of the franchise, although combat mechanics have been greatly improved. Fans of the last game will notice some familiar tunes, but the score as a whole suits the action well. Voice acting is solid. With the new ability to switch between memories, a plethora of side-missions, and an engaging multiplayer component, there is no shortage of content here.			"

 Assassin's Creed Brotherhood  It's not a great title. The game is just a big DLC/expansion, with a lot of unusefull stuff sold a full price. The story is bad, only Cesare is a good character, the gameplay is a copy-paste of the previous one and the online is really really bad. The ""new"" stuff in the game are all secondary things that don't really give a reason to call this a new Title. The only thing that's truly good is the location (Rome 1500).			"

												.....reinstalled it after a few years to show the amazing cities to a friend, to see that this abomination of programming called Uplay has deleted ALL my savegames, at least for ACII and Brotherhood. I feel sorry for everyone who spent his time to collect all the items/buildings/etc. Will never buy anything with Uplay again, not the first loss of AC savegames.			"

												Wow! Epic story continues...I can't judge anything harshly at all... Solid 9.5/10.I look forward to the next game in the series and hope it all ties together. Ezio's life/story is gripping and on a level one could only imagine. So much happens in his life and Italy is such an amazing sight to play and explore around. One of the top protagonists in my books.			"

												One of the most broken games I've played. When I heard that people thought this game was great I had high hopes, however it appears to be the worst of all the series.-I had a section of the game that if I failed stealth the game would crash.-The cannon section at the start is incredibly unforgiving.-The port is terrible and controls make no sense. (for those of you just saying I should play with a controler, this proves its a bad port and the only thing a controller fixes is this part.)-A gap that Ezio can cross one time won't work the next time you try it.-I jumped onto a ledge with a horse that was about 30cm (12"") of the ground and it couldn't get off the ledge.-The camera changes to an awkward angle the worst moments and the slightest movement of the mouse makes it look like a 2year old with a handy cam. -While the camera changes the directions don't work the way you would expect and you can often jump to your death.This is a buggy piece of Bovine Fecal Matter and unless you care about the overall Assassin's Creed story avoid at all costs.

												Don't buy this game on PC.I had high hopes for it, as my friends had told me that it was one of the best of the AC series. However, on PC, it's just a blatant and extremely badly executed console port, to the point that you can tell with ease.Combat is clunky to the extreme, controls are the worst I've seen (and they are entirely uncustomisable beyond the three profiles you're given at the start), parkour is disappointing (just hold down the run button and point towards where you want to go), and it's very poorly optimised. Oh, and you have to debug Uplay before you can launch the game for the first time.For once, I suggest you just buy it on a console if you really want to play the game. The story was alright before I became entirely fed up with the controls and poor optimisation, so I would hope that these issues are not present on the console version.			"

												I'd only recommend this game if you feel like you _must_ experience all the AC games before moving on to the next one, otherwise - skip it.Why do you play any Assassin's Creed game? To see the plot nicely woven into the history as it was written. That's literally the only thing you can expect from this game.Main problem with this game is repetitiveness, it's just more of the same. Nothing new. Still, the world is beautiful and the fact that you get to focus on a single city and improving said city is very nice.The characters are paper thin, aside from Ezio, who sadly feels much darker in this installation and Desmond remains pretty unrelatable. What annoyed me with AC2 and this is still the infurating use of the in-between-english-italian with americans trying to do an italian accent and replacing random words with italian. It's not enjoyable - just annoying. Also with this game, there is a lot of jumping from one scene to the next with no understandable transition in between.Overall, it isn't worth playing by any means. Check the plot synopsis on wikipedia and move on.			"

This is my opinion of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood   Aspect Rating   Story 8.0   Graphics 8.0   Sound 9.0   Gameplay 8.0   Overall 8.3 Scores are out of 10. Overall score is an average A step up from Assassin’s Creed II, The city of Rome comes to life in incredible detail. Animations and character models are beautiful. Controls are nearly identical to previous iterations of the franchise, although combat mechanics have been greatly improved. Fans of the last game will notice some familiar tunes, but the score as a whole suits the action well. Voice acting is solid. With the new ability to switch between memories, a plethora of side-missions, and an engaging multiplayer component, there is no shortage of content here.			"

												Do you love Assassin's Creeed? You'll probably love this. Do you want to try out Assassin's Creed? I recommend you try Assassin's Creed 1, and 2 before this. Without the first (and especially 2nd), games under your belt, this story will make no sense, you won't care about the characters, and you probably won't enjoy this at all. This is a filler sequel. The gameplay is extremely similar to Assasin's Creed 2. It is hard for me to identify too many new elements. I don't know if any of the weapons were actually new, of if the ammo for them was just more plentiful, but I definitely used the gun, poison darts, and crossbow a lot in this game. I also found myself playing a lot less stealthily, possibly because the crossbow was so much fun to use, and I could loot ammo from any dead body.The one new element is that towards the midgame, you start an Assassin's Guild, sending assasins out on missions throughout Europe. They reward you with money, and some rare ""shop quests"" (i.e - crafting) items. You can also summon them during any battle and they will fight well. It almost feels like cheating compared to previous games, but it is kind of fun to say, ""screw this stealth crap, everyone dies now."" "

												Only unity ranks worse than this game, 90% of the fights involve ezio in the attack stance and no attacking, but just watching, This is what happens when you map the attack button to the button that enables you to do things like attack people, if you let go, you can't attack, but while your pressing it, you can't attack either. Also, once you enter a battle, you can't leave, there no no such option as running away, even though the entire first mission is comprised of you running away. This is a complete piece of sht. Also, the game crashes everytime I try to leave it. Guess it can't even handle it's own awfulness.			"

												Imagine the last Assassin's Creed game, then add in a butt-load of collectables. That's what this game is. It's just like Halo (though, to be honest, I don't like that entire series) all over again. They release the EXACT same game without changing ANYTHING or adding in ANYTHING creative and expect you to pay $60 at or even before release.			"

												For me, this was the best part of the AC series. It surpassess ACII mechanics of combat and movement in almost every way and even now, years after its publishing is still a lot of fun to play. There are a lot of activities to keep you busy and entetained and there is the synchronization system and collectibles which add a little more. The plot is the weakest point, sadly, not due to low quality, but because it seems so short. It is also a shame that you cannot explore monteregioni anymore, and while you do get your own base, it just isn't the same. The BEST thing about the game is the world, which is open and well designed. Walking, running and climbing through rome is a joy, the finest city experience any part of the game has served up yet. It is a shame that the multiplayer isn't active anymore, but u guess that's just how it is.Summing up, i recommend this game. The best argument i can find is that it really is a very enjoyable gaming experience, and really, isn't that what matters?			"

												You don't buy this game for the gameplay. It plays almost exactly the same as the previous games. You should only get this game if you are interested in the story. It is a bit of a filler but it builds on Ezio's and Desmond's characters quite well. I think it's worth the money (during a sale though) if you're into the Assassin's Creed story.----[Rating weighted based on the genre]----I'm basing my rating on the game being part of a larger whole of the series. I do not recommend playing this game on it's own.Story: 5/5Gameplay: 4/5Challenge: 2.5/5Discovery: 3/5Replayability: 3/5Aesthetics: 3.5/5Visuals: 5/5Atmosphere: 2.5/5Music: 4/5			"

												In spite of the hours I've logged on AC:B and ACII, don't be fooled: only about half of those hours are worth the playing. Most of all the AC games involves running around and trying to avoid being attacked by guards, who seem to spawn just in time to complicate your escape. The storyline and actual missions are great, but they tend to be variations on the same basic types: tail someone. Assassinate someone without being detected. Hold down W + RMB + SHFT indefnitely (what the game calls ""freerunning""). AC:B seems to be particularly annoying with regards to how the controls and freerunning works: sometimes Ezio will leap off a tall building even though you told him to walk cautiously in the opposite direction, and sometimes he will lock on to something you didn't even know was there and save your hide before you even realized it was in danger. There are also several annoying features of the game, like the camera switching perspective, which throws off the direction Ezio moves in.			"

												At first, I was confused with the multiplayer addition – I thought all those awesome guys on the cover are to be assassins, alas, they are your targets in singleplayer portion of the game. Despite this, the real brotherhood was something new and experimental. As usual, I would list the best points from the game:Multiplayer is innovative, not your usual killing, it’s stalking, hunting and chasing. It had its drawbacks, not stable servers, for instance. What I like most about this part is that everybody provides different animation for a different weapon, no two weapons or techniques are the same.Assassin brotherhood is a huge innovation, since Ezio is Il Mentore now. Even though the apprentices appear out of thin air sometimes, it is still interesting to have them by your side.Comparing to the previous game, it became more saturated in terms of colours. The previous game literally pales in comparison. Here everything is rich – from the colours of the robes to the landscapes of the levels.In my opinion, this game has the weakest soundtrack from the series, save for some tracks, it is quite repetitive (I believe this is due to the fact that we are in the same city and the need to differentiate does not arise).Also, because of unknown reasons (only in Steam version), two missions are bugged - the final mission, unable to interact with Cesare after climbing the siege tower, and locked controls during flying the bomber. Don't know if I am the only one who encountered this problem.Still, it is a good sequel to Ezio story, recommend it.			"

												Hi again, last time I was reviewing Rogue (AC) and now time for Brotherhood!!!So, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood have epic and intresting story of Ezio Auditore. It takes place in Monteriggioni, small, peaceful city, but peaceful for not so long. Game itself have great graphic and clear details. Characters there are awsome (as in every AC series). But Now, let's see + and - :Good:+Great Graphic+Superb story+Amazing Fights+Epic Brotherhood+City is a great parkour place+MultiplayerNow, Bad stuff:-Extra short story-Some missions are boring or easy-MemesSo Buy this awsome game if you wish to join Ezio brotherhood!!!!

												Assassin's Creed Broterhood is at its core not a bad game, but it has a few too many flaws in order for me to be able to recommend it to anyone who does not intend to play it just for the story.Pros:-The main city is quite big and well made-Logical continuation of the story-The parkour feels really satisfying, when it works-A good amount of sidequests and other activitesCons:-When the parkour does not work, it's quite frustrating-Highly inconsistent controls-Broken economy-Simplistic combat and overlong kill animations-Rushed endingAssassin's Creed Brotherhood starts right where Assassin's Creed 2 left, and the makers of the game seem to take for granted that you've played the previous game. The gameplay in Brotherhood is nigh identical to that of Assassin's Creed 2, and that sadly also means that they did not bother fixing some of the flaws that that game had.A core part of what makes the Assassin's Creed games is the parkour system. Jumping from rooftop to rooftop can be a real joy, and many of the missions also have lengthy parkour elements. The system is not without its flaws though, the game sometimes has a hard time telling where you want to jump, and decides to jump to something to the side rather than straight ahead, resulting in some embarrassing deaths. It's at least not as bad as it was in Assassin's Creed 1, but there is still a lot of room for improvement here. The game designers also decided to lock the camera at some points during these parkour segments, but as movement is relative to the camera, when the camera locks at an awkward angle (and it always does), jumping in the right direction becomes harder than it should be.One flaw that seem to have become bigger with the introduction of some new elements is the problem with the inconsistent controls. Most games would simply have a ""use"" key that you would press when using levers, opening doors, talking to people, looting bodies  and opening chests, but Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood has 3 different keys that is being used here. E, Shift and the dreaded ""any key"" (which can be a hassle if you're close to the object and intend to run in any direction). And it's not entirely consistent about which key you're supposed to use at any given moment. This is made even more annoying by the fact that tutorial message that tell you very basic things keep popping up through the entire game, which covers the button prompts. Attacking is also a bit inconsistent.  For most attacks, the left mouse button is used, like in any other game, but when using cannons (and other more exotic mounted weapons), it's suddenly the right mouse button that is used instead. This inconsistency makes no sense, as the left mouse button is not used at all during these segments. When mounting or dismounting things (boats, horses & cannons) there is again an inconsistency in regards to what button you're supposed to press. Shift, space and the left mouse button are all used for this. Finally, when using the crossbow or pistol you suddenly aim with WASD and can't control the camera at all, which makes those weapons really awkward to use. The story is for the most part quite nice, for an action game. What's going on makes sense within the confines of the universe and most of the characters also behave in a relatively believable way. The voice actors that voice the major characters do a good job at portraying them. Sadly the later parts of the game feel rushed and the story end up feeling a bit disjointed towards the end, jumping from place to place with no logical transition. It felt like I missed several cutscenes during the final 2 hours of the game. The level design of these parts also show signs of being rushed, as I found 3 spots where I got stuck (without looking for them) during chapter 7 alone. Getting stuck in the level geometry is generally a sign of lack of playtesting.Finally, the economy system is just as broken in Brotherhood as it was in Assassin's Creed 2. The game showers you with money as soon as you've started to make a few investments, and money ends up being a non-issue, to the point where it might as well not be there in the first place. In closing, I find it very hard to actually recommend Assassin's Creed Brotherhood to anyone. While it has its share of good elements, it also has quite a few problems that make what otherwise would have been a good action game a so-so one. There are just too many better games out there for Brotherhood to be worth playing, unless you're just playing it to get the complete Assassin's Creed story.			"

												Could not get any asscreed game to run on windows 10. Googled around, it's a common problem. Ubisoft does not officially support windows 10. This game installs another launcher (ubisoft launcher), and I believe it requires an internet connection. Ubisoft is everything wrong with PC gaming. Never giving them another dime.			"

												There are three reasons why I cannot recommend Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood; chief of which is how there's not enough new content for this to qualify as anything more than a DLC. No new notable characters have been introduced, additions to gameplay are minor and differences to the script similarly so: you essentially lose everything from Assassin's Creed 2 during the prologue and spend the rest of the game trying to build back your base of operation. Meaning, don't begin your Assassin's Creed experience from this title onwards because you start immediately as Assassin's Creed 2 drops off; so yes, spoilers.Secondly, one of the defining aspects of the game (specifically, the brotherhood of assassins whom you recruit) works entirely by a time-passage mechanic.  If Assassin's Creed 2 allowed you to cheat the system by waiting so as to gain additional income, Brotherhood sends your assassin recruits away on missions where success is based entirely on a percentage, with no involvement on your part.Third, although I love how your missions now have additional challenges, autosaving on your failures and the inability to skip cutscenes are just artificial obstacles that any game producer respectful of their customers would've removed already. Neither can you skip the end credits, and the game won't acknowledge you've finished the story until the whole 20 minute thing has passed. Alt-tabbing pauses the credits.Production was so lazy, it warped the whole story stupid. They've copy-pasted the villa restoration system from 2, but it's one thing to rebuild a decrepit villa so as to attract tourists and another one entirely to renovate ROME. You wage war on the open seas against battle ships sculling about your little gondola oar, because of course they kept the gondola and they couldn't be arsed in building an appropriate boat. I should add that the filler returns WITH A VENGEANCE: the missions I don't mind, it's the list of tasks such as ""kill 20 guards with a crossbow while undetected"" which are nothing but a chore. Expect around 40 of those.So don't do like I did and buy a whole bunch of discounted Assassin's Creed products in bulk, but pick and choose amongst the goodish ones. Or imagine everyone lived happily ever after the events of Assassin's Creed 2. That works too.			"

												NOTE: this is a review of the singleplayer, not the multiplayer, and I have also completed the main story and did a few of the side misssions.This game has some good points, so I'll go over them first.In ACB, the graphics have been slighly upgraded from ACII, so you'll still be able to run it if you have a way way weak PC, which is good, and the story for the most part is quite fluid and follows on nicely from ACII. The combat, IMO, is still great with a few added improvements.But then, This game, to me, falls on so many levels compared to Assassins Creed II.First, the map you play in, Rome. Rome seems to feel more empty and barren compared to Florence and Venice. In those games, you always had somewhere interesting to go, something to dominate the view, but in this game, most of the map is just open countryside with a few Roman ruins scattered around. You may get a slight sense of awe when you first see the places like the Pantheon or the Colloseum, but after a while that novelty wears off and they just become another thing to climb. It also seems to have sparce few people, making rome feel empty, which is never really good.the ending to the story is just confusing to wrap your head around, and they just seem to throw in charecters from ACII randomly. And then the main feature of the game: the Brotherhood ability.This ability is quite fun recruiting people and them using them to earn you money and kill guards without you having to do much. But it becomes that: getting money and killing guards; not very exciting.So, in MY opinion, I beleive this game fell far from the greateness of ACII. I would only get it in a sale and if you want to carry on the story of Ezio.			"

It's not completely terrible; it's no III, Revelations, or (god forbid) Unity, but it's not quite as good as 2 either.  If you're okay with pathetically easy combat that basically gives any pretense of this being a stealth game the middle finger and spending large portions of your time trotting slowly around big empty fields on a horse, hey, more power to you.I really wish Steam would let me give a 'meh' score; not quite yes, not quite no.

												OK graphics, decent controls, plenty of different mechanics (exploration, economy, rebuilding, conquering, assassinations).  A decent game overall but it has too much handholding and the open-world aspect is, as always with Ubisoft games, very restricted. You cannot play the game the way you want, you have to follow the footsteps of the devs.The combat! Combat feels disconnected and loose. You do not have direct control over your actions during combat, you feel like a spectator where you have to push a button as soon as someone attacks you; very frustrating.The game also lacks the atmosphere and details of the previous games, it feels like a copypaste of AC2 and somehow the essence got lost.Alright game but not worth your time.

												88 hours and I've yet to finish this game! And no, it's not because of fiddling with the banks.Look, I don't really care whether the game has a 3rd party EULA or not. However, when said EULA not only fails to put your save files on a cloud, but actively prevents you from backing them up yourself, that's where we have problems.You see, twice I either had to do a system reset on my PC, or change to a new one. All my games either kept their save files on a cloud and survived, or allowed me to back those up on an external drive. All my games except AC brotherhood, where both times I was quite near the end of the game.While it was fun to play and all, it's basically AC II all over again in terms of gameplay. Not really worth it unless you get it at a ridiculously low price.Maybe one day I'll be able to finish it. "

From the movement to the combat to the camera angles, AI, pathing, texture glitches, mounted movement/combat/interaction, general crashes, secondary objectives failing to sync, hitboxes, LOS, animation, the mechaincs, the triggers, the algorithms, the processes in their entirety, direction control, delayed responsiveness, flawed environmental interactivity placements. Oh and enjoy the cutscenes. Especially if you want to get a full Sync.. ♥♥♥♥ing enjoy that masochists, as I didn't. Common sense.. Within the confines of this game.. It doen't exist. The single worst game I have ever played. Period.			"

Any help would be appreiciated but i cant find the support page on the ubisoft website. Ive seen awesome gameplay but i can get the game to start.

												If u haven't play any next-gen or say newest Assassin's Creed series, this one is really great. I kinda like it storyline, even tho its not as good as AC II, and its feature that we can call backup since the fight sometime kinda annoying to do it by yourself. Its graphic doesn't really bad either.But if u already play newest AC series e.g. unity and syndicate, u'll find the control system might be frustating since its more complex and similar to previous series. Its gameplay also sometimes annoying, like when u try to climb a wall that actually he can but then he just jump off to the opposie side, and unlike in unity and syndicate, everytime I enter a battle mode, I unable to run away to directly kill the captain for example, etcThats my personal opinion :)			"

												... Eh. Only if you've already beaten ACII and are hungry for more.Don't get me wrong- there's nothing much wrong with it. It's solid, it's just more of the same. There are changes here and there that make it more polished, but at the end of the day, ACII had a solid and interesting, if not terribly inspired, story backing up its gameplay and exploration every step of the way, supporting its flaws. Brotherhood... kinda doesn't. It's fine, it's just less engaging than its predecessor, and while some of the new gameplay tools are quite fun, it's hard to justify buying a whole game for ""more of the last one"" without having a story of some sort worth carrying it.

Concept:Mostly teh same as previous ACs.  A great game with great (albeit simple and very easy) combat, Excellent platforming scaling detailed walls where teh main character grabs onto handholds realistically (for a super assassin) and where intricate leaps can be made onto small skinny poles and lamps and what not.  Overall the platforming is very well done.  Unfortunately, this very promising and potentially great game is plagued by unskippable lengthy dialogue and downright monotonous cutscenes that caused me to quit the game early.  I cannot remember perfectly, but I believe this was the AC that introduced property purchases and interval revenue (earning money over time.)Graphics:Nothing remarkable, but definitely passable.  Overall good.Sound:All good, nice horse sounds, city sounds, crowd gossip and what not.Entertainment:An extremely promising game, ruined by certain sequences.Replay:Atrocious, unless you enjoy boring, lengthy dialogue/cutscenes/sequences.Rating:Out of 60 USD, 10.(Opinion on teh monetary worth of the game scaled 1 to 60$)Conclusion:Coulda been excellent, spoiled by poor game design.  Still, worth checking out if on sale. "

It was a solid Assassin's Creed entry as far as I'm concerned, coming with a diversity of side quests that I was planning on enjoying more of until I saw that I had already stumbled on the closing phase of the game. So this thumbs down is because my laptop has an I7-4720HQ, GTX 960M 4GB, and 16GB of ram and this game has a hard time running even with all the graphical settings turned down. So poor optomization is my rationale for this rating. Both of the other games on the Ezio trilogy are running well at high-ultra settings  quite well. Even AC Rogue worked on my old laptop that had an R7 M260DX in it. So yeah, good game, tough time with the gameplay a lot of the time. Still on the lower end of playable most of the time. So if you're just trying to play through all the AC games like I'm trying to do get it for the story and see if you can bear it or maybe your PC will just fare better than mine.			"

												AC Brotherhood is a great game, but it gets a thumbs down because having a game launcher within a game launcher is the most ridiculous thing I've seen all week. Yes, I'm talking about the cancer that is ""Uplay"".I purchased the game on Steam. I have a Steam account. It is absolutely unnecessary to force upon players an additional hoop to jump through just so they can access the content they've paid for the pleasure to use. I will gladly change this review to a positive if Ubisoft ever digs their head out of their♥♥♥♥♥and stops forcing bloatware on its customers.			"

												For those of you who played Assassin's Creed II, you will probably like Brotherhood, as it plays pretty much the same. It starts out fun and introduces a few new features and modifications that are definitely for the better.However, as soon as one reaches Rome, it quickly gets frustrating. Me, I stopped there after a while. Here's a few reasons why (it's basically the same reason all over, but it gets so annoying it's unbearable):1) You see a lookout on the map and try to reach it. However, you quickly realize that you can not access it just because you see it on the map. Because ""this memory is not available"".2) You want to return to a place you've been before, perhaps to get money from the bank or repair your armor? You'll notice that, other than in every other Assassin's Creed before, areas you've been to will not necessarily stay available. Suddenly these areas are ""not available"" anymore.3) I feel like I'm squeezed into a relatively narrow tunnel of ""available memory"", with only a bit of space opening before me, while it closes again behind me. Everytime I stray form the path a little, I can't continue because ""this area is not available"". Like the game is trying to get me through the missions and areas in a most linear way. Not the Assassin's Creed experience I came to know and love.4) I would like to repair a building to get a lookout point. I can reach the building. However, the building is controlled by a tower. I need to destroy the tower. However, the tower is in an area that is ""not available"". WTF?!?At this point I was so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that I actually stopped playing, because I felt mucked.Seriously, it's a great game. Gameplay-wise, it's even better than the original Assassin's Creed 2. But the way it limits the player to a rather small area really kills it for me. So much for ""open world"".			"

												Pros:- The story is not bad.- To be able to recruit new assassins and send them on missions is an interesting new feature.- The game mechanics are ok.Cons:- This game has a double DRM (UPlay) which does not work for some people.- Regarding bugs and gliches this game is really messed up.- The missions are very repetitive.- It crashes a lot and you can't Alt-Tab out of it.I loved AC1 and bought this game because I really wanted to know how the story continues - now it is the last Ubisoft game I ever bought.Ubisoft tried a few interesting new things (mainly the recruitment system and flying one of leonardo's inventions), but the bugs were awfull. Unfotunately one mission couldn't be solved (the flying mission) because the controlls stopped working. After that my motivation to take on other missions or try multiplayer was gone and I tried to end the game as fast as possible.Some of the bugs are well known to Ubisoft, but they never provided patches as I've learned on some message boards.UPlay worked on my playthrough (others weren't as lucky), but I still don't understand the need for a double DRM. Being forced to make an account for playing offline really got on my nerves.This game was also very prone to crashes and Alt-Tabbing out of it was completely out of the question.Whereas in AC 2 you visit different cities, in this game you just remain in Rome. This and the repetitive missions killed most of the replay value.All in all I'd give this game 3 out of 10 points mainly for the story and the whole climbing and stealth mechanics - if that's also what you love about the AC series I'd reccomend you to buy AC 1 and leave it at that.This game was a total waste of money. If you really need to buy it, buy it when it's on sale.			"

												After trying, over and over, to get into this game, all I can say is its one big disappointment. As much as I'm sure the story and later levels are fantastic, I simply cannot get into this game because of the combat. Having played a whole lot of Black Flag, trying to learn the combat system for this game is a measure in frustration, incredulity, and stupidity. Sometimes you can counter. Often you can't. There's no indicator for when your attempt to counter is going to work or not, and I cannot get the combat system to respond in any manner of consistent way.Sometimes you can break a hold, sometimes you can't. It seems to be entirely random whether or not your attempts to attack, counter, block, or dodge are going to work, resulting in even a modest number of guards able to whittle your health down significantly.I understand that the focus should be on NOT engaging in combat, but often the game forces you into it, and punishes you for doing so. I so very much want to like this game. I really, really, really want to like it. But the combat system is total trash.			"

												I was not even able to play this game because UBISOFT/UPLAY is a bunch of garbage. So many other  people are having the same issues and yet nothing is being done. In my opinon I would not purchase this because uplay is a bunch of crap that barely works. I have never had any other problems from any other game producers/companies besides ubisoft. What i would like to know is why would they create this uplay crap when it does not even work. My only guess is that they do not care if the program works correctly but only care if they receive the amount of profit they desire. I'm sure this is a GREAT game, just due to the fact that I can't even play it, will make me reer AWAY from UBISOFT in the future.			"

												Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood ultimately is another Assassin's Creed game. These games sit on the borderline between recommendation and non-recommendation for me; they're okay games, and do solid enough stuff, but also contain an unpleasantly large amount of tedium in them which isn't much fun. Some of the missions are solid, some of them are boring, and overall the game is kind of variable in how good it is over its length.I don't really regret playing these games, but it is hard to really recommend them either, as while the conspiracy ideas underpinning the game are neat, and the game is cool in places, there's a lot of time spent doing things which just aren't very interesting.Overall grade: C			"

												a game that will continue the previous one from the moment you left off will start out as a blast first 3 secuences were a whole lot of fun i cant say that there is anything bad about the game until that point but ofcourse since this is a negetave comment i will say them:1. a game with so little story (the story is good but it feels too short) that ubisoft just sqeezed in so many side challanges i spent over half my game time on these side challanges that the story was not fun.2. the game contains a DLC ""The Da Vinchi Disapearnce"" which for some reason feels longer than the main game and has a more solid story3. assassins - nice touch but overuse of the same npc face (i went to reqruit my last assassin and 4 of the first faces i saw were exactually the sameSPOILER4. the game is too easy going at first but on the last misson it jumps you 9 years forward with no explanation of to how the bad guy is leader of a different army unless you read it in TABmaybe i didnt play it right though....

												Editied...At first this game refused to work on a really good rig. Didnt know why (see EDIT*).I use a (good) keyboard for games like this. If I wanted to use only a controller, I would buy a fkn console.It takes a bit of practice to get used to the controls, but at least its keyboard-coded far better than the garbage spewed out of KONAMI Studio called Metal Gear Solid 5, which REFUSES to allow you to re-map all the controls for disabled players (missing fingers) or the left-handed, Unlike this far older game.In regard to MSG5, I dont think Hideo Kojima was responsible for that re-mapping MESS, but I think he/his team was Ordered to make it a Console port, and not cater for PC specifically (especially in regards to Controls re-mapping). Asanine twerps wanted to chop costs. This game (Brotherhood), I have not have much chance to really test it out. Buy it in a Sale if you can if AC Creed games work for you.EDIT*.Now I fixed AC Brotherhood with switching Steam BETA on and rebooting and Switching Steam BETAS back off, and re-booting, and now the game works after hours of determination to find a fix.I updated my review (to thumbs-up) when I got the frustration out of my blood enough to play the thing without gritting my teeth trying to get it to simply start.As for Peonza`s comment (when I initially game the game a thumbs-down [when the game refused to start]), I can certainly understand why some people hate such awkward-to-control games; but like I said, its Keyboard controlled FAR BETTER than Metal Gear Solid 5.

												What a tragedy! Why, Ubi? Why did you let this game die and give it no love? AC:B won several GOTY awards, and frankly if I could give one, it'd win one from me, too. The atmospere is immersive, the voice acting is spectacular, and the music gives it a soul. With the exception of the controls often being the most epic boss in the game and the plot never going anywhere, story mode is worth the trip! But the MP flattens the SP by far! Vibrant, colorful, well-voiced, well MO-CAP player models and genius design, the MP is arguably the best gaming has ever seen. Unfortuantely, Ubi decided to go all COD on it, releasing another AC every year. The legendary MP that they did so well to make is now dead forever. What a shame. This game deserved to live forever like QUAKE or CS. Still recommended, just don't expect to get a MP game.			"

												This is a tough game to review, like all AC games the controls are garbage.  Is this game fun, thats debatable, it doesnt feel fun, but it is challenging.  Every mission is 100% is possible but ONLY if youre real hardcore, because your not playing to beat the game, your playing to beat bad game design.  Every time I get 100% sync on a mission, I feel like its sticking it in the face of the devs, as if as a mere player I can overcome how bad they are at making games.  Lets step into BAD game design 101 a class where everyone at Ubisfot is an A student: There is a side mission where you drive around in a tank, the bonus goal to get 100% on this mission is to not let the tank take any damage.  Any normal player would think that makes sense so we can preserve the tank, keep it undamaged to use later.  HA!  FOOLED YOU!  This is bad game design, no lets make the mission ungodly difficult, then after you beat the mission, lets have th player jump out of the tank and blow it up!  *Bonus bad design:  Make it a looOOoooong mission, where if you get damaged in the tank, instead of going back to a checkpoint, you need to restart the entire mission.Next chapter in Bad Game Design:  Build open world, imagine a big world you can explore, gamers would like that!  That isnt how its done in this game, thanks to more bad game design there are stupid white walls everywhere that just kill you if you touch them.  There is no excuse for this, I found it altered none of the story if you could just go to different places.  How that would ruin any game is just beyond me.   Multiple endings:  Games that offer different ways of achieving a goal through creative thoughtful strategy is often rewarded.  Not in AC brotherhood, most missions if someone looks at you, you just die and have to restart.  Suddenly everyone of the bad guys in Italy are medusas, and if they look at you apparently you die.Playing this I often picture the developers, who are in their corporate headquarters on a hill as the sky grows dark lightning crashes around it.  They sit in a meeting room making lists of how to make the game worse.  Ringing their hands in dark rooms lighted only by the glow of their overhead projector used for presentations, while laughing maniacally at the thoughts of people suffereing through their horrible game, MuWaHaHaHaHa....Multiplayer is dead...  Game is so boring that people sitting in the same room watching me would fall asleep as I had to retry missions again, and again.  They tried to play it and thought the controls sucked, and it wasnt fun.  There so for average people or fun gamers, this game is terribad, only for people who really want a challenge is it fun, and challenging isnt that much fun to be honest, its just challenging...Regular Gamer:    Rating:  0/10  Value  $0.00Hardcore Gamer:  Rating:  10/10  Value:  $9.99 "

												This game is such disappointment after the AC2 it has so little extra game content, it should be a DLC, but even for that wouldn't have been too great.To be fair, I have to say, it has some values, and I have to highlight the parts, I liked about it.These are like the crossbow you get, and basically all the new weapons. Also you totally get the good old AC2 feeling with it, wich you probably expect when you buy this.But other then these above sadly you geta disappointing storylinebunch of  annoying missions when you have to jump on walls seeing Ezio from awkward camera positionsa horse that's useless in fights but always knows how to be in your wayloads of business and assasin's order micromanagment, that has to be done, or you are financially ♥♥♥♥edetc...(believe me there is a lot more)to sum up this, only buy this episode if you are a huge fanboy otherwise you going to find a better piece of this series (just not the Revelations, it's even a bit below this one)			"

												I had forgotten the AC franchise didn't get good until ACIII. The early Assassin's Creed games (and Chronicles) make me cuss at my computer more than any other game series. Your character never moves the way you want him to, the combat is wonky, block is the same button to run so there are times where your character will just stand there. Parts are fun sure, and I'm going to beat it but damn, it doesn't deserve the 89% it has on Steam. The controls ruin it. ACIII and ACIV are where it's at.			"

												Top notch game!This first expac to the AC2 game is just crazy. You got so much stuff you can do with your assassins crew its really fun. You can send your assassins on misson to improve their lvl and skills and make them master assassins. All kind of new achievements galore. The story continue with Etsio pursuing the golden apple. Somehow, i found the story a bit more dull than with AC2, but the gameplay was more fun. Actually, i spent faaaaar more time with my assassins crew and side mission than with the main story.I think i sank 60 hours in the game and i still had a few achievements that i didn't get.			"

												Continuing with Ezio's storyline and adding in new elements of combat, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a good experience overall. Though the fact that there is only one city to explore, Rome, can be a little limiting compared to the various setting of Assassin's Creed 2, there is still plenty to do. The combat has become quicker and better with sequenced executions and  you get a ton of opportunities to fully exercise these new skills throughout the game. Added on is the fact that you can recruit other assassins and manage a guild, which I found an interesting element of gameplay. The storyline is somewhat more predictable than in Assassin's Creed 2, but it nonetheless carries through just fine. Aside from that, multiplayer is good, but rather basic. Nonetheless, is this game a good sell.			"

												Hello, I know that quite a few Mac users have been experiencing problems while starting up the game. I recently looked through the internet and found a fix that someone else posted.Below will show how to fix the startup crash, I also know that the game crashes through clips in the game, but sadly I do not know how to fix that.. STARTUP FIX:Go to finder, there should be a tab on the top of your screen titled ""Go"", click it. Once you click it, go to ""Go to Folder"" then paste the following into it: /Users/Computer's username here/Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/Assassins Creed  Brotherhood/Assassin's Creed Brotherhood/Contents/MacOSOnce you do that, there should be a file titled ""acbmp_sf"", click it and then you should open up with Terminal. Allow it to open up and the game should launch! Progress may not save through Steam as far as I've heard.EXTRA NOTES:I found the discussion here:http://steamcommunity.com/app/48190/discussions/0/666827315945443028/?insideModal=1PLEASE note that I DID NOT discover this myself, another user did and was helpful enough to post it for other users having the same problem.Other than the problems through crashing, I truely enjoy this game, as I have played it for a decent amount of time. I completely recommend it!			"

												Very much an iteration on Assassin's Creed II, but not necessarily in a bad way. The combat and movement of Ezio feels more fluid and refined, and so does everything else in this sequel.Rome is a fantastic location with tons of unique scenery and history. The missions are varied and fun and the game is about the right length. A bit shorter than Assassin's Creed 2 which was a bit too long in my opinion.Make sure you activate the free Leonardo Da'Vinci expansion in UPlay, it contains a couple of great missions.The biggest difference from the last game is that you're not on your own as much anymore. You get to recruit and train followers that can earn you money and aid you in combat.Lastly it's great to see proper controller bindings now, bindings that actually makes sense. Assassin's Creed II controller binds were just all over the place but now it works like it should.Overall a great, refined game!			"

												DONT BUY THIS GAME      the game itself is pretty freaking awesome... but it's next to impossible to get working on PC. Fisrt off, you need to create a Uplay account, and, normally, i would be completely fine with this, but the code you use to play the game DOESN'T WORK. it took me a crazy amount of time to find a work around to get the code to activate, but after that I managed to play the game without much trouble. The whole campaign, all the way through, and it was fun. However, a couple months later, on a new computer, i'm trying to get the game installed, but once again the Uplay system is screwing me over, telling me ""this game is already installed on a Uplay account."" Yes, yes it is, ON MY ACCOUNT, but it won't register with my new computer. It has me so frustrated i don't even want to bother with it anymore. I just want whoever created Uplay, to fall down a well. Look, do yourself a huge favor: shut down your steam acount, logon to Amazon, and buy it for a PS3 or Xbox. It's really a great game, but only if you can play it.			"

												This is in truth of of the greatest games I have ever played. Packing not only a story and some gameplay, it also delivers an ideology.The story is good, although not as fantastic as the game in the series prior to this (Assassin's Creed II). The gameplay on the other hand is brilliant, and odds are you won't be 100% done before you've spent a couple of days with it.Assassin's Creed Brotherhood offers multiple ways to deal with objectives, as well as a lot of small side missions- and quests. You're able to build and customize both yourself, but also your allies. At the top of my head, you can do just about anything you would want to do in the rennesaince, apart from killing innocents. Including riding around on a unicorn.			"

												I waited for a sale to buy this game, as I was expecting it to be only focused on multiplayer and having a meager single-player campaign, with not much to add. Boy, was I wrong. Not only it improves on AC:II playability (fixing the combat system), it is as big, if not bigger, than it's predecessor. With better city design, quests and antagonists (cesare borgia's ""if I want to take, I take"" speech is brilliant and beautifuly delivered), this is my favorite Assassin's Creed game.			"

												Für mich ist Brotherhood ein Stück schwächer als der sehr geniale 2. Teil. Die Story ist weniger episch bzw einfach mal garnicht episch. Die Atmosphäre ist klasse, jedoch fühlt man sich viel weniger in die Zeit zurückversetzt, was auch daran liegt das ACB oft sehr episodenhaft wirkt. Trotzdem eine sehr gute Fortsetzung der interessanten Geschichte mit bewährtem Gameplay (einigen unpassend integrierten Neuerungen) und einer Technik die immernoch wunderbar ist. 8,8/10			"

												If you have just finished ACII and jump right into Brotherhood, you may feel a bit weird at first. Part of this weirdness feeling is good: Ezio “feels” older – he should be. The patchy beard, the slight comments from NPC’s here and there, the louder noise he makes when he drops from a height, it all adds to the feeling that the character you have played with since his teenage days in Firenze is now close to or in his  40’s – but don’t worry; he can still do all the good stuff. This, ageing, is not an easy thing to convey in a game and many developers will not do it at all, keeping their character closer to a young aged audience, but for a story like AC it is both needed and, in this case, well executed.The other part of the weirdness is perhaps not so good. AC Brotherhood needs time. In the beginning you feel a bit thrown into the game world without much to go on, no real idea where to begin. Perhaps that is a good thing. Ultimately, the small pieces of your “work” here and there begin to consolidate the picture and you start to tread on more solid ground. One point of complaint is the map and menu navigation which Ubisoft for some reason messed with from the previous game, with not so good results.Ultimately, Brotherhood continues the story from ACII nicely, deepens the plot, creates more questions but is all in all enjoyable. The recruitment of assassins adds a nice touch to the feeling that you are part of something larger and eventually – at its head.			"

												Solid maybe recommendation.Play it if you're a fan of the franchise, if you'd like to see the gameplay expanded and refined with new elements and improvements, or if you'd like to see how the Assassin's Creed mechanics work out in multiplayer. If you don't have a lot of time to devote, or you just want to see the new plot developments, you might as well just watch the ending on YouTube. The gameplay is a lot of fun and a definite improvement over the other games, but the plot is a rehash of two levels from 2 and there's not much new plot.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2011/08/assassins-creed-brotherhood.html "

												Hello, I know that quite a few Mac users have been experiencing problems while starting up the game. I recently looked through the internet and found a fix that someone else posted.Below will show how to fix the startup crash, I also know that the game crashes through clips in the game, but sadly I do not know how to fix that.. STARTUP FIX:Go to finder, there should be a tab on the top of your screen titled ""Go"", click it. Once you click it, go to ""Go to Folder"" then paste the following into it: /Users/Computer's username here/Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/Assassins Creed  Brotherhood/Assassin's Creed Brotherhood/Contents/MacOSOnce you do that, there should be a file titled ""acbmp_sf"", click it and then you should open up with Terminal. Allow it to open up and the game should launch! Progress may not save through Steam as far as I've heard.EXTRA NOTES:I found the discussion here:http://steamcommunity.com/app/48190/discussions/0/666827315945443028/?insideModal=1PLEASE note that I DID NOT discover this myself, another user did and was helpful enough to post it for other users having the same problem.Other than the problems through crashing, I truely enjoy this game, as I have played it for a decent amount of time. I completely recommend it!			"

												I thought I'd re-recommend some games due to how poorly written and dumb my old recommendations were.The Assassin's Creed series has always been a great series (with a few exceptions ;3), and its games often are amazing and enjoyable, with breathtaking scenery and amazing gameplay: this one is no exception.Assassin's Creed Brotherhood consists of a fairly long storyline, filled with enjoyable and interesting missions.  Playing in the beautiful city of Roma as Ezio Auditore is a great experience, and the city allows for much adventure and open world exploration outside of the storyline.  In fact, there are multiple stories you can follow, for instance there is a free addition you can download where you play a story that takes place shortly after the main adventure.  The game also intertwines with historical places, facts, and people, such as the Borgias.  The main antagonist is Cesare Borgia, a well-developed and historically-based character.  The storyline shows how you attack him from various directions and slowly take back the city.  This installment of the series introduces a new concept: Assassin Recruits.  The game allows you to pick up fellow citizens and teach them in the ways of the assassin, and throughout the story you can call upon them to help you.  In general, this can lead to many fun battles: I personally enjoyed running around and attracting as many guards as possible, then just call in fellow assassins and murder them all. >:DThe multiplayer mode of this game is great.  To run around and attack others while being chased yourself in a small area is so much fun, and there are all sorts of gimmicks and hiding places you can use to make chases and escapes even more exhilirating.  However, it can be difficult to get a multiplayer game going, since there aren't often many people on the network.  If you manage to get a game though, stay in it and play around for a while, you'lll unlock new bonuses and rewards as you level up from playing.One last thing to note about this game is the enviornment.  I mentioned before that the game takes place in Roma, and in case you didn't know, Rome is a pretty vast and beautiful place. :P  You don't play through Rome during its days of glory, but long after when many of its structures are in ruins and the Borgia have complete control and power over the city.  As you gain wealth and status in the city (usually from not-so friendly ways... protip: Borgia Towers are strangely very flammable), you can repair old buildings, buy renown places such as the Coliseum and the Pantheon and gain the trust of nearby factions such as theives and courtesans.  In general, the envoirnment is very large yet extremely detailed and gorgeous.  With so much to do in the city, oftentimes you may set out to go get something done but find yourself trying to kill a Borgia Captain and igniting a tower hours later.In general, the game is amazing.  As I said in my previous 2-word review: ""Awesome shtuff.""			"

												The 2nd of the Ezio trilogy. And if you are new to the games, I would reccomend starting with AC2 first justto understand the story. A definite sequel. Improves upon nearly every single game mechanic of Assassin's Creed 2, and is personally my favorite in the series. The combat is more fluid. The guilds make sense and are utilized in the story. Even capturing areas and exploring the world are tied into the 'story' of the game. I only wish the other games in the series took more notes from this one.			"

												I'm going to keep this review as straight forward as possible: Is ACB good? On a techincal level, if not mediocre.Will you enjoy it? If you can be ok with a ton of repitition, other wise avoid or take caution.Brotherhood is probably one of the more boring games i've played, which is dissapointing considering I thought Assassin's Creed 2 was quite good. All the story missions are the same thing over and over game, kill that thing, go here, don't get caught, and of course FOLLOW MISSIONS, which are one of the worst mission types for any sandbox game ever considering the stealth in this game is shoddy.In comparison to Assassin's Creed 2 it is staggering how much quality has been lost.Optimization: Assassin's Creed 2 was nicely optomized for pc, it ran well and I don't recall many issues. For ACB the game is laggy, it looks kinda bleh at times, and the video settings keep going to their defaults every single time you re-enter the game, and I found no way to fix this. Gameplay: Already covered above; story mission too repetitive, and not really varied. Nothing memorable here.Setting: Rome is dull. The landscape is bland and honestly uninteresting. We wen't from the streets of Venice to the open grass lands of...Well Rome. I don't know if it might suit someone else's tastes, but I find it uninteresting.This is honestly a pretty weak game in my opinion, not bad persay, but following Assassin's Creed 2 it just doesn't hold up as well, considering its more of the same plus it being incredibly boring and repetative at times. I wouldn't really recommend it that much, not even if you are trying to follow the story because the two timeline plots have simple start and end points, no real inner 'meat' to add anything signifigant or worth noting or caring about.Worth a skip.

												Having previously played AC 1, 2 and this game on console, I wasn't really sure what to expect when I bought this during the Steam Summer Sale 2014..... but it delivered and rekindled my gamer crush on Ezio. Gameplay is immersive. There's your main quest line, side quests, Cluster puzzles, plus a bunch of other tasks you can do within the single player game. There's also multiplayer, which if I can remember my console days clearly, isn't too bad either. Controls take a little while to get used to, especially with the move from console to PC for me, but they are displayed on screen and once you get the hang of what all the buttons to do, the combat is so much more enjoyable. I find this game quite challenging. While completing the quests aren't too difficult, the extra requirements needed for 100% sync makes it a little harder for those who are into full completion. I think this game is so much fun to play and I have yet to tire of the whole franchise. I highly reccommend this game and give it an 8 out of 10..... points lost because..... well running away and hiding can get a little annoying when sometimes I just want to kill em all.			"

												Another year, another turgid crapfest from the AssCreed series. Unskippable cutscenes (really, we're still doing these in 2010?), sticky cameras, lousy storytelling, etc. To be fair, though, this isn't QUITE the same sweaty nutsack that AssCreed II was; the combat is vaguely improved, and the scenery looks as nice as ever. Eventually, Ubisoft might make a worthwhile entry in the AssCreed series that's actually worth the 10 bucks I pay for them during Steam sales, but I doubt it. In the meantime, I'll keep slogging through the pigshit that the AssCreed series leaves in its wake, all the while posting whiny non-recommendations on Steam.			"

												I have always been a fan of the Assassin's Creed series ever since I bought the first title for Xbox because I was interested in what the word Creed meant and even now that the series has been♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by Ubisoft I still enjoy returning to the older games to relive the fun that it offered. This though is a ♥♥♥♥ing mess. I don't know if this title was a port but it is riddled with glitches and game breaking moments. I played through this on Xbox360 with no issues but now, years later playing on PC, I am struggling to want to continue playing. `The crossbow bolts will deflect off gaurds in random directions at times.`The counter attack is almost entirely useless as it only works when it desires.`Gaurds strike you mid-attack so finishing fights unharmed is impossible. `Ezio occassionally disregards commands and will begin walking slowly away from enemies, usually attracting more hordes.`You can be spotted through walls`Ezio will sometimes forget to grab onto ledges causing death`Unsynced Audio/Video in CutscenesAll that and so much more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, it's ♥♥♥♥ing pathetic. While the game is still playable these glitches make getting 100% Sync impossible at times, I would almost always make it to the end of a quest just to have something unfair happen and bam ♥♥♥♥ed up my entire waste of careful planning and actions. The only other title in this franchise I played for PC is Revelations, thankfully Ubisoft fixed all the issues this had for that. Only play this if you have serious patience..			"

												As much good as ACII, maybe even better!Beatifuly modeled Rome with its surroundings (Vatican too!), a much more side-job opportunities than in ACII (during first play of AC:B i was just like ""hell, it is beautiful, this and that, yeas, this is how ACII should really be"" :)).Game very tightly continues after ACII story, so i think there is really need to know ACII before playing this (and before playing AC:Revelations too).Pros:- again and again you can feel absolute freedom of movement, you can go and climb really almost everywhere- beautifuly modeled Rome, Vatican and its surroundings- beautiful and believable atmosphere of living city and living story, everything fits very fine- on PC version there is just one click activation (no pay, only activate it) of nice DLC ""Leonardo disappearance"", wchich adds pretty few hours filled with anothet part of main story- very good audio enviroment modeling/engine- parachutes from Leonardo (but it has its dark side, see cons also)- almost no bugs or glitches.Neutral (aka ""not sure"" ;)):- same combat system as in previous AC, maybe with slight differences which i (sorry) didn't noticed.- possibility to ride horse anytime and anywhere ... which comes boring after while. Or, for long distances traveling - if one doesn't want to use sewers system the horse is only choice. But not in tight streeets of Rome, you can get really hard times with your horse stucked somewhere on the corner etc ;)).- there is no more killing from back of your horse with your sword possibility. You just can't draw your sword while being on horse. Which looks strage, but to be honest - it gave too much overpower to Ezio. Ezio was almost immortal with sword being on horse back. It was fun for a while, but with that were some parts of game too much easy. Specially liberating Borgia towers was like ""one finger in my nose, second hand on my mouse"", i just took a horse, draw my sword and even hardes Borgia towers were cleaned of Borgia soldier within minute with no need to use of medicine.Cons:- as i play third AC in row (started with ACII, then AC:B, now i play AC:Reveletaions) i start thinking there should be difficulty setting, i fell very often like as guards are totally blinded or def- parachutes from Leonardo! Worst thing ever, for what is it if you can't use it as primary tool for escaping some fight/battle which gone wrong? I was unable to use parachute almost everytime i was ""known, seeked and chased"". In time of peace i had no problem to deploy parachute.Conclusion:Who loved AC and loved ACII will enjoy AC:B. And i have no problem with strictly continuity of Ezio story (so one needs to know ACII before playing AC:B and needs to know AC:B before playing AR:Revelations).			"

												This entry was  vast improvement over Assassin's Creed 2 for me.  I'm not even sure if I can put my finger on why that is either.  Perhaps less flag/feather gathering.  I'm a bit of a completionist so that drove me insane in AC2.  Though admittedly I didn't gather everything in this entry either.  For those without AC experience, there are flags and other items to ""collect"" scattered around the game.  Some are in hard to reach places or locked areas that open up as you progress.  For the most part I enjoyed the ""jumping puzzle"" and added challenge of figuring out how to get to them.  Some may not...for some reason in AC2 I was at my wit's end due to the size of the game and high number/variety of items. The feeling of ""missing something"" was constantly there and it became tedious trying to figure out what I may have overlooked.  One of the bigger changes in Brotherhood in regard to missions, was that every single one had an added challenge in order for you to get 100% synchronization for a memory.  At first, I found this extremely frustrating especially since I hadn't mastered some of the combat mechanics (like kill streaks, though once I figured that out it, my game changed dramatically).  But eventually I ended up finding that the missions were a lot more fun with the added challenge.  Granted, there were times I was cursing how clumsy I was with the controls. This did eliminate some freedom in how you decided to complete a mission.  That was my biggest lament over this feature...but for me, it wasn't a terrible thing.  The acrobatics in this installment are as you'd expect them.  Perhaps it was my imagination, but it felt more responsive than the previous games and  traversing the rooftops felt more fluid than ever.  As much as I'd expect to get tired of it, just jumping from rooftop to rooftop, is a good time. It's no wonder flabby gamers everywhere love the AC series because it lets you become the ultimate acrobatic badass as you hang from a ledge by one hand flashing your 12 pack abs to the ladies below. Those courtesans may sleep with everyone else in the game, but let's face it, they all want you (Ezio). I have to give props to the music in the game.  The perfect track always started when you were jumping through ruins, fighting 20 guards or racing the clock.  It always felt right. I liked the storyline this time around.  I had to recap what happened in AC2 before I played Brotherhood. But I'll be starting Revelations knowing exactly what happened in Brotherhood. No shortage of intrigue and I have to give the writers credit, I love the whole premise of visiting a time period hundreds of years ago while progressing a sci fi story in the present/future. It's brilliant from a sequel standpoint, especially considering the fact that I'm 3 games behind the current release (with a new one on the way).  I hope Revelations is as satisfying as Brotherhood. I know AC2 was a fan favorite, after reading reviews and comments about it.  I can understand why some loved AC2 over AC1 due to AC1's repetitiveness but I didn't get much out of the crazy amount of side quests and collecting in AC2.  I also felt like AC1 was stronger from a storytelling perspective (with the ending being an exception perhaps). Ezio was very difficult to like at first too. Perhaps that's why Brotherhood won me over.  It took all of AC2 and Brotherhood for me to warm up to him.			"

												Many of my friends believe that Brotherhood is the best AC title out there. While I agree that many of AC II's qualities and faults were improved and corrected, respectively, the game's limitation to one world-map (Rome is amazing, but still) and almost insultingly easy combat makes it get old VERY fast, especially when you're going for the 100%. If you want to kill mountains of people without any trouble at all, this is really the game for you.  One of the game's saving graces is the Assassin Brotherhood mechanic... rounding up and training your own assassin's is pretty awesome.			"

												If you liked Assassin's Creed II you will probably like Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. Just like the previous game, it's really easy, now easier with Assassin recruits that do your job and a Crossbow, also with Posion Dart (but who uses that). The entire repairing Rome is useless since the game is easy, so you don't need better weapons, just keep the one you get for FREE, and the best armor is obtained for free. Only thing you're going to buy is pouches. Taking down Borgia Towers is fun. The AI is still dumb as ♥♥♥♥. The side quests are more fun, adding a different kind of Assassination Mission: Templar Agents. Multiplayer is great. You can do missions at 100%, which adds a little replayability. This feels like an expansion to Assassin's Creed II, but slightly feels and plays better. Did I say themultiplayer is great? Infact on Xbox, I spent over 600 hours playing it competitively. In a nutshell, if you like Assassin's Creed II, you will like this, but it's way easier... Multiplayer is fun. 8/10			"

												This game is a direct continuation of AC2 and improves upon the gameplay in many ways. There are new gadgets (crossbow, poison darts, parachute to name a few) that make Ezio's arsenal finally feel complete (I'm not sure why it took so long to get the crossbow though, Altair had one in the intro movie for the first game). The ability to call assassin's is great fun and actually makes you feel like part of the brotherhood instead of just a lone wolf. In many ways Ezio is just completely overpowered (which isn't necessarily a bad thing) so when I see a group of guards it's a question of how do I want to kill them as opposed to what is the most effective way to kill them since all the methods are effective. The Leonardo missions are also fun (Ezio gets to drive a tank in one).That said, this game feels like it really should have been an expansion pack for AC2 instead of a sequel. There isn't much to the story and what is there is drawn out longer than it should have been. Ideally the best placement for this game would have been right before the final act of AC2 so Ezio builds up to finally confronting his arch rival. The bad guy in this game just doesn't seem all that exciting after fist-fighting the pope at the end of AC2.The world is also MUCH smaller. You're stuck in one city the entire game with no countryside either.That said, the game was still a lot of fun and is easily recommended. As with all older games, wait to pick it up on sale.			"

												Just as much fun content as Assassin's Creed II, and the same basic ideas and gameplay too, but not as well put together. The main story doesn't drive you to the more fun missions in the game. Do run around and find every Leo mission and clear every borgia tower.Worth playing if you enjoyed the second game, but if you passed that one up, don't pick this over it.			"

												'Assassin's Creed Brotherhood' improves on its predecessor, 'Assassin's Creed II' in almost every way. The graphics are more detailed and combat systems are even more finely tuned. The commerce system is a bit distracting at first, but proves invaluable if you wish to rebuild Rome as a side mission. Give the game some time to gain its momentum because it gets more fun once you start recruiting people to join your brotherhood.			"

												I waited for a sale to buy this game, as I was expecting it to be only focused on multiplayer and having a meager single-player campaign, with not much to add. Boy, was I wrong. Not only it improves on AC:II playability (fixing the combat system), it is as big, if not bigger, than it's predecessor. With better city design, quests and antagonists (cesare borgia's ""if I want to take, I take"" speech is brilliant and beautifuly delivered), this is my favorite Assassin's Creed game.			"

												Brotherhood picks up the story exactly (literally!) when AC2 left it. And I must say, I'm pretty amazed by what the producers did with this game. The combat system is much better now, with introduction of killing streaks, but also with stronger and more difficult enemies. To get 100% in the mission, you have to also do some additional objectives (which sometimes are quite troublesome!). The city of Rome is an amazingly big area, unlike anything you have seen in the previous games. Characters are very interesting and the whole storyline is quite good (though, not as good as in AC2 in my opinion). Also, there are multitudes of additional missions and content, so finishing the entire game takes tremendeous amount of time. All in all, this game will definitely not dissapoint you so I can recommend it to anyone that loves AC.Actually, after playing AC:R, AC3 and AC4, I must say that if you love AC franchise, that would be the last game I would recommend to play, if you don't want a huge letdown.

												A pretty good sequel to Assassin's Creed 2. Brotherhood continues the story of Ezio/Desmond. There are improvements on the gameplay but mostly this is a continuation for AC2 but instead of feeling like a rehash the story is interesting and I got to care what happened to Ezio. The desmond story is not as interesting but you spend so little time as Desmond it doesn't matter. The game ends on an interesting cliffhanger so Now I'm off to play Relevations.			"

												The Single Player is not much more than Assassin's Creed 2, just one or two new ways to kill people or get around the city, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but any gripes with the series so far probably haven't been addressed with this installment, and what people have liked about the series is still in the game.  My favorite aspect of Brotherhood was the multiplayer.  I personally haven't played any game that had this style of gameplay, so it was ""fresh"" so to say, something new to learn, new mechanics to wrap my head around and master, a different way to use the mechanics we were given in single player.  I greatly enjoyed the way the multiplayer emulated the feeling that the original assassin's creed created when it first released, which was the feeling of being an assassin, which I personally haven't felt since AC 1 was released.

												For only one area you deal in (Rome) it's so in detail it's almost amazing. The characters look wonderful and I have to say, Ezio, Desmon and even the Altair outfit for Ezio looks great. They really should have used the models for Revelations. At times it does almost feel like a DLC for AC2, but I feel that it holds up on its own as a separate game. I only wished I had known my username for UBIsoft UPlay would be the username I used to sign up, meaning I'm stuck with a name I would rather not have causing me to really be unable to enjoy the Multiplayer aspect. All in all, definitely a game I would reccomend along with all the others in the series.			"

												Mesmo mantendo praticamente a mesma mecânica e o mesmo visual, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood consegue ser levemente superior ao seu antecessor. As poucas, mas notáveis adições ajudaram a deixar o jogo mais dinâmico (como os assassinos da Brotherhood e o sistema financeiro). As missões, especialmente as side quests, ficaram um pouco mais diversificadas e não estão tão cansativas. Único problema é que a história demora demais pra sair do lugar e quando começa a ficar legal, o jogo termina. Isso é realmente frustrante. Recomendado pra quem jogou e TERMINOU o AC II.			"

I haven't tried the multiplayer aspect, but it has received decent reviews from those who have. The game gets a bit repetitive in places and a few side missions are quite frustrating (mainly due to camera control).

												Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is a good game, no arguments, you can't debate it, AC:B is a good game. It would be a great game, if you didn't feel like you were being milked while playing it.Good gameplay, good story, good pacing, that is hooked onto the AC formula seen in the first and second games. And that's it. You know that Ubisoft is going to milk you for every penny, making you pay full price for the work that is essentially DLC extra's and fancy modding padding extra layers onto bloated thing they have already. This is more blatant with the new ""innovative"" feature of Assassin's Recruits that really is a tack-on, and the game would survive fine without it. But if you've already played the first two Assassin's Creed games, you'll definitely play AC:B, so go ahead buy it, it's still a good game.Just dont' think about how badly your being played. 8/10			"

												Brotherhood picks up right where Assassin's Creed 2 leaves off.  Ezio begins gathering and training new assassin recruits for the order, which itself becomes a major new gameplay mechanic allowing you to find and rescue them, get them to join, train them, and call them to aid you in battle. Ezio on his own is a force to be reckoned with for a whole army of renaissance warriors, but with the Brotherhood at his side it becomes a slaughterfest.Again, this game builds upon its predecessors, adding new weapons, mechanics, refinements, options, etc. Better quest system and economy system. You can gain military control of parts of Rome by destorying enemy bases....etc etc etc etcThis game is awesome. My only complaint with it might be that between his ranged weapons, and the Brotherhood, Ezio might be TOO powerful.Also, Multiplayer. It's unlike any other Multiplayer out there and, contrary to conventional wisdom, Assassin's Creed translates to be a GREAT multiplayer game.			"

												Plays a lot like Assassin's Creed 2, but with some cool extra features. Most notably is  the Brotherhood system where you recruit civilians to the Brotherhood to work as assassins. They can either pounce from the shadows to take out tough targets or send them out on missions to earn more money for your cause.The story picks up immediatly after AC2. For this reason, it's hard to recommend ACB over AC2. ACB is pretty much AC2+, so if you can only buy one: buy this one and read up on AC2's story on wikipedia.			"

												This game takes of where Assassins Creed 2 came to an end. I don't personally think the storyline was as good as Assassins Creed 2, but I still enjoyed this game immensly and would have no problems recomending it. It takes place in Rome, and only Rome ( with a few side quests in the countryside ), and tough Rome is a beautiful city, alot of it is in ruins even during the years this game takes place. Still quite amazing roaming around inside some of the buildings of Rome. Well worth my time. Apparently the game continues in the 3rd installment of Ezio Auditore ( Assassins Creed Revelations ) So that's where I'm headed next.			"

												While Brotherhood can be looked at as overpriced DLC for AC2, it is also a very good game. It adds many new mechanics and improves the visuals and storytelling as well. As usual, Desmond's scenes aren't that interesting and the ending of the game is very disappointing and confusing from Desmond's perspective. Ezio's story is once again well fleshed out and intriguing all the way through and the Da Vinci side missions are probably the highlight of the game. Also, the new multiplayer mode is incredibly addicting and fun. Very good game.			"

Dont bother with ubisoft / uplay games.----------------------------------------------------------The review is base on story mode.-There are improvements in graphics, but the mod does not suit well causing some disappearances of structures, while switching the camera view.-The menu takes too long to load, which is frustrating.It is only play-able to reveal the destiny of Ezio. Recomended for those who are willing to find out the journey of Ezio, otherwise, wait until the next sale.I have bought the Assassins Creed franchise 1~4 during the summer sale.so far, my rating goesAC 2 > AC 1 > AC 2 Brotherhood			"

So I had damaged armor, but no way to repair it until the game was finished, which made it hard. Overall though, fantastic game 9.5/10			"

												The game has become so wide since the first installation. I don't know whether to call it a rpg or a puzzle game. This variety of content contributed much to the game? This is a debateble concern. Some might find it pleasent whereas some don't. I feel that the rich content may  feel like overwhelming sometimes. If you are looking for a simple game like in the first installation this is not your game. On the other hand, if you are okay with widening your perspective, i would definetely recommend it. Only thing i found lacking in this one was the inability to alter some of the keyboard shortcuts.There was this sense of uncomfortable feeling while you are navigating through the menus. (W A S D doesnt work with menus and former ""TAB=quit"" changed into ""ESC"" button which i found disturbing.)I believe only the PC version has theswe flaws since right now companies mainly focus on console version games. I found the ingame climbing easier in AC2 but like i said above, the game is lacking in PC version since sometimes while climbing you encounter weird camera angle which makes it nearly impossible to make the appropriate jumps while using a keyboard (You definetely need a console controller for this otwerwise you are bound to suffer a lot). Puzzles are definetely more challenging from the previous games and as always the story was mindblowing. Overall, very good game but sometimes can make you rage bc of some awkward control issues in PC version if you are using a keyboard.			"

												23 hours or so long, I did lots of sidequest things.Game runs fine and looks prettier than AC2.  Controls are a bit righter, but there are a lot less rooftops to run around in and a lot more open fields.Compared to AC2, this game streamlines the combat without improving it at all.  Bosses are as dissapointing as they ever were, but now there are less of them.  There is not much innovation in mechanics or content, but zones are much more well designed and fleshed out.  Storyline is fine, but there's a lot of pointless sidequest and a few plot points just left unadressed.  There's a 'trade good' and shop quest system that is not at all developed or fun.  There's a few new tools for the player to use but not necessarily in interesting ways.Overall the game is basically AC2 with more spitshine but, as will come with the curse of sequels, they dont do anything unsafe with it.

The middle chapter of the Ezio trilogy this game does a great job of continuing Ezio's adventures.

												Assassin's Creed Brotherhood offers modest but welcome improvements over the previous entry in the series, Assassin's Creed II. Graphically, it's very similar. I did notice a new day/night lighting cycle, and greater variety in character models around the city.However, the gameplay has been tuned significantly. I found the free-running much smoother in this game; I spent less time jumping accidentally against walls that I didn't mean to climb. Brotherhood seems to know where I want to go much better than AC2 did.But mechanics aside, it's the new mission structure that really impressed me. Brotherhood takes a lesson from the Grand Theft Auto series -- the city of Rome is huge, and there's always something nearby that you can get involved with. The major missions come more naturally; you don't feel funneled towards them in Brotherhood like you do in AC2. You can take them on early, or muck around in the city for a long while before addressing the major story.And - the story. The Assassin's Creed storyline is still wonderful, and improves in Brotherhood. The cut scenes are well-balanced so they don't dominate gameplay. The body models are expressive and evocative, and the voice acting is excellent. I find that I really care about these characters and what's happening in the story. Also, Brotherhood really improves Desmond's meta-story. Last comment - Assassin's Creed has the best cities in video games, hands down. Brotherhood takes place almost exclusively in Rome during the renaissance. The city and nearby countryside is massive! But the attention to detail is remarkable. You see different NPC character models in different parts of the city, and they change between night and day. People mill about in a realistic fashion; some have places to be, others chat in the shade. The ambient noise is fantastic. And never a loading screen as you move about.So... Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is over 4 years old as I write this, so I doubt I'll convince anyone to play it who hasn't already. But it looks great, plays great on PC with a controller, and really delivers a satisfying experience. It's definitely worth your time.			"

												It's not quite as bad as the first AC game, but way worse than AC II or AC IV. Lot's of stupid special missions you need to solve exactly one way or they won't work. Lot's of missions impossible to solve the first time round because you have no time to look around and plan, you run and do. If you did right, you will barely make it in time. If you chose wrong on pure luck, desynch, try again, try another way. No thinking, no planning, just run and do trial and error.Regular and egregeously stupid camera lock to some effed up perspective you cannot see anything you'd like to see. The freerun ""railing"" usually get's more in the way than helping, which is emphasized by willy-nilly placed ""railing""-structures like walls that break and stop any attempt at freerunning that was not explicitly build as a course.Regular occurances of interface failure, where among the three dozen context-selected actions on one button the only sensible and rather required one is not available and your char does something completely stupid instead. (Enemy? Wait, you could... knit, cook, puzzle, hug, read the newspaper, go to the toilet or pull faces. Attack? No. Assasinate? No. Run? What are you, a coward?)Open world? Yes, in theory. In practice, most interesting things are only available once you got all regions unlocked and are about done with the game. What you might want with any special equipment once you have no occasion to use it anymore is anyones guess.Achievements? Well, yes, but it's anyones guess what some of them are meant to be. ""Kill guards while mounted."" well... it does not count the amount of guards you kill while mounted yourself. And ist does not count guards killed while they are mounted, at least not assassinated ones. And a hit in combat usually dismounts guards instead of killingt them while mounted. Hmm... I have some that triggered, but not the foggiest idea which, how and why.Full synchro? Yes, please try. Some of the requierments are stupendously easy, many others are terribly frustratingly difficult. Combined with the above mentioned mission pacing as purely lucky choice parcours, no ""redo from checkpoint"" option and the frequent control glitches... eff that.			"

												This is a Good game. As an example, I present that I have purchased this game twice: once for console (and then the disc disappeared, fortunately after I'd already beaten it), and once now on Steam.In some ways the game feels more like an expansion to AC2 than a full game in it's own right, but you get enough done over the course of the game that it stands on it's own fairly well.My only real complaint is that this is really where Ubisoft started to listen to the fans complaints about the Meta-Plot. Yeah,  you get to explore Ezio's home, but it really feels like there was going to be more to it and they just never got around to doing it.Is this canonically part of the 40K universe? Well, it takes place on Terra, so in the broad since it certainly could be. Minerva, Jupiter and crew could easily be Eldar screwing around with early man, and the Apple and other artifacts would be Eldar tech.			"

												Top notch game!This first expac to the AC2 game is just crazy. You got so much stuff you can do with your assassins crew its really fun. You can send your assassins on misson to improve their lvl and skills and make them master assassins. All kind of new achievements galore. The story continue with Etsio pursuing the golden apple. Somehow, i found the story a bit more dull than with AC2, but the gameplay was more fun. Actually, i spent faaaaar more time with my assassins crew and side mission than with the main story.I think i sank 60 hours in the game and i still had a few achievements that i didn't get.			"

												In Ubisoft's thrid installement of the Assassin's Creed series we follow Firenze's favourite lady's man: Ezio Auditore. However, this time he is 40 years old, not 17-40 like in the AC2. This is overall a great game. The climbing is just as good as AC2 and AC1. That being said there are some minor problems in the map. We'll get into the pros and cons later, now we will talk about the story.At the beggining of the game you begin right where you left of in AC2. For those of you that like a game because of the story, buy AC2 first it will make the story more clear. After leaving the vault you reunite with Uncle Mario. After returning back to the Villa you are greeted by the beautiful Catarina Sforza, whom you bang that night. Afterwards the villa is attacked my Ceasere Borgia, The pope's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ son. He takes back the apple of eden and kills Mario. :( Ezio then goes to Rome seeking revenege and the Apple. After reuniting with the other Assassin's, Ezio liberates Rome and gives it back to the people. Pros- Great Gameplay- Goodish Story- Climbing is still good- Corteseans are still good looking- There's a sex scene!- Plenty of side missionsCons- Rome's map is all over the place. Some buildings are high above others and you cant climb them without stopping and going around.- The master armor looks more like a winter jacket than an Assassin's hood.- Money is scarce and buildings are too expensive- Character develpment is limitedVerdictACBH is good game with lots to do. However, the story just isn't as good as AC2. Ezio doesn't seem to grow as much as he did in AC2. Which does make sense but it would be better if he connected with his sister more instead of just feeling bad about not being behind her for 25 years. The climbing would be way better if the map wasn't so messed up. Anyway, this game is fun but if you are looking for story rich, fast paced game. Play AC2 or Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor. If you want a fun, open-world game with some stealth and some loud pound this is the game for you. I give it a 7.5/10.			"

												The second Assassin's Creed title I've played.  The core mechanics remain the same, which in most cases is a mixed blessing.  In this case I think it worked out for the best, since the level design and a handful of new mechanics encouraged me to try out new tactics I hadn't attempted in the previous game.  In particular I made much use of the crossbow, poison darts, and minion attacks, the combination of which allowed me to take on much larger groups of guards without losing health.  As a strategic minded player, I greatly enjoyed leveling up my minions by sending them on missions.  I spent 24 hours on the game, and overall I think I got my moneys worth.8/10			"

												Good game, too short.So ACII was pretty good, it was a true upgrade from the AC experience and yet I guess Ubisoft decided to make money and ruin a great franchise going the CoD way, the only thing wrong is that they don't have 3 teams to build a game in a 3 year cycle. Anyway I really thought it would be better since people recommended me the game so much but it just feels like an episode from ACII.I was hoping the game to contribute more to the main story and not just give you the intro, play 10 in game hours and then give you another clue about the ""actual story"" of the franchise. If you like these games, then I'm sure you'll like to do the same stuff that ACII brought to us. If you're not that into AC then I'd probably pass Brotherhood and Revelations to play ACIII. I hope Revelations isn't that bad since most people say it is.PROS-Assasins are a really a great feature of the game, but I would've like to use them earlier on the game.CONS-Game is too short compared to ACII, it's actually half the story in game time.-Story doesn't tells you much about what the heck is going on with Desmond.-Rebuilding things is cool, but feels empty anyway it doesnt help much in the game to do everysingle shop.-Gather all the *insert anything that comes to your mind here*.The game is good, but nothing great which I was expecting after playing ACII. I guess this is where money and Ubisoft face the downfall of AC franchise? Well I hope not because I will play Revelations for Reviewer's sake and hope it has more to offer...			"

												It isn't Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood, it's more Assassin’s Creed 2, and that is not a bad thing. The main problem is that the story is perhaps not as enthralling as its predecessor, but if you've played through Assassin’s Creed 2, the entire situation is given a little more context. If you found some annoying problems with the movement or combat in Assassin’s Creed 2, they will probably still be present, so be warned. The resource management minigame is an interesting distraction, and there is some satisfaction to be had in seeing your hired assassins become more skillful.			"

												Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ I never really believed it was possible to out-do Assassin's Creed II, but they did it. And they did it in style.Assassin's Creed Brotherhood takes place almost entirely in Roma. The plot of the game is intriguing, and, unlike Assassin's Creed II, most of the side-missions are short but just as sweet. There is some DLC one could purchase and, honestly, I recommend it highly.They improved everything that has to do with combat without sacrificing the difficulty all-together. Wall climbing is also substantially faster without being too much easier. The graphics are breathtaking, a whole step up from ACII. Horses make a comeback, and it is now much easier to move about a large portion of a city (besides quick travels through the sewers) and, more importantly, horses are now another variable in combat.I can't really think of anything that his game got wrong! Even the multiplayer is fantastic! Albeit, somewhat dead nowadays.YOU SHOULD PLAY AC & ACII BEFORE PLAYING THIS GAME9 OF 10Silence Dogood			"

Game runs perfectly on my PC and looks better than AC4:Black Flag which runs very slow. Brotherhood is very long and the amount of side activities is huge! Creating your own Assasin Guild is fantastic and is implemented well. Soundtrack is a piece of art!MINUS: Can't think of any! Buy it!			"

You continue to play as Ezio Auditore from AC:2, an assassin living in Renaisance Italy. Full of awesome action, believable characters and some crazy new weapons like the crossbow, this game is definetely worth your time and money. I would rate this game a solid 8/10 and would easily reccomend it as one of the best Asssassin Creed games, right behind AC:2.*By the way, don't be fooled by my low hours on this review (6.9 at time of posting), I have played through the entire game before, having only bought it on Steam very recently.

												The Best Assassin's creed I've ever played. After Revelation, Assassin's creed Series became bored. But Brotherhood gave great experience. Battle is quite good. Only One Full Sync is better as revelation did. I purchased it with Revelations and Black flag, AC2. Also. In the side-mission, It has full sync challenges! I love it!  "

												I kind of hated this game. I liked Assassin's Creed 2, but this game just kept ramming itself into walls. The missions are terrible and boring. I'm tired of following people through crowds to eavesdrop on their conversations - it's not fun. Then you have some completely buggy and broken stuff to go along with it. Some of the side missions or optional stuff let's you assassinate a Borgia family captain who walks around a general area. One time I came across a ship yard, where clearly the developers wanted you to dive off the mast of a ship and air assassinate him. I didn't want to do this - I had seen it done many times and I wanted to do it my way. The problem? Approaching him made him run, which is fine, but he runs about 10 feet before he disappears into the side of a building. No doors or anything around, he just vanishes. I felt like I was playing a Playstation 2 game. There were frequent occurrences of ridiculous design like that and I had enough of it. I did not finish the game nor do I want to. It also turned me off of the rest of the series.			"

												Another improvement over the previous game, and continues to wonderfully scratch the ""Tomb Raider itch"".  A huge amount of things to do and manage, a giant city to run around in, buildings to climb, etc, as well as a neat historic setting peppered with plenty of information on buildings, people and events.  There are problems of course, the controls don't always respond as quickly as you might like, the 100% synch challenges are more annoying than challenging, the investment system is a drag, and the scenes outside of the Animus continue to feel like irritating distractions to the ""real"" story of Ezio's adventures in Rome.  But they're minor problems in what is otherwise an extremely engaging game.			"

												Even though Assassin's Creed 2 left me wondering what the feck just happened after the (anticlimatic) end fight, AC Brotherhood does a good job wrapping things up and explaining more stuff related to Desmond. After all, it's fun collecting all these bits of information and work towards an explanation for all that is happening.This game would be perfect if it wasn't for the sloppy console-port - the controls feel stiff when using mouse & keyboard.Apart from that I recommend this to fans of the Assassin's Creed series.

Somehow, i found the story a bit more dull than with AC2, but the gameplay was more fun. Actually, i spent faaaaar more time with my assassins crew and side mission than with the main story.I think i sank 60 hours in the game and i still had a few achievements that i didn't get.			"

Update to the graphics engine improves so much on the look and feel, auditory sounds in the cities make it so much more lifelike than in the past two games, the HUD has been slimmed down and the optimization of the game is just amazing. New interactions, items, weapons, city economies, additional parkour elements and a brand new storyline makes this much less an upgrade with the same characters and different storyline, but a fully new game with four times the facets as the previous one.The multiplayer has been flawless since release day, being able to choose your own character skin and just the simple way to play multiplayer with the quick tutorial is so much fun and before you know it 2 hours have gone by in extreme fun.

												It's a pretty good game. Story was amazing as usual, but gameplay remained unaltered. Graphics were a step down from ACII (even though this came out a year later). There were a few problems, and it felt like a poor console port. The entire game lasted one-third of the time that ACII did, which was a little bit of a surprise. Also, the whole Assassin's Guild system was pretty easy to master; however, recruiting new people felt repetitive. There were a lot a structures that were clipping through each other, but most of the Assassin's Creed games have had lots of errors like this (flying lamps, lots of clipping, etc).Overall, it was a nice edition to the franchise; but they could have done better.

												The Creed evolves in the third installment to the Assassin's Creed Universe. Ezio, once again reprises his role as an experienced assassin, with a bag of new tricks. Summoning companions to decimate your enemies, mysteries waiting to be solved, more questions and more answers await your initition. Further your knowledge with new history filled with new characters new and old. ACR:B contains even more content than that of assassin's creed 2, you will be bewildered, stressed, out-of-control-rage, sad, pity, hot, cold, unforgiving, forgiving, bulging eyes, and constant bathroom breaks(sarcasm intended).If you're a fan, i'd suggest immediatly picking this up before I reprise my role as an assassin and kidnap all Abstergo operatives and force them into the sewers, never seeing the light again (I'm serious). However if you're not a fan, but some new guy, i'd suggest sucking up you're pride, and guts, and go back to assassin's creed 1, finishing that, and also two before you head on over to AC:B. Let it be known you will be far from dissapointed. At least you will be surpised, agitated, excited, and perhaps a badass ( if you think like one). But, of course it's up to you, whether you have the courage to take a blade and fight against the approaching Templar menace. Our Creed lies with you,9.51/10			"

												Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood suffers from a so-called 'intermediate chapter syndrome'. It's just as good as Assassin's Creed II with improvements in some areas. What it lacks though is surprise. Brotherhood continues the story of Ezio, becoming the second chapter in a sub-trilogy within Assassin's Creed tetralogy. As a result, few new characters are introduced, and the story progresses at a slow and steady pace. It's not any less interesting than in previous games, and its ending, again, is cool and unexpected, but while the second game was a major step forward compared to the first one, Brotherhood feels more like an expansion pack for the second game.It introduces multiplayer which is surprisingly fun for something that shouldn't have existed in the first place. It has integration with Assassin's Creed: Project Legacy, a Facebook game that sheds some light on the series' mysteries.That being said, AC: Brotherhood is still a must-play for everyone who enjoyed the first two games.

												Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is in my opinion, the best Assassin's Creed game out there.Let me tell you why.The story picks up right after Assassins Creed II's ending, so I can't really talk much about what it happens in it, but what I can say is that Desmond finds himself in Monteriggioni reliving the rest of the memories of his ancestor Ezio Auditore da Firenze to look for clues as to where is the Apple of Eden, an ancient artifact from an advanced civilization of old.Ezio's story itself also takes place right after the ending of Assassins Creed II, but to keep it spoiler free, all I can tell is that Ezio now finds himself in Rome trying to take on The Borgia family's tyranny while building his own Assassin Brotherhood.From this little synopsis of the plot you can pretty much tell the most important draw fromt he game, it doesn't feel 100% new in it's assassin story. It just expands upon Ezio's story in AC II. Plus the game doesn't do many things differently from AC II in terms of presentation or even core gameplay, BUT it does add many other good things.For instance, the game adds dual wielding to some weapons, which removes the tediousness of constantly having to switch weapons using the weapon wheel to change weapons. Not only that, but now you can customize the d-pad weapon shortcuts. The game also adds a killstreak feature which allows you to make chain kills in combat, while it's fun to use, it makes the combat a little too easy. The game adds new weapons like: The crossbow or the Poison Darts, which offer new approaches to each situation that's presented to you. Another feature is that you can now use horses everywhere in the city of Rome, making navigation much faster. Another great feature is that now you can exit the Animus at any time to play as Desmond and interact with your crew and surroundings, and I must admit that it comes close to the the great moments as Desmond from AC I, disgracely roaming in Monteriggioni is timed and you cannot do much. But seeing how Monteriggioni has aged is considerably interesting.Now the main gameplay feature from Brotherhood is that you can now recruit Assassins into your own Brotherhood, which can aid you in battle or on assasinations. This assassins can be sent on missions for experience and other rewards until they reach the Asassin rank. This system can essentially bring more hours of gameplay and enjoyment into the game. The last system added unto the game is the Rome renovation system, in which you can invest on locales from Rome after you've eliminated Borgia controll, which can give you money in return. While similar to the Monteriggioni system from AC II it does add some more depth to it.The only issue I have from all of this is that there are far too many things to do in the game eventually leaving you overwhelmed by all the choices.The story is presented in the same way as AC II, while adding the much needed memory replay option and some interesting optional objectives to get cheats or costumes for your character.Another feature from this game is a multiplayer component, which consists in assassinating other players while trying not to be assasinated. I couldn't really check it out because of the following issue, THE COMMUNITY IS BASICALLY DEAD. It is pretty much impossible to play a good MP match nowadays because of the lack of dedicated servers or an active community to play with.Overall, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood does everything that Assassin's Creed II did right, while at the same time adding new content to the game. This is a must play for every AC fan out there and a worthwhile check to everyone else.If you are not a big fan of AC get it on sale at least but check it out at least once in your life.PC PORT REPORT: ♥♥♥♥ YOU UPLAY I ♥♥♥♥ING HATE YOU. Same issues with AC I though. Poor controls that can be rebindable, so if you plan on checking this game out I recommend getting a controller compatible with a PC beforehand. If you have the console version I recommend staying away from this PC port because it doesn't add anything worthwhile to the core game.			"

												Great follow up for the best game in the series, and in my opinion the last Assassin's Creed game that doesn't suck. Reasonable story, beautiful city, great design overall.What makes it actually great is the multiplayer mode. In console version, I spend over 80 hours back in the day, just playing the multiplayer. It's appearently not everyone's cup of tea but if you like it, you will be spending lots of hours. It is better than AC: Revelations Multiplayer because Ubisoft watered down the damn game, in order to make it more accessible. Multiplayer mode in PC still has player base, which makes it a worthwhile buy for me. If you like stealthy, sneaky-stabby action, then this is for you.			"

												Personally, this is my No. 1 Assassin's Creed. It took the best things AC2 brought about, added mechanics that are not completely ignorable and useless (Revelation I'm looking at you), and coupled them with Ezio just at the right age (not too young to be naive and hot-headed, nor too old to realistically parkour - Revelation I'm looking at you again) for what he's going to be facing.

												I enjoyed this games campaign very much so it was very long but very enjoyable the entire time. The different styles of play this series allows is great. However once you have completed the campaign and sides missions the game really just drops since multiplayer is lacking players based on the games age. But still if you are looking for a 15-25 hour long campaign with a great story this would be a game to check out. Worth the price and worth the time.			"

												Trying to add to what was added and improved in Assassin's Creed 2, but what it adds doesnt really give it much value. its more of the same with some boring side missings and uninteresting minigames. the overworld is boring, the villens are more forgettable then before and the main character acts too use to what he does and isnt enjoable to watch let alone play. if your going to play this game, then your only playing it for the story which isnt that great either. this one is passable but its not something i would recommend without a big sale tag on it.

												Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood (henceforth referred to as AC:B) is the third title in the Assassin's Creed series. Chronologically taking place after AC2, this is a nice sequel. Admittedly the numerous graphical glitches (ground not loading, birds stretching into the sky, enemies sliding on hills) are distracting and do take you out of the moment. The story is gripping, and the addition of heavy weapons is a nice touch. However, AC:B fails in the respect of convenience: you have to buy the stores yourself in order for them to sell you things, and you often need quite a bit of money to do that. Frankly they should have not included that facet, it was the worst part of the game. The combat was much to easy, AC1 had the right idea in preventing you from using the counter move until halfway through the game, forcing you to dodge and such. Despite this, I still reccomend this game.			"

												Atmostpheric and beautiful with a stunning soundtrack, voice acting, and top notch cinematics and direction.The story was immersive, and the historical setting alone makes this game very worthy of playing. This has to be one of the best depictions of ROME 1500ish that I have ever seen. The quality of artwork is fabulous. This is a god installment to the Assassins Creed series, and while I suppose a player could spend hours completing all of the subquests, I stuck to the main storyline to avoid any boredom.Recommended.

												Good game, too short.So ACII was pretty good, it was a true upgrade from the AC experience and yet I guess Ubisoft decided to make money and ruin a great franchise going the CoD way, the only thing wrong is that they don't have 3 teams to build a game in a 3 year cycle. Anyway I really thought it would be better since people recommended me the game so much but it just feels like an episode from ACII.I was hoping the game to contribute more to the main story and not just give you the intro, play 10 in game hours and then give you another clue about the ""actual story"" of the franchise. If you like these games, then I'm sure you'll like to do the same stuff that ACII brought to us. If you're not that into AC then I'd probably pass Brotherhood and Revelations to play ACIII. I hope Revelations isn't that bad since most people say it is.PROS-Assasins are a really a great feature of the game, but I would've like to use them earlier on the game.CONS-Game is too short compared to ACII, it's actually half the story in game time.-Story doesn't tells you much about what the heck is going on with Desmond.-Rebuilding things is cool, but feels empty anyway it doesnt help much in the game to do everysingle shop.-Gather all the *insert anything that comes to your mind here*.The game is good, but nothing great which I was expecting after playing ACII. I guess this is where money and Ubisoft face the downfall of AC franchise? Well I hope not because I will play Revelations for Reviewer's sake and hope it has more to offer...			"

												Amazing Game. Update to the graphics engine improves so much on the look and feel, auditory sounds in the cities make it so much more lifelike than in the past two games, the HUD has been slimmed down and the optimization of the game is just amazing. New interactions, items, weapons, city economies, additional parkour elements and a brand new storyline makes this much less an upgrade with the same characters and different storyline, but a fully new game with four times the facets as the previous one.The multiplayer has been flawless since release day, being able to choose your own character skin and just the simple way to play multiplayer with the quick tutorial is so much fun and before you know it 2 hours have gone by in extreme fun. This was worth my $50 by a long shot.			"

												Great game! Good successor after Assassin's Creed II. Rome has been made well and after the initial confusion it turns out to be very huge and explorable. There are lot's to do for everyone, who has even bit of an adventurious nature and even though combat is way too easy and crossbow is significantly overpowered, one can easily overcome these by trying pacifistic (hurt minimal amount) or ghostlike (not been seen or vanquish right away when seen), or what ever the player feels like. Little problems setting up ubisoft user but game made it all quickly up. Also I was suprised that the online player vs player was still plentifully occupied with fellow assassins.			"

												Out of the series, this is my favourite so far. Familiarity of AC 2's HUD system and combat mechanics with additional in-game features such as building up your very own troupe of Assassins and sending them on missions to gain levels and become more powerful. One of my favourite features was having the Assassin's at my beck and call to terminate any tricky targets or just to troll the guards for a bit of fun. Great continuation of the story so far with even more intrigue thrown in and questions raised. Definitely a worthy addition to your AC collection, or just a fun game all around. *****			"

												Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is in my opinion, the best Assassin's Creed game out there.Let me tell you why.The story picks up right after Assassins Creed II's ending, so I can't really talk much about what it happens in it, but what I can say is that Desmond finds himself in Monteriggioni reliving the rest of the memories of his ancestor Ezio Auditore da Firenze to look for clues as to where is the Apple of Eden, an ancient artifact from an advanced civilization of old.Ezio's story itself also takes place right after the ending of Assassins Creed II, but to keep it spoiler free, all I can tell is that Ezio now finds himself in Rome trying to take on The Borgia family's tyranny while building his own Assassin Brotherhood.From this little synopsis of the plot you can pretty much tell the most important draw fromt he game, it doesn't feel 100% new in it's assassin story. It just expands upon Ezio's story in AC II. Plus the game doesn't do many things differently from AC II in terms of presentation or even core gameplay, BUT it does add many other good things.For instance, the game adds dual wielding to some weapons, which removes the tediousness of constantly having to switch weapons using the weapon wheel to change weapons. Not only that, but now you can customize the d-pad weapon shortcuts. The game also adds a killstreak feature which allows you to make chain kills in combat, while it's fun to use, it makes the combat a little too easy. The game adds new weapons like: The crossbow or the Poison Darts, which offer new approaches to each situation that's presented to you. Another feature is that you can now use horses everywhere in the city of Rome, making navigation much faster. Another great feature is that now you can exit the Animus at any time to play as Desmond and interact with your crew and surroundings, and I must admit that it comes close to the the great moments as Desmond from AC I, disgracely roaming in Monteriggioni is timed and you cannot do much. But seeing how Monteriggioni has aged is considerably interesting.Now the main gameplay feature from Brotherhood is that you can now recruit Assassins into your own Brotherhood, which can aid you in battle or on assasinations. This assassins can be sent on missions for experience and other rewards until they reach the Asassin rank. This system can essentially bring more hours of gameplay and enjoyment into the game. The last system added unto the game is the Rome renovation system, in which you can invest on locales from Rome after you've eliminated Borgia controll, which can give you money in return. While similar to the Monteriggioni system from AC II it does add some more depth to it.The only issue I have from all of this is that there are far too many things to do in the game eventually leaving you overwhelmed by all the choices.The story is presented in the same way as AC II, while adding the much needed memory replay option and some interesting optional objectives to get cheats or costumes for your character.Another feature from this game is a multiplayer component, which consists in assassinating other players while trying not to be assasinated. I couldn't really check it out because of the following issue, THE COMMUNITY IS BASICALLY DEAD. It is pretty much impossible to play a good MP match nowadays because of the lack of dedicated servers or an active community to play with.Overall, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood does everything that Assassin's Creed II did right, while at the same time adding new content to the game. This is a must play for every AC fan out there and a worthwhile check to everyone else.If you are not a big fan of AC get it on sale at least but check it out at least once in your life.PC PORT REPORT: ♥♥♥♥ YOU UPLAY I ♥♥♥♥ING HATE YOU. Same issues with AC I though. Poor controls that can be rebindable, so if you plan on checking this game out I recommend getting a controller compatible with a PC beforehand. If you have the console version I recommend staying away from this PC port because it doesn't add anything worthwhile to the core game.			"

												ATTENTION EVERYONE WHO CAN'T LOGIN!!!!!! I cant promise that this will work for you but it worked for me. search your computer files for ubisoft game launcher. Or if you know where it is in your computer files just go to it and open it. When you open it find UPLAY. It is listed as an application. It is about 25,000+ kbs. Right click it. Then select properties. After selecting properties. Click compatibility tab. Then select RUN COMPATIBILITY TROUBLESHOOTER. Just follow the on screen prompt. It took me two different settings to run but it worked when I tested the program. Be sure after you test it and it works to SAVE THE NEW SETTINGS. meaning just finish the on screen prompts. I really hope this works for all of you as it did for me. If this helps you please just give me a thumbs up. And if you have any questions please ask and I will get to you as quickly as I can. I hope I explained clearly enough.			"

												While the Assassin's Creed series isn't exactly shining at the time that I write this, this game is, and likely always will be, my favorite Assassin's Creed game and one of my favorite games of all time. It has a vast and realistic depiction of Rome, with details so accurate you can find some of the small alleys that really exist there in-game. It has complex characters and a charismatic lead who is questionable but sympathetic. It has side missions that actually engross you. It is essentially everything that AC2 was, but with a little more gameplay variety, and in Rome to boot. I strongly recommend this game.			"

												While the story is more grounded then AC II this game is far from disappointing with all your fellow assasins by your side as you begin to develop the reach and influence of your brotherhood. The gameplay is smooth and their is plenty to do on the side to get more florins for your coin purse. The story is incredibly well done and has been done so that even in short play sessions you can make enough progress to leave you wanting more . Overall, assasins creed brotherhood is a perfect 10/10 and remember nothing is true , everything is permitted!			"

												The Best Assassin's creed I've ever played. After Revelation, Assassin's creed Series became bored. But Brotherhood gave great experience. Battle is quite good. Only One Full Sync is better as revelation did. I purchased it with Revelations and Black flag, AC2. Also. In the side-mission, It has full sync challenges! I love it!  "

												This game is great: it runs very smoothly and efficiently, the plot is well developed, and the freerunning is a little less linear or obvious now. There are some zones that you navigate like a 3-dimmensional maze. Combat is a lot more fluid and you can kill many more units at once, so there are now much larger battles in place.The plot is well-written, and, as with the environments, attention was taken on details-- at least until about 60% synched. I'm not spoiling anything, but just know that the game is about 90% complete when it gets to about 60%, and you can't access any more of the world (shops, training, etc.) once you get to this point. (With broken armor it made this part incredibly hard.)The multiplayer is also very well done. It's pretty unique to the market, even in its execution: it's a game where not only do you match your abilities versus your opponents, but your ability to play mind-games as well. Incredibly well done.			"

												A pretty good sequel to Assassin's Creed 2. Brotherhood continues the story of Ezio/Desmond. There are improvements on the gameplay but mostly this is a continuation for AC2 but instead of feeling like a rehash the story is interesting and I got to care what happened to Ezio. The desmond story is not as interesting but you spend so little time as Desmond it doesn't matter. The game ends on an interesting cliffhanger so Now I'm off to play Relevations.			"

												'Assassin's Creed Brotherhood' improves on its predecessor, 'Assassin's Creed II' in almost every way. The graphics are more detailed and combat systems are even more finely tuned. The commerce system is a bit distracting at first, but proves invaluable if you wish to rebuild Rome as a side mission. Give the game some time to gain its momentum because it gets more fun once you start recruiting people to join your brotherhood.			"

												The first Assassin's Creed was clearly a game with great potential and cool ideas, a new approach to the ""sneak and stealh""-genre. But alas, it turned out weak due mostly to it's highly repetitive missions and completion structure, unintresting plotline and world and it's generally unpolished finish. Cue Brotherhood, the third installment in the franchise. This is Assassin's Creed in it's top form. A beautifully rendered Rome in the Reneissance Era with characters, buildings and events from real-life combined with the fictionous Ezio and his quest, vastly imporved controls that add to the fluidity of the parkour movements and the general feeling that now I, the player, am in control of not only Ezio but also Rome. This is how it should have been from the beginning!			"

												You thought the crazy Adventures of Dezmond and Ezio are over? Think again. In this third and most likely last installment for a while, you are thrown right back to where AS:2 finished.Anyway, the graphics engine has been completly overhauled to provide an even more interesting immersive experience over the previous two games. Its hungry for hardware so perhaps make sure you can play AS and AS:2 at least on medium to ensure you can play this much detailed sequal.Story wise its been improved and as previously stated, its a direct continuation from AS:2. More quirks and additions are in this packed game, so if you are an Assasin at heart, this is a MUST buy. If you have a controller, then all the best, good luck and remember, you are an elite assasin in the 1500's.Where will the fight with Astergo lead you? What answers does Subject 16 still have for you? Where did Leonardo get to? All will be revealed in this action packed, beautifully detailed game.Final Score: 4 / 5			"

												This entry was  vast improvement over Assassin's Creed 2 for me.  I'm not even sure if I can put my finger on why that is either.  Perhaps less flag/feather gathering.  I'm a bit of a completionist so that drove me insane in AC2.  Though admittedly I didn't gather everything in this entry either.  For those without AC experience, there are flags and other items to ""collect"" scattered around the game.  Some are in hard to reach places or locked areas that open up as you progress.  For the most part I enjoyed the ""jumping puzzle"" and added challenge of figuring out how to get to them.  Some may not...for some reason in AC2 I was at my wit's end due to the size of the game and high number/variety of items. The feeling of ""missing something"" was constantly there and it became tedious trying to figure out what I may have overlooked.  One of the bigger changes in Brotherhood in regard to missions, was that every single one had an added challenge in order for you to get 100% synchronization for a memory.  At first, I found this extremely frustrating especially since I hadn't mastered some of the combat mechanics (like kill streaks, though once I figured that out it, my game changed dramatically).  But eventually I ended up finding that the missions were a lot more fun with the added challenge.  Granted, there were times I was cursing how clumsy I was with the controls. This did eliminate some freedom in how you decided to complete a mission.  That was my biggest lament over this feature...but for me, it wasn't a terrible thing.  The acrobatics in this installment are as you'd expect them.  Perhaps it was my imagination, but it felt more responsive than the previous games and  traversing the rooftops felt more fluid than ever.  As much as I'd expect to get tired of it, just jumping from rooftop to rooftop, is a good time. It's no wonder flabby gamers everywhere love the AC series because it lets you become the ultimate acrobatic badass as you hang from a ledge by one hand flashing your 12 pack abs to the ladies below. Those courtesans may sleep with everyone else in the game, but let's face it, they all want you (Ezio). I have to give props to the music in the game.  The perfect track always started when you were jumping through ruins, fighting 20 guards or racing the clock.  It always felt right. I liked the storyline this time around.  I had to recap what happened in AC2 before I played Brotherhood. But I'll be starting Revelations knowing exactly what happened in Brotherhood. No shortage of intrigue and I have to give the writers credit, I love the whole premise of visiting a time period hundreds of years ago while progressing a sci fi story in the present/future. It's brilliant from a sequel standpoint, especially considering the fact that I'm 3 games behind the current release (with a new one on the way).  I hope Revelations is as satisfying as Brotherhood. I know AC2 was a fan favorite, after reading reviews and comments about it.  I can understand why some loved AC2 over AC1 due to AC1's repetitiveness but I didn't get much out of the crazy amount of side quests and collecting in AC2.  I also felt like AC1 was stronger from a storytelling perspective (with the ending being an exception perhaps). Ezio was very difficult to like at first too. Perhaps that's why Brotherhood won me over.  It took all of AC2 and Brotherhood for me to warm up to him.			"

												The sequel to ACII didn't disappoint, Brotherhood was really fun to play. The story continues the fight against the Borgia and their Templar agents in Rome, Ezio takes it upon himself to lead the Assassin Order as they try to free Rome from their influence. This was nicely portrayed as you rebuild your Assassin Order while crippling Templar presence. The story was shorter than the previous game, but it was still very well made and packed with intriguing characters.The gameplay didn’t change much from ACII, but did add some entertaining side missions like liberating sectors of Rome from Borgia oppression, further develop the city’s economy and various assassination contracts. Ezio develops his leadership skills while training recruits and managing the Order, this also allows the ability to call assassins as backup or send them on mission across Europe.The graphics and animations are amazing, the streets, the architecture and monuments and landmarks of Rome are breathtaking and really add to the game’s immersion. The soundtrack itself adds to this, combining some old songs with new ones, really good work.Definately a game worth buying and a great addition to the series.			"

												Good way to continue from where AC2 has ended. If you want to play a good Assassin's Creed game, here's more of it where AC2 left off. Combat is still lawful, and I was in no hurry trying to get the best armour of the game. I finished the story mode without it.I haven't really played the multiplayer. I'm not the one to judge it. I tried the tutorial & it required a re-bind to the controller, but I haven't really done much in that.I recomend it for the story mode.Update after 102 hours of playing: If you're a fan of the series & you have a SSD, go on and have a go, but if you don't you can't 100% the singleplayer. Ubisoft back in 2010 decided to make galloping a SSD only feature in freeroam mode. My second playthrough was not as enjoyable as the first. Also to note some the Da-Vinci machines are awkward to control and completing the no hit requirement in the memory just makes it infuriating.			"

The story was shorter than the previous game, but it was still very well made and packed with intriguing characters.The gameplay didn’t change much from ACII, but did add some entertaining side missions like liberating sectors of Rome from Borgia oppression, further develop the city’s economy and various assassination contracts. Ezio develops his leadership skills while training recruits and managing the Order, this also allows the ability to call assassins as backup or send them on mission across Europe.The graphics and animations are amazing, the streets, the architecture and monuments and landmarks of Rome are breathtaking and really add to the game’s immersion. The soundtrack itself adds to this, combining some old songs with new ones, really good work.Definately a game worth buying and a great addition to the series.			"

												I can't recommend this game, I bought it because I was interested in the back story as I played black flag, but the control scehem makes no sense and is completely distracting from the game and the game is a direct continuation of the story from the previous game, meaning if you didn't play it, you have no clue what is going on anywhere, and the game does an incredibly bad job of telling you what's what and who's who, I still don't have much of a clue what's going on, and I suspect it will stay that way.If you haven't played the previous game, you probably shouldn't play this.

												Having previously played AC 1, 2 and this game on console, I wasn't really sure what to expect when I bought this during the Steam Summer Sale 2014..... but it delivered and rekindled my gamer crush on Ezio. Gameplay is immersive. There's your main quest line, side quests, Cluster puzzles, plus a bunch of other tasks you can do within the single player game. There's also multiplayer, which if I can remember my console days clearly, isn't too bad either. Controls take a little while to get used to, especially with the move from console to PC for me, but they are displayed on screen and once you get the hang of what all the buttons to do, the combat is so much more enjoyable. I find this game quite challenging. While completing the quests aren't too difficult, the extra requirements needed for 100% sync makes it a little harder for those who are into full completion. I think this game is so much fun to play and I have yet to tire of the whole franchise. I highly reccommend this game and give it an 8 out of 10..... points lost because..... well running away and hiding can get a little annoying when sometimes I just want to kill em all.			"

												up a wallwhere this control schemedriveth me---So I skipped the first one and played II, Brotherhood, and Revelations back-to-back. I'd have to agree with the consensus that this is the Ezio game you want to play if you're new to Assassin's Creed.Still, what blows my mind isn't the silly animus framing narrative--but that to run in this game, you have to push the left analog stick while holding a trigger and a face button. The genius who came up with this control scheme must wear the label ironically.			"

												Do you like doing the same frustrating thing over and over again, and looking at the same flashing red FAIL screen everytime when you do not play the game exactly  the way the game wants you to play it?  Well this is the game for you!  This game is such a mix-up of playing styles, some really fun and some really frustrating and totally not fun.  It really seems like a frankenstein game made up of different parts by different programming teams - as the INCREDIBLY long credits proves!  Just too much design by committee here instead of a single vision.  Yes, I did finish the game but it was such a chore to do so, I couldn't wait for it to be over.  I guess I do recommend it as I did finish the game, but it's really not as much fun as the first 2 games in the series in my opinion.  And that ended - wtf!  Really a total letdown to end the game like that especially after the previous game ended so well.			"

												Great game! Good successor after Assassin's Creed II. Rome has been made well and after the initial confusion it turns out to be very huge and explorable. There are lot's to do for everyone, who has even bit of an adventurious nature and even though combat is way too easy and crossbow is significantly overpowered, one can easily overcome these by trying pacifistic (hurt minimal amount) or ghostlike (not been seen or vanquish right away when seen), or what ever the player feels like. Little problems setting up ubisoft user but game made it all quickly up. Also I was suprised that the online player vs player was still plentifully occupied with fellow assassins.			"

												It's pretty good, the gameplay is fun as hell. Even if you're used to it on a console (like I was) and are just coming back to it because you enjoyed it the first time, the controls are really quite easy to pick up with the parkour element being a simple combination of the left mouse button and the space bar. I mean come on.Also, the multiplayer, a few words, if you wanna actually find a game, don't try and play at like 5 in the morning or something, because, it probably won't work, if you wind up in a 1/6 lobby, leave and try again, if the lobby you end up in has more than 2 players waiting, stay there. The multiplayer is very much NOT dead and still has one of the nicest multiplayer gameplay experiences I have ever played.			"

With better city design, quests and antagonists (cesare borgia's ""if I want to take, I take"" speech is brilliant and beautifuly delivered), this is my favorite Assassin's Creed game.			"

												If you have just finished ACII and jump right into Brotherhood, you may feel a bit weird at first. Part of this weirdness feeling is good: Ezio “feels” older – he should be. The patchy beard, the slight comments from NPC’s here and there, the louder noise he makes when he drops from a height, it all adds to the feeling that the character you have played with since his teenage days in Firenze is now close to or in his  40’s – but don’t worry; he can still do all the good stuff. This, ageing, is not an easy thing to convey in a game and many developers will not do it at all, keeping their character closer to a young aged audience, but for a story like AC it is both needed and, in this case, well executed.The other part of the weirdness is perhaps not so good. AC Brotherhood needs time. In the beginning you feel a bit thrown into the game world without much to go on, no real idea where to begin. Perhaps that is a good thing. Ultimately, the small pieces of your “work” here and there begin to consolidate the picture and you start to tread on more solid ground. One point of complaint is the map and menu navigation which Ubisoft for some reason messed with from the previous game, with not so good results.Ultimately, Brotherhood continues the story from ACII nicely, deepens the plot, creates more questions but is all in all enjoyable. The recruitment of assassins adds a nice touch to the feeling that you are part of something larger and eventually – at its head.			"

												The first two hours are an interactive slideshow, then half of the rest of the game are cinematics and half are easy missions. There are multiple sidequests and missions besides the mainline, but once you finish the main one, you can not go back and finish the others. Overall the experience leaves a bad taste.			"

												Such a good game! Probably the best back when it first came out. It is still good among the new games right now. Highly recommand this game to those who just started to play Assassin's Creed series. P.S. When I bought it, I spent $29.99... now it's only $4.99... wow...			"

												Ok! Assassins Creed Brotherhood review! This game is the second of 3 in following the story of Ezio Auditore. It's a few years after AC2, and so there's a few of the same characters and a bunch of new ones. There's even a few flashback missions that take place in Firenze. I was in it for the story for the most part, so I tried to beat the story missions as in order as possible. The combat is pretty much identical to AC2 but with much cleaner mechanics. I didn't play around with the weapons much and mostly just stuck with the hidden blades. The combos are always satisfying when they connect especially when landing an execution chain on multiple enemies. As usual, the voice acting and dialogue is excellent as AC goes . The cutscenes and scenery in general is awesome, with great attentions to detail in reconstructing the textures and landscapes. It really feels like being in the renaissance! The maps were very detailed and well put together so you rarely take the same paths twice, if ever. The ability to call and ride horses instantly everywhere makes getting around on roads and sidewalks a breeze no matter how many npc's are walking around. There's still a lot of repetition in mission events, go here, go there, stab someone, run away, hide etc. That aside, it's definitely a game series worth playing and I'm gonna get on AC Revelations tonight!

												Brotherhood is perhaps my favorite installment in the AC series. An expansive, open-world enviornment allows the player to prance about and complete various tasks in any order they desire without any linear elements. The default controls are a bit strange, but can be easily binded to a custom configuration.A unique quality of this game is the ability to relieve notoriety when being pursuded by enemies. This mechanic is not common in other third-person open-world games and proves to be quite useful.All in all, I'm not crazy about Brotherhood, but it was definitely worth the buy. I would rate it 8/10.			"

												Coming in off AC:II, which is undeniably one of the high points in the Assassin's Creed  series, the bar is set high for Brotherhood. Set in Rome several years after the events in AC:II, Brotherhood expands on the story surrounding the Borgia and their attempt to take the city (and then the entirety of Italy).Personally, I found the storyline uninteresting and failed to drive me to move forward in the game compared to II where I was riveted the whole way through. I think this is in part marred by the introduction of the extra feats you need to complete to achieve a '100% Sync%' on missions, you find yourself concentrating more on some of the (sometimes ridiculous) extra criteria that have been set for you rather than the mission and it's impact on Ezio, Rome and the larger world.Rome itself is quite possibly one of the dullest settings in an Assassin's Creed game, players were spoilt with the multiple venues of II and if you move onto Revelations, Constantinople has more character and charm about it than Rome does. The Lairs of Romulus add in an extra spark to an otherwise boring landscape, but again the 100% sync challenges may mean you want to speed through these locations instead of taking them in fully.Combat hasn't really evolved from the second game, you'll find a majority of fights easy and with the added bonus of being able to call upon your own team of assassin's, any fight where your seriously outnumbered can be evened out in a matter of moments. The fact that you are recruiting assassin's and sending them out on varying missions really does help you feel that you are being instrumental in helping to establish a proper order in Italy and will leave a legacy in Ezio's name.Brotherhood can be considered a low point in the series, the game feels like they've tried to cram too much into it in a short space of time, not really developing the new features fully, making the experience a somewhat stop/start affair. There is still plenty to keep die hard Assassin's Creed fans occupied and there is enough lore here to warrant playing through the game to keep abreast of the whole arcing storyline that runs through the AC series. Worth picking up when on offer, just don't expect it to light up your life.(Ignore the 230 hrs played, there was a glitch in the matrix that added 180hrs to my play time.)			"

												Atmostpheric and beautiful with a stunning soundtrack, voice acting, and top notch cinematics and direction.The story was immersive, and the historical setting alone makes this game very worthy of playing. This has to be one of the best depictions of ROME 1500ish that I have ever seen. The quality of artwork is fabulous. This is a god installment to the Assassins Creed series, and while I suppose a player could spend hours completing all of the subquests, I stuck to the main storyline to avoid any boredom.Recommended.

												This entry was  vast improvement over Assassin's Creed 2 for me.  I'm not even sure if I can put my finger on why that is either.  Perhaps less flag/feather gathering.  I'm a bit of a completionist so that drove me insane in AC2.  Though admittedly I didn't gather everything in this entry either.  For those without AC experience, there are flags and other items to ""collect"" scattered around the game.  Some are in hard to reach places or locked areas that open up as you progress.  For the most part I enjoyed the ""jumping puzzle"" and added challenge of figuring out how to get to them.  Some may not...for some reason in AC2 I was at my wit's end due to the size of the game and high number/variety of items. The feeling of ""missing something"" was constantly there and it became tedious trying to figure out what I may have overlooked.  One of the bigger changes in Brotherhood in regard to missions, was that every single one had an added challenge in order for you to get 100% synchronization for a memory.  At first, I found this extremely frustrating especially since I hadn't mastered some of the combat mechanics (like kill streaks, though once I figured that out it, my game changed dramatically).  But eventually I ended up finding that the missions were a lot more fun with the added challenge.  Granted, there were times I was cursing how clumsy I was with the controls. This did eliminate some freedom in how you decided to complete a mission.  That was my biggest lament over this feature...but for me, it wasn't a terrible thing.  The acrobatics in this installment are as you'd expect them.  Perhaps it was my imagination, but it felt more responsive than the previous games and  traversing the rooftops felt more fluid than ever.  As much as I'd expect to get tired of it, just jumping from rooftop to rooftop, is a good time. It's no wonder flabby gamers everywhere love the AC series because it lets you become the ultimate acrobatic badass as you hang from a ledge by one hand flashing your 12 pack abs to the ladies below. Those courtesans may sleep with everyone else in the game, but let's face it, they all want you (Ezio). I have to give props to the music in the game.  The perfect track always started when you were jumping through ruins, fighting 20 guards or racing the clock.  It always felt right. I liked the storyline this time around.  I had to recap what happened in AC2 before I played Brotherhood. But I'll be starting Revelations knowing exactly what happened in Brotherhood. No shortage of intrigue and I have to give the writers credit, I love the whole premise of visiting a time period hundreds of years ago while progressing a sci fi story in the present/future. It's brilliant from a sequel standpoint, especially considering the fact that I'm 3 games behind the current release (with a new one on the way).  I hope Revelations is as satisfying as Brotherhood. I know AC2 was a fan favorite, after reading reviews and comments about it.  I can understand why some loved AC2 over AC1 due to AC1's repetitiveness but I didn't get much out of the crazy amount of side quests and collecting in AC2.  I also felt like AC1 was stronger from a storytelling perspective (with the ending being an exception perhaps). Ezio was very difficult to like at first too. Perhaps that's why Brotherhood won me over.  It took all of AC2 and Brotherhood for me to warm up to him.			"

												This game is a direct continuation of AC2 and improves upon the gameplay in many ways. There are new gadgets (crossbow, poison darts, parachute to name a few) that make Ezio's arsenal finally feel complete (I'm not sure why it took so long to get the crossbow though, Altair had one in the intro movie for the first game). The ability to call assassin's is great fun and actually makes you feel like part of the brotherhood instead of just a lone wolf. In many ways Ezio is just completely overpowered (which isn't necessarily a bad thing) so when I see a group of guards it's a question of how do I want to kill them as opposed to what is the most effective way to kill them since all the methods are effective. The Leonardo missions are also fun (Ezio gets to drive a tank in one).That said, this game feels like it really should have been an expansion pack for AC2 instead of a sequel. There isn't much to the story and what is there is drawn out longer than it should have been. Ideally the best placement for this game would have been right before the final act of AC2 so Ezio builds up to finally confronting his arch rival. The bad guy in this game just doesn't seem all that exciting after fist-fighting the pope at the end of AC2.The world is also MUCH smaller. You're stuck in one city the entire game with no countryside either.That said, the game was still a lot of fun and is easily recommended. As with all older games, wait to pick it up on sale.			"

												Assassins Creed Brotherhood is what I would consider a very good expansion to AC2. Ubisoft refined the combat system and the storyline is as enticing as ever. Sure, the Desmond parts are just the usual acrobatic feats but it's great. Ezio, now in his 40's and an experienced Assassin heads to Rome, and Rome is huuuuuge! I won't waste time on the SP experience as I loved it. As for the story? It was good but it doesn't top AC2 in terms of the wow-factor.The Mulitplayer is what shocked me. It's so fun. It's really fun! I thought it would fail but it didn't and I can't get enough of it! Sure you have the nooby roof runners which will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off and the MP will get on your nerves and have you raging, but it's great nevertheless. 8/10 from me overall.			"

The game basically just continued the story and gave Edzio a few new toys.If you want to play the Assassin Creed games for the storyline (and you should), then you should play this game.

												The history may not be that good, still is acceptable, and there are even more new things. I loved the additions to the game (like buying things, making quests for shops and etc.). Even though, again, I got bored sometimes, as there are too much repetition. This time, also, the game has potentialized it's believing that the player is a noob. Many of the challenges of the game have gone, and most of the time it is like running and killing. Sometimes the game gives you so much tips for easy things, and some times (when you may really need it) it doesn't give you any hint.The worst part, I think, it's the camera control. Many times the camera will change and make you miss a jump or something else. Made me rage quit sometimes. Really annoying.In the end, it is a good game. Recommended for those who like the series and want to go to the end, knowing the history. Still, as an isolated game, I think it just has many flaws and inconsistences. For the moment, I think this is the worst game of the series.7/10			"

												Okay, all Assassin's Creeds have the same basic idea, but they are different usually. But, AC: Brotherhood and AC II are VERY similar in many respects, and since I haven't played them for awhile, I am literally copy-pasting the same review to both of them because I can't remember all the little things that are different, because really, they are very similar. So here we go:I love the Assassin's Creed series. I played the first AC about seven years ago, and I played it nonstop. The basic idea of AC is that you are and assassin, and you have a city as your assassination-playground, usually multiple locations. You start the game as Desmond, a guy who uses a machine called the Animus to shoot back in time to his ancestors' history. This is accomplished from the Animus being able to use his mind as a channel for those ancestors' memories. Then, you are his ancestor, an assassin. and you have to kill things. The story is usually deep and intriguing, and it brings you along, and the gameplay of it is awesome too. And then you can just do random things as sidequests, usually pickpocketing, or another assassination target, stuff like that. You have two profiles: Low profile, where you don't draw attention, and just push past people, or walk. Then High profile, by holding right trigger, where then you start running and you can parkour, fight, shove through people, and sprint. The combat is fun, and the sneaky-assassinating is satisfying. There's some flaws, but Brotherhood and AC II are probably the best out of this series. Would recommend anybody to try.			"

												Continuing the saga of roof-running stabby goodness we have AC:Brotherhood. The game continues to grow in interesting ways with much more diversity in how you deal with missions courtesy of your new group of ""mini-me"" assassins able to do your job for you. Got a guy on the rooftops in your path and no time to sneak up on him? Let your peeps handle it. Need a distraction? No problem, they're good. Need every guard in sight to take a ""nap""? They've got you covered.Again Ubisoft manages to expand the mission options and gameplay filling another game chock full of interesting characters and new gameplay. It's not just another expansion, it truly is a continuation and evolution of the series.The now mandatory multiplayer is also quite intriguing but let's face it, that's not what you buy an AC game for, that's just a bonus.

I have a hard time playing a game for more than a few days unless it is really good (Skyrim, Rust, Cod 4 are just a few games I can find enjoyment after playing for so long).

												I love this series. Love it. I like the fact that history coincides with the Assassin v Templar storyline, which is not completely fictitious either. Brotherhood protrays Rome quite well, and has a fantastic storyline. Even with Unity on the horizon, I consider this my favorite game in the series.			"

												I originally skipped this AC game since I felt it didn't wrap the Ezio storyline when it was released, and I only got it since it was on special.Given that I payed little for it, I felt that I got my money's worth. This game doesn't add much to the AC story, but Ezio is one of the coolest assassins in the franchise and it was a blast to play through another adventure as him.The gameplay of AC2 before it were polished to a tee in this game, and the new features allowing you to hire assassins, level them up, and call them in for assists was pretty cool. Taking over the new city 'Rome', purchasing buildings, and restoring it to its former glory was cool as well.Assassin's Creed - Brotherhood is pretty fun if you're a fan of the franchise, you can find it for cheap, and you have some time to burn.

												Brotherhood starts off immediately where the previous game left off. When I say this, I really mean you start in the exact spot, wearing the same gear you were at the end of the previous game. The story picks up right away and continues to entice.This game, while different in various ways, keeps the same essence of the last game. You explore Roma during the Borgia reign of the early 16th century. This allows for, like all the games, some splendid views and the ability to truly appreiciate the thought and effort put into the design of the city and surrounding areas plus the attention to detail that I have come to enjoy and appreiciate. There is a lot to do in this game. The added Economics allows for lots of money to be made and spent in Roma. This just builds on the ability in the previous game to earn and spend money and puts that to work on a grander scale. The added abilities, weapons, and use of the syncing percentage really shine in this game. I found myself using the crossbow alot more than I thought I would and not just out of neccesity but actual enjoyment. Leveling up you own assassins within your guild and using them in various ways allowed for more interesting encounters with enemies and missions. Having missions have an optional objectives/constraints to get a sync percentage made had me retrying missions all the time to achieve that percentage. It made the replay value, for even the first time through, appealing and challenging. Overall, if you like the series and played the games up until this point, continue to do so. You won't be disappointed.			"

												Didn't buy this originally because I thought it would play like a DLC money grab but I couldn't have been any more wrong. Sure it's still the same game I know and love but there's a good 20 hours plus of single player content set in Rome and they've introduced the most original multiplayer mode there has been for decades based around blending in with the AI civilians. They've also added challenges and some hard time trial stages which are very much welcome. Ended up getting 100% as usual too because I'm so fond of the free running and climbing.			"

												A refinement of part 2, which I liked more but which I also did not play on Steam, so you're getting a recommendation of this and not that. The gameplay is standard Assassin's Creed stuff with a few additions that make it much easier, it's up to you whether that's a good or bad thing. I found a lot of the upgrade systems to be largely unecessary and mostly just busywork. If you play it stealthy like you're supposed to you won't need more powerful weapons and armor. And as long as you learn the combat you can get by with anything. The dialogue is not always great but at least the overall story is not insufferably bad. Requiescat in pace, videogioch.			"

												A sequel to AC2, you could easily say that this is AC2 again but extending the storyline further with some better closure than the previous game delivered (It's basically AC2's second half). It picks up right where AC2 ends and continues on with more funtimes and stuff to do. There are new improvements here to the gameplay, graphics, and the gigantic city of Rome is much larger and unique than any other location in the previous games. It's slightly bigger than its predecessor, and it adds multiplayer (which probably nobody plays anymore) as well. If you want innovation, there isn't much here. But if you enjoyed AC2 and want to keep running with that, this is the game for you.			"

												Despite Revelations being the newer title, Brotherhood is what I consider to be the pinnacle of the Assassin's Creed game concept. If you like the pairing of third-person action with RPG elements and free roam, you can easily sink 50 hours into it if you seek out the side quests! Multiplayer is also quite serviceable, though it's probably hard to find a community playing it now - better spent playing with friends.			"

												Fun but not renewing.And therein lies the problem of all♥♥♥♥♥Creed games; they're good games (with the exception of AC1) but they do the same thing over and over. AC2 was good, so in this game they copy AC2 and just add more distractions. And the game after this one does it again, but with even MORE distractions!I'll expect you know at least a little about AC's gameplay from one of the five games. And that's all there is, in this game. It's just... More Assassin's Creed. It's never boring though.The story revolves around Ezio's fight with the Borgia. The underlying, hugely boring and complicated story about Desmond as well, but to be honest, no-one pays any attention to that. No-one has more than a vague understanding of it anyway. And considering it'll take 5+ games to reach the end of that boring and vague connecting story, why bother?So is this game fun? Yes. If you've played AC2, and you're looking for more, this'll give you just that. If you're completely new to the AC franchise, get AC2 instead.The free Da Vinci DLC is fun but not worth interrupting the main story for. My advice is: pick a few side quest storylines to follow, then do the main story. If you still want more by the time you've finished it, do the other stuff too.The Good: Still fun, Assassin buddies are very useful, does what AC does well.The Bad: More of the same, freerunning can occasionally feel really slow and clumsy, far too much♥♥♥♥♥♥to do, Subject 16 puzzles get mathy and really hard with little to no payoff in the end, UPLAY. 6,5/10			"

You can hide behind corners, on top of buildings, and assassinate targets without even alerting a bug. After completing the game, I was left with many things to do, but instead I decided to move on to Revelations. I hope it offers as much excitement as this game has!			"

Plenty of stuff to do after you've done the main quest, including assassinations, training your own apprentices, rebuilding parts of Rome, investing in small businesses and just soaking up the amazing atmosphere of Renaissance Italy!  It will take you well over 100 hours of gameplay to 100% complete (I have only about half of this because my game client used to glitch out and not count hours).  Anyway I would 100% recommend this game if you have previously played AC2, otherwise you will have no clue about what is going on when you come to start.

												Absolutely excellent game, a clear improvement over AC2, and that's before you even get into the multiplayer. Combat has been improved upon, making it more fluid and exciting, and missions have been expanded to provide opportunities to increase syncronisation. Completely new features were introduced as well, such as the Assassin Apprentice system.Depending on how much you like Desmond Miles, this could be either good or bad, but there is more opportunity to play and explore as him, developing the story further.Multiplayer is great as well. While I found the interface a bit awkward, gameplay was quite smooth (aside from lag) and entertaining.Only real downside to the game is that it took Ubisoft so bloody long to release it on PC. Thankfully they did it without too much DRM garbage - you can barely notice it here, so you don't have the same problems that existed in AC2.			"

												AC: B...What can I say?It's the second chapter in the Ezio-trilogy. Moving around the Rome is actually pretty fun, and if you feel like learning something, the Animus Database has some interesting facts and knowledge of history.The new Assassin Recruiting -mechanic was really fun, and it helps in some situations a lot.The game itself plays just like AC2, but the plot isn't actually as compelling, although still pretty good.The end of the game was hectic as ♥♥♥♥ and I loved it the most in the game.There's not enough Da Vinci, though. That's a minus, but otherwise the game was very fun!			"

												Truly one of my favourite Assassins Creed Games, continueing the story of Ezio Auditore. Many new features and weapons have been added so that you do not feel the game getting repetitive in any way. Its truely a in depth and wonderufl experience growing with Ezio as he gets older and ventures forward to beat the Templars and continue his quest to find more information of the pieces of eden and those who came before. I highly recomened to those who already played Assassins Creed 2 and to anyone esle who wants to enjoy a game with great graphics and an in depth adventure!			"

												In my opinion this is one of the best Assassins Creed games out of the thousands that are now available.Ezio is in his prime and on the prowl for the ladies and revenge.Great brotherhood mechanics involve recruiting people to join your creed which add depth and a sense of impact on the world as you call in you brothers and sister to help you if things go wrong.This is one of the last Assassins Creeds to have a have decent story that I really enjoyed progressing through the game.

												This was my introduction to the Assassin's Creed franchise.  I chose to try this one first because it seemed to be the best reviewed entry.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  You have so much freedom to do missions as you like, and the parkour and platforming is very well done.  It deserves all the praise it has received.  It's not without its flaws, but it's such a fun game. I regret not purchasing the whole series while they were on sale during Christmas.  I hope there's another Steam sale for this franchise soon.

												For only one area you deal in (Rome) it's so in detail it's almost amazing. The characters look wonderful and I have to say, Ezio, Desmon and even the Altair outfit for Ezio looks great. They really should have used the models for Revelations. At times it does almost feel like a DLC for AC2, but I feel that it holds up on its own as a separate game. I only wished I had known my username for UBIsoft UPlay would be the username I used to sign up, meaning I'm stuck with a name I would rather not have causing me to really be unable to enjoy the Multiplayer aspect. All in all, definitely a game I would reccomend along with all the others in the series.			"

												Brotherhood picks up the story exactly (literally!) when AC2 left it. And I must say, I'm pretty amazed by what the producers did with this game. The combat system is much better now, with introduction of killing streaks, but also with stronger and more difficult enemies. To get 100% in the mission, you have to also do some additional objectives (which sometimes are quite troublesome!). The city of Rome is an amazingly big area, unlike anything you have seen in the previous games. Characters are very interesting and the whole storyline is quite good (though, not as good as in AC2 in my opinion). Also, there are multitudes of additional missions and content, so finishing the entire game takes tremendeous amount of time. All in all, this game will definitely not dissapoint you so I can recommend it to anyone that loves AC.Actually, after playing AC:R, AC3 and AC4, I must say that if you love AC franchise, that would be the last game I would recommend to play, if you don't want a huge letdown.

												The first Assassin's Creed was clearly a game with great potential and cool ideas, a new approach to the ""sneak and stealh""-genre. But alas, it turned out weak due mostly to it's highly repetitive missions and completion structure, unintresting plotline and world and it's generally unpolished finish. Cue Brotherhood, the third installment in the franchise. This is Assassin's Creed in it's top form. A beautifully rendered Rome in the Reneissance Era with characters, buildings and events from real-life combined with the fictionous Ezio and his quest, vastly imporved controls that add to the fluidity of the parkour movements and the general feeling that now I, the player, am in control of not only Ezio but also Rome. This is how it should have been from the beginning!			"

												The Creed evolves in the third installment to the Assassin's Creed Universe. Ezio, once again reprises his role as an experienced assassin, with a bag of new tricks. Summoning companions to decimate your enemies, mysteries waiting to be solved, more questions and more answers await your initition. Further your knowledge with new history filled with new characters new and old. ACR:B contains even more content than that of assassin's creed 2, you will be bewildered, stressed, out-of-control-rage, sad, pity, hot, cold, unforgiving, forgiving, bulging eyes, and constant bathroom breaks(sarcasm intended).If you're a fan, i'd suggest immediatly picking this up before I reprise my role as an assassin and kidnap all Abstergo operatives and force them into the sewers, never seeing the light again (I'm serious). However if you're not a fan, but some new guy, i'd suggest sucking up you're pride, and guts, and go back to assassin's creed 1, finishing that, and also two before you head on over to AC:B. Let it be known you will be far from dissapointed. At least you will be surpised, agitated, excited, and perhaps a badass ( if you think like one). But, of course it's up to you, whether you have the courage to take a blade and fight against the approaching Templar menace. Our Creed lies with you,9.51/10			"

												Many of my friends believe that Brotherhood is the best AC title out there. While I agree that many of AC II's qualities and faults were improved and corrected, respectively, the game's limitation to one world-map (Rome is amazing, but still) and almost insultingly easy combat makes it get old VERY fast, especially when you're going for the 100%. If you want to kill mountains of people without any trouble at all, this is really the game for you.  One of the game's saving graces is the Assassin Brotherhood mechanic... rounding up and training your own assassin's is pretty awesome.			"

												This game is a direct continuation of AC2 and improves upon the gameplay in many ways. There are new gadgets (crossbow, poison darts, parachute to name a few) that make Ezio's arsenal finally feel complete (I'm not sure why it took so long to get the crossbow though, Altair had one in the intro movie for the first game). The ability to call assassin's is great fun and actually makes you feel like part of the brotherhood instead of just a lone wolf. In many ways Ezio is just completely overpowered (which isn't necessarily a bad thing) so when I see a group of guards it's a question of how do I want to kill them as opposed to what is the most effective way to kill them since all the methods are effective. The Leonardo missions are also fun (Ezio gets to drive a tank in one).That said, this game feels like it really should have been an expansion pack for AC2 instead of a sequel. There isn't much to the story and what is there is drawn out longer than it should have been. Ideally the best placement for this game would have been right before the final act of AC2 so Ezio builds up to finally confronting his arch rival. The bad guy in this game just doesn't seem all that exciting after fist-fighting the pope at the end of AC2.The world is also MUCH smaller. You're stuck in one city the entire game with no countryside either.That said, the game was still a lot of fun and is easily recommended. As with all older games, wait to pick it up on sale.			"

												If you liked Assassin's Creed II you will probably like Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. Just like the previous game, it's really easy, now easier with Assassin recruits that do your job and a Crossbow, also with Posion Dart (but who uses that). The entire repairing Rome is useless since the game is easy, so you don't need better weapons, just keep the one you get for FREE, and the best armor is obtained for free. Only thing you're going to buy is pouches. Taking down Borgia Towers is fun. The AI is still dumb as ♥♥♥♥. The side quests are more fun, adding a different kind of Assassination Mission: Templar Agents. Multiplayer is great. You can do missions at 100%, which adds a little replayability. This feels like an expansion to Assassin's Creed II, but slightly feels and plays better. Did I say themultiplayer is great? Infact on Xbox, I spent over 600 hours playing it competitively. In a nutshell, if you like Assassin's Creed II, you will like this, but it's way easier... Multiplayer is fun. 8/10			"

												The history may not be that good, still is acceptable, and there are even more new things. I loved the additions to the game (like buying things, making quests for shops and etc.). Even though, again, I got bored sometimes, as there are too much repetition. This time, also, the game has potentialized it's believing that the player is a noob. Many of the challenges of the game have gone, and most of the time it is like running and killing. Sometimes the game gives you so much tips for easy things, and some times (when you may really need it) it doesn't give you any hint.The worst part, I think, it's the camera control. Many times the camera will change and make you miss a jump or something else. Made me rage quit sometimes. Really annoying.In the end, it is a good game. Recommended for those who like the series and want to go to the end, knowing the history. Still, as an isolated game, I think it just has many flaws and inconsistences. For the moment, I think this is the worst game of the series.7/10			"

												The game has become so wide since the first installation. I don't know whether to call it a rpg or a puzzle game. This variety of content contributed much to the game? This is a debateble concern. Some might find it pleasent whereas some don't. I feel that the rich content may  feel like overwhelming sometimes. If you are looking for a simple game like in the first installation this is not your game. On the other hand, if you are okay with widening your perspective, i would definetely recommend it. Only thing i found lacking in this one was the inability to alter some of the keyboard shortcuts.There was this sense of uncomfortable feeling while you are navigating through the menus. (W A S D doesnt work with menus and former ""TAB=quit"" changed into ""ESC"" button which i found disturbing.)I believe only the PC version has theswe flaws since right now companies mainly focus on console version games. I found the ingame climbing easier in AC2 but like i said above, the game is lacking in PC version since sometimes while climbing you encounter weird camera angle which makes it nearly impossible to make the appropriate jumps while using a keyboard (You definetely need a console controller for this otwerwise you are bound to suffer a lot). Puzzles are definetely more challenging from the previous games and as always the story was mindblowing. Overall, very good game but sometimes can make you rage bc of some awkward control issues in PC version if you are using a keyboard.			"

												This is a really cool open world game. It's so much fun running around Rome randomly stabbing guards from rooftops. The story is meh but that's not the main draw of the game. Like any Assassin's Creed game it involves a lot of parkour and stabbing, which it nails down well. The one draw back for me is the lack of any sort of cover mechanic. Sometimes you're supposed to assasinate a target, yet all you have to hide behind is a pillar slightly wider then yourself. A cover system like Batman: Arkham City would have been nice. Overall though the game is a lot of fun and you can spend hours just free-running around Rome. I give it an 8.7/10			"

												Assassin's Creed had the potential, but it was a matter of whether you liked what it had to offer or not; you got to experience everything it had to offer from the get go and if you didn't like it, tough!Assassin's Creed II was more like a game, where the gameplay expands as you progress in the story, and Brotherhood was the perfect tuning to that great formula. So, great gameplay mechanics that keep evolving, charismatic hero and story that hasn't become too convoluted yet; Brotherhood is the entry in the Assassin's Creed series that most stands the test of time.

												My favorite Assassin's Creed game, until 4 came out. While Brotherhood does feel like a well polished game at most points, there are times when Ezio will do something I swear I didn't mean him to. It can be very frustrating when he jumps out at 90 degree angles and whatnot. Overall, there aren't too many collectables to where it feels like a hunt and find like later Assassin's Creed games, but there are enough to keep you entertained. The brotherhood aspect feels amazing, and the ability to recruit and train assassins makes this rate above 1,2,revelations, and 3. The sailing aspesct of 4 really captured me, but this game is amazing otherwise. Some of the missions will challenge you, and make you swear like a sailor, but oh well. One of my favorite games in a nostalgic sense, and one of my favorite assassisn's creed games.			"

												Excellent game, combat is fluid and enjoyable, think batman arkham asylum, yet not overly simple. I love the parkour gameplay and they do an excellent job of making it fluid and easy to master. AC 2's story was more engrossing, but AC:B has more overall, and has more of a sandbox feel to it. I recommend doing the virtual training early on in the game to understand the gameplay mechanics, and I recommend using the dual hidden blades for most combat as it is not only the most effecient at killing but also the most enjoyable to watch.  However it seems that multiplayer is dead for this game now, so that sucks.			"

												Absolutely excellent game, a clear improvement over AC2, and that's before you even get into the multiplayer. Combat has been improved upon, making it more fluid and exciting, and missions have been expanded to provide opportunities to increase syncronisation. Completely new features were introduced as well, such as the Assassin Apprentice system.Depending on how much you like Desmond Miles, this could be either good or bad, but there is more opportunity to play and explore as him, developing the story further.Multiplayer is great as well. While I found the interface a bit awkward, gameplay was quite smooth (aside from lag) and entertaining.Only real downside to the game is that it took Ubisoft so bloody long to release it on PC. Thankfully they did it without too much DRM garbage - you can barely notice it here, so you don't have the same problems that existed in AC2.			"

The plethora of new features can be overwhelming at first, but once you get the hang of it you won't want to put it down. The storyline in the Assassin's Creed games gets better and better as a new game is added to the series. Brotherhood is no exception. WIth the added multiplayer feature of Brotherhood, you won't be leaving your room for a while. The multiplayer adds a lot more to the game with a system that rewards you with items and perks as you level up. Buy it.			"

												It is a very good game. The addition of assassin followers is the newest and most exciting feature which sets AC: Brotherhood apart from the earlier AC games (and makes it a definite improvement). The only real problem I had with the game was the very ending. It offers no sense of closure and instead of doing something good, you kill a close friend and ally with no explanation. Even aside from the ending, the game still isn't quite perfect, but it is easily worth its current $40.00 price tag. I'd give it a reluctant 9 out of 10.			"

One of the best storylines in a game series to date. The downsides are that the Assassin's Brotherhood gameplay addition is more of a gimmick than anything else which is a damn shame as it could have been awesome to train up your fellow assassins by being able to engage with them more directly instead of just sending them on pre-scripted text based missions. Also, being able to call them to help you in a fight is cool and all but can be used to easily cheese your way through the tougher encounters in the game.8.5-9/10			"

A continuation from ACII.Elements from ACII are carried to this game and the story continues with a little more of everything. This time around, the player feels more included in the Assassin band because you could send in a team at your command. The story is as interesting as ACII if not a little less, because the game tries to answer everyone's questions, both the audience and Ezio's. There are a few more gadgets and a brotherhood, otherwise that is it. The gameplay is basically the same as in ACII. By the end of ACII, Ezio got a bit comfortable, but right from the beginning of this game, it is clear that there are other powers out there that are constantly uprising. As usual, the game design is beautiful. The city of Italy has a lot to take in with many areas to explore. The missions are roughly the same as in ACII, but there are a few new ones that were refreshing. This iteration of the series was not as amazing as ACII, but was still a fun game to experience.The StrengthsThe developers played it a bit safe by just using the same formula from the previous game. I enjoyed the sense of 'Brotherhood' when interaction with the assassin family in the game. I thought that the addition of the crossbow was awesome, and on top of that the arrow storm proved to be very useful in many situations that I encountered.The LimitationsAlthough there was a good amount of features added to the game, I did not get the same sense of awe throughout the game.

												Ok! Assassins Creed Brotherhood review! This game is the second of 3 in following the story of Ezio Auditore. It's a few years after AC2, and so there's a few of the same characters and a bunch of new ones. There's even a few flashback missions that take place in Firenze. I was in it for the story for the most part, so I tried to beat the story missions as in order as possible. The combat is pretty much identical to AC2 but with much cleaner mechanics. I didn't play around with the weapons much and mostly just stuck with the hidden blades. The combos are always satisfying when they connect especially when landing an execution chain on multiple enemies. As usual, the voice acting and dialogue is excellent as AC goes . The cutscenes and scenery in general is awesome, with great attentions to detail in reconstructing the textures and landscapes. It really feels like being in the renaissance! The maps were very detailed and well put together so you rarely take the same paths twice, if ever. The ability to call and ride horses instantly everywhere makes getting around on roads and sidewalks a breeze no matter how many npc's are walking around. There's still a lot of repetition in mission events, go here, go there, stab someone, run away, hide etc. That aside, it's definitely a game series worth playing and I'm gonna get on AC Revelations tonight!

												Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a fun game, just as good as its prequels. It is filled with many Assassin's Creed II functionalities, but maintains a fresh new take on the franchise.Continuing the open world aspect (thank goodness), you play as Ezio once again, this time exploring Rome, of which was a brief setting in II that you could not roam. Now all the city is yours to do whatever you wish. The adventure never fails, letting you climb on vertially anything, until you get to the top and see Rome in all its glory. The setting is amazingly beautiful.The voice acting is terrific, and it's awesome seeing Ezio age from the beginning of II to the events of Brotherhood. The combat is the same as well, allowing you to stealthily hide in crowds or hack and slash through guards as you please. Because pleasure is guaranteed in this game.A fun new feature in brotherhood sticks with the title: you can now recruit other assassins to help you in the game. You can have them eliminate foes for you, or send them on missions to make money for you and strengthen the asssassin's abilities. The story is magnificent as well, keeping you on your toes the whole time.For any action-adventure lover or fellow Brotherhood members, this is the perfect game for you. But, keep in mind, this is not the first game. I advise you to play Assassin's Creed I and II first. Assassin's Creed I CAN be skipped, but I do not recommend it. Play them all.

												A healthy sequel to Assassin's Creed 2, this game took what was in AC2 and added to it. Complete with new gadgets, a brand new, large city to explore and your own guild of assassins, Ezio is well equipped to confront Borgia tyranny.That is not to say that everything that this game adds is good though. In particular are the new challenges, the 100% sync missions. These are optional, additional challenges on top of the normal missions in order to appeal to completionists. And while most are reasonably possible to do, some are outright annoying, for if you fail the 100% sync, you cannot get 100% sync without restarting the entire mission.Luckily, the game retains the same fun, do what you want sandboxy feel that AC2 had, and my gripes are really only optional content. If you enjoyed Assassin's Creed 2, definitely pick up this title too.			"

												I've only just been introduced to the AC series by some friends at school, and ALL of them said that Brotherhood was their favourite AC game. I agree 100%. It's not only one of the best AC games, it's also my FAVOURITE single player story game EVER. The graphics quality is great, the storyline is amazing, the combat is unreal, and all the Training Missions and Multiplayer modes are AWESOME!!! Definitely Recommended.			"

												game is quite short. its like gta but in the olden days  (instead of cars you have horses, instead of guns you have swords etc.) having said that, the game is short and sweet. and when i say short i mean the main story,  you can always kill a few hours fooling around the city. just look at my hours on record. LOLin conclusion, i recommend the game but be prepared to buy the rest of the assasins creed game cause the story does not end in brotherhood.			"

												Well, actually my favourite Assassin creed game is the second title but i have it in another website. Brotherhood tries to follow the same way of the second, with secondary missions less tedious (as tedious as the first title). I think the goal is having the player in game the more possible hours. The story is nice like the others and you can do a lot of things, fight, jump, climb, etc.I saw in this game missions like Tomb Rider saga. To me its impossible not to recomend at least 1 game of Assassin's creed series.			"

Many cool additions since AC2 such as having assassin's do your bidding, new weapons like a crossbow, better ways of getting around Rome via fast travel, etc. improves upon every aspect of AC2. Now I can't wait to get AC:R then AC3 but when they are on sale like this one was. :)			"

												Not much has actually changed in this version of Assassin’s Creed. Ezio has most of his weapons from the beginning with a few slight tweaks including stronger poison, parachute, poison darts (which are a lot of fun to shoot at the enemies by the way), a crossbow and a heavy sheath that allows you to carry larger weapons instead of having to pick them up and drop them. The game is still a free running action adventure sandbox game, but there is no more emphasis on the guilds and a new mechanic in which allows Ezio to train new assassins that he can call and use whenever, with a limit of course.  When you destroy the Borgia towers, I will explain the Borgia later, you can train one assassin per tower for a total of 13 assassins. The player can then send these assassins on missions in order to level them up to what this game calls master assassins. A nice aspect of this is that when there are a lot of enemies you can call in some assassin’s and they easily can take care of the them, take note, it was a whole lot of fun calling in all 7 that I could at a time.One more change between these two iterations is the combo and fighting system. In Brotherhood you can now dual wield allowing a lot more options during a fight. They have added a whole bunch of new finishing moves and combos to your combat repertoire. There is a lot less bugs in this game as well though I was playing it long after the release so they could have easily patched it by now. The story continues where AC2 left off. Ezio returns home and decides that his days as an assassin are done and wonders if he should have killed  Pope Rodrigo Borgia. Shortly after, Monteriggioni is attacked by Cesare(pronounced Ches – er – á) Borgia (Son of the Pope) and Mario Auditore is killed in the process. Ezio decides to return to Rome and rebuild the Assassin’s Guild/Brotherhood (hey look the name of the game) and take down the Borgia threat. Eventually after about 4 years of destroying Borgia strongholds, resources, and the like, he takes them out of power and discovers the location of the Apple of Eden that was taken from Leonardo da Vinci. The whole reason for Desmund to follow this time period of Ezio’s life is in order to find the location of the Apple of Eden themselves and the Grand Temple. The characters in this game are a lot stronger than in the AC2; in fact the Pope’s kids even have an incestuous relationship that drives Cesare in trying to conquer all of Italy. These characters were all based on actual historic people which makes the story even more compelling.  	I didn’t talk much about controls in the last review so I figured I should make a mention of how this game is played on PC. A lot of the controls rely on a mix of  4 or 5 different keys. While in combat and locked onto an enemy, if you hold the right mouse button down you will parry an attack. However right after you parry, if you click the left mouse button you proceed to do a counter attack which (unless the enemy is especially good at defending against) will do a finishing move that will kill that enemy. If immediately after your finishing move you click the left mouse button again and a direction, you can do another finishing move that will continue until you either miss or run out of enemies you can perform the move on, this is called a chain attack.  Also, using ‘Q’  allows you to change your weapons and pressing spacebar while holding the right mouse button will kick your enemies. When you are in free run mode, right mouse does a sort of fast run and holding space allows you to scale walls and move faster up said walls. The shift key allows you to drop while climbing and if you are falling, it also allows you to catch a ledge and stop. These are most of the standard controls apart from ‘wasd’ to move around and mouse to look around. 	As for the graphics they are still very nice, even for a 2-3 year old game and are a slight improvement over the second game. On top of that, the architecture of the buildings and the design of Rome was very well done and close to that of what Rome might have been like in the early 16th century. The sound and voice acting is still top notch and is over looked in a game like this where the voice actors have to try and use strong accents and mix the languages between English, Old Italian and French.	Overall this is a much improved game, however it felt to me like the story just didn’t stick with me as well as AC2 or Revelations (which was my favorite out of the trilogy).•	Story  - 4 out of 5•	Gameplay – 4 out of 5•	Graphics – 5 out of 5•	Sound  - 5 out of 5•	Fun – 5 out of 5Overall a total score of 4.6 out of 5 "

												Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is a good game, no arguments, you can't debate it, AC:B is a good game. It would be a great game, if you didn't feel like you were being milked while playing it.Good gameplay, good story, good pacing, that is hooked onto the AC formula seen in the first and second games. And that's it. You know that Ubisoft is going to milk you for every penny, making you pay full price for the work that is essentially DLC extra's and fancy modding padding extra layers onto bloated thing they have already. This is more blatant with the new ""innovative"" feature of Assassin's Recruits that really is a tack-on, and the game would survive fine without it. But if you've already played the first two Assassin's Creed games, you'll definitely play AC:B, so go ahead buy it, it's still a good game.Just dont' think about how badly your being played. 8/10			"

												a surprisingly great game, it takes insipration from older games (eg: the ship) for a unique muliplayer experience where you are the hunter AND the hunted. it ticks alot of the boxes, great animation, art style, sound, and great gameplay. only a few issues remain, such as lag. this wouldnt be a problem, but it becomes such because of the lobby system. they did not put a server browser, and instead put an automatic lobby system that will sometimes pair you with people with SUCH bad internet connections that they may be residing in the bahamas. On the camaign side, i cannot really judge, as i have only started. But it does seem to follow to ""press X to win"" theme of previous games, and the story wont make much sense to those unfamiliar with the assassins creed universe.Performance is also a big issue, and you need to be careful of your computers spec's before you consider this game, otherwise the framerate is just PAINFUL.A great experience, with a fair bit of replayability. :)			"

												Assassins Creed Brotherhood expands once again in every aspect of the game. Combat is even more fluid, story is even more engaging, and adds many new features to the Assassins Creed Genre. Oh and there is multiplayer as well. So it adds endless replay ability to the game. If you loved the previous games, you will love this one. They have done away with exploring countless viewpoints to view your map and have minimized the amount of points to explore the map. Though you are on one map of Rome rather than multiple environments, you are still thrown to various areas to spice up the scenery from time to time. Haven’t had any problems other than the rare ninja spot where the AI just immediately spot you, even though you are not notorious but it isn’t game breaking. Definitely a must buy, if you loved the previous games.  "

												Personally, I enjoyed AC2 way more than Brotherhood. I think that Brotherhood was good, but some of the missions felt tacted on to remind you of the new features added on to the series. I think the story progressed nicely, but I felt some of the side missions were too much. Capturing the towers and paying to open up the stores had me hesitant to stay away from those areas until I needed them. Overall the game was good, but not great like AC2 for me.			"

As an example, I present that I have purchased this game twice: once for console (and then the disc disappeared, fortunately after I'd already beaten it), and once now on Steam.In some ways the game feels more like an expansion to AC2 than a full game in it's own right, but you get enough done over the course of the game that it stands on it's own fairly well.My only real complaint is that this is really where Ubisoft started to listen to the fans complaints about the Meta-Plot. Yeah,  you get to explore Ezio's home, but it really feels like there was going to be more to it and they just never got around to doing it.Is this canonically part of the 40K universe? Well, it takes place on Terra, so in the broad since it certainly could be. Minerva, Jupiter and crew could easily be Eldar screwing around with early man, and the Apple and other artifacts would be Eldar tech.			"

												Considerig how this game just came out for mac, I figured I'd inform my fellow mac users on how it performs. Short answer: great.Long answer:I am playing this game with my 2015 macbook pro 15"". This game has been incredibly optimised for this system, for I can run the game at 60 fps and maximum settings. However, since the game is so well ported, it works much better than most other ports. I'm sure it can be run on any mac at various settings. As someone frequently concerned with port quality, I can confirm that this one is beautiful. One more thing: There is a new problem where on some systems where the game crashes on launch. http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2183652 . There you go :).			"

												If you want to play this game, don't do it for PC. You have to download Uplay and I wasn't able to play with a gamepad which is dreadful (keyboard controls are dang unfair).No saying it’s a bad game, just saying that it shouldn't be played here (unless you can get the gamepad thing to work with Uplay...).[Long playtime is from sibling] "

												Let me start off by saying that I love the Assassin's Creed game franchise, but this game is literally unplayable on windows 10. First, you have to download the crappy Uplay DRM launcher. It barely works and I had to reinstall it several times. Once opening the game, it lags and stutters at horrible speeds. I can barely get through th game menu at 5 fps. I am running dual GTX 970's.... my hardware is not the problem, the software is. Do not get this game if you have windows 10, I recommend reading the online forums about this game.			"

												Having previously played AC 1, 2 and this game on console, I wasn't really sure what to expect when I bought this during the Steam Summer Sale 2014..... but it delivered and rekindled my gamer crush on Ezio. Gameplay is immersive. There's your main quest line, side quests, Cluster puzzles, plus a bunch of other tasks you can do within the single player game. There's also multiplayer, which if I can remember my console days clearly, isn't too bad either. Controls take a little while to get used to, especially with the move from console to PC for me, but they are displayed on screen and once you get the hang of what all the buttons to do, the combat is so much more enjoyable. I find this game quite challenging. While completing the quests aren't too difficult, the extra requirements needed for 100% sync makes it a little harder for those who are into full completion. I think this game is so much fun to play and I have yet to tire of the whole franchise. I highly reccommend this game and give it an 8 out of 10..... points lost because..... well running away and hiding can get a little annoying when sometimes I just want to kill em all.			"

												Good game, too short.So ACII was pretty good, it was a true upgrade from the AC experience and yet I guess Ubisoft decided to make money and ruin a great franchise going the CoD way, the only thing wrong is that they don't have 3 teams to build a game in a 3 year cycle. Anyway I really thought it would be better since people recommended me the game so much but it just feels like an episode from ACII.I was hoping the game to contribute more to the main story and not just give you the intro, play 10 in game hours and then give you another clue about the ""actual story"" of the franchise. If you like these games, then I'm sure you'll like to do the same stuff that ACII brought to us. If you're not that into AC then I'd probably pass Brotherhood and Revelations to play ACIII. I hope Revelations isn't that bad since most people say it is.PROS-Assasins are a really a great feature of the game, but I would've like to use them earlier on the game.CONS-Game is too short compared to ACII, it's actually half the story in game time.-Story doesn't tells you much about what the heck is going on with Desmond.-Rebuilding things is cool, but feels empty anyway it doesnt help much in the game to do everysingle shop.-Gather all the *insert anything that comes to your mind here*.The game is good, but nothing great which I was expecting after playing ACII. I guess this is where money and Ubisoft face the downfall of AC franchise? Well I hope not because I will play Revelations for Reviewer's sake and hope it has more to offer...			"

												Continues straight from where AC II left off, Brotherhood has even more varied missions mainly in Rome. Even though there are a lot of simultaneous missions and lots of areas open at the same time, which might cause a headache to some, it also gives the opportunity to choose what you want to do instead of following the plot all the time. Also features tradable items and maps that help you find feathers and flags.			"

												Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ I never really believed it was possible to out-do Assassin's Creed II, but they did it. And they did it in style.Assassin's Creed Brotherhood takes place almost entirely in Roma. The plot of the game is intriguing, and, unlike Assassin's Creed II, most of the side-missions are short but just as sweet. There is some DLC one could purchase and, honestly, I recommend it highly.They improved everything that has to do with combat without sacrificing the difficulty all-together. Wall climbing is also substantially faster without being too much easier. The graphics are breathtaking, a whole step up from ACII. Horses make a comeback, and it is now much easier to move about a large portion of a city (besides quick travels through the sewers) and, more importantly, horses are now another variable in combat.I can't really think of anything that his game got wrong! Even the multiplayer is fantastic! Albeit, somewhat dead nowadays.YOU SHOULD PLAY AC & ACII BEFORE PLAYING THIS GAME9 OF 10Silence Dogood			"

												Plays a lot like Assassin's Creed 2, but with some cool extra features. Most notably is  the Brotherhood system where you recruit civilians to the Brotherhood to work as assassins. They can either pounce from the shadows to take out tough targets or send them out on missions to earn more money for your cause.The story picks up immediatly after AC2. For this reason, it's hard to recommend ACB over AC2. ACB is pretty much AC2+, so if you can only buy one: buy this one and read up on AC2's story on wikipedia.			"

												Good way to continue from where AC2 has ended. If you want to play a good Assassin's Creed game, here's more of it where AC2 left off. Combat is still lawful, and I was in no hurry trying to get the best armour of the game. I finished the story mode without it.I haven't really played the multiplayer. I'm not the one to judge it. I tried the tutorial & it required a re-bind to the controller, but I haven't really done much in that.I recomend it for the story mode.Update after 102 hours of playing: If you're a fan of the series & you have a SSD, go on and have a go, but if you don't you can't 100% the singleplayer. Ubisoft back in 2010 decided to make galloping a SSD only feature in freeroam mode. My second playthrough was not as enjoyable as the first. Also to note some the Da-Vinci machines are awkward to control and completing the no hit requirement in the memory just makes it infuriating.			"

												Overall still recommendable though the game is not without its minor and major flaws.The PC controls are inexplicably worse from part 2. A real mystery because they improved mucho between AC1 and AC2 and then in Brotherhood it's worse again (like the req to hit 'enter' instead of 'space' on many confirmation dialogues or how 'TAB' opens the map but does not close it again... WTF). The story did not grab me as much as part 2. Leo Da Vinci added a nice touch in AC2 that was sorely missing in Brotherhood. Many story and optional missions were quite grindy and drawn out. I'm not a fan of the lengthy escorts or tailing missions of which there seemed to be too many. There was also too much trial & error, in part due to the absence of mission critical info,  which led to IMHO unnecessary repetition due to the console checkpoint save system.I liked the 15th/16th century depiction of Rome though. The atmosphere and ambience was great. The story, while not stellar, was still motivating enough to make me keep playing and finishing the game. So overall it gets a thumbs up but I'd warn anyone to be prepared to lose some hair over the game's annoyances that are mostly owed to the game's console heritage.			"

Being able to recruit your own assassins and train them up is a great feature they added to the assasssins creed games.  As well as Etzio remembering where you have seen things like flags and feathers by adding them onto the map once you have seen them in eagle vision, this way you can come back for them later and not have to remember where they are.  Such a simple improvement and useful feature.  Love this game so much !!			"

Dont bother with ubisoft / uplay games.----------------------------------------------------------The review is base on story mode.-There are improvements in graphics, but the mod does not suit well causing some disappearances of structures, while switching the camera view.-The menu takes too long to load, which is frustrating.It is only play-able to reveal the destiny of Ezio. Recomended for those who are willing to find out the journey of Ezio, otherwise, wait until the next sale.I have bought the Assassins Creed franchise 1~4 during the summer sale.so far, my rating goesAC 2 > AC 1 > AC 2 Brotherhood			"
