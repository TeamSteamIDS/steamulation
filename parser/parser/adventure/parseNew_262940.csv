												If you like adventure games you owe it to yourself to play .... THIS! Broken Sword 5! You do not -have- to have played the first 4 games, but you still should at least play the first 2 or 3. I know, after this 5th one - if you play it, you'll WANT to play the earlier ones, too.Such amazing, lovingly crafted adventures! :]			"

												Immediately grabbed me. The quality of the voice acting is thankfully superb, but it is the animation that has blown me away. There are lots of little details with characters body language that are truly impressive. Based on my short time with the game so far, anyone who has played Broken Sword 1 or 2, or any other classic point and click adventure game, will feel right at home. Hearing the Revolution fanfare at the beginning was like sinking into a warm comfy bath :)			"

""But the Serpent was wiser than all the animals that were in Paradise...""""And God cursed the Serpent and called him 'Devil'...""""And He said, 'Behold, Adam has become like one of us, knowing evil from good.'"" - The Testimony of Truth (Gnostic Gospel circa 100AD)Broken Sword 5 - the Serpent's Curse is the last part of Broken Sword series, coming out in 2014. Yup, our lovely duo is back in our lives again, nearly 20 years after the release of the legendary first game. We have witnessed George and Nico evolve throughout years - and devolve in some games, to be honest - yet after the commercial and presentational failure that we'd know as Broken Sword 4 - Angel of Death, I wasn't expecting much from a new game. I had come to accept that even though it had a marvelous beginning, Broken Sword series were dying in our age. Now I am thrilled to announce that I was tremendously wrong after playing this adventure gem. George and Nico are back, and they are at their best!Some years after the 4th game, George and Nico run across each other by another odd chance in an art exhibition. They are back in Paris again: the city that holds many memories for both; of cafés, of music, of love and of death. Where it all began years ago. This time, George is working for the insurance agency which the gallery owner made an arrangement with, and Nico is simply there to catch a scoop of the gallery opening. Just before they can catch up or get on a nostalgia train through longing looks they exchanged, they witness an art theft and an accompanying murder! Gallery owner is shot and La Malediccio - a religious Gnostic painting by the mysterious artist El Serp - is stolen. As fate pushes Nico and George into each other to run through a final mystery, we take on yet another mystical yet hilarious adventure with them.Okay, from this point, it might very well become a love letter and a summary of the whole franchise and narrative, so feel free to skip this part if bored. Narrative pace, presented lore, character interactions and humor are incredibly well here! I was really worried - and a bit depressed after playing the 4th game, since it was obvious that with each new game hailing from the series, the quality of all these aspects dropped down a bit more. Legendary with the first, well-done with the second, quite nice with the third and... Downright horrible with the fourth. Now this game, brings back George and Nico, and what made both their personalities and the stories revolved around them special. We'll meet new characters, catch up with old ones and work on a full blown conspiracy with medieval background yet again. This time, the lore focuses on a less known - and mostly apocryphal side of Christian history: Gnosticism. It is a different approach with authentic scriptural storyline, compared to the millionth Catholic witch hunt we've seen in video game history so far. It is refreshing.Environment design is again 2D classic point and click, with 3D depth enhancement. Keyboard interference is completely gone once again. Artworks are marvelous, and site transitions are wondrously smooth. You keep playing the game without a notch of display quality dropping down. Character designs are marvelous cartoon exaggerations again, with some comic art shading, which is a tip of hat to older games yet a refreshing redesign when it comes to animations. I have to add that the soundtrack was also the best in the series since the first one. Kudos!This is a text-book classical P&C adventure if I've ever seen any. We have inventory collection, NPC & environment interactions, and of course puzzles to solve. Well, not to dishearten, but puzzles are not really challenging. They only take some attention to detail and some careful reading in most places. Yet, they are not actively time consuming at least. Now that we are not dealing with 3D environments anymore, all box-pushing puzzles we've suffered through in previous games -3rd and 4th, to be specific - are gone. Yay! Oh, and there are achievements added to this game, which is a first in the series here on Steam. By the way, as another side note to fans: the goat is back!Beautiful, mysterious, intriguing and funny. All these are the qualities of a Broken Sword game, and this 5th instalment delivers all these aspects in full potential. It is a must for the fans, and a more than decent addition to all adventure gamers' library. Enjoy!Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												Broken sword is back! Finally they dropped that ugly looking 3D graphics and annoying controls and got back to the roots.The game looks amazing, beautifully drawn environments just makes you take screenshots.From the very beginning you can feel that broken swordish atmosphere and hear the great music, nostalgia conquers you and finally you start your adventure with George and Nico.The story is good as always and it's very broken swordish too. Religious symbols, some legend, people who want destroy the world, you know.Game has been split into two parts. First part feels easier (at least for me), second part has some more action and good puzzles which could take some time to solve. Overall game is not very hard. Old school hardcore gamers probably wouldn't like it. But in my opinion the adventure game cannot be very hard when it has a logical solutions to the puzzles. I don't like when you need to do absolutely stupid and illogical things to solve something, so i'll better have an easier game but with logical puzzles. Everyone who played the old Broken sword games should remember the damn goat. I remember it. It was a pain. Guess what? The goat is back! Of course people who didn't play the previous games probably will not be happy seeing all those characters from Georgie and Nico's past and will not understanding some dialogues and jokes, but don't worry, George has a new friend - Trevor. He's cute, he likes cookies and is very brave, he risk his live for George and he's a real hero.Sorry i'm very biased towards this game series, it's my favorite. It's hard for me to say something negative about it, but i'll try. In the second part there're couple lines of subtitles missing. Ok that's enough bashing this game.If you like adventure games i'd say this is a must have and if you liked it you should play previous games or at least 1 and 2. Yes they're old but still looking good, such games doesn't get old.So get this game, go on adventure, save the world and eat a doner kebab.			"

												Dear Adventurecommunity,After My first impressions of this Game I can say the Broken Sword Series is back. The lovely Graphics, the Voice Acting and the Story make this hole Game to a great Revolution of the Series. From the Design it is like the first two Parts of the Broken Sword Series, but with new features like an Autosave and Game Hind function. All in all I would thank Mr. Charles Cecil and the Kickstarter Backers who make this all possible. So i hope You all will enjoy this Game and happy Investigating.Your DickEvil ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------An Euch Adventurefreunde,nach meinen ersten Eindrücken ist es wirklich fantastisch geworden. Es sieht wunderschön aus und macht einen lebendigen Eindruck, sehr schöne deutsche Synchronisation. George wird wieder von dem gleichen Sprecher synchronisiert und auch die anderen Sprecher sind sehr gut gesprochen. Es spielt sich wie damals beim ersten und zweiten Teil. Also wieder back to the roots. Die Geschichte geht spannend voran und die Rästel sind logisch. Es ist wieder wie damals, Nico und George in Paris, danke Charles Cecil und alle Kickstarter Backer das ihr dieses Spiel für uns Fans möglich gemacht habt.So dann werde ich mal weiter ermitteln und die Verschwörung versuchen aufzudecken.Viel Spaß beim spielen liebe Adventure und RätselfreundeEuer DickEvil			"

												I probably won't ever get around to writing a full-on review for the game, but I highly recommend it if you're a fan of the 2D Broken Sword games. The game is slightly more hint-through-speech-oriented than I would like in a point-and-clicker, but if you can look past that minor off-put and appreciate the game and its innards for what it is, you'll love it, for sure.Garyxx			"

												As a Broken Sword fan who loved the first two games, but found the third and fourth game forgettable, I find this installment to be nothing short of fantastic.What's to love?- Original voice actors,- Beautifully designed 2D backgrounds,- Combination mechanics that make sense, you can actually figure these puzzles out!- Original design team who clearly have a love for this series.If Broken Sword 1 and 2 were personal favourites of yours, you have no reason not to give this a try. The game is quite long! Just over 14 hours or so to complete, and there's depth to it all. It's heartwarmingly back to its roots, so much so to have a wondrous Paris landscape with beautifully soothing music.If I'm not talking about the bad points, it's because I don't think there are any. Fans of the series know what a Broken Sword game is like, and apart from a mildly underwhelming ending, it's solid enough to be fun, engaging and very, very clever. Purchase, sit back, enjoy and smile.			"

												The Broken Sword series is pretty much a classic. You can't say you love point & clicks and not have played them.Ignoring the 4th game released in '06 - The Angel of Death (which was pretty much a mixed bag) and the 3rd game in '03 - The Sleeping Dragon (which was rejected by purists for its 3d graphics and keyboard controls); it was a truly long wait since the 1st game - The Shadow of the Templars and 2nd game - The Smoking Mirror, released respectively in 96 and 97.This 5th game, returned back to its 2d roots and with current technology, boasts a really neat graphic system. We have the usual solid adventure to solve and lots of places to explore. George's nemesis - the goat made an appearance yet again and it is also part of an easter egg. Do check that out for lots of laughs. As this game was backed on kickstarter, there were some goodies for the kickstarters to find in game. Don't forget to listen to the Radio Yorkshire for the answers to some of the questions we have been dying to know - as asked by the backers.			"

												Nico and George are back!Back in Paris with it´s cafes and murders, without 3D, but with the over the top dialogues, fun characters and nicely drawn graphics.So in short, it´s what old school Broken Sword fans may have hoped for.Cons: The riddles are not really hard, therefore expert adventure fans may feel a bit underwhelmed and the playtime is also a bit on the short side, due to it being a first episode game.If you can look beside this two points, this game is worth a look.

												I've never been a fan of adventure games because you often have to be inside the head of the developer in order to solve obscure puzzles that make little logical sense. Aside from The Walking Dead, Broken Sword has always been an exception to that rule. The first two games featured great puzzles, snappy dialogue, and intriguing mysteries. But after an awful third and fourth entry into the series, I was afraid the adventure genre was dead to me. Then along comes Broken Sword 5: The Serpents Curse. It does away with the horrendous transition to 3D and instead returns to gorgeous 2D backdrops. Back again is the clever dialogue and intriguing but not too obscure puzzles, and it's back one more time for another clever mystery. I really, really cannot reccoemend this game enough. You don't need to have played the others in the series, so it won't hurt to start here. If you love this game, go back and play the first two.-I opened a skylight with a bottle of diet cola and mints, then used a grappling hook made out of a dust cover and a crowbar to escape a building.  10/10			"

												As a die hard fan of original Broken Sword: Shadow of Templars, I really dislike this game. However, if I'm about to be fair, it's slightly above average. Adventure games aren't that common these days, and if you've never heard about Broken Sword series, for the price, it's not that bad.SynopsisBut if you're a Broken Sword fan like me, I would either not recommend the purchase, or buy it, thinking of it as kind of spin off game that has little to do with what made original great. For me particularly, it's the writing, acting and music. Storyline & charactersVery uninspired and lazy. Dialogues are not funny, painfully cheesy, stuff happens solely for the plot to continue further, characters are (with some exceptions) quite bland, even George (!!!) and you can spot every cliche from miles away. ""Hey, this place is not safe, let me tell you all that important stuff at much safer place, and count on me not to get killed on the way there!"" Original Broken Sword was playing it seriously, but was packed to the top with dry humor that was fitting perfectly. Here, it's nothing like that. Goofy, lazy, stupid and only here and there you'll catch a glimpse of something funny. A lot of old characters that have been brought back are just pointless cameos without any reason to be there, plus they've all lost their charm. (Moe is nothing like the funny goofball he used to be, now he's really just a guy. A guy without any personality.)Voice actors are also really bland. They all play it safe, so you'll never get a really bad impression, but you'll never get an impression that they beleive stuff is happening around them. Compared to how amazing they were in first game, once again, it's just a letdown. I personally blame whoever was in charge of voice acting, because actors can only do so much on their own, if they're not told what kind of vision director has. And I don't think they're bad, just badly utilized.Music and graphicsMusic is also somewhat of a letdown to me. Broken Sword 1 had amazing and memorable orchestral soundtrack and each track was carefully selected so it really had a meaning and helped out building atmosphere. Here, it's sometimes decent, but overall I just felt like in case of Fable series, where soundtrack never got any better than the first one. Plus I'm missing those little musical cues when something was happening, again, it's here and there, but not enough. Not terrible, but not amazing.And graphics - I'm a big sucker for traditional 2D animation, not cell shaded 3D graphics like this one has. It's awkward. But I can understand that once again, budget issues wouldn't allow for traditional animation, or perhaps Revolution thinks this look sells more. I've always adored cutscenes from original, because some of them were like something out of Don Bluth movies (and if you don't know who he is, do some research), here for obvious reasons, it isn't like that. And don't get me wrong, the game isn't ugly, but it feels phony. Also, there is almost nothing going on in background. Remember the rich and animated backgrounds in original? Compared to traditional animation, it's just cheap and once again, takes you out from the overall experience, but compared to other things, it doesn't bother me too much.In the end, I'm happy for Revolution that they can continue doing what they love, it's better to get something than nothing and frankly, as I've sayed, it's at least an average game. I just wish it was better, and I'm still hoping that one day we'll get that Broken Sword game that will be just as awesome as the first one was.			"

												Wow, this game is basically perfect! It was fun, it was exciting, it was groovy! This will be a love fest of a review since, for me, everything was perfect. The game is gorgeous. Seriously, it is one gigantic screentshot, with the beautifully drawn characters and locations with a hint of 3D to make them three dimensional. The detail and the color in this game never drops, whether you are on the streets of London and Paris, or a dingy shop on the outskirts of town, or a dank and dark cave. This game is eye candy. The characters are top notch. George and Nico are in top form. We have a great cast of supporting characters as well as familiar faces from previous Broken Sword games...and for all of you who played Broken Sword 1, the goat is back! The actors, the script, and story all come together to create an experience that hails back to the original Broken Sword. The music that was composed for this is very cool. I found myself dancing in my seat to the cool 1970's jam sequences. Now for the mechanics side. The game is a true point and click, with no keyboard interference. Every action has an animation, so sometimes George and Nico have to watch a side character, or listen to a side conversation before being able to act. This can be a tad annoying, but it helps focus attention in the right place. There is a wonderful hint system so that way you don't have to get stumped and search a walkthrough while in game. This game was made with wanting players to have fun, not to get irritated over puzzles. I would say that if you have never played any of the Broken Sword games, this could be a good start, and then go back a play the first game in the series. Also, I would vouch to say that if you like a good detective/adventure story with religious conspiracy themes, this would be worth picking up, even if you don't usually play point-and-click adventures. If this is the last game in the Broken Sword series, I can't think it could have ended any better. I am very glad I played this, and know that there will be another playthrough in the future.			"

												I enjoyed Broken Sword 5. The game made me laugh. Thumbs up.… Well, if you want a little more detail than that, fine, I guess I could try to expand upon why it won me over.I first learned that the point & click game series “Broken Sword” existed because of my cell phone actually. I had a smart phone. I had no games on it that would hold my attention for more than 15 minutes or so. And, at the time, I had a three-hour flight. Dreading boredom, I browsed games until I found Broken Sword 1.  Then a month later I bought Broken Sword 2. By that time I become a casual fan of the series so of course I bought Broken Sword 5. It took me a bit to understand WHY this point and click game stood out to me. It wasn’t exactly ground breaking. Each game had a mystery plot that had the characters adventuring to new locations and trying to solve a murder that revolves around historical artifacts and each game had puzzles that made you think outside the box. The art was great and the voice acting was wonderful. The plot was  humorous and filled with fun loving characters.It was good on all these levels, but there was an additional something that just makes it more noticeable to me. I still have trouble putting my finger on it, but I can only described the feel as a serene level of calm pleasantness. Playing Broken Sword 5 (as well as the other broken sword games) was like picking up a favorite book again or going fishing with some buddies. There was no feeling of urgency to complete the game, no over exotic melodrama, no underlying political messages, jarring scenes of violence, or crazy car chases. I didn’t play this game because everyone else was talking about it or because it was on the latest and greatest tech.  It was a  casual player’s dream. To play a game just so it can bring out a chuckle and a stress dissipating smile, during those times when a person only seems to have a half an hour a day or so to themselves.			"

												I was so close to the end of this game, and then, BOOM! I apparently encountered a bug that is impossible to overcome.. at 81% of the game. That suc*s.Looking on web, it apparently is a translation bug or something similar, that forbids you to put a specific word in one of the final enigmas (Tabula Veritatis). Lots of people has still today no idea how to finish the game at this point, someone suggest to load an old savegame, or to start the entire game from zero, just to try again that enigma, but no one confirmed that this actually works.A stupid but definitive bug that never was solved by devs in years (I'm writing this in 2017) and that can forbids you to see the ending of a very cool game.Dear Revolution,I was so happy for this comeback. I played the Broken Sword series since the day one of the first chapter and then I always played your games until this one.. and it was a MASSIVE shame that now probably I cannot finish the last one.I still want to try some possible workarounds before unistalling it, but the negative review will remain, since this stupid bug probably ended a lot of nice gameplays of other people, probably including myself. 3 years were enough to fix this bug, you didn't. PS = Not to mention, part of my frustration, is also this message to one of the guys who got this bug, wrote by one of the devs:""Hi there - if you can email Catherine@Revolution.co.uk I know she can either offer advice or send you a Savegame file for the next scene along in the game whilst she looks into the issue for you.""Proof: http://i.imgur.com/TtBrSSu.pngYou can offer an advice, a savegame, but you cannot simply fix the game.Really?

If you like traditional point-and-click games, like the ones from the 90s Lucasarts and Sierra eras, you'll feel right at home with this game. The story isn't the most engaging, but most of the puzzles are pretty logical.If you want a more modern point-and-click puzzle adventure game, TellTale has done a better job with Tales of Monkey Island and Sam n Max.

Broken Sword 5 - The Serpent's Curse			* 8/10The latest (not the last, I heard they're working on a new BS) chapter of this saga comes back with a classic yet renewed style!After the questionable 3d and keyboard input experiments with the 3rd and 4th chapters, this 5th chapter presents itself in a classic aspect, the way we used to know Broken Sword as in its most appreciated chapters (1st and 2nd). 2d characters (actually 3d, but then exported in 2d) on 2d beatifully drawn ambiences.As usual the story starts very quickly: George and Nico meet up by chance for work reasons at an art gallery in Paris and they both witness the homicide of the gallery owner and the theft of a particular painting, which is the core of this story as the entire adventure revolves around it. Obviously this time the purpose will be to find the killer, who's behind him and what is the story behind that particular painting.The spirit of the game is back at its origin, we'll see new characters but also old acquaintances (a special mention for the Goat), the game can be played with just the mouse again and the interface is very intuitive.We'll be visiting many locations and almost all of them are well realized, with details, or great sceneries or good old humour (special mention for Pugs), which is always present in George's speech.Dialogues are always important, they reveal informations and even though they're not always essential they give shape to characters (special mention for the ""gardener"" with Nico).Riddles sometimes can be hard to understand or solve (special mention for the ""sancuary"" and the dark cave) but there's nothing that can be impossible if you try to understand all the elements around you and try with logic and George's logic, according to the situation.The story is very pleasant to follow, a thrilling starting point, hideous characters, old acquaintances, many plot twists and revelations, everything with a touch of classic humour in the right points.To make it short this chapter is another one of my favourites among the frist two chapters. Good job Revolution, I can't wait for the next chapter!+++PROs+++ IT'S BROKEN SWORD! A chapter realized with the successful recipe that made the first two titles so good is not a guarantee for success, but it makes a good title if you add it a good story, easter eggs and a good soundtrack.---CONs--- DIFFICULTIES. I have to admit I had some trouble with few riddles, especially in the final part of the game.I played this game on this machine:Intel Core i7-497016Gb RAM DDR3GeForce GTX 660Windows 10 Professional x64 "

												Back by nostalgic demand, this fifth installment of the franchise is something of a return to form, albeit one that is as guilty of replicating the faults of previous games as it at revisiting the strengths.Abandoning the 3D worlds and returning to a 2D style, reminiscent of the first two installements, helps the game recapture the appealing artwork style that enhanced the atmosphere of those first two adventures. Not to mention the return of Barrington Pheloung on soundtrack duties. Meanwhile voice work is largely of a good quality, spear-headed by Rolf Saxon's now iconic performance as George Stobbart.However, it's the story that really starts to let things down, with the plot taking some silly turns that push the player out of the narrative, keeping you at arm's length from really engaging with the events unfolding on screen. There are also a handful of puzzles that are frustrating in a way that stops you feeling like you're really experiencing the thoughtful adventure, meaning that you spend ages pursuing an idea that seems right, receive no confirmation that you're making any progress, and then feel lost, only to realise that you were right to begin with... and not in some sort of rewarding ""I'm a genius!"" fashion, sadly.It also feels terribly anti-climatic, though that's been a problem of every single Broken Sword game, but, for fans of this series, this is a much appreciated step back in the right direction, and undoubtedly the third best game in the series, though that's both high praise and something of a back-handed compliment.

												A stagnant and rather witless appeal to nostalgia.  It's an improvement over Broken Sword 3 and 4 simply in that it has nice visuals and isn't a pain to interact with, but the writing's as flat as it's been since 3 (if not worse), George and Nico continue to not grow as characters, and the puzzle design is nothing special for the most part.  I hate to say it, as a huge fan of the first two games (and a Kickstarter backer with my name in the credits), but it's probably time to put this series to rest.  I'd like to see an all new game directed by Charles Cecil with a fresh cast of characters, though.			"

												I felt the need to review this game, which I don't usually do, as I know a lot of people will be on the fence. Well, this game is fantastic. It combines the classic old skool gameplay that Broken Sword is known for, and adds all that is necessary - superb graphics and art style. The rest is the same as Broken Sword 1 and 2. Same pointer, same menu system at the top, same inventory etc etc. The story is really interesting, the dialogue is good and funny, and the puzzles require thought.It is also a lengthy adventure, and so well worth the price. Buy this game and support the developers as they deserve it, and if you want a Broken Sword 6!!			"

												Only Broken Sword game I haven't played is the fourth one, and as I have heard only negative things about it I'm sure it will take me some time for me to do that. What this game does the best is the respectful apporach to the previous titles, especially 1 & 2. However, in terms of overall continuity it feels a little bit out of touch. It feels like as if it was meant for especially newcomers of the series and for those who want to get some old nostalgic vibes from it. The playtime was in my opinion acceptable. It took me nine hours to beat the story, allthough I missed a few achievements. About same amount as in the first and the third installations. The story was as fascinating as one could expect from a Broken Sword-game, with religious mysticism and conspiracy, with some twists and funny references. All in all, I prefer the first and the third one (I know that this is an unpopular opinion) over this, but I still recommend it to everybody.			"

												Pros: - Beautiful handmade graphics - Nice character models - Rolf SaxonCons: - Some jokes and cameos from previous games are really awkward (Moue, Piermont) - Many puzzles are kind of ridiculous - The story is too straightforward, no way to choose a little alternative path or do things in another order - Seriously, guys, couldn't you hire people that would be capable of writing a less naive scenario?As an avid adventure games player, I am really glad that Revolution had decided to make a new Broken Sword and I was more than happy to support the Kickstarter campaign. However, after 2 years of development, I definitely expected more than this.			"

												After the not so well received Broken Sword 3 & 4, Broken Sword 5 is back to the root, which is the good old 2D classic graphic point-and-click adventure, just like broken Sword 1 & 2. And it's good!The Full HD graphic is crispt and nice! The puzzles are mostly logical, although a little bit here and there are okay.A recommended title for Broken Sword fans, and point-and-click adventure alike.			"

												Broken Sword 5 is an awesome adventure game and hails the return of one of the best game franchises in adventure game history. The graphics are awesome, even if some of the animations are a little stiff and awkward. The voice acting for the most part is superb with standout performances from george and nico. The story is amazing and is right up there with broken sword 1 and 2. Now for some basic pros and cons.PROS1. voice acting2. overall story is very well done that kept me engaged the whole way. I always loved the Indiana Jones aspects of the broken sword series and this game is no exception. its full of intrigue and suspense.3. puzzles for the most part are well thought out and not too hard, but as in any adventure game there are some hard ones and some solutions that are basically just trial and error. there is a built in hint system that can help you, im pretty proud I ony had to use it on two puzzles. overall I give the puzzle difficulty of it a 6/10 in the fact that for the most part they will challenge you but not frustrate you.4. The hand drawn backgrounds all look fantastic, and I mean FANTASTIC.5. The length of the game is also really good, I beat the the game in about 12.5 hrs, which I think is the perfect length for a game.CONS1. Animations are a little wonkie and im not a huge fan of the 3d models they used for the characters, I wish they were hand drawn like the backgrounds 2. Humor and jokes while at times are truly funny, I believe this game misses on the jokes more than they hit. not a huge deal but I wanted to point it out.3. While the cutscenes still look good, they are no where the level they were in broken sword 1 and 2.4. the game for the most part ran smoothly but did crash on me twice, the good part though is it does auto save frequently, so was not a huge issue.5. While I love the fan service and cameos I thought they had too many cameos and returning characters, and one to many goat puzzles lol.CLOSING COMMENTSThis game is great I got it on sale and I cant reccomend it enough to anybody, especially if you played the other games in the series and enjoyed them, or if your an adventjure game fan in general. Although you should first play broken sword 1 and 2 bc even though this is the 5th game in the series, im pretty sure it follows the events of broken sword 2. they are also on sale right now. Broken Sword 5 is a great entry into the series, if I had to rank my fav broken sword games in order it would go1. broken sword 12. broken sword 53. broken sword 24. broken sword 35. broken sword 4			"

												I'm a huge fan of the Broken Sword series.  George and Nico are second only to Guybrush and Elaine.  I tried not to mind too much when the series shifted to 3D and some action for the third and fourth installments because Revolution were clearly handling the games with care and love for the genre.  Still, I was thrilled when it became clear on Kickstarter that the fifth game would be 2D and action-free.The artwork in the game is about the best of this style that I have ever seen in a game.  Scenes are beautiful and detailed (and that really helps when you have to notice a slightly pink spot on a sort of orange spot).  I had to resist taking screenshots because they would all be spoilers.The game presents you with pretty standard environment, inventory, and dialog puzzles, but they all work pretty sensibly, even the decrypting puzzles late in the game.  I never got stuck due to some ridiculously obtuse puzzle structure.The worst I can say about the game is that there are so many spots to interact with, so many comments to hear (although still less than in a typical Daedalic game, by comparison) that you can progress pretty slowly and it's possible to get bored.  Still, the story is well written with a typical Indiana Jones plus reluctant hero approach as in the other Broken Sword games.  I did find it to be slightly less boring than the fourth game (which is finally on Steam, by the way).  The religious aspect of the story focuses on a conspiracy-flavored long line of Gnostics protecting an artifact that could upset the balance of Jehovah and Lucifer, so you kind of know the story will take you around Europe and eventually to the Middle East.So if you like the very best that standard point-and-click gameplay can offer, reasonable puzzles, and the best 2D artwork anywhere, this game is a must-play. Depending on your ability and your choice of pace, it's about a 12 hour game at least, possibly as much as 14 hours, longer than that other crowd-funded classic adventure game two-part installment that still isn't finished (ahem-cough-Broken-Age-cough).

												I loved the original game and none of the sequels impressed me as much. This fifth installment of the series tries to recapture the magic of that first masterpiece, bringing american George Stobbart (now working for an insurance company) and french journalist Nico Collard together again in lovely Paris for another adventure involving a religious cult and an old supernatural mystery, in several locations of Europe and the Middle East. But, besides the jokes involving goats, some recurring characters and good old George (voiced by Rolf Saxon) showing all the bizarre things he keeps in his pockets to everyone, this game lacks the amazing sense of humor of the original. It's not a bad point & click adventure (although the pixel hunting has become tiresome) and it's better than the 3rd game in 3D (I didn't play the 4th, considered the worst), but don't expect it to be as unforgettable as ""The Shadow of the Templars"".

												A very good point&click adventure in the best of classic style, very much resembling first part of the Broken Sword series. It seems a bit more epic and more Indiana Jones-like with less humour, witty dialogues and climate, but does its job at keeping you entertained for 10 hours even if the characters are not too complex.Game itself is quite easy, puzzles are usually logical. Everything is wrapped in a nice graphic and soundtrack.It is a must for fans of the series, but if you're not really into this kind of games you should rather try the first part of BS.Made me want to play Shadow of the Templars again after 20 years.

												A wonderful entry to the series, it is the closes thing to the original Broken Sword (not only the best game in the series but also one of the best point-and-click adventures ever made).The game is wonderful in almost every aspect. I'm really happy to see extremely detailed 2D backgrounds. In my opinion, this is the only right way to do classic adventure games. I haven't ever seen any 3D backgrounds that could rival the 2D ones. The voice acting and the music are of the best quality too.The only disappointing thing is the characters. They are not in 2D, sadly, and look even worse than 2D characters featured 17 years ago in the original game! Well, the character models are actually made in 3D and then pre-rendered and put into 2D frames, they are not processed in real time. Nonetheless, they are much-much worse than authentic 2D models. A good example of how the 3D characters ruin the whole feel of the game is the introduction movie. The intro clearly takes cue from the first game in the series but looks worse than the original 17-year-old movie, even if you put them side by side now. Only because of those 3D models which stand out too much and not in a good way.Other than the 3D models, I couldn't find anything I didn't like about the game. It's absolutely gorgeous. I was one of the backers behind it and I wouldn't hesitate to back any of Revolution's other games.			"

												Really enjoying it so far but it's difficult to account for how much this is influenced by Nostalgia.It has a very similar feeling to the first two Broken Sword games, both in style and content. It's evident a bit of care has gone into the storyline and I'm keen to see if they keep the quality up through both episodes.As this is quite a nostalgic game, it will feel quite dated, particularly to those who have't invested in the series previously. Unlike current games it's very much on rails and doesn't include faux interactivity though moral choices, not that this is necessarily a bad thing. It's very much a straightforward puzzle point and click adventure game.I'd certainly recommend the game to would be buyers, but would advise new people to the franchise to try to get hold of the original Broken Sword and give it a play through. I went back to it recently and it has some very clever puzzles of the right kind of difficulty, almost a more logical Monkey Island, (which I also enjoy of course!)Perhaps look for the original version if you can, as the Director's Cut has had a very mixed reception).This new game comes into an time where there's more of a walkthrough culture in games where there can be a focus on 100%ing, getting all achievements and all that jazz. I'd really recommend bucking this trend for this game to just jump in and work through it at your own pace.			"

												Done in 8 hours. Yes, buy it.I could have used just that tiiiiiiny bit more of polish, most notably for me on speech transitions -- characters will wait for their animation to be at the right spot to start talking, and since there's a LOT of dialogue in the game (GREAT voice over work) that's a crapton of little delays during the whole affair.Backgrounds are gorgeous, I understand some people not liking the '3D' look of the characters but I did like them. Callbacks to previous games are nice, but you don't really need to have played them to enjoy this one.The last hour or so I found to be streched a bit thin puzzle wise.. Really 1 thing to be done at a time, and only one specific way to do it, could have used more hints on close solutions and the like. Did use the hint system just to get to the end because my patience was running out. Lots and lots of looking at George walking (slowly) around to try and retry actions. Ugh. Still not a big thing, but noticeable.			"

												I backed this game on kickstarter because I loved the first and second installments (never played any of the others). But I must say I'm disappointed with the result. It's not necessarily a bad game, the graphics and voice acting are excellent, but... the story itself is just incredibly bad, there's no flow to it, things just seemed stuck together for no reason. And the puzzles often have no logic to them at all. What to think of a game that says ""that only works in the movies"" when you try to open a lock with a paperclip but then (spoiler) happily makes you stick the clip to a cockroach to send it inside a some dangerous electronics to replace a fuse. Wtf?In the end not a completely bad game, but I can't really recommend it either.			"

												Started the game ages ago and got through about 40% playing on my desktop before moving on to other games and kind of forgetting about this one. Got a steam link and steam controller and was flicking through my library for controller compatible games and started this one again from the start as I had forgotten the story.Have to say laying back on the couch and playing this on my tv makes it a so much better game. Totally addicted now and halfway through the story and will have finished the rest by tomorrow, it's the kind of clicker you can just lay back and enjoy the ride, story is interesting, clues and puzzles are just hard enough to get my brain ticking and I'm really enjoying a genre I don't normally play. So much I have brought the other four to do when I finish this one. The couch and large tv just make it a much more enjoyable experience.Also the amount of times I have just paused to admire Nico in all her sexy goodness I've thought about placing lube and a box of tissues on the table next to my couch.Highly recommend for those who want something relaxing to play while laying on the couch and enjoy a good mystery story to entertain them.

												I was really entertained by this game and had a few chuckles, but there were times, when I was probably too tired, that I felt it was really testing my patience and dragging it's feet to much. I completed the game in little less than 15 hours and despite cutting a few lines I had heard before during trial and error, I wasn't really in a rush. Puzzle-solving Adventure games are always a little on the edge, because developers have to come up with new puzzles and find a way to balance them and incorporate them into the natural flow. Being an Old School Adventure player I found a lot of things to be quite intuitive and straightforward, but there were also a few very complicated puzzles and some that were too hard for me. BS5 have added a gentle Hint system, that you can access whenever you feel lost, that nudges you in the right way with each option until it completely spoils you with the last option, but there were times when I found the spoilage to be just as cryptic as the problem itself. Even with the solution at hand I know there are puzzles I would never have guessed at all. There were times when it was hard to resist using the Hint system, but I really recommend not using it too much, because it is a rather short game and relying on hints too much dulls your mind to the point where you are almost completely dependent on them.  The game looks and sounds pretty nice in the Broken Sword 2D style and the resolution is pretty high too, but there are times when the generally nice and smooth, but sometimes too flat and bland graphics worked against the puzzle solving of the game, it simply doesn't support the needed attention to detail and there were times when I really wished there had been more controls than just the mouse to move parts of the game. The one thing this game really required of me above all else was PATIENCE! I often found myself to be quite annoyed with the slow mechanics of the game. The slow movement of the characters, the repetitious nature of problem solving like the repetition of the same walk, talk, action and 3-4 mental notes that kept popping up in boxes like bubbles in a club soda was really straining my decreasing patience a lot. Phew. I think the price of the game at $14.99 is a actually a bit too high, $9.99 would probably be too little, but I wouldn't have had any second thoughts about the worth of the game, because even though it's really a nice game the constant challenge of my patience really detracts a lot from my joy of the game, but I had a good time and in the end game there was a nice crazy turn of events and a romantic touch, that saved the day.

												Back when the first Broken Sword game came out, I was just a kid. I remember being taken away by the cartoon-style graphics, and the mystery revolving the killer-clown and the templars. I loved that game, and I loved Broken Sword 2 as well. Then the 3D titles came, and I played them, but they never really hit the spot for me, not like the first two games did.With Broken Sword 5 - the Serpent's Curse, I feel it's safe to say that Broken Sword is back. If you loved the first two games, you will love this one as well. The humor, the gameplay and the all-around feel of the game is very similar to the way this series started.I never write reviews for a game, but this one had me experiencing nostalgia as well as gripping story, so I felt that I had to recommend this to other people. I miss the cartoon graphics of the old games, but this in no way effects my overall experience. 10/10 for fans of Broken Sword, and a most enjoyable game for all fans of point-and-click adventure games.

												It's been a long time since Broken sword dug back to its roots. It can be said, and it's also true that, the art style is hindered by the addition of 3d characters, yet it somehow works. The latest edition to the Revolution repertoire really outshines its recent predecessors and welcomes back some very familiar faces. For fans of the series, this is a must buy. For newcomers, this is a must try. You'll find yourselves delving deep into a conspiracy that scopes back thousands of years. You're a donkey, and the story is a carrot on a stick - Revolution are holding that stick, and they're not letting it go easily. With an updated interface and an addition of a 'hints' system, which is sometimes so blunt they may as well have put a blinking fluorescent 'Click Here' sign on the screen, the game has become much more accessible. The biggest downside to the game so far is its length, which is average at best. Fortunately for the fans of this game the release of a second episode will hopefully promise some much needed answers and game time.Broken Sword 5 - The Serpent's Curse - 9/10.			"

												While only half of the game has been released so far, it’s still a good chunk of story.  And the tale is just what you’d expect from Charles Cecil and the other writers.  It’s full of intrigue, mythology, and good old fashioned humour that you would expect from a Broken Sword game.  There are a few small nitpicks, but overall it’s a solid playing experience.  Some have said that the game is too short and that you rarely leave Paris, but what else would you expect for an experience that’s only 50% done?  And it does leave on a bit of a cliffhanger, so if you’re impatient, you might want to wait until January when the rest is released.(http://www.kickstartadventure.com/home/broken-sword-5-the-serpents-curse-review-2/) "

												Overall the game is real good and keeps you hooked.The thing I love about broken swords is there: it teaches you neat pieces of history, through traveling tales and neat characters.The puzzles weren't very nice, except the cryptographic ones. Actually there wasn't a single time that I went ""AH! So that's how!"" as I did in the previous games.In fact a lot of times things looked very far-fetched (like dropping a hammer on a guard from 5 meters above and actually hitting and knocking him out).The menus weren't as responsive as they should be. And if there was a way to make George walk faster I couldn't figure it out.So it was a bit boring at times. What kept me going on was the story.The characters weren't as charismatic as in the first 3 broken swords. But they were nice. I specially liked the weird barista guy but he didnt show up much after the first act.Come to think about it. There wasn't much interaction going on. There were a lot less different characters for each location than in the previous games (specially the first too). So all and all, I would say this was as good as the 3rd one. But still one of the best adventure games out there.I didn't find the story very compelling, but the history piece that they picked (gnostics/cathars) was really really interesting.Ty for making this game guys,			"

												Short and easy, but very pretty. The gameplay is virtually unchanged from the first two, so no decline in that sense. The plot is standard bad guys trying to take control of some super powerful religious artifact from middle ages. The writing is on par with the originals. Overall pretty decent p&c.			"

												The Story has its strengths that i like, some dialogs are not so bad and few even funny. Graphics has its own charme, sound is okay. The game length for the price is a bit short if you dont need so long but with a discount of 50 % or higher its fine. Great game i hope that parts 1-4 get still some updates. I enjoy it, if you like point and click adventure test it. I give this game 86 %. Thanks for reading.			"

												Of all the kickstarter projects of 2014 this had been the one with the better outcome. The game is pretty nice, well done and polished in all general aspects, without being anything incredible it is, in the end all that it was expected from a broken sword game, and above all, everything that it's developers and charles cecil himself had promised from the very beginning. That's why this game is so satisfying: it's the closest thing to play and old adventure in the present (something that, the other devs and it's crowdfunding projects had tried with different results, not quite achieveing their original objectives, or just failing, miserably)Broken sword 5 is the second best of the series (After the first one) and that's saying a lot:*The backgrounds are hand drawn. The characters and it;s animations are not.*The music is the same style from the first two games, playing very subtetly while progressing.*The voices for the character are perfect. the voice for George, the main character, it's the same from previous games.*The story while being pretty average, it manages to capture some spark from the first installment and does service.*The places you visit during the adventure are beautifull and inspiring.As a negative point i would say the puzzle loose some logic by the end of the adventure. Personally, i had to resort to a walkthrough to be able to solve them.A pretty good  game, and after playing the other kickstarter adventure games from 2014, i would say this the best all around.UPDATE 24/03/2016:I would say that, of 2014 Sherlock Holmes Crimes & Punishments is the best adventure game , but off all kickstarter adventures Broken sword was the best .

I was disappointed that George no longer has that well-lubricated Don Bluth strut, and I found the animations in general to be on the stiff side, but the wonderful character designs and voiceovers make up for it.(This game reminded me of how much I love McVitie's Tea Biscuits, so I went out and bought a bunch of rolls.

												All in all a good adventure game, which is true to the previous installments in the series. But I don't feel, that you need to play the previous games in order to enjoy this though. Of course some detail stuff opens to you only, if you have played those.I personally liked the first episode more: it was a bit more coherent with the puzzles. I felt that the second episode had few difficulty spikes with the puzzles and also few puzzles, that needed a plain ""let's try everything from the inventory"" approach. But don't get me wrong, it was still rather good. I also have to mention the gorgeous background art.A full recommendation to all the adventure fans out there.			"

While I enjoy the concept of some of the later challenges, some of them suffered greatly from the typical ""aventure puzzle"" syndrome.Outside of minor nuances like slightly/off janky animations, and a slightly cumbersome UI, this game is well worth your time.

I Hope BS Angel of Death be available on steam too. Then my collection be complete.

												Based on  the german version with 5 hours played and around 30% completed.UI:Well, let's be honest the UI (Main Menu) isn't beautiful and looks like some alpha/beta version. The ingame UI is the standard backpack inventory which should be well known to every gamer that likes point and click adventure. Sadly there seems to be no option to open the menu with a mouse click/wheel action. So you have to move your mouse to the icon on the bottom left side of the screen. When hovering over a usable object the UI will present you with the right (=only) action you can perform. In addition to that you can inspect every useable item to get a response from your active character. Voiceover: The german voice actors are really superb. George got his old voice actor and Nico got someone who almost sounds exactly the same as her usual voice actor. If I hadn't known beforehand that Nico got a new voice, I wouldn't have noticed it. The other characters got pretty good voice actors as well and those that made an appearance in a previous installment of the Broken Sword series seem to have their original voice actors as well. Graphics:The backgrounds are beautifully hand drawn and look amazing. Seeing those backgrounds with George and Nico really took me back to the old days. Sadly the animations aren't on par with the backgrounds. Don't get me wrong they aren't bad but compared to those backgrounds they just lose.Currently the supported resolution of the game is only 1280x720. But they promised to deliver a 1080HD patch. Puzzles:The puzzles so far have been good (=fun) and till now I havn't encountered an illogical one. The puzzles range from dialogue puzzles to item combination puzzles to the likes of reconstructing a destroyed message. If you're an experienced adventure gamer you'll probably have no difficulties solving those. But I still had fun and enjoyed them. Story: A painting is stolen from a gallery and during that a man is killed. Nico and George happen to be there and are trying to solve the robbery/murder. While doing so they discover that the painting has a special history and that it wasn't just a regular robbery.  During that they meet some old friends and visit different countries. Bugs:Well I havn't ecountered a real bug till now but there are some things like e.g. really hard to spot items or a big item where the mouse courser has to be at a specific spot to make it useable (like a whole blank page)  which could frustrate you. Other than that I havn't encountered anything.Conclusion:I'm loving the game but I'll be honest here and tell you that I'm a fan of the ""Broden Sword"" series. So I might be a little biased here. Revolution Software delivers a good (definetly better than 3 (ugh) and 4 but not as good as 1 and 2) sequel to the Broken Sword series and every fan should get it asap if he hasn't already. Every other adventure game fan should ask himself if graphics (UI/Animation) is really (!!!!) important to him and if so he should maybe stay away from the game. All those that value gameplay and story more shouldn't wait and get this game. With that you'll support one of those developers who still make adventure games.Warning: The second part will be released at a later date (January). If you buy the game now you'll get the second episode as soon as it becomes available. So you'll probably have to wait till then to experience the full story. On the bright side the game will be complete with the second episode and the wait isn't a long one.			"

												This game is just as good as the other in the Broken Sword series. You will follow Nico and George around Paris and other locations investigating a art theft that they witnessed.The game is very short for a experienced player. ~9 hours. And it ends just when things are getting interesting. There will most likely be another game to follow up on this great and intriguing story.In my personal opinion it's just to make more money. But then again, the game is rather cheap, so it would be better if they said from the start that it was going to be ""Episode"" based or something. Just like other games are now days. (Walking Dead game series)I hope you guy's enjoy this game as much as I did. I'm very happy that the series it's back!			"

												Very happy to see Broken Sword back. I loved this game series as a kid. My parents bought the first game for computer when I was 8 or so. We played it together, and we had a blast. I remember being stuck on the Goat in Ireland. In the original game it was a very tricky puzzle to solve. We loved that game, so to see a modern iteration, with HD graphics and superb voice acting, it really makes me truly happy. We got the second game for PS1 one weekend, after I had injured my leg and was laid up. Once again, we loved it. Another masterpiece. The third game lost us, we couldn't get into it, and the 4th game seems so incredibly rare to buy, I didn't know it even existed until I heard about this game being the 5th in the series. I've played about 2 hours of The Serpents Curse so far, and I am really enjoying it. The humour is as sharp and witty as ever, superb voice acting by Rolf and the rest of the cast, which we shouldn't have expected it to be any less than perfect. Good to see George and Nico back in action, and its also good to see some characters coming back, like Seargent Moue and Laine. I'm sure as I progress further through the game, it will surprise me with more cameos.Its also good to see the game return to its Point and Click roots. The main reason I never played the 3rd game was because of the controls. It wasn't familiar, and so I assumed the 4th game followed the same convention. So if you're thinking about buying this game, and you enjoyed the first 2 games or even any of the game in this series, you should definitely get it. Especially while its 20% off.			"

												New Broken Sword is good game, all adventure fans will enjoy it for sure (and it doesn't matter if this is your first or fifth game of the series). Characters are really fleshed out and every one of them has memorable personality unlike many other games. I also liked how dialogue listening payed off because conversations gets you clues about how to solve puzzles. And really clever humor was in there - I found myself laughing many times. Story is good so far - what starts as simple museum murder slowly becomes mystery which later turns into dangerous religious conspiracy and I bet you will enjoy the ride.. which ends in half indeed but with proper and rather satisfying closure - and you shouldn't be disappointed.Technically, there are still some bugs that needs to get patch soon, like occasional missing lipsync or 1080p assets but while some little polish is still needed this is really nothing game breaking. Graphics are top notch, mainly some hand-drawn backgrounds and cell-shaded characters are done pretty well at least. First I was afraid that it ruins the atmosphere but I got used to it rather quickly. You can also switch to old-fashioned subtitles instead of comics bubbles and turn off hint-system (which is something I really recommend as the game isn't too hard and every puzzle can be solved rather logically).In the end I have to say the folks at RevSoft managed to bring Broken Sword back to its glory and now I really can't wait for their next game.

												I am an old graphic adventures lover and i have all 5 Broken Swords Retail boxed, i really love Broken Sword serie, but my main satisfaction when i play an adventure is the chance i have to complete it whole without reading any solution or hints, that's why i disabled the ingame hints (i think is a bad thing) for the whole game. When i can't solve a puzzle and i decide to read the solution to solve it (this works for any game i've played in past) there are 2 different situation, the situation number one is when after i discovered the solution i realize i did not find it cause of my personal mistake, in this case i pity myself but then i not change my opinion about the game, the situation number 2 is the one when after i read the solution i realize the puzzle was not clear, not logic, and bad built up, so basically was not my fault but developers one who ruined totally the fun for me for that game, sadly in this adventure i discovered one of those (the only one i had to read hints for) and is the puzzle of the damned GLYPHS, was totally illogical and nosense and i pray DEVS, for their next adventure, to avoid to put such puzzles in their beautiful advntures cause they ruin the fun, i don't mind the challenge of an hard puzzle, but it have to be logical and intuitive enough, if it is totally obscure it is no more funny, i can't talk about it here for obvious reasons but who encountered it understand very well what i'm talking about. So this is a positive review but for me is a dramatically sad one, cause i did not expect from a such company a such weird puzzle, so my final vote, that originally was 8/10, after this puzzle becomes 7/10 and make me consider this Broken Sword as the worse one of the 5 released till now, altough remains a good adventure after all.My Final Score is 75 /100  "

												I wanted to like this game, but I found the puzzles too dumb. You can't talk to a lady because there's a cockroach running around. Ooh, get rid of the cockroach puzzle time! Or let's spread this pizza sauce around to fool the detective into thinking it's blood! Because blood and pizza sauce look exactly the same. The graphics are nice, the voice acting is nice, and I guess the story so far is OK, but I felt a lot of the puzzles were forced and the solutions were pretty cheesy as well.			"

												This game feels a lot like the first two Broken Sword games, despite the use of 3D models. In fact, it's not necessary to have played the previous games to enjoy this one, though everyone should definitely check out the entire series.As usual, the plot is gripping and filled with the bizarre sort of humour that is only possible in an adventure game.

												As a long term fan of the Broken Sword series, ""Broken Sword 5 - The Serpent's Curse"" is both a lovely trip down memory lane and a mostly successful adventure in its own right.Seeing the return of George and Nico to a 2D adventure is a very welcome thing, the backgrounds are all beautiful throughout the entire game and I would look forward to each new location to see what it would look like, just as equally to continue the story. The 3D model based sprites used in the game while not a perfect fit (sometimes appearing to be out of perspective with environments or simply standing out too much) do a great job of conveying the colourful and exciting world the game inhabits. I personally would love to see a return to 2D hand animated characters, but it is obviously something that it's too expensive for a game created through kickstarter and that's understandable. The story for the most part is a success, an interesting and sometimes mysterious adventure into another hidden powerful religious artefact although at points it feels predictable and formulaic with the rest of the series, especially in the second episode which sadly to me felt a little padded and included some odd/unbelievable decision making from some characters and an ending that can sadly only be described as a bit lazy and pandering. The music as always is spectacular and brought me right back to what I loved about the series within seconds of booting up the game. Overall I would say this game is a success however and I really can't wait to see what's next for George and Nico. Hopefully a little less reliance on nostalgia but bring on Broken Sword 6! I'm ready!4/5			"

												Since I bought this game before both ""episodes"" were made, after completing the first part, I wasn't really happy. The story looked as something already seen in the series without anything new or fun to add. Being a huge fan of Broken Sword, I was sad for this seemed a lot like Broken Sword 4 to me all over again. Not that BS4 is bad, it's just an acquired taste...The ""episode 2"" or rather, second part of the game was to be released 1 month after I finished the first one and that looked as a long wait to me. In the end it came out nearly 3 months later... At this time the game had so much negative points that I was really contemplating whether to finish it or not. After deciding to give it another go owing it to the legendary predecessors, I found that the second part was brilliant. It definately made a game mediocre at best - awesome. The story developed and the puzzles and Georges witty dialogs gave the game the atmosphere and adventure it needed.For someone who can play from start to finish without the 3 month wait, I'm sure it will be a delight. To the BS fans who didn't get the chance to play it yet, I warmly recommend it.			"

												It's probably the second best Broken Sword game after the first one, tied in a way with the second one. It's also probably not a great adventure game for 2013, nor a proper evolution for the series and its characters.It is nice to have Nico and George back, personally I could never go through the 3D games in the series (even though I heard 3 is actually rather okay), dropping them pretty early on and Director's Cut of the first game actually made the game slightly worse due to rather weak additions that broke a very good pace of the original. But updated second game and rather promising start of these made me want to expect more. Yes, the art is sometimes crappy, all pre-rendered cutscenes look horrible due to very-very bad compression, but overall the style, the controls and the feel of the game Revolution were going for is great.But then comes a weird feeling that all excitement from the game comes only from the fact that Nico and George work so well together and some interesting religious themed mythology conspiracy is just a potentially good topic to explore, but... it's like that's what the entire game hangs on. Puzzles themselves are rarely ""what now"" or feel needlessly hard, but the NEED for those puzzles seems weird. You need to remove a roach that doesn't even try to hide, but instead of just crushing it and swiping remains under the table, you need to complete a puzzle and use 2 items to catch that roach, just so he would then hang in your inventory for most of the game to be used in a single puzzle, many events later, in a completely different part of the world. George is a collectathon enthusiast, sure, but why would he even consider doing something so complicated and pointless, when he's on a very tight schedule and things are quickly getting out of control? And that's what happens with quite a lot puzzles - they just feel forced in just to be puzzles, which feels old even compared to some classic adventure games. Making a puzzle easy doesn't make it less annoying that puzzle shouldn't even exist in the first place.And the story as well just feels like it has a lot of wasted potential. Writing is mostly good, a lot of jokes are funny and witty, but then there are some strangely outdated stereotypes as if straight from franco-belgian comic books like Tintin, or european adventure movies of mid-90s. It's never painfully bad, but just often unnecessary. Episodes also feel very strongly divided into ""this is the crime part"", ""this is the mythology mystery part"", wich just feels... wrong. Understandable for a game originally released in two parts but making you question if doing so, at least in this way, was a smart move.That said, it's still an enjoyable adventure for those, who loved the classic Broken Sword games. For those who didn't play those, though? I don't know if it's going to be a particularly interesting game, honestly.			"

												As a longstanding Broken Sword fan, I had been looking forward to this game for a long time. Visually, the backgrounds are a definite return to fantastic 2D form, even if the actual characters are somewhat incongruous. Still, I will give the game the credit it deserves and say it is aesthetically very pleasing.I've always played Broken Sword, however, for the script as much as anything, and I found the humour which I'd so enoyed in earlier games sadly flat, as well as a storyline which failed to truly engage. For that reason, I wouldn't recommend the game to those with good memories of the early games (particularly if, like me, you actually enjoyed BS3 and 4). Keep your positive memories of the series and skip this game.			"

The story is always fantastic, meaningful, the gameplay simple but provides a lot of fun to explore around the game and touch everything as I feel please. I've been waiting for the game ever since I heard it's coming back on iOS or Android, and finally decided to purchase this game on Steam. Worth every second and centimes playing the gamesWhy should you consider buying it?- Genuine and original story- Lots of fun jokes from the main characters- Beautiful design, using 2D classic backgrounds- Interesting puzzles, and great hinting systems in case the player got stuck- Last of all, the game has received lots of support from its long-time fans, Definitely a great gameTry it, and have fun, may you learn a lot of new things!

												Just ended it and was a good trip back in memories, thanks to the huge amount of quotations.The new plot is good too, as an old-school adventure through mysterious artifacts and ancient cults: not very original, but interesting.I believe that finding new subjects for this kind of games it's become harder since the ""conspiracies type"" has been exploited to the bone... So, the efforts to make an original game fitting with characters and storylines created nineteen years ago it's more than appreciable.PS= I'd like to deal with a spin-off adventure with young versions of Duane & Pearl Henderson.

												Broken Sword is back!  The Broken Sword games so far have seemed to follow the opersite rule to the Orginal Star Trek Movies with Broken Sword 1 and 3 being great and 2 and 4 being good but not as great as the the odd ones.  Well for 6 sake I hope the rule does not contine but I can say 5 keeps to it delivering a great game.  Classic Point and click style with a mix of hand drawn and computer generated many where worried about the art but the computer generated mixs in just fine and the graphic are just perfect, and the puzzels are adventure games at there best, was stumped a few times but if you do not want to just leave your brain to go over it there is a hinting system in the game and if you are used to adventure games the puzzels are just perfect level of a chanlenge but nothing to keep you stuck in one place, could do with something like Monkey Island 1 and 2 remastered where it shows you all items on screen as the few places I was stuck it was for not finding something I needed but apart from that just perfect.  With only 50% of the game out now I will redo this review once part 2 is out and I have finished that, but for now I only have two things I want, first for part 2 to come out NOW, and second for Revolution to do a kickstarter for there next game so I can give them more of my money to make something great with.  Beneath a Steal Sky 2 maybe?			"

												The fruits of a keystarter project from a year ago, I was glad to see this first chapter before the end of the year. The art is lovely, and the call back to previous games is perfect. Some of the audio at the start of the game is wonky, but it sorts itself out. It is extremely linear, and though I tried to meander, I completed it in 7 hours. Hopefully, the second chapter (delayed to incorporate stretch goal add-ons such as new locations) will be longer. As a fan, I enjoyed this. I would recommend playing at least the first 2 Broken Sword Games before picking this one up (which you can get at GOG).			"

												Been a fan of point and clickers for as long as I can remember and been a long time fan for BS. When I saw it out for sale, I couldnt resist. We are greeted by pretty new graphics, yet familiar faces and voices with a story that seems promising.If you are new to the series then I would suggest getting the triple pack of 123 together, however, if you are familiar with the series and want intrigue adventure and fun, well, so far, BS5 has the potential to 'deliver' but right now, it doesnt. The locations you visit are few, the puzzles are easy, straight forward, almost idiot proof (prompts and hints are too readily available too), humour is few and far between, or simply not funny and you only get a few hours worth of game play. Though we are promised a new chapter early in the new year, the first part of the game simply seems like a prolouge, does that mean after the next chapter they will start charging for the follow ons as DLC? BS5 promises a lot but has delivered very little... so far... all it has done is set out a mountain of promises and I really hope it doesnt break them.If you are a die hard fan, then you will likely jump on this game regardless, however, right now it isn't complete, feels far from it, feels unengaging and plays more like a Japanese animated novel where you simply click the screen repeatedly and make a few choices now and then, with that in mind, they may as well had turned the whole broken sword franchise into an animation, at least it would have removed the 'chore/bore' from the game. There are no random choices with consequence, no alternate ways to solve puzzles. Right now I hope it gets better, I will always hold broken sword with eager eyes to 'reinvigorate' the genre again, but with games such as 'The Walking Dead' out there, there will be many people disappointed with this game.If you are a die hard fan, look into it, they may pull something out of the hat yet, but if you are new to the series, AVOID AVOID AVOID play the first and second game then maybe follow on.P.S. hurry up and get BS4 on Steam already Valve!!

Still, if you're a fan you will probably enjoy the characters being reintroduced. It felt short. I understand that it was only half a game, but still. Short and easy.			"

												As a fan who enjoyed Broken Sword 1 & 2, I was looking forward to Broken Sword 5 going back to its point & click adventure roots.  I contributed to the Kickstarter and the result of that campaign was a great, albeit half-finished story.  The quality of the animation, sound, music, interface and backgrounds are fantastic.  During my play through, I encountered one crash that I was able to workaround after a quick read of the forums.  There are also some scenes where the character's lips don't move even though dialog is being spoken and I noticed one clipping issue where George walked right over the edge of a dumpster.   One choice the designer made was to force the characters to fast-travel to certain locations.  On one hand, it would have been the logical choice for the player anyway, but to me it felt like I was being rushed in order to keep the narrative going.   The plot is extremely linear and there is absolutely no opportunity to wander or simply explore the surroundings.  Despite these minor flaws, I do recommend the game and I'm looking forward to the finale.			"

												One of my favourite games series of all time! I'm so happy they went back to their roots and made it in 2D. very gripping story and the main characters (George and Nico) are very lovable. Some old character from previous Broken Sword games such as Laine, he was in the first one, he smashes your pot and you make him pass out in the Gleese Gallery. Inspector Moue makes another appearance, he was also in the first one who almost arrests you for blowing up the Cafe. Fleur the flower shop lady was also in the first who insists that he'll see George again and he does in this one. Also Lady Pieremont makes a brief appearance. I realise that a lot of familiar faces are in this game from previous games. which is awesome! seriously can't praise it enough. Plus the song Jasmine is a killer tune! definitely worth buying!			"

I am a big fan of the previous installments, but there were a few bugs at the final moments..which caused my game to crash. But I managed to find a way around that with the help of google. I'm sure they will fix the little problem. But it's safe to say that it's an inceredible point and click adventure and I can't wait for the next part.			"

												Having back this on Kickstater I thought it only fair to give it a review after having completed this (first part) of the game.First and foremost it is great to see the game go back to its original format, the background detail is fantastic with little tidbits thrown in there for you to spot and have a giggle over. The characters look awesome and the animation is brilliant, not to mention the voice acting and delivery of the script.There's no need to have played any of the other games as this stands alone with its own story which is engrossing enough to keep you wanting to find out what happens next. For old school players that did play the first 2 particularly there are lots of nostalgic references thrown around and characters that we know and love. For those that are being highly critical of the game I do admit the puzzle solving does seem to have gotten easier but wether that's by design or we have just got used to how revolution puts together puzzles is another thing. Though I played through with hints switched off there were plenty of verbal queues that helped lead you to the solution and I do feel that made things a tad too easy. On the flip side I think it helped the pacing of the game and story and I'm sure a lot of people would be thankful for not spending hours smashing your head against a wall trying to figure something out.I also agree that the game feels a little short but again I would have to go back to the originals which I know very well and play through without struggle for comparison to see just how long they were when you weren't wracking your brain trying to figure out how to get past a security gate. That said where the game currently leaves off for part 2 was satisfying in a ""next week on..."" kind of way.All in all do I think the game is worth its asking price? I think after the second part of the game is released it will be worth its weight in gold but I wouldn't let that deter you for purchasing now. The time I spent with game was enjoyable, funny and engaging and I expect the second half of the game to give me more of that with a satisfying conclusion. I would recommend this to any fan of point and click adventures or anyone wanting to try out their first one. If you like it go back and play the first 2 as well.			"

												If you played the other Broken Sword, I would recommend you to also play this one.Sadly, they have strayed away from what BS once was, and if you plan on playing this for the challenging game that Broken Sword once was, you should look elsewhere.It is easy, with perhaps one or two challeingng puzzles. The voice acting is really nice, good sfx, animations can at times feel a bit robotical, but the overall graphics and feel is great.But as said, if you want a old style puzzle game that really challenges you, you should just play the old games instead.

												The fruits of a keystarter project from a year ago, I was glad to see this first chapter before the end of the year. The art is lovely, and the call back to previous games is perfect. Some of the audio at the start of the game is wonky, but it sorts itself out. It is extremely linear, and though I tried to meander, I completed it in 7 hours. Hopefully, the second chapter (delayed to incorporate stretch goal add-ons such as new locations) will be longer. As a fan, I enjoyed this. I would recommend playing at least the first 2 Broken Sword Games before picking this one up (which you can get at GOG).			"

												Been a fan of point and clickers for as long as I can remember and been a long time fan for BS. When I saw it out for sale, I couldnt resist. We are greeted by pretty new graphics, yet familiar faces and voices with a story that seems promising.If you are new to the series then I would suggest getting the triple pack of 123 together, however, if you are familiar with the series and want intrigue adventure and fun, well, so far, BS5 has the potential to 'deliver' but right now, it doesnt. The locations you visit are few, the puzzles are easy, straight forward, almost idiot proof (prompts and hints are too readily available too), humour is few and far between, or simply not funny and you only get a few hours worth of game play. Though we are promised a new chapter early in the new year, the first part of the game simply seems like a prolouge, does that mean after the next chapter they will start charging for the follow ons as DLC? BS5 promises a lot but has delivered very little... so far... all it has done is set out a mountain of promises and I really hope it doesnt break them.If you are a die hard fan, then you will likely jump on this game regardless, however, right now it isn't complete, feels far from it, feels unengaging and plays more like a Japanese animated novel where you simply click the screen repeatedly and make a few choices now and then, with that in mind, they may as well had turned the whole broken sword franchise into an animation, at least it would have removed the 'chore/bore' from the game. There are no random choices with consequence, no alternate ways to solve puzzles. Right now I hope it gets better, I will always hold broken sword with eager eyes to 'reinvigorate' the genre again, but with games such as 'The Walking Dead' out there, there will be many people disappointed with this game.If you are a die hard fan, look into it, they may pull something out of the hat yet, but if you are new to the series, AVOID AVOID AVOID play the first and second game then maybe follow on.P.S. hurry up and get BS4 on Steam already Valve!!

Althpough not the best in the series (The first one for me is still the best) but extremely far from the worst (Angel of death). The puzzles are not too easy or too difficult with some of them require some out of the box thinking but all in all a very well made game and I cannot wait to get into the second half of the game.

My beloved broken sword was getting a thumbs down until I read that. Decent story, but the game itself seems easier than previous titles in this series. Still, if you're a fan you will probably enjoy the characters being reintroduced. It felt short. I understand that it was only half a game, but still. Short and easy.			"

												It's the adventure game equivalent of stale bread. It doesn't do anything special, the 3D art for the characters is considerably worse looking than the 2D ones from the much older games, the animations are slow and you have to wait for every animation to complete to do anything. The whole game is slow. I'm betting if you could skip the slow♥♥♥♥♥animations the game would be about 70% shorter and the game is not that long anyway.This game was released in two parts originally and I would have been severely disappointed if I bought it in two parts since all the interesting bits happen in the first episode while the second episode is just a big wrap up. I haven't bought it in two episodes but the game's pacing is still ♥♥♥♥ed because of the episodic format. There's no feeling of good sense of beginning, middle and end here, it's all just meandering in a shallow pool until we finish.The story is garbage, of course. Well they at least tried to do something decent but the excecution is flawed. The biggest problem is the plot chooses to kill the characters once it's done with them rather than giving them a satisfying closure which is just lazy writing. Besides, it's not special anymore when people are dropping like flies. The whole nostalgia aspect can get irritating as the game presents characters from the old games one by one each getting a speacial little scene for themselves but it's just fan service, there's no substance to it. It is a kickstarter based nostalgia bait, afterall.That's all that it is, 65 percent nostalgia-bait, 30 percent okay but not good enough to write home about adventure gaming. The last 5 percent is comprised of some good ideas being wasted because budget probably.PS: The game's auto save will actually save while you are in a puzzle and the game will bug out while you are in certain puzzles. So yes, the game will auto save on a bugged out puzzle and there's nothing you can do to fix that. Perfect.			"

												Broken Sword is back!  The Broken Sword games so far have seemed to follow the opersite rule to the Orginal Star Trek Movies with Broken Sword 1 and 3 being great and 2 and 4 being good but not as great as the the odd ones.  Well for 6 sake I hope the rule does not contine but I can say 5 keeps to it delivering a great game.  Classic Point and click style with a mix of hand drawn and computer generated many where worried about the art but the computer generated mixs in just fine and the graphic are just perfect, and the puzzels are adventure games at there best, was stumped a few times but if you do not want to just leave your brain to go over it there is a hinting system in the game and if you are used to adventure games the puzzels are just perfect level of a chanlenge but nothing to keep you stuck in one place, could do with something like Monkey Island 1 and 2 remastered where it shows you all items on screen as the few places I was stuck it was for not finding something I needed but apart from that just perfect.  With only 50% of the game out now I will redo this review once part 2 is out and I have finished that, but for now I only have two things I want, first for part 2 to come out NOW, and second for Revolution to do a kickstarter for there next game so I can give them more of my money to make something great with.  Beneath a Steal Sky 2 maybe?			"

The story is always fantastic, meaningful, the gameplay simple but provides a lot of fun to explore around the game and touch everything as I feel please. I've been waiting for the game ever since I heard it's coming back on iOS or Android, and finally decided to purchase this game on Steam. Worth every second and centimes playing the gamesWhy should you consider buying it?- Genuine and original story- Lots of fun jokes from the main characters- Beautiful design, using 2D classic backgrounds- Interesting puzzles, and great hinting systems in case the player got stuck- Last of all, the game has received lots of support from its long-time fans, Definitely a great gameTry it, and have fun, may you learn a lot of new things!

So, the efforts to make an original game fitting with characters and storylines created nineteen years ago it's more than appreciable.PS= I'd like to deal with a spin-off adventure with young versions of Duane & Pearl Henderson.

												I recommend it only for the hardcore fans of the series like myself who expected a new game for years. For everyone else who isn't struck by nostalgia I think that it's an average adventure game. The first half (episode 1) is at least mediocre, the story is so boring I forced myself to continue it, with easy puzzles, corny dialogue / jokes and hit 'n miss voice acting for most of the characters. The second half (episode 2) gets more interesting plot wise, it has more challenging puzzles and different locations to explore than the overdone good old Paris. Visually the game has beautiful hand drawn backgrounds but weird semi 3D character models which have plastic and clunky animations. Why not keep everything 2D? I dunno. Overall, it was a good fan service but nothing more.			"

												It's really difficult to recommend this game. On one hand it's an ok adventure that has it's moments but compared to Broken Sword 1+2, and even 3 its outright boring. Uninspired set pieces, uninteresting characters and the worst you have to wait so much time that George does anything. He always has to move to someone to speak with him. I would say out of my 12 hours playtime at least 4-6 hours are just watching George moving from A - B, doing some talking and then going back. This completey destroys the timing and sense of action you had with the former titles. There are also no real story highlights.What BS5 does reallly well is the hint system. It's starts with giving you vague clues and then reveals details after details. That's really great if you are stuck. I also like how some running gags from previous titles have been transfered to this one. It's an OK'ish game and if you have played the other BS titles you might enjoy this too. Otherwise I would everyone suggest to play number 1+2(essential), may the 3rd one too, but then you should look out for other great adventures on Steam and skip BS5.			"

The humour, puzzles, voice acting, suburb. I just bubble up with happiness each time I think about the series, and V has blown me away just as much as the previous. Still very true to its origins, looks beautiful, perfect. Great return for the duo and friend, Charlies Cecil! You made us classic fans have an excellent start to Christmas.			"

Moreover there's a lot of things which should probably look like a suprise. E.g. the scene was when George found a murder weapon. Of course he takes it to his hands like he wants to shoot and so no surprise that in that moment inspector suddenly appears with his squad without making any noise.

												I've played every Broken Sword game multiple times each, it is probably my favourite series to date. The second I heard this game was coming out I was so excited. However this is a very rough and a barebones game. It feels slightly rushed and lacking much depth.My First Criticism would be how easy it is. How is it easy? Well how linear it is - Yes of course all Broken Sword games have to be quite linear but this game had so few locations and choices. I must have visited the same gallery and cafe 6 or 7 times in the first 2 hours as the story kept bringing me back there instead of giving me more places around Paris to visit. In the old games I found myself visiting multiple places trying to solve the next riddle. However this game literally holds your hand the whole way. There are even moments in the game where you are brought straight to where you need to be and the character, be it Nico or George, would literally say okay I’m done here this is what I need to do next.Boring Characters – It’s great to see the old characters pop their face in but some new characters were just plain boring. I can’t even recall the detectives name I found him so boring and uninteresting. We get it, he’s incompetent but driving that same joke over and over doesn’t hold much weight.Overall I hoped for a lot more but this game just doesn’t have the depth I was hoping for. It’s quite boring at times and the characters hold little weight in the story.I would recommend it for people who want another adventure with George and Nico but for new comers I would suggest playing the older games. Disappointing but maybe this is a stepping stone for a better game and it was a bit of an experiment with Kickstarter.OHHH and what happened to the music? The old games had such great music!!! "

												I am a fan of the Broken Sword series ever since I was 10 and as such, I couldn't help feel very excited about the news of a fifth installment and of course I backed the kickstarter campaign. In this respect though, I am somewhat disappointed with the end product.My first gripe is, of course, that this is actually not the end product - this is supposed to be just half of it. If you're new to the franchise DO NOT buy this game until you've played BS 1,2, and 3 (I don't believe 4 is in Steam) - it is much, much, much more value for money.Of course, I read the update saying that there will be another episode in January (free for me, yay!), but when I saw that I have completed nearly half of the game, I thought that it was half of this episode - and it feels this way! this game is just so short, I was a bit dismayed even when I was thinking I did 1/4 of the story, not half of it! SPOILER ALLERT! BS5, as it is right now, is really just a murder investigation. I cannot help but compare it to the original Broken Sword, where the story just began as a murder investigation, but unfolded to be about much more! This time, it felt as if I was jumping down the rabbit whole... to find it painfuly shallow! I really hope that the second episode speeds up the pace and present and reveal more secrets for us to solve!Finally, I really hope that there will be more locations in the second episode - in this one there were only five locations for us to explore. Again, a comparison to the original Broken Sword does not make the Serpent's Curse look too good. I can only assume - and hope - that we will be given more than just Paris, Spain and the promissed in the kickstarter campaing Middle Eastern/North African location (these are a must, of course!).Finally, the reason I compare this game so much with the first one in the series is because the Serpent's Curse is made as mainly fan-service to the die-hard fans. 1 of the frequented locations in the game (that is, 20% of all of them) is an old one and a large portion of the characters are from the previous games. Nothing wrong with bringing old characters back, but the new ones are so few!As a conclusion, you'll see that it says on Steam that I'm recommending this game. While this is true, it applies only to people who have played the previous installments - it is, after all, a Broken Sword game and the story looks promissing, so I am having high hopes for the second episode. But if you've never played any of the previous games - please, do, before bying this one! The story stands alone, you are not going to miss anything - however BS5 just does not provide as much value for money.			"

												Very true to the first 2 broken sword games. Good old 2d hand drawn art, nice working control system and as always Georges sense of humour.First part took me 8 hours to complete, which did feel a bit quick, but the games price somewhat reflects this. None of the puzzles so far have been that hard. The most difficulty I had was turning pages in a book as the action button wasn't in any kind of logical place. Lets hope part 2 lasts a bit longer and gets a bit more puzzling!If you're a fan of the broken sword series, this is definitely one to buy! "

I never thought we get a 5th game out considering how average Angel of Death was, but all of a sudden due to the wave of classic PC games being brought back to public domain known as Kickstarter, eventually we finally got the Serpent's Curse.This is just the first half of the game and whilst some of the puzzles are easy to notice because there's a hint system that helps you... the story is so interesting that it draws you in, one of the charms of the series is the ability to tell a story and keeping you interested.I'll give a final view when part 2 is out in January			"

												Great point & click adventure. Great graphics, good voice acting, logical puzzles that generally aren't too difficult. I did notice a couple of graphics ""continuity errors"" that looked rather odd to have been missed during testing, and one time the game would consistently crash (in the flower shop) but I got around that by switching to windowed display instead of full-screen.Looking forward to part 2!

												Have been a fan of these games since the very first iteration, and while I was less than blown away by the third game, this one is a return to everything that made the first two so much fun to play. The hand-rendered backgrounds are here, Niko's weird accent/delivery, George Stobbart's wry, saucy quips, the mystery, the globetrotting, the puzzles that seem so ridiculously obscure only to prove insanely obvious once you figure them out (it helps that this time around you have the option to ask for hints if you get stuck), and the beauty of the world. Worth waiting for, and here's hoping it won't be the last we see of George & company.			"

												I had been eager to play this new Broken Sword adventure since I also played all episodes before. The games are well thought out and have a nice twist to them. As always Nico and George, our main heroes, still have this ""thing"" going on and it looks like the creators are turning up the furnace a notch regarding the possible romantic relations :)The puzzles are nice and there are also some weird achievements to score, all in all this game scores high on my best games played list, recommended if you like puzzles and a nice story line, it wont let you down...

												Ok to start off with so glad this game is back..Well with the game being new there are a few glitches where George stobbart can stand on the side of buildings as if he is floating but nothing to worry about as the game is still fun to play..The only problem I have is that it seems a bit too easy to play maybe its just me or that the second half is going to be a lot harder.. We I hope so as the first half was too easy.. The game play has been first class as always.. i love the classic graphics and mixing a bit of 3D that made George and the others look more real apart from their faces that took me back to the old classic broken sword that we all loveIf you are reading this and you have not got this game yet then don't read no more and get it NOW!!! PS: Get all the other broken swords as well....			"

												A kickstarted Broken Sword adventure that evokes the feeling of the first couple of games in the series quite well. Slow but deliberate in its pacing, dry but sharp in its wit, the story of Serpent's Curse does get more than a bit preposterous towards the end, but remains entertaining for the duration. Graphically and aurally pleasing with (mostly) well-designed puzzles, this one can be recommended for the fans of the series.			"

												Another great game in the Broken Sword series. This one gets back into 2D style, which is actually a huge step forward because the free movement style of the previous two games didn't work so well.Graphics is nice and colorful. Environments are attractive and detailed. All characters look great and their animations are smooth.While the soundtrack doesn't seem so memorable as the ones in the first two games, it still is very good and only adds to the atmosphere. Voice acting is absolutely perfect, as always.The story goes in the style of previous games. It includes all the things Broken Sword is known for - murder, mystery, conspiracy, supernatural elements and goats. The game's characters are well-written and every each of them feels special. You'll also meet some people from the past (previous games).There's a wide range of puzzles. Even though most puzzles aren't very hard to figure out, there are some that are rather challenging.Every point-and-click fan should get this game. And if you decide to give it a try, I recommend playing Broken Sword 1 and 2 first, so you can experience the original adventure and get to know the protagonists.			"

I love the music and the artistic attention to detail is amazing!The only negative point I will mention is the fact a number of characters' voice actors have changed which is a minor pain in the neck but overall I would 110% recommend this game to anyone.

												LAST PART FINALLY OUT!! When i first played this series it was by accident, i just found it on my Nintendo DS and i just loved it!The first game, i played it on my DS, the second and third on my PC , i can't find the fourth :'( and this is the lost one! I love it, the two protagonists are back,Nicole(Nico) and George, a parisian reporter and a californian dude that just met by accident at a crime scene in the first game and went on all kind of adventures to find clues, places and knowabouts the criminals and they kinda fell in love (they kissed at the end) but they just call in ""friends"" (i think they're more than that ;) ) and now i'm playing the last episode(episode 5) and everything is just as good as before,even better. The cartoony graphics of Paris and the voices are just perfect and they go together just as perfect. if you ask me i give this game and series a 10/10 for being my favourite point&click adventure game of all time, by all it has to offer, the puzzles not being that kind of puzzles that are impossible to solve, and if you get stuck you have infinite very useful hints that get you out of trouble. I love this game and series and even tough this is supposed to be the last game i hope there's more to come and as i said i give this game 10/10, worth every coin!			"

												This is a very excellent half (or so) of a game. The fact that it ends at what isn't quite the climax, leaving the need for, rather than room for, a sequel, is why I say it's half of a game, but a good half it is. Great voice acting, story pacing, puzzles, and a novel approach to bringing the original art style in line with modern graphics makes me want to play another 7 or more hours of this game, even though it's over too soon.

												For those of you who have grown up with the Broken Sword franchise, this game delivers to the original games dynamics. Gone are the 3D worlds and characters of Broken Sword 4 which unfortunately did not live up to its predecesors, this game goes back to it's original roots with 2D graphics but much more vibrant colour pallette. The game can suffer for some puzzles which were intended to be hard to solve but were more of an annoyance than anything else, however the story is just as unique and egaging as any other Broken Sword game and hopefully the second chapter to this two part series delivers the same the with more involving and challenging puzzles.

												[Part 1 Review]Please remember that this is just the first part of the game, the second part will come out later on ETA January 2014.Note on the game page: ""The game will be released in two Episodes with Episode 1 releasing on 4th December. Episode 2 will be delivered as a free update to Episode 1 in Q1 2014.""The main menu UI feels stiff (there's plenty of room for polish here), but the game itself should be familiar to adventure gamers out there.The graphics is gorgeous, a mix of 3D characters with 2D painted background. Feels like playing an animated interactive movie.Voice acting is top-notch as in every other ""Broken Sword"" game, and there will be plenty of familiar characters in this one too.The story is as you can expect from a ""Broken Sword"" game, there will be plenty of secret society stuffs and magical artifacts.Can't wait to play the 2nd part of the game and will update this review until then.[Part 2 Review]Somehow part 2 felt short. Wished that they had include more alternative solutions to move forward with the story. Some of the solutions some times a bit too hard to guess.Also there is a part of the game where you can get stuck, and you can't rely on the autosave to restore. Beware of that.In the end, this is just another adventure game with its usual linear branch. I wish they do more branching and do things similar to Indy 4 adventure game.			"

That being said even though I didn't feel like I rushed it, I still finished it off a little too quickly, even with hints turned off.From playing the earlier Broken Swords I can't help but think that either they had more content or the puzzles were just harder. Quite often the game restricts where you can travel as a way of helping you progress. I understand that it’s not fun to travel all around the map looking for that item you need to progress. I do think though there is a balance between puzzle difficulty and trying to prevent players getting bored. BS5 seems to be too far on the side of trying to stop you getting bored, perhaps a  difficulty system would have been a good idea.			"

												It is the same good old Broken Sword magic that I remember so fondly - the voice actors return yet again to reassure returning players that this is NOT an immitation and continue to entertain us for +/- 16 enjoyable hours.Does not have a ""show location"" for items if you are interested in such things, it does however have a very useful hint system which nudges you in the right direction, should you need it.

												Its good with a but. The new/old art direction style is good. Would have been nice if they could have got some mouth syncing going on but not the end of the world.Never really felt any immediate threat of Danger, and I wasn't aware of any scenes in the game were I could have died, e.g. like the most of the other Broken Swords, there is some scenes if you don't complete it correctly you die.Story is very good, inclusion of old characters are a nice touch, and I can't wait until the second part. The but for me though is the shortness of the first part, took me <6 hours...I suppose if I was to compare to other recent point and click games, e.g Walking Dead, each of those took me less than 2 hours, so if the 2nd part is equally as long, it will be equally as long as these.I guess like the Walking Dead games you can't really judge the game until you have the whole			"

												Big fan of the first two, and strong supporter of the kickstarter game. Couple of things with I am dissapointed with however - the repeat locations become very frustrating, and the first part of it (0-50%) is far too short. Just as I thought the game was kicking off properly the credits roll. Apart from these minor set backs the story is in depth and invigorating, the matte backgrounds are beautiful and the updated 3D character animations and the voice acting (as always, particularly George) are enough on their own to draw you in. A must have game for any adventure lover - I look forward to playing the second half..under the assumption I will not be charged extra to do so.			"

												Certainly the best Broken Sword game so far, and one I can easily recommend--although with some reservations.Despite loving adventure games, I can say I've never really been a big fan of the Broken Sword Series, the first one was alright, but due to the similar subject matter felt a lot like the third Gabriel Knight game, but with worse puzzles and less charasmatic leads.  The second Broken Sword game makes my list of worst adventure games, and the third was fun enough, but its pleasure came in the unusual platforming and stealth areas at which other games have done much better.  So it was that I never really jumped at buying this one.That turns out to be a mistake.  First of all The Serpent's Curse is gorgeous.  I didn't mind a bunch of simple puzzles that did little other than waste my time in the first act, just because I loved seeing every environment.  So much attention to detail in the art too I loved the inside of Bijoux's apartment for instance, which caught her personality even better than her dialogue did.In the second act the puzzles improve quite a bit.  It does in that act include one puzzle they should have axed involving a cockroach that is on the level of the cat hair mustache in GB3 or the inflatable duck to get the railway key in Longest Journey.  However, that excepted, Act 2 has a very nice assortment of puzzles including some particularly memorable ones in which you must decode a map and decipher a hieroglyphic language.  The plot is fairly interesting throughout, if a bit safe.  It goes exactly the way you'd expect and never really explores new territory, but that is okay if it's a story you don't mind hearing again.  And it is one which allows the artists to dazzle you.  Also on the negative side is a number of tiresome comic relief characters and an uninspiring will-they-won't-they dynamic between the leads.  Especially considering they have before.I must agree with reviewers that you control George too much and Nico not enough.  There really should have been more balance here and in one place where you DO control Nico, it makes little sense.  There is a scene in which George and Nico must pose as insurance investigators.  George is an insurance investigator in his daily life, yet Nico--who is a reporter--takes the lead? Later, or possibly right before that scene, George interrogates a man who has come to see Nico because of a report she wrote on a robbery--wouldn't it make more sense for Nico--the reporter--to have conducted that interview?  It is bizarre.  And then, of course, there are numerous scenes throughout where it wouldn't matter which character you control except that it is almost always George.  Ah well.  I suppose it is a little thing really.Buy this for the art and the puzzles in the second act.  There is also a story and some characters, those shouldn't annoy you enough to keep you from enjoying it.			"

												Beneath A Steel Sky (by the same developers) was the first point & click adventure game I played and a few years later, Broken Sword completely blew me away. The music, the atmosphere, the story, the characters, the many exotic locations - it all came together to form a near perfect experience. Since Broken Sword III, however, Revolution kind of lost their way - 3D action adventure games that were painful to control with mediocre stories and uninspired locations.Broken Sword 5, however, was their chance to go back to what made the original so great: hand drawn 2D backgrounds, classic mouse interface, exploring Paris, etc. I was one of the first to back the game on Kickstarter because this was exactly what I had been wanting for 15 years! The question of course remains ... did they succeed? And the answer has to be ... yes and no.As an adventure game it's great - the puzzles are interesting but never too hard (perhaps slightly too easy for a seasoned gamer though) and the story is definitely engaging. The backgrounds are beautifully painted as well and I really enjoyed exploring and revealing parts of the puzzle. The game has some solid new characters to encounter as well and many old characters make an appearance - even minor ones.However, there are some (minor) negatives:- some of the original voice actors are missing which is a shame. Moue and Mrs Piermont both had very recognisable voices but have sadly been replaced. I don't know the reasons why but the new voice actors aren't quite as good (or as memorable anyway).- the music feels a little too generic to my tastes. The original had a masterful approach with the right music playing at the right time creating this amazing atmosphere. In BS5, the music is still similar in style but lacks the soul and doesn't come in at the right time either. They could have tuned this way better- the 3D characters are no match for the well drawn 2D sprites of old. I know it's a LOT cheaper this way but the animation could have been a great deal better at least. Half the time, the animations look stilted while BS1, a 20 year old game (!!) had animations that still look fresh and fluent today.- the locations aren't quite as interesting as those in the original Broken Sword game (which sent you all over the world).These negatives aren't that important though - this is coming from a die-hard Broken Sword fan so it might not even bother you at all. All in all, this is a very solid game which is head and shoulders above BS3 & BS4. I'd say it's on par with BS2 (which was a little rushed and had a much smaller budget) which is not a bad thing because BS2 was still an amazing game.			"

												This game was long overdue, but it was worth the wait. It plays out much like the first two Broken Swords (thankfully), turning back to it's 2d roots. I bought a physical boxed collector's edition for £33, and it was certainly worth the money, so you can't go wrong with the pricing on Steam (especially during sale time).There were a few points in the game where I thought the puzzles were a bit stupid, I wont ruin it for you though, but some expected a bit too much. Thankfully, the game has a built in hint system so if you do get stuck it wont be for long. I did use it once or twice, but it did feel a bit like cheating. When you get to these puzzles, chances are you will too, trust me ;).The game still contains the charm and catchy music (JASMINE DO DO DO DO DO DO DO DO DOOO), and of course the scenic locations. All of the characters are very likeable, and the goat does make a return (not a spoiler as the b*****d is in the picture reel above!). The story is great, which ties to religious history, who would of guessed it?!.Lets make an agreement to call this game Broken Sword 3, and forget about the last two.9/10.			"

												What can I say? I replayed the first two BS not long ago in a thrust of nostalgia and I couldn't resist being seduced by the look of BS 5. No disappointment here, it has been like a trip back to my early teens when playing such adventure games (BS, Longest Journey, Monkey Island...) were like truly transporting yourself into a parallel world for a few hours. And you never wanted it to end...Nicely rendered characters in gorgeous 2D frames, long-lost witty dialogues found again, reasonably difficult puzzles and chains of choices to achieve certain objectives... I cannot recommed playing BS 5 enough to any ""stick-in-the-mud"" gamer out there; but I especially recommend it to those who didn't grow up with the compelling magic of early computer games. They ought to know what they missed!Nailed it Charles! Glad this Kickstarter's made it through!			"

												This one is another solid entry into the Broken Sword Series. It suffers a little bit from being split into two parts. Imagine a sequel took place immediately after the original with many but not all of the cast returning. A bit disjointed, right?It is far better than Broken Sword 3 &4. It suffers a bit in comparison to Broken Sword 1 for reasons that aren't really the developers fault. In the original Broken Sword, you were a tourist. So when odd things started happening, it was never quite clear just how far down the rabbit hole you were going to go. On the other hand, when Broken Sword 5 rolled around and introduced George Stobbard as an insurance salesman, my immediate reaction was ""yeah, right"" so some of the magical discovery was gone. For the same reason, the instant I saw the spoiler, I began perusing it for clues and was not the least bit surprised when a character later told me the spoiler had clues in it.But do not let these nipicks steer you away from a solid adventure game			"

												If your a fan of the Broken Sword series, then of course play this game!If not? Then in this gaming market where something like 90% of games are shooters of some sort and the other 10% is racers. Then its really a nice change of pace to go back to an old school point and click. It's more relaxed but thats not to say its not fun or challenging, in fact there was a couple of puzzles I admit I had to look up. However its not the best of the series, lets be honest how often is the sequel better than the original? There is some rather dumb points, such as picking up the possible murder weapon?! But don't let this put you off, its still an enjoyable game with a lot of nods to the original game, which you don't need to have played to enjoy this but personally I would really recommend giving that game a go, I ended up buying again, for my phone, its got some extended moments and was really great to relive a childhood favourite game.

												The game's is an extremely mixed bag.The premise is good and the game starts interestingly enough with simple and standard puzzles, but as soon as a plethora of cameos and easter eggs come up, the gameplay loosens and the plot falls apart under convenient resolutions for the sake of ""member this?"" nostalgia tripping. Moue is a one of the victims of said capitalizing that tasty and effortless nostalgia's value. Puzzles are very uneven. There're some clever ones, like deciphering the Tabula (could use a better UI for this one, though...) or the old telegram (there's some wasted potential here, since the base word is way too obvious to guess - and it basically solves the whole puzzle), but most of they are way too illogical or simply ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The cockroach+paperclip=fixed fuse is just stupid, but making the player to type an answer with a God damned typo (Bassam's shop), only to see it properly spelled in the background after finishing it is just going overboard. Getting a correct answer is not enought, you need to make a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ typo to solve this puzzle, only to... see it properly spelled afterwards. At this point I was on the edge of dumping the game. Pointless and time consuming (I had to see the playthrough and the correct answer literally got me shaking). Not to mention that it's a bollywood reference and has little to do with the location's context (edit: turns out, Bassam looks a lot like a male lead from the movie, though). And yes, you can't simply crush the cockroach, because it's the most convenient resolution for an obscure problem only 5 hours later in the game, in Spain (you find it in Paris). Meanwhile, you will carry it even to the Russian gangster's mansion - to London.The 2D backgrounds are pretty and give that classic BS vibe, but awful 3D models do their best to ruin them. Why aren't they also in 2D?The game got on my nerves many times with its puzzles and shattering narrative. Most of newly introduced characters are simply killed off conveniently after being exploited by the plot and they don't even make sense. The murder investigation in Paris and George being a main suspect are also dropped off without a reason and it's not even concluded at the end (which is obviously rushed). But the overall experience was satisfying enough and the good overweight the bad - barely.			"

												George and Nico are back in a game that is much remanisant of the orginal two. I like to ignore games 3 and 4 as much as possible and so it is a welcme relief to play a game that is true to the games origins.Having grown up in the late 80s and early 90s point and click adventures stay close to my heart and this game does not fail to live up to the memories of old. If you are looking for a fun puzzle adventure then look no further. If you have never played the originals (shame on you!) then this game is as good as a stand-alone as it is as part of the francise.			"

												Even if it brought up some nostalgia, this game was strong in the beginning, and disappointing in the end. The riddles were not that logical sometimes, and the object combination, on the other hand, was pretty easy. I needed to play this game to complete this awesome series. But I must admit that, besides the nice vintage graphics, neither the storyline nor the game situations were particularly entertaining. Nonetheless, I will strongly advise to buy and play this game if you've been a fan of the series since your childhood as I have.			"

												Broken Sword 5 is a classic old-school point&click adventure. It is the 5th part of a series with ups and downs and it is definitly not one of the downs.Obviously some people learned their lesson after Broken sword 3 which always seemed like a very weak action adventure in some parts but still had a decent story and Broken Sword 4 which was clearly one of the worst adventure games I ever played. Broken Sword 5 is obviously ""back to the roots"". No more crate puzzles, no more running aroud using your keyboard with messed up controls to escape someone you can't even see properly because of the bad camera position... Just simple and plain point&click!The story is clearly told and makes some sense (to be honest I didn't understand all the twists of Broken Sword 4 and it had some logical flaws, so this is a point I realy appreciated) although of course it has some mystical components (this is a Broken Sword game, after all).You will meet some old faces, of course. I don't think I will spoil all too much if I say that Pearl and Douane have their appereance and, other than Douanes appereance in Broken Sword 4, this appereance isn't utterly nonesense.The graphics are beautiful. The music is good enough. The german dialogues were mostly well translated.Any cons?Well, the solutions to some of the puzzles are a little bit stupid. And I hated the one music puzzle. But fortunately, they re-inserted the hint function which gives cummulative hints until you get the solution, so you won't ever need to watch a walkthrough and spoil your fun (because most people will rely on a walktrough once they have googled it).Recommendation? Yes!			"

												I just managed to complete the game, and the direction the game was taking toward the end of the game left me mostly dissatisfied. I think that this is a fantastic puzzler, and a great U-turn back toward what makes (made?) the Broken Sword series so good back in the day. However, when coming toward the final act of part two (roughly 80% into the game) you are faced with an extremely taxing puzzle that slows the pacing of the game down to a crawl. Upon completing this puzzle you are then faced with a situation where your antagonist miraculously knows off-hand all the information that you just toiled away to figure out, from the remains of a person who (literally) took the secret information to his grave. This scenario had me so irate that I began to pay attention to the flaws in the game: the way that characters turn their entire morality upside-down with little effort, the lacklustre voice acting from the supporting cast, the crutch of returning characters from the first two games in the series that the game leaned upon the entire time, and finally the extremely anti-climactic ending that isn't without its fair helping of cheese.I feel that Part one is fantastic: the puzzles are exciting and the pacing of the story is well maintained. I only felt aggrieved toward the end when the dialogue practically vomited out all the loose ends that needed to be resolved in Part 2 (back when this title was split) like a cat regurgitating hairballs. It was poor writing and it left a bad taste in my mouth. Part 2 felt very rushed in comparison; I'm not sure what deadline the team were under, but the story was leaping from location to location at an uncomfortable pace and the puzzles became less about solving riddles and using logic and more of the classic point-and-click trope of ""try combining all your items in your inventory and see what♥♥♥♥♥♥sticks this time"".Despite all that I will recommend this game to lovers of the point-and-click adventure genre. It has its great moments, but is let down by the pacing and disappointing conclusion. At times it really does remind you that it is a Broken Sword game, but when you try and compare it to the original and its first sequel, it sadly falls by the wayside. Broken Sword 5 takes bronze in the series.			"

												Definitely enjoyed this like other Broken Sword games.  Great art, voice acting, etc.Story is good and takes you all over the place.Puzzles were on the easy side (except for maybe 1 or 2.)The biggest dissappointment for me was the supreme lack of cutscenes.  For such art that is well done, this was greatly missed.  There are a few key places with cinematics but for the most part there are far too many ""A few minutes later"" scenes.  I'm guessing this is related to funding but I wouldn't have thought it would have impacted the game that much.			"

												This is literally the best point and click adventure to come out in years. The puzzles are clever, the characters are charming, the artwork is beautiful and it has exceptional voice acting to boot.It was very rare that i was presented with a solution where i couldnt work out what i had to do without applying a little brain power. No situations where the solution made no sense (as can so often be the case with games of this type). Ive not enjoyed a point and click adventure so much since i last played Grim Fandango. Its definitely one of the greats.			"

												Not sure why so many people hate on this instalment. This makes up for the trainwreck that is Angel of Death many times over; could go on and on about that tripe. I have few criticisms about this one and so many good things to say:The long-missed composer from the first game is back, all the characters are distinctive and have something to like about them, the artwork is the best i've seen in a point and click, the plot is the most interesting since the first game, the difficulty was just right and the puzzles were mostly intuitive.If I had to criticize, I'd say that the 3D models looked out of place a good bit of the time and a couple of puzzles went a bit too far.

												This is probably the best Broken Sword game of them all. There was never a dull moment and it was full of references to past Broken Sword games. I think the best part was the puzzles, which were enjoyable and very doable. Unlike some puzzles from past games, I actually wanted to figure it out on my own instead of using hints or walkthroughs. The visuals were absolutely stunning (and I thought BS4 looked good!). Everything else is as you would expect from Broken Sword. Overall, it was very similar to the first two games, so if you liked those then you'll definitely like this one as well. If you skipped 3 and 4 however, I would recommend playing those before this one to get the ultimate Broken Sword experience. Hopefully this won't be the end of the series but if it is, I can't imagine a better way to end it.			"

												At the end of the first half of this game, I was moved. I had finally gotten the next installment of my favourite franchise and it ended on an amazing high, I was happy to wait for part 2....till it happened. The second half, for want of a better word....bombed. All logic dropped quickly, we were whisked from place to place with no real engagement with the reasons for the excursions. The clues to each puzzle were just non-existant after the first half. More annoyingly this game was ruined by the Kickstarter voice actors and non-stop references to the first games in the francise; you know the part with a goat? HAVE ALL THE GOATS!!			"

It's becomming harder the further in the story you get, but even if you are bad at this game, the ansvers is up in your cornor, where you can get hints, and the more hints you ask for on the problem, the more precise is the hint, and the last one gives you the answer.I can only recomend it, if you like adventures. I wont recomend it if you look after an Triple A title.The voice acting is decent but not great, and the artstyle might not be every ones taste.But over all i loved the game, and i had about 8 hours of fun. can be done in less time, but i tryed to figure the pusles out my self.

												Haven't played the series. Bought this at a discounted price and decided to give it a shot. Overall , I would recommend this game but if only it is discounted  . It provides a solid 13 hours entertainment :) The things that I liked about the gameGreat Artwork - You just got to love the background 2D art. A lot of attention to detail. Kudos to the team. Also I love the character models , they were nicely done Decent storyline - To be honest the storyline isn't bad at all. I had to google up and it made to learn about culure and all.  i have  noticed a lot of people here commented that the script is nowhere close to the first series [which i think i should pick up and play]Tutorial and Hints System - It just makes it easier for people who are new to this genre and for those who are stuck at some puzzle (like myself). The Hint system is just amazing , I like the way how it is designed. It gives you more clues  untill you hit the final clue where it gives you the solution. Ideal for the puzzles that you are stucked (which I faced a lot)Things that I didn't like Alternative Path - As someone suggested in the comments , they should have given an alternative path. At times you were given an option to tell the truth or lie , if you have picked one or another , the consequences would be different and the game outcome would have been different. It would have given another reason for people to replay and experience the story differently Chracter Development - I find it too bland , Nico and George had great potential. I just feel that it was missing some depth..well not depth..just something isn't right  "

												The first Broken Sword and its first sequel remain among my favourite point-and-click adventure games. (Remember to check the Director's Cut versions of those games!) #3 and #4 changed the art style (to 3D) and lost some of the magic in the process, although those aren't bad games either. After that, it took a long, long time for the fifth game (back to gorgeous 2D) to come out. Based on the middling reviews, I wasn't expecting much. Luckily I was pleasantly surprised.The new 2D art is beautiful. More importantly, the opening scenes in Paris re-capture the atmosphere of the early games. The characters - George and Nico et al - remain the same, love'em or hate'em. The game feels stuck in the past. That is not ENTIRELY a bad thing. However, it means that the interface is clunky; inventory is messy; puzzles can be obtuse; there's even a goat puzzle involved (!). Luckily there's a VERY useful hint system incorporated. Whenever I got stuck (every 30 minutes or so), all I had to do was to click the ""hint"" button.If you don't like old-school adventure games, this game is probably not for you. If you have no prior experience with the series, many of the inside references and jokes will be lost on you. And you should really start with the first game. That one's a better game. But this one FEELS right, like an authentic Broken Sword game - even down to replicating the flaws and quirks of the original. For nostalgic fans of the series, especially of the first two games, this one is a worthy sequel. Rating: 8/10			"

												I am a fan of the original series, and in a way this game brings me back to them... but I have one huge issue with it: it's terribly SLOW. The dialogues, the never-ending walking, it really demotivates me to keep playing. I'm not sure if this was done on purpose to elongate the game a little more, but it makes for a tiresome experience. Having said that, it's nice to see a traditional graphic adventure. It just needed one or two more tweaks.			"

												I played every Broken Sword game and really enjoyed the first two, this however did not live up to my expectations. Episode One was kind of okay but Episode 2 was a travesty. The puzzles towards the end made no real sense and I could never have solved them without the hints. The ending was also a bit underwhelming. Overall, not a great game.			"

												Broken Sword 5 is a great game, full of that nostalgia that we, gamers from the 90s, eager to see again nowadays. I'm not a nostalgia guy, but sometimes I want to live those experiences again, but with new games. Because of that, I strongly recommend Broken Sword 5: The Serpent's Curse, specially if you enjoy great dialogues, mysterious plots and doing some detective work, while using your brain to solve some puzzles. It's not perfect, but it sure is great.			"

												At the end of the first half of this game, I was moved. I had finally gotten the next installment of my favourite franchise and it ended on an amazing high, I was happy to wait for part 2....till it happened. The second half, for want of a better word....bombed. All logic dropped quickly, we were whisked from place to place with no real engagement with the reasons for the excursions. The clues to each puzzle were just non-existant after the first half. More annoyingly this game was ruined by the Kickstarter voice actors and non-stop references to the first games in the francise; you know the part with a goat? HAVE ALL THE GOATS!!			"

												This game have an compelling story, in short it is about a murder, that ends up being about the gnostisk. The game is chalengin in just the right amount. It's becomming harder the further in the story you get, but even if you are bad at this game, the ansvers is up in your cornor, where you can get hints, and the more hints you ask for on the problem, the more precise is the hint, and the last one gives you the answer.I can only recomend it, if you like adventures. I wont recomend it if you look after an Triple A title.The voice acting is decent but not great, and the artstyle might not be every ones taste.But over all i loved the game, and i had about 8 hours of fun. can be done in less time, but i tryed to figure the pusles out my self.

												Haven't played the series. Bought this at a discounted price and decided to give it a shot. Overall , I would recommend this game but if only it is discounted  . It provides a solid 13 hours entertainment :) The things that I liked about the gameGreat Artwork - You just got to love the background 2D art. A lot of attention to detail. Kudos to the team. Also I love the character models , they were nicely done Decent storyline - To be honest the storyline isn't bad at all. I had to google up and it made to learn about culure and all.  i have  noticed a lot of people here commented that the script is nowhere close to the first series [which i think i should pick up and play]Tutorial and Hints System - It just makes it easier for people who are new to this genre and for those who are stuck at some puzzle (like myself). The Hint system is just amazing , I like the way how it is designed. It gives you more clues  untill you hit the final clue where it gives you the solution. Ideal for the puzzles that you are stucked (which I faced a lot)Things that I didn't like Alternative Path - As someone suggested in the comments , they should have given an alternative path. At times you were given an option to tell the truth or lie , if you have picked one or another , the consequences would be different and the game outcome would have been different. It would have given another reason for people to replay and experience the story differently Chracter Development - I find it too bland , Nico and George had great potential. I just feel that it was missing some depth..well not depth..just something isn't right  "

												Beneath A Steel Sky (by the same developers) was the first point & click adventure game I played and a few years later, Broken Sword completely blew me away. The music, the atmosphere, the story, the characters, the many exotic locations - it all came together to form a near perfect experience. Since Broken Sword III, however, Revolution kind of lost their way - 3D action adventure games that were painful to control with mediocre stories and uninspired locations.Broken Sword 5, however, was their chance to go back to what made the original so great: hand drawn 2D backgrounds, classic mouse interface, exploring Paris, etc. I was one of the first to back the game on Kickstarter because this was exactly what I had been wanting for 15 years! The question of course remains ... did they succeed? And the answer has to be ... yes and no.As an adventure game it's great - the puzzles are interesting but never too hard (perhaps slightly too easy for a seasoned gamer though) and the story is definitely engaging. The backgrounds are beautifully painted as well and I really enjoyed exploring and revealing parts of the puzzle. The game has some solid new characters to encounter as well and many old characters make an appearance - even minor ones.However, there are some (minor) negatives:- some of the original voice actors are missing which is a shame. Moue and Mrs Piermont both had very recognisable voices but have sadly been replaced. I don't know the reasons why but the new voice actors aren't quite as good (or as memorable anyway).- the music feels a little too generic to my tastes. The original had a masterful approach with the right music playing at the right time creating this amazing atmosphere. In BS5, the music is still similar in style but lacks the soul and doesn't come in at the right time either. They could have tuned this way better- the 3D characters are no match for the well drawn 2D sprites of old. I know it's a LOT cheaper this way but the animation could have been a great deal better at least. Half the time, the animations look stilted while BS1, a 20 year old game (!!) had animations that still look fresh and fluent today.- the locations aren't quite as interesting as those in the original Broken Sword game (which sent you all over the world).These negatives aren't that important though - this is coming from a die-hard Broken Sword fan so it might not even bother you at all. All in all, this is a very solid game which is head and shoulders above BS3 & BS4. I'd say it's on par with BS2 (which was a little rushed and had a much smaller budget) which is not a bad thing because BS2 was still an amazing game.			"

												Mostly a great point-and-click adventure game, with interesting lore (although for my tastes personally, I would have liked more lore to be available in game). Hints were well written, so you can get a very general suggestion or a walkthrough depending on your preference. I would have liked to play as Nico for more of the game.**SPOILERS**My favorite puzzle was the translation of the runes on the tabula. Great design.I hated the very end, after they got out of the cave. Killing Donna was just mean, and a mood-killer, and wasn't funny. I would have liked it quite a bit if it had just ended with them being on top of the mountain after Eva left.			"

												I was one of the backers for this game, and absolutely was not disappointed!Broken Sword 5 goes back to the same type of style as 1 and 2, and even allows you to have the classic subtitles and UI, which is a bonus. The art in this game is gorgeous, and George's voice actor returns for another great performance. The game responds very well, which is good for a point & click adventure, I've never had it hang or crash on me either. The game has an autosave feature, too!The game does a great job of keeping you hooked in the story with all the twists and turns. Just when you and George think you got things figured out - it's not quite what it seems! A fantastic adventure with a very satisfying ending. Hope Revolution will keep this series going, because they've found their footing again for sure!One tiny little thing, however, is that I don't believe you can actually die in this. Whilst there was a lot of dangerous shenanigans going on, it's impossible to get yourself hurt - which is slightly disappointing as death was a very real danger in previous games of the series. Of course, Broken Sword is no Sierra game - deaths were few and far in between in the series, but it was definitely a missed feature in this game.Let it be known that Broken Sword 5 is a great example of a success Kickstarter project!

												Everything I say here is just my opinion, please read around and get a full perspective.I love the Broken Sword series, specifically 1 and 2, and then 5. For some reason 3 and 4 went out of the point click genre and onto something else which wasn’t very favorable. So Broken Sword 5 and the expansion returns to the original Point-Click Adventure concept that we all love, a great bonus in the gaming direction. As always I felt like the main characters were very profound and fun to use. I liked the chemistry and the interesting backstory. Even if you’ve never played 1 and 2, you can easily pick up 5 and play it from beginning to end (that’s actually how I got into the series). What struck me at first glance was the beautiful graphics, great sound track and really interesting puzzles and scenes. Nothing was overly hard or complicated in this title, but it seldomly has to be. In my opinion Point-Click Adventures are most enjoyable when they convey a narrative and tell a story over entrapping the player in thick logical puzzles. If you as a gamer love to slave over complex or detailed puzzles, you might find this a bit lacking. The story itself was deep and it brought some interesting subliminal messages across. I really liked how things were conveyed and often I felt as if I was watching a movie or reading a really good book. The side characters were allot of fun and I wish they had a tad more depth or detail to them. The original Broken Sword 5 was over a bit too soon, however with the expansion it seemed to add that extra bit that made the game sit just right. I wished I got more of it, I really enjoyed what I did get and I hope that any future installments have a longer game play time.I’m not too sure what else to like or dislike about the title, it stayed very true to its original origin of a Point-Click Adventure, and more so to being a slightly “investigator” like game. I wholeheartedly enjoyed this game and would have no problems recommending it to anyone who loves a good story and wants to be immersed in a unique but realistically seeming universe.			"

												Sure, from a technical point of view, Broken Sword 5 is not great. Animations are wooden, dialogue is delivered flatly and the whole thing sometimes feels painstakingly slow. That said, the game has a certain quality and charm - it can be witty, the character interactions can be charming and the puzzles are good ol' fashioned fun. It's no Monkey Island in terms of polish, but I didn't find it a waste of time at all and gladly finished the game.			"

												True to the feeling of BS and close to the first-second ones. However it is still pretty linear, the fact that it was released in 2 parts creates sort-of 2 stories, and the role of Nicko in the game feels redundant . The end of the story seems sloppy and hasty, however the rest of the story is intriguing. Puzzles are quite easy while the 2 last puzzles are at a satisfactory medium-level difficulty. The existnce of Hints completely breaks motivation and its addittion to the game seems wrong. Overall a nice game, nice story, beautiful art, classic BS style. It has several issues but definitely not the worst game of the series.			"

												If your a fan of the Broken Sword series, then of course play this game!If not? Then in this gaming market where something like 90% of games are shooters of some sort and the other 10% is racers. Then its really a nice change of pace to go back to an old school point and click. It's more relaxed but thats not to say its not fun or challenging, in fact there was a couple of puzzles I admit I had to look up. However its not the best of the series, lets be honest how often is the sequel better than the original? There is some rather dumb points, such as picking up the possible murder weapon?! But don't let this put you off, its still an enjoyable game with a lot of nods to the original game, which you don't need to have played to enjoy this but personally I would really recommend giving that game a go, I ended up buying again, for my phone, its got some extended moments and was really great to relive a childhood favourite game.

												What can I say about a franchise I hold dear to my heart. 1 and 2 are my favourites and I wished they kept the art style and point and click for 3 and 4 but they moved on to 3D which didn't truly suit this type of game. But 5 really brought back the feel of Broken Sword, not sure it tops 2 but it's close. There is 1 puzzle which i honestly just could not get my head around it and most people won't which is ashame, they need to add more puzzles which are more logic or common sense than some of there more biazzare one's.

												The game's is an extremely mixed bag.The premise is good and the game starts interestingly enough with simple and standard puzzles, but as soon as a plethora of cameos and easter eggs come up, the gameplay loosens and the plot falls apart under convenient resolutions for the sake of ""member this?"" nostalgia tripping. Moue is a one of the victims of said capitalizing that tasty and effortless nostalgia's value. Puzzles are very uneven. There're some clever ones, like deciphering the Tabula (could use a better UI for this one, though...) or the old telegram (there's some wasted potential here, since the base word is way too obvious to guess - and it basically solves the whole puzzle), but most of they are way too illogical or simply ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The cockroach+paperclip=fixed fuse is just stupid, but making the player to type an answer with a God damned typo (Bassam's shop), only to see it properly spelled in the background after finishing it is just going overboard. Getting a correct answer is not enought, you need to make a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ typo to solve this puzzle, only to... see it properly spelled afterwards. At this point I was on the edge of dumping the game. Pointless and time consuming (I had to see the playthrough and the correct answer literally got me shaking). Not to mention that it's a bollywood reference and has little to do with the location's context (edit: turns out, Bassam looks a lot like a male lead from the movie, though). And yes, you can't simply crush the cockroach, because it's the most convenient resolution for an obscure problem only 5 hours later in the game, in Spain (you find it in Paris). Meanwhile, you will carry it even to the Russian gangster's mansion - to London.The 2D backgrounds are pretty and give that classic BS vibe, but awful 3D models do their best to ruin them. Why aren't they also in 2D?The game got on my nerves many times with its puzzles and shattering narrative. Most of newly introduced characters are simply killed off conveniently after being exploited by the plot and they don't even make sense. The murder investigation in Paris and George being a main suspect are also dropped off without a reason and it's not even concluded at the end (which is obviously rushed). But the overall experience was satisfying enough and the good overweight the bad - barely.			"

												As a large and life-long, immense fan of Broken Sword I was not disappointed at all. They tried to go back to the old, retro style which was nice to experience again, since I am a great fan of old point & clicks. Still I prefer the working out what to do with what over the puzzles- which there are a few of on this game. This one differed because it seemed to be a lot easier than the classics (was probably the easiest, simplest Broken Sword game for me) and it was also not as witty and funny as all the rest. There were so many potential jokes and quick one-liners they could have put in, and that I expected to be said, but didn't. That's the one reason why I was quite disappointed. Other than that, great game! ****			"

												1st half: Puzzles are far too easy.  Nostalgia is the main attraction for me here and would not recommend this to anybody who is brand new to the Broken Sword series as there are much better point & click puzzle games out there such as Grim Fandango or Dreamfall: The Longest Journey.  Was a nice walk down memory lane and looking forward to the 2nd half.2nd half:  With the exception of a damn near unsolvable convoulted puzzle to translate a text the puzzels are again by in large so simple they'll make your eyes roll.This is just an other sample in a growing trend of cash grabs using nostalgia to hoodwink customers.  As for me, this is the last game I will ever pre-purchase.  First Brink, then Dead Island and now this.  It's time I gave my bank account and eye-rolling a break, and learn my lesson.Avoid.  Far better point & click puzzle games out there.			"

												Certainly the best Broken Sword game so far, and one I can easily recommend--although with some reservations.Despite loving adventure games, I can say I've never really been a big fan of the Broken Sword Series, the first one was alright, but due to the similar subject matter felt a lot like the third Gabriel Knight game, but with worse puzzles and less charasmatic leads.  The second Broken Sword game makes my list of worst adventure games, and the third was fun enough, but its pleasure came in the unusual platforming and stealth areas at which other games have done much better.  So it was that I never really jumped at buying this one.That turns out to be a mistake.  First of all The Serpent's Curse is gorgeous.  I didn't mind a bunch of simple puzzles that did little other than waste my time in the first act, just because I loved seeing every environment.  So much attention to detail in the art too I loved the inside of Bijoux's apartment for instance, which caught her personality even better than her dialogue did.In the second act the puzzles improve quite a bit.  It does in that act include one puzzle they should have axed involving a cockroach that is on the level of the cat hair mustache in GB3 or the inflatable duck to get the railway key in Longest Journey.  However, that excepted, Act 2 has a very nice assortment of puzzles including some particularly memorable ones in which you must decode a map and decipher a hieroglyphic language.  The plot is fairly interesting throughout, if a bit safe.  It goes exactly the way you'd expect and never really explores new territory, but that is okay if it's a story you don't mind hearing again.  And it is one which allows the artists to dazzle you.  Also on the negative side is a number of tiresome comic relief characters and an uninspiring will-they-won't-they dynamic between the leads.  Especially considering they have before.I must agree with reviewers that you control George too much and Nico not enough.  There really should have been more balance here and in one place where you DO control Nico, it makes little sense.  There is a scene in which George and Nico must pose as insurance investigators.  George is an insurance investigator in his daily life, yet Nico--who is a reporter--takes the lead? Later, or possibly right before that scene, George interrogates a man who has come to see Nico because of a report she wrote on a robbery--wouldn't it make more sense for Nico--the reporter--to have conducted that interview?  It is bizarre.  And then, of course, there are numerous scenes throughout where it wouldn't matter which character you control except that it is almost always George.  Ah well.  I suppose it is a little thing really.Buy this for the art and the puzzles in the second act.  There is also a story and some characters, those shouldn't annoy you enough to keep you from enjoying it.			"

												I'm finding it very hard to give this a recommendation, yet also feel rather bad for giving it the thumbs down.It starts off as a great return to the old classics that were 1 and 2. The atmosphere is great, it's visually pleasing to look at and the voice acting is really well done. The puzzles are, at the start at least, well done and requires quite a bit of 'out of the box' thinking.Old characters return, which is always nice, but some are just there to be there and be even more ridiculous than before.And here comes the part... Later in the game, it doesn't just require the player to think outside the box, it actually gets down to, should I say, ridiculous puzzle solving. Trying not to spoil too much, I managed just fine on my own with the game, until there was a puzzle that just made absolutely no sense (to me) in any way. I thought that was fine, but then came another one and... Dare I say, even another one. Sure, not all puzzles are meant to be easy, but I found these to be a bit too over complicated, as if the developer thought they were clever.Another gripe I have is that the voice acting of minor characters is off. A french person with an american accent or a rather obnoxious actor trying to imitate spanish. A pet peeve because it started off so well, then this happened.When acting with a certain object, it sometimes doesn't even change to be interactive until the playe has looked at or interacted with something else. At the start, it's very minor, but later, it became a bugbear.Then the typo's, there are so many in this game that it became bothersome.Then there's the pacing. There's no quick walk or sprinting at all, nor double click to skip to next scene. Everything is very slowly paced and even the dialogue sometimes waits for several seconds to actually start. It drags the game out so long for no good reason.And it's a shame, because the first half of the game is really damn good. After that, it starts to become a drag. I wanted to get on with the game, but it wouldn't let me. Throw in some obnoxious puzzles, have backwards logic, like not being able to interact with something when it made sense and that's pretty much Broken Sword 5.I would commend it for being rather true to what it started out to be in the past though, but I simply can't recommend it like this. There are many point and click adventures out there that make more sense while having puzzles that work outside the box (Book of Unwritten Tales) that actually work.If you're a fan of the series, it's a rather good addition to the series, but I'd suggest waiting until it's in the bargain bin.

												Nice idea to create detective quest. But the story is awful. It is full of stereotypes: silly policemen, french waiter-revolutionary bent on revolution and philosophy. And of course the ""cranberry"": Evil Russian Bear who looks like Putin and befriends evil colonel Gaddafi, reads ""War and Peace"", has medals for his service in Chechnya, smokes cigars ""Romanovs"" and even has a bush trimmed as the emblem the Russian Federation. I will not surprise if he drinks vodka with his pet brown bear, plays on balalaika and wears ushanka when he runs his own nuclear reactor in cellar.If creators collects so much stereotypes about Russia in one place they should learn Russian alphabet better. The typewriter's keyboard is very strange at least.One more big minus: the game is too simple. You do not have to think. This game can be exciting only for 7 years old child or for mentally challenged people.But if you want to play without thinking and Zooma already bothered then you can try this game.			"

												Pros+ Very similiar style to first two Broken Sword games+ Good 2D graphics (for the most part)+ CheapCons- Story is stupid- Character animation is poor and very limited- Some/most characters come across as annoying- The writing is amateur-ishAs a big fan of the first two Broken Sword games, I was excited to see the series return to its roots after the last few releases. At first, I wasn't disappointed; the graphical style was spot on, and Rolf Saxon was back voicing the main character, with a similar witty approach.However, that's where the similarities ended. I started to notice a lack of variation in the character animation, and when interacting with objects, mimed with empty hands instead of holding them. The cut scenes were ok, but some of the 2D style backdrops made me feel motion sick as they 'moved' to create a sense of perspective in panning shots.Though the voice actors put in a good performance (mostly), that can't overcome the poor quality, amateur-ish script. A lot of the dialogue was clunky, and any humour felt false and out of place. The overarching story started well, but by the end was just over-the-top stupidity. The ending felt like the writer had had enough and just stuck any old crap on the end just to finish the game. Details such as how the police acted were also badly written, as if the writer didn't have the first idea of what police officers actually do. Yes, those characters were supposed to be a bit silly, but it crossed the line into ludicrousness.In short, the only thing that got me to the end of the game was my love for the original two games. Although that was clearly what the developers were going for, that is all they went for, not quality or originality, but a pastiche with many original characters stuck into the game just because they could.

												not to recommend, even if you are a fan of the series (like I am).Writing down in all detail what bothered me, would have taken more time than I needed to finish ep1.So just a quick sum up: the story and story build up is way too slow and not compelling (i.e. ep1 - here is hoping for ep2); charakters are mere caricatures and the style of the puzzles is indecisive, shifting form bizarr to realistic. The early titles were famed for being heavy on the dialog, but, oh boy, they really improved this one.Will I play ep2? Sure (as I already bought it). But in hindsight I should have waited for the ep2 reviews.			"

												Just not as good as the previous Broken Sword games. The puzzles were even more ridiculous than in previous games. For instance, one puzzle uses a cockroach to short two power terminals, and another focuses on consoling a fat woman to progress the story. I lost interest around this part and used the hints to finish the rest of the game quickly. The overall plot was only mildly interesting but I did learn about a fascinating offshoot of christianity. The animations were fantastic but simply took too long each time an action was activated. The awkward pauses between conversations to allow the animations to complete were also jarring. The game was a test of patience in this respect.I was also dissatisfied that Nico was playable for a far shorter time than George.			"

												I really really liked BS1 and 2, 3 to 4 were hit and miss, and I'm still undecided in recommending 5. Took me 9 hours to finish it after stopping for a few months in between as I wasn't that interested in the story. I feel that it's too ""episodic"", and I don't like the pseudo-3D characters (much rather have the painted 2D from BS1-2). Soundtrack, although I love Barrington Pheolung and his work, was a rehash of BS1.Story is intriguing but not original enough. There's not enough stuff to keep me hooked or interested, and the final third felt like a drag: no world wide threat, no actual ""danger"", no real ""international threat"", just a few baddies, really awful jokes, and poor animation and cutscenes.I guess if you're a die hard BS fan (eg you liked 1 TO 4, including the 3D ones), then you'll also like 5.If you like BS1 and 2, but not so sure with 3 and 4, then you may enjoy 5.Pros: Locations (the very few ones), goat(s), some of the puzzles.Cons: THE puzzle that makes no sense, and even after having looked at a guide, I still don't know what's the ""right"" way to solve it, soundtrack, animations, cutscenes, story a bit meh.

												I really wanted to love this game. I've followed the series and played them all. Fond memories from my youth and all that. But this game was just... painful. My biggest complaint is pacing. It is slow. Painfully slow. Every single sequence takes SO long to complete because of the ridiculously slow movement speed (seriously, guys, a jog won't kill you) and the stilted, meandering dialogue. The puzzles lack any of the clever ingenuity of the early games. In this game they're reduced to lucky combinations of items, or downright nonsensical logic. It's no surprise they incorporated a hint system, because so many of the puzzles make zero sense.There are many more issues, visibility of important puzzle components, janky mechanics, a frustrating inventory system, poor dialogue, but I think the biggest is just, the lack of a strong plot.The whole thing is poorly written, and totally cliche, downright stealing elements from earlier games and just rehashing them. Despite my love for the series, I can't recommend this game. It's janky, slow, poorly developed, and lacks the charm that really helps you put up with the bad. The plot isn't compelling, and there's really no incentive to see it through. I'm disappointed.			"

												Outdated, but not in a charming way, hampered by the need to wait for animations to finish before you can talk to characters, it generally feels sluggish and at odds with the swashbuckling storyline.  The art is clear but less expressive than bs1/2 and nor does it have the more expansive exploration of bs3.  The best character arc in the game is that of a murderous quasi-butler who likes gardening.  Playing feels a little like going through the motions at times.			"

The only problem i have with the game is that its a little easy and part one feels short. With 5 hours for part 1 that gives us a total play time of about 10 hours. While not a short game (its on par with broken sword 1 and 2) I was hoping for something a little more.

The story is well written and the gameplay flows with puzzels placed such that they enhance the exzperience, rather than being an arbitrary progress gate. The only problem i have with the game is that its a little easy and part one feels short. With 5 hours for part 1 that gives us a total play time of about 10 hours. While not a short game (its on par with broken sword 1 and 2) I was hoping for something a little more. That said however I would advise anyone with a love of old school adventure games to get this one. Although.....you may want to wait until part two drops......the wait is driving me nuts.			"

The game has a beautiful feel and the story is progressively compelling.  Just opening up the plot and enjoying the game, looking forward to uncovering more.			"

												Really loved the return of this series. The artwork is beautiful and reminiscent of the first titles, the voice acting great and the story doesn't let the series down. My only nitpicking would be the character models animations that occasionally look a bit awkward, specially in some cutscenes. But if you can forgive that, I think this adventure title will most certainly not disapoint you. Absolutelly recomend!			"

												(Note: my 'hours played' is massively higher than actual playtime because I often had the game minimised while doing other things, which was quite often as BS5 didn't grip me)I got about two thirds of the way through and gave up out of boredom. I YouTube'd the ending, out of curiosity, and am glad I didn't bother getting there myself. I'm a big fan of BS1 and 2 and I backed 5 on Kickstart. I'm glad that point and click adventures continue to get made and I've got my fingers crossed for a Beneath The Steel Sky 2, but I found Broken Sword 5 to be rather limp and flat. I can put up with some silly puzzles if the writing and humour are there, but they weren't. It was all pleasant enough, but I think the game played it very safe; there was no cheeky spark or wit. I found myelf playing the game with the sound off, while having one eye on whatever was on the TV in the background. That was when I realised I should play something else. (Mild, but possibly helpful spoiler!) And acknowleding the infamously unfair goat puzzle from the first game with... an unfair goat puzzle? You establish that George isn't an action hero, and that the game isn't a third person action game, so why can he suddenly do certain very physical things mid game that he couldn't do before and with very poor signposting? The game breaks its logic to have a laugh about the logic breaking in the first game. (spoiler end)Lovely backgrounds weren't enough to make me care about the story or its flat delivery. It's the first BS game where I didn't care much about any of the characters either. Currently the game is overpriced too. Might provide a pleasant and undemanding Sunday afternoon for someone who's bored and happens upon the game during a sale. Alternatively, try the superior BS1, 2 or a good book.			"

Full of nostalgia for fans of the series and yet can be played as a stand alone for newcomers. However, a little bit easier than past games with a larger degree of handholding. Overall really fun game with a very detailed story. Would definitley reccomend to anyone who likes a puzzle/ murder mystery and cannot wait for part two.			"

												A worthy sequel to the broken sword series! Withold-school click&point mechanics as well as handdraw 2D-backgrounds, revolution games revives the spirit of the first two games. Murder in Paris, George and Nico and conspiracies this part of the series has it all.Pros: * Nice puzzle design, with some really challenging bits (Decoding an encrypted telegramms for instance)* Lovely drawn background* Exciting, fast-paced story (at least after it picks up speed in the second half of part 1)* Funny characters, conversations and refferences to the old gamesCons:* 3D Character-models and lazy animations. (There are severall glitches due the mix of 3D-models and 2D-Backgrounds)* Magic doors - I just don't get it, either you don't use doors (or at least not normal doors that need human interaction) or you animate character to open the doors, but doors magically opening and closing themselves just looks lazy and broken at the same time.* Lame voice acting, that seldom feels like conversations but like everyone needing to take a peek at their lines before responding.Nevertheless it is worth its money and a must for true fans of the series.

												It's a good game, better than numbers 3 and 4. episode 1 was a bit slow paced, and the puzzles didnt seem too difficult to solve. there is a hint system in place, but try and avoid using it as it does seem to take something away from the game.There are plenty of hints in the dialogue anyway to keep you on the right track.  I'm hoping that episode 2 will be a quicker pace with a higher difficulty. Happy I brought the game for 50% off otherwise I might have been dissapointed. Completed episode 1 in approx 4.5 hours, so should end up being about 10 hours overall (not bad for the price when episode 2 is released)Graphics are amazing for a 2D game, lighting is atmospheric and it is great hearing the same voice actors.

												What a great game! I've played all ""broken sword"" games until the series started with a ugly 3d-Tomb Rider look and feel (I've stoped with BF3). As I've seen that the new one is a 2D (ok, 2.5D in 2D look) ""point and click"" style I was overjoyed. The game is great and the difficulty level for riddles is good enough to think hard but not so hard to lose the fun. Yesterday I've finished the game and I hope that we get a Broken Sword 6 in a far future.Thanks Revolution for another masterpiece of 2d adventures.			"

												If you are a fan of old school point-and-click games then you'll likely enjoy the latest Broken Sword entry. Built with nostalgia in mind - this game purposefully doesn't reinvent the wheel. This is a blessing for fans of the genre, however it will not convert any adventure game naysayers. There are about 4 hours gameplay in Act 1 which is ideal for busy gamers who appreciate a casual drop-in playthrough mentality. Looking forward to Act 2. I just hope THAT song (you'll know which one I mean) doesn't make a resurgence.			"

												As a backer of the Kickstarter campaign, I might be a bit biased. But I think the creators delivered a nice adventure game with an interesting story - even though it's a bit short on plot twists - enjoyable characters and puzzles (thank god, no crate pushing though). The story is the typical Broken Sword conspiracy/cult/historical/mythical adventure, what is probably what you've bargained for if you buy this game.Beware though, that Broken Sword 5 might not be the best game to start playing the series, as the game draws a lot from the player recognising characters or incidents from previous Broken Sword games. The main plot however can be understood without knowing any previous games though; a lot of jokes will just go over your head.			"

												Old school point click, very much in the style of the first two games in the series. In terms of the puzzle design it feels a little dated and some of the recycled characters feels a bit too much like fan service but the puzzles are good examples of their type and the story is compelling. The biggest selling point is the visual design which is stellar, a marked improvement over recent Broken Sword games. My only real bugbear is that like all of the games in the series the comedy can fall flat in the face of the darker elements and I wish it played a little more seriously. Regardless as far as part one goes I'd probably put it on par with Broken Sword 2 in terms of quality, and would recomend it to anyone who has enjoyed the series to date.			"

It goes more into conspiracies, which is a bit meh, but other than that, it's great. Gameplay is nice too and there's hints offered in case you get stuck. The only thing I didn't like so much is having to rely on the clues. It's a lot like CSI but without the lab analysis. Definitely worth playing for hours on end.			"

												When a new Broken Sword comes out it's one of the few games I really look forward to and buy straight away, but in my opinion while I enjoyed this one it felt quite a bit short in length, and that's after part 2, it's the main thing that stood out as a big minus for me, I also feel that Nico could have played a more active role in the game. But obviously there are good points, notably the care and detail put into the hand drawn scenery in each part of the game which I thought was very well done/ good voice acting (as usual). So yeah don't be put off by this Broken Sword it's not a bad game at all I enjoyed it on the whole, I'm just comparing to their previous standard set, so bottom line: Good game in general, just a bit short for me, one or two more different locations before the end featuring more of Nico would have made it more satisfying come the credits.

												Another Broken Sword adventure. Less humoristic than first ones, maybe.Story is interesting enough and, clues and investigation are very entertainer.The only bad thing is that when dialogs start they take a long between the one finishes and the next one starts.Also, a double-click to make the character to reach places before would be more than desirable.Too much time spent doing nothing can be desperated.The worst of all is that this seems to be the first part of a two parts history so, that should continue in Browen Sword 6, I guess.Recommended, anyway. A good game.			"

												I enjoyed this game the first 4/5. Then things began to fall apart. The last 1/5 feels like the puzzles make no sense and are unintuitive. The final cutscene literally has no sound other than the dialog. They had to have been rushed at the end and they released an incomplete game.-Edit-I got the game in a HumbleBundle, so I paid far less than the $25 they are asking.I'm changing my recommendation to a resounding NO. Only get this game if it's $5 or less.			"

												Nice graphics, semi-stupid dialogs, totaly stupid Nico. Most of puzzles can be easily solved without using Hint system. I could recommend this game, if price go for 50%, offcourse I just saw first part. Hoping for more adventure in second part of the game and I hope it will come very soon. BTW in one moment, my character mentioned some fact, that I or him should not know yet, so not the best work there, should had more testing before release. Also game crashed 2, 3 times, thanks god for autosave feature, you realy need those if your game does not work perfectly.			"

												+ Pretty 2D-graphics.+ Good story.+ Feels almost like a old school Broken Sword game.- Puzzles are too easy.- Too few locations and characters. There isn't even other people or traffic on the streets of Paris?- The characters are badly animated. They feel wooden and have very limited movements. They walk slowly and can't even walk continuously if you click the screen.- Voice acting is dull.- ”Humour”. Sudden funny parts feel just unattached and awkward.- Some bugsAs a fan of Broken Sword 1&2, I really wanted to like this game. The game felt just rushed and silly.2.5/5			"

												The more adventures I've played the more I realize just how perfectly balanced (ha!) the first Broken Sword was. I didn't hate the game, it's more like ""meh"". Overall I don't think it's worth the time.Pros: -the game is pretty-Rolf Saxon's voice is pretty-goat is pretty-puzzles aren't completely ridiculous & the hint system is pretty-balance and Cathar faith are pretty-there's a lot of nice, intelligent detailsCons: -for some reason the writers couldn't be bothered to write a new interesting NCP since The Shadow of the Templars. Every time I meet Moue, the Hendersons, etc. I die a little inside.-If you can't do French/Spanish/British accent, don't do them. Listening to Nico is painful.-cca.30mins before the end the story just gives up and goes batshit crazy.-plot twists are obvious.-dialogues are more embarrasing than funny-a ""cute"" sociopath just murdered someone and I'm expected to laugh.-the first half is boring. The story just isn't interesting enough to hold the player's attention for so long.			"

												I feel realy sad to not be able to recommend this game, I just love the old traditional point & click games and this seemd to be a game I would enjoy alot. But that was not the case, the game has a weak story, still not terrible and at some points I actualy found it intresting.But the thing that gets this game from a decent game to a bad one is the game mechanics, several of the things one needs to solve is just stupid, one have to do it in just the ""right"" way, some items you cant pick up before doing someething other first. Wich makes one to belive that one wont be able to pick up that item at all. So you sit there thinking you are stuck because you need just that thing that you erlier could not pick up for no reason at all.And the gameplay is horrible slow, there are several places where you just have to click throught badly written dialog with no usefull content at all, just to be able to pick up something that was just obvius that you should get. But alas, you had to go throught the dialog first.And if that is not enought, some places you have to do a series of thing, but if you just forgot one of them the game will play out a sequence that is minutes long with just a character moving just to see that you need that one more thing, it's extramly frustrating. Like rotating staues, the animation for it is extreamly slow, and if you go one step too long you have to spend another minute or so rotating it..And last but not least, even if this game did not have these flaws, itäs still not worh €23, maybe €10 without the flaws, as it is now dont but it for more then €2.And honestly, dont buy it at all, buy one of Daedalic Entertainment games insted, they know how to make these kind of games.

												It's a good old graphic point'n click adventure with all the things that made good old point'n click adventures as good as annoying. I wish there was a neutral button. That's what I'd hit. Since there isn't one, I have to go with the negative evil thing: The bad just outweights the good. I want slow adventure games to succeed. I really, really do. I love stories. I love characters. I love puzzles. I love getting involved into fantasy stuff. I love... ermm.. slowness in games? The Serpent's Curse managed to drag me into nostalgia, I suppose. And it's very much like its predecessors, almost like a copy. Still, things just don't add up anymore nowadays. It's like the devolpers haven't learned anything since 2006. How long can you drag nostalgia out? The good:  - It's fairly heavy on story. I'm not at the end yet but still wanna find out about those mysteries- It has beautifully drawn background graphicsThe bad: - Oh god, the voice acting. Nothing feels natural. I tried three different audio languages and I'm still lost here. In German (1st language), it's like listening to 3rd-graders reciting a play. English audio has hilariously spoken accents everywhere, Even I could hear the fake, and that says something. Finally I tried French and... well scratch that, my French has somehow dissolved over the years. Hopefully you'll get luckier with your audio.- Holy hell, the puzzles. I forgot how annoying these can be sometimes. You often know EXACTLY what you need to do: Talk to this guy, give him that. Repair the machine using X. But it's never that easy, isn't it? Things have to be complicated. THEY HAVE to be, because point'n click adventure game. Oh man. I'm writing this review from a point in the game where I definitely know that I have to drive a frigging seagull off a lamppost by honking a horn. Problem: I have about 0,5 seconds to make three things at once happen. Even with a guide at hand, I've tried seven times so far. This whole situation is horrible. I hate guides. I don't wanna use them. This game gives me no choice though. I don't wanna run around offering everyone a banana for five hours and hope it'll stick. So, there's that. Conclusion: This game is heavily outdated and only a thing for hardcore nostalgists. or masochists. Or people who like to google for solutions. Or ones who like to do the same things over and over again. "

												This game is a good example of just about everything wrong with point and click adventures - long animations that need to be repeated until you solve the puzzle with some truely, utterly obscure item combinations required. Overall this game doesnt do anything that Monkey Island wasn't doing ~25 years ago.The plot is intriguing and the characters likable though I think the humor missed almost completely. There are also some dialogue trees that just seem totally pointless. Overall the voice acting is acceptable though sometimes character reactions are out of place.Overall, if you're looking for a point and click adventure, there are better ones out there.			"

												If you think this game will have the same quality as the first two you will be disappointed.The game has some great art on the backgrounds and a decent story, but the core of the game is badly designed.The animation are obnoxiously long, to the point that characters even wait a couple of seconds to talk to each other or to interact with an object, this becomes frustrating since you will obviously have to do that a lot.Some of the enigmas are good but most of them are unispired and in some cases just stupid. Another bad thing is the fact that some objects you have to interact with are just too small to be visible on the background, making you frustated on an enigma when all you had to do was interact with it (there's a point when you have to interact with a notebook, and it is literally two pixel wide on a game that is 1080p...).

												I've been a big fan of the Broken Sword series but it seems the studio behind it have attributed its success to its Christian iconography and puzzles. Yes, the original is still considered a classic and I urge you to go play it now if you haven't already, but gamers loved it for its characters, mystery and charm, not for its overwinding historical lesson of the Templars. The Serpent's Curse is trying to simulate everything that made the first game a runaway success, down to bringing back the same characters, the same locations and the same jokes. Even a goat makes a comeback, for eff's sake.The game is also too long fro its own good and about halfway-through, started getting dull and repetetive. Even the puzzles started becoming needlessly dreary and complicated. Is this game better than the last two? Most definitely. Does it outshine the original? Not by a long shot. Is it a good adventure game for fans of the series and those just getting into it? Probably, and sadly, no. You will get some entertainment out of it, but it's too busy being stuck in the past and will never really launch for you to embrace it fully.			"

												The whole game felt rushed to me, due to the obvious Kickstarter campaign pressure. The animations were extremely shoddy and lifeless, and looked terrible at 2560x1440... With a glaringly obvious line around each character's neck, being visible in most scenes (which I presume the models were designed to rotate around). Everything also seems optimised for 420p, with the hand drawn pre-rendered backgrounds looking far less sharp than the glaringly obvious 3D character models... Which don't really fit with the style of going back to the game's roots. The few 3D mashup cutscenes were also jarring, considering this new / old combination style. Puzzle wise, everything you need is usually within your immediate environment and they require little to no thought. Some of the solutions are also pretty absurd, with the attempts at humor being a letdown this outing. I remember actually being challenged by the original games, which is sad. Also, did I mention the backtracking? Don't expect many new environments. The things you can't interact with on your first visit signify multiple visits to the same location. All of the usual charm and the bones of an interesting story are all there, but I'd avoid this until you can get your hands on the full version, or at least at a Steam Sale discount. The price is far too high for this level of quality. Let's hope the second episode is an improvement. 5/10.  "

It seems to be an attempt at cashing in on an established brand.Saying that, the artwork is genuinely good. The colour scheme and the style are really nice and I wish more adventure games looked like this. It's just a shame that the actual game is pretty poor.

												So, not sure which way to go on this one in the binary choice provided by Steam. If you are going to get into the Broken Sword series, then I suggest you go and check out the first game, which is available in an updated and still-beautiful edition on PC, Mac, DS, iOS, Android... probably GameBoy... uhm... yeah. Go play that. Then the second one if you feel you're enjoying yourself. And so on.If you've played and enjoyed Broken Sword before and have since forgotten about its existence, I am not sure if I could outright recommend 5. I did have fun, and much more so in the second half of the game. It's definitely a Broken Sword game, and there is plenty to like, but I am not sure it's worth rushing your wallet out. It's a return to the older-style point-and-click of the first two games, and it's good enough for getting your Broken Sword juices flowing, but really... I hope there are greater things ahead of the series.			"

												I backed this on kickstarter and it was the worst $200 I have ever spent. I will not talk about the kickstarter itself, sufficed to say I will never buy a Revolution game ever again purely based on that, but I will talk about the game itself.I grew up with Broken Sword. I played it in the days before walktroughs, where you had to sit and figure things out on your own and it was a wonderful story. Lovable charaters with dead pan wit, immersive historical plots, challenging puzzles and beautiful scores. This game spits on the name Broken Sword. And I've played Angel of Death.Pros:Stellar voice acting.Updated artwork that stays true to the original style. Cons:Ridiculous puzzles. Not hard, not challenging, just totally random actions needed to produce an unexplained result.Glitches. There are broken puzzles, broken achievements, missing sprites, characters (including George, so your game breaks) can randomly disappear.Character animation is jerky and everyone walks like they have terrible piles.Humour: there is none. It tries desperately to be funny but it's just sad.Cameos from previous games are thick and fast. They are also shoe-horned, pointless and mostly cringey.Nico, the once intelligent and sarcastic self-made journallist has been reduced to a flat, lifeless piece of eye candy, her only purpose in the game being to seduce random people in George's way. This game is so bad. And to think it was two years late and even then only half the game was released (presumably they ran out of money). This game actually makes me want to cry, it feels like a betrayal. It's taken me over two years to finish because I just don't want to play it, it's a chore and it makes me sad. If you ever played the originals, stay away. If you want a new point and click, play 1 and 2, enjoy them thoroughly, stop there and live in happy ignorance of this piece of ill-concieved♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  "

												This is my first and most likely last Steam game. As I noticed I can leave a review about it, I thought why not. As the game forces you to use steam, I have included reviews of steam. As I do not have time to make it unique I will use many parts of an Amazon review I wrote for the same game.Prior to this game I had never come across this ""Steam"" software. I had heard of it but never came into contact with it (I am it seems a bit of a dinosaur when it comes to PC games). I knew the software came with a Steam key, but was hoping steam would not be that bad. After all if I was going to play one of my favourite series of games I had to use it anyway.So my new game comes and I place the DVD in the drive. Instantly I am harassed with the requirement of installing Steam. Well I knew this in advance so I thought that's OK.  I provided some personal details such as email which I would rather not have supplied and went about installing the game. Installation went OK I suppose, although no better than a normal installation. Then Steam asked me for a code which I entered from the booklet inside the case and the process was complete.The process was not so pleasant, with registration and the annoyance of adding software of absolutely no benefit to me. But on the bright side that was all over now.So I double clicked the icon and steam loaded. Not quite what I had expected, I do not practically like when a program is simply wrapping another program, it uses up resources and provides no real service in return, well of no benefit to me anyway. Not too bad I suppose but another minor annoyance, which is by now adding up. Anyway a few moments later I am presented with a blank screen, so I continue to wait patiently. I hear some music so continue to wait. Still nothing happened. The music continues but I get no picture.So I closed the program and I loaded Steam. Loading steam I was presented with an advertisement. There is probably a way to turn these off but that is beside the point, I purchased the game so in my view I shouldn't have to deal with adverts. Even if I can turn them off, they should be off by default, or at least a question on install ""Would you like us to bother you with advertisements when you finish playing a game?"" would be nice. I mean surely this is obvious? Some game makers allow you to play games for free if you have the adverts enabled, and charge you to remove them.Anyway I started to explore steam, which is not too badly laid out so soon found a way to get to the exe location and I tried again. Again it failed to load. I noticed a BS_5FF.exe and tried that. It loaded a splash screen then failed to load any more.Thinking it may be a resolution issue I checked the box for resolution requirements, and found nothing. I then proceeded to try all available resolutions on my laptop. And still nothing. I browsed the internet for an hour or so trying various fixes, none of which worked.I also emailed Revolution, which wasn't the best experience. Hopefully they will be able to help though.I tried again today (just in case it was a steam issue and they had solved the problem) and I got the error ""steam could not connect to the network"" and it closed. I tried yet again this time it did connect to steam (I guess it did anyway because I did not get the error) and once again nothing. However when I closed the game steam was quick to advertise to me.So now I have a DVD, for a game I cannot play. I could try on a different PC however installing steam to another device makes me feel a bit sick. I could give the game away as it appears good for nothing else, but oh no it is locked to my account so that option is out.My only hope is I come across a fix, or Revolution gets back to me. However I do not see myself ""working"" to fix the issue as it is becoming a chore and because of the experience, most excitement for playing this game is now drained away.The only good thing I can think of with regards to this game is that I know to stay clear of games presenting the Steam logo now.Only advice I can give is avoid this game really.---------------------------------------------------------------------As steam limits my comment length a reply to totally free of skills message:Of course it is not a review of the gaming aspect of the game. The game will not work. More than likely due to some hardware requirement the publishers did not bother to note. My graphics card looks suspect in this and they didn't bother to publish graphics card specifications. You could argue I shouldn't down vote a game because of this, but to be quite honest it is an underhanded tactic by the developers, since they have deceivingly low specs for everything they bother to list. Seems convenient the one thing I do not have is the one thing they don't list, probably the one most likely thing a user would not have to be honest.Also as it is incapable of working it is still a review of my purchased ""Broken Sword 5"" product. The only thing I can review is the steam aspect as steam is forcefully installed to me it is a part of the package I would otherwise not have. Steam also has made sure I am stuck with the useless deceitfully advertised software which I can not even give away without the hassle of passing my account on to someone else.Steam provides NO benefit to me and yet it FORCES me to have it installed. This is therefore to me bloat ware. All of this to prevent copyright. I can understand the desire to protect a product from copyright, and as a product should be protected. My issue is people illegally obtaining something like this would have no steam bloatware, they could install and run without need for internet. They have no fears of steam closing down, or something happening to their steam account. Hence in my opinion having a better product than the paying user.Furthermore if my game did work and anything happened to steam. Then again I cannot use my product. Maybe steam would provide a key, maybe not. Really it is not worth the risk.I see where one might like steam if they wanted to play a multi player game (which this is not) or to see ""offers"" (which I do not care about). Other than that I can't see anything I could not get elsewhere (and both of the previous things I probably could find elsewhere).My review may be useful as you put it. If I can convince just 1 person to boycott this software. Then I would be happy. In fact I have already put one person off with a different review elsewhere, and as most of it was a copy and paste job it has been of use.			"

												I'm very disappointed with the game. I love the series, and this game was good while it lasted but it was way too short. Nearly £20 for just an afternoons gameplay? However there is a second half to come out as a free update so it may still turn out to be good.			"

												Wonderful. After the dissapointment of 3, and especially 4, The Serpent's Curse is a return to form and looks and feels as good (even better maybe?) than the first two in the series. Small issue with Creative driver under Windows 10 (BSOD) but disabling the card until the first scene was reached (and using USB headphones) allowed a quick save, reboot, re-enable card, and a game resume seem to work fine with the Creative card and speakers again.Lovelyfootnote: I did find that there were three or four other cutscenes that caused the BSOD so again I disabeld the Creative card temporarilyand played through them - recommendation is to save the game regularly though the autosave did help on one occasion			"

												The game is engaging, funny, and had lovely graphics. This was the first in the series that I played, so I missed out on bits that were for previous fans, but I didn't mind.I did like the first half better than the first and I'll do what I can to describe the difference while being vague so I don't spoil anyone. The puzzles were enjoyable little morsels that added to the story instead of took over while the story itself was engaging. The second half provided a convoluted plot and a few puzzles that were frustrating instead of just being a challenge. (There is one particular puzzle toward the end that I truly think needs to be reworked.)(Sure, I had my moments where it took me far too many minutes to figure something out that made me sigh at myself, but those aren't the puzzles I'm referring to.) All in all, it's worth the money on sale. "

												Final installment of Broken Sword series. Probably the best story of the five, for me. The game is back in 2D, very nicely painted graphics. This time you can skip dialogues (yay!). OK so the story begins in Paris again (duh!) at an art gallery where George meets with Nicole right at the time a robbery occurs and a single painting gets stolen... The story thickens a lot and people who like the Da Vinci Code book should definitely give it a try.			"

												I was a fan of the first 2 games, and abandoned to follow the series when they turned to 3D. This one however intrigued me. It has 2D backgrounds and even though the characters are 3D they are prerendered and played by clicking a mouse, which is what got me back to it. The environments are as beautiful as ever, the plot is really interesting, and an intriguing story pulling you in more with each new step, to an extent that you are loosing sleep just to find out what's in the end.I thought the game played well for the first half, the puzzles were well organized, so that after each complicated puzzle you could do enough other things to relax ( like exploring Paris and chatting with interesting characters) than just puzzle solve - a really comfortable tempo.The second half however felt like puzzle after puzzle and I began to lose interest more so as I neared the end of the game. I already knew what it was all about and I wanted it to end and it didn't for some time still. It was rather frustrating and boring.The ending, the paranormal, is typical of the series, and is something that I very much dislike and for me it was the lowest point of the game.All in all I would recommend it for the gameplay, everything about the story except the ending, and for the humor.

												Buy it - Just buy it, you will not regret it if you have ever played/enjoyed Broken Sword 1 and 2 (and if you were disappointed with Broken Sword 3 and 4 like me, this game blows them out the water).Having played the series since it's release, I was much younger when I first picked up Broken Sword 1, I can finally say they've managed to match, and perhaps surpass, the first release.Broken Sword 1 and 2 were truly brilliant, clever, inspiring and enjoyable games, and I am one of the many who feel the move to 3D for Broken Sword 3 and 4 was a tragic, but understandable mistake.Broken Sword 5 has finally recaptured the magic and charm that the first two games brought us. It's engaging, full of life, mystery and oozes such appealing gameplay. I am so glad they have finally brought us a Broken Sword worthy of the name. I would, and do, recommend this game and it's predecessors. If I could, I'd throw any amount of money they needed to make Broken Sword 6, the games are that good.			"

Full disclosure - I pledged $15 to Broken Sword 5 on Kickstarter for a copy of the game.In the opening moments of Broken Sword 5, I was cast back to playing the original Broken Sword game back in the 90's. A peaceful afternoon in France is quickly transformed into a murder mystery... The story beats are classic Broken Sword fare; a crime is committed, there may have been a deeper motive behind this crime than is first apparent, and digging deeper begins to tug at the threads of a historical conspiracy.At first glance the 3D models used for the characters draw more attention to themselves than their hand-drawn and animated sprite counterparts of old, but this passes quickly. The background art is bright and vibrant and characterful, reminiscent of the previous old games (1 and 2, in particular). Voice actor Rolf Saxon returns for George Stobbart (and let's face it, it wouldn't be George without the same voice!), although Nico's voice actor has sadly been replaced. I must admit, however, that the change for Nico is not particularly jarring, with the new voice fitting in alongside George's well and you'll quickly forget that her voice was ever any different.I found the puzzles mostly satisfying, only getting stuck a few times over both episodes, and fortunately the game has a built in hints system that works really well. It's a tiered system, first offering a vague hint, then building as you ask for more info until it just gives you the complete solution. I feel this is the best possible system a point-and-click game can have in place, allowing you to still feel like you've solved the puzzle on the first few hints, and ultimately saves you alt-tabbing out of the game for a guide in the worst case scenario. I felt comfortable negotiating most of the puzzles myself, but a few tricky and obscure puzzles had me stuck until a few hints pointed me back onto the right path.A must-play for Broken Sword fans, and a great point'n'click game for those new to the series too. A few in-jokes may be missed, but you'll still enjoy the ride.			"

												An engaging, but short adventure. The Broken Sword games as a whole have been compelling and number five offers many  thrills, much humor  and suspense, albeit in a small package. A few more locales and characters to interact with would have made this installment better. The hand drawn illustrations are some of the best I have seen in a modern game, if not rather unexpected in the digital age. The dialogue is both funny and charismatic. The mystery of the murders, the Tabula Veritatis and the ancient connection to Jehovah and Lucifer are interesting and may appeal to members of gnostic and catholic faiths. The ending is good, but brief. If George and Nico's outing had been shown, it would have been a satisfying finale. As the conclusion is, it leaves players wanting more, but also wishing the story had lasted longer.All in all, Broken Sword 5 is a fine game, worthy of praise, but a little lacking in depth. What it offers is interesting, but if the game had had a little more depth, it could have been as notable as the first.			"

												[Edit] Managed to finish the game, increadibly grateful that BokenSword devs camethrough on promises and did not force a payment of the second episode in which all the thing I love about BroknSword came rushing to the forfront. The puzzles became moderatly difficult, allowing for time to consider the plot while enjoying the game. The reintroduction of characters and the addition of complex history, mythology and ledgends was in reminicienst of BrokenSword 1 and 2. generally made a ful recovery and I am very satisfied. [Pre-Edit]frustrating change of the format into episodic nature, how they will fit the rest of the story into only 1 episode is a mystery to me as this episode is not even 1/5 of a story. annoyingly the mystery of how they will ressurect this poorly written story is more complex than that of the game. george seems to have become a dunce in his years away.

												The recommendation for this game is for people who like classic Point-and-Click adventures or the series as a whole. I wouldn't recommend it for someone who is just trying out the adventure genre.It wasn't the most intriguing and compelling of all story lines, there are (as in all Broken Sword games) a few really silly puzzles and solutions, and of course many open questions and a plot that relies more on chance than on logic. Still - it has beautiful backgrounds and it's entertaining enough. Not my favourite Broken Sword game, though (that would be either BS1 or BS2), but bettrer than its predecessors 3 and 4.			"

												Finally a good game in the series and a great way to end this mediocre marathon.After 2 failed attempts to make a 3D game BS series finally does it by mixing it with 2D. Beautiful 3D models with 2D and just as beautiful background, no pixelated images and a tasteful color palette... Graphics are simply superb. As for the gameplay, they went back to P&C. The game has almost the same gameplay as the first two. They polished some rough edges of course (but completely ignored making a double-click function to make the characters move faster). They changed the second lead character Nİco's voice yet again, thankfully not for the worse,  and I'm starting think they are doing this on purpose seeing as no voice was used a second time but I'm missing the point of it entirely. Anyway, puzzles are a delight for the most part. There are still overcomplicated unimportant puzzles like every adventure game ever but most of them are just as they should be especially the second half of the game(Yes there are two main parts).Story is also the best in the series imo. I love christian mythology (no I'm not a follower of the religion) and this is one of the best ones I've seen. The symbolisms, the background, the puzzles... They really connect and you can see they really put effort in it. But the other guys in the story department clearly didn't do as much. Not surprising twists are not surprising, bad guys are cliche at best and ending is disappointing (still better than slaying ♥♥♥♥ing dragons). All in all it's a fun story.To sum up: I you liked the previous ones you ARE going to love this one. If you didn't like them or didn't play them it's still a good game worthy of your time.			"

												Broken Sword 5 gets back to the roots of what made the first few games great with the return of the point and click and system and 2D game play. You get down to some pretty fine fenoddling with George and Nico, the voice work is spot on, the puzzles are pretty good, the backgrounds are beautiful, and the humor is back. The first two are definitely my favorites but this game is straight after them in the list.  I don't know if there ever will be, but I hope there will be a Broken Sword 6 if they keep making them like this.			"

												I was a fan of the first 2 games, and abandoned to follow the series when they turned to 3D. This one however intrigued me. It has 2D backgrounds and even though the characters are 3D they are prerendered and played by clicking a mouse, which is what got me back to it. The environments are as beautiful as ever, the plot is really interesting, and an intriguing story pulling you in more with each new step, to an extent that you are loosing sleep just to find out what's in the end.I thought the game played well for the first half, the puzzles were well organized, so that after each complicated puzzle you could do enough other things to relax ( like exploring Paris and chatting with interesting characters) than just puzzle solve - a really comfortable tempo.The second half however felt like puzzle after puzzle and I began to lose interest more so as I neared the end of the game. I already knew what it was all about and I wanted it to end and it didn't for some time still. It was rather frustrating and boring.The ending, the paranormal, is typical of the series, and is something that I very much dislike and for me it was the lowest point of the game.All in all I would recommend it for the gameplay, everything about the story except the ending, and for the humor.

												Overall I enjoyed this and am grateful to see that another BS game has finally been made, but I must admit that it wasn't really until I got through the first 1/3 of the game that I started to enjoy it. While there is a lot to like about this game -- the art, music, story and puzzles (in the latter part of the game at least) were well done -- by the time that it got interesting the game was almost finished. The main problem with this release is with its first half, as it spent far too much time self-consciously trying to reassert itself as an old-school point and click adventure game, which made it feel a little tired, like an old band trying to make a comeback after many years out of the scene.In saying that, I still really enjoyed it but am not sure if I would have persevered past the first quarter of the game if I wasn't such a big fan of the series.

												This is my first Broken Sword, and it lives up to the hype. I'll definitely now buy and play all the others.The story, visuals, characters and voice acting are all strong, but what sets this apart from other point-and-clicks is the execution of the puzzles. With the exception of a few late on, this game's puzzles avoid the common pitfalls of not communicating themselves well enough to the player; they are a challenge, not a nuisance. The hint system also comes with various tiers, therefore catering to players of all skill sets.Worth the full price for anyone interested in a good 8-10 hour point-and-click with an engaging plot.

												Buy it - Just buy it, you will not regret it if you have ever played/enjoyed Broken Sword 1 and 2 (and if you were disappointed with Broken Sword 3 and 4 like me, this game blows them out the water).Having played the series since it's release, I was much younger when I first picked up Broken Sword 1, I can finally say they've managed to match, and perhaps surpass, the first release.Broken Sword 1 and 2 were truly brilliant, clever, inspiring and enjoyable games, and I am one of the many who feel the move to 3D for Broken Sword 3 and 4 was a tragic, but understandable mistake.Broken Sword 5 has finally recaptured the magic and charm that the first two games brought us. It's engaging, full of life, mystery and oozes such appealing gameplay. I am so glad they have finally brought us a Broken Sword worthy of the name. I would, and do, recommend this game and it's predecessors. If I could, I'd throw any amount of money they needed to make Broken Sword 6, the games are that good.			"

												So what can I say about this game, I am an avid fan of the Broken Sword series and I was extremely happy to see they went back to the old style of how it plays of ""point & click"" compare to the 2 previous games where you could run around more. This game was fantastic! I loved the story, the art style, the references to the other games, everything was great with this game. I really don't have anything negative to say about it. I really recommend you pick up this game if you have already played the previous 4 games, if not then please get the others and play this series! It is well worth the money. I went into this with mix feelings because sometimes in a game series you can be let down after the first 2 games but this series just keeps getting better and better! I had the same mixed feeling playing the 3rd & 4th games but was happy with how the stories played out for those 2 games. So yes in closing please pick up this game series if you haven't and enjoy!

												Not as good as broken sword 1 and 2, but miles better than 3 and 4, the game goes back to it's roots but still not quite 2D, a wierd hybrid bewteen 2D and 3D. The first half of the game is the best part of the game and reminds me of the gerat times i had when i was a kid with Broken Sword 1 and 2, my sister loves them as well, but something is missing in the second part of broken sword 5, the charm dissapears, the game delves into silly illogical puzzle after another and the story starts to trip over itself and struggles to keep my attention and gets too wacky for it's own good, even pearl and duane cannot save the second half of this game.It gets a recommedation from me only becuase the first half hit me in the nostalgias, Revolution Software need to go back to their 2D roots fully and bring that charm we all know and love back, enough of the ghosts and supernatural stuff i want templars, french police, lots of cafes, pubs, gangsters with charm(guido and flap) just to name a few things. Broken Sword 5 for me felt like my favorite band that i know created masterpiece after masterpiece coming back from a 6 year hiatus and releasing a really avarage album that still had that spark that you knew and loved only this time not as bright.7/10, cannot wait for the 25 year anniversary box set Revolution Software, big fan here make no mistake just feel you guys could have done better.

												I’ve always been a Broken Sword fan, even throughout the awkward 3D box pushing, filling Prague with Russians phase. Then the fourth one came out and I only played it once and there was some bimbo blonde instead of Nico, and then Nico shows up with this weird voice actress and just doesn’t look like herself and it’s probably the weakest episode in the series, so no wonder Broken Sword gets quieter than ever. But somehow, even without my knowledge, the guys do a crowd-funding of this one, and, as it should, it drives nostalgia like a new muscle car. The dorky humor of both protagonists is back, it gets the classic 2D point and click treatment and the logic of your tasks is mostly within reason. The game doesn’t do anything special or revolutionary (hah, the irony of that, considering the studio), but we all know how that turned out last time, so that’s all cool. The weird cell-shady 2D/3D aesthetic took a little time for me to get used to and frankly, the animation is sometimes hilariously bad – namely mouth movements and occasionally the way the characters are stood when talking to each other. The puzzles are sometimes dumb as all hell, though that may be intentional in an attempt for subtle humor (whether that works for you or not is another thing). But the voice acting is good, the story intriguing and it is definitely one of the better Broken Sword games.			"

												An engaging, but short adventure. The Broken Sword games as a whole have been compelling and number five offers many  thrills, much humor  and suspense, albeit in a small package. A few more locales and characters to interact with would have made this installment better. The hand drawn illustrations are some of the best I have seen in a modern game, if not rather unexpected in the digital age. The dialogue is both funny and charismatic. The mystery of the murders, the Tabula Veritatis and the ancient connection to Jehovah and Lucifer are interesting and may appeal to members of gnostic and catholic faiths. The ending is good, but brief. If George and Nico's outing had been shown, it would have been a satisfying finale. As the conclusion is, it leaves players wanting more, but also wishing the story had lasted longer.All in all, Broken Sword 5 is a fine game, worthy of praise, but a little lacking in depth. What it offers is interesting, but if the game had had a little more depth, it could have been as notable as the first.			"

Full disclosure - I pledged $15 to Broken Sword 5 on Kickstarter for a copy of the game.In the opening moments of Broken Sword 5, I was cast back to playing the original Broken Sword game back in the 90's. A peaceful afternoon in France is quickly transformed into a murder mystery... The story beats are classic Broken Sword fare; a crime is committed, there may have been a deeper motive behind this crime than is first apparent, and digging deeper begins to tug at the threads of a historical conspiracy.At first glance the 3D models used for the characters draw more attention to themselves than their hand-drawn and animated sprite counterparts of old, but this passes quickly. The background art is bright and vibrant and characterful, reminiscent of the previous old games (1 and 2, in particular). Voice actor Rolf Saxon returns for George Stobbart (and let's face it, it wouldn't be George without the same voice!), although Nico's voice actor has sadly been replaced. I must admit, however, that the change for Nico is not particularly jarring, with the new voice fitting in alongside George's well and you'll quickly forget that her voice was ever any different.I found the puzzles mostly satisfying, only getting stuck a few times over both episodes, and fortunately the game has a built in hints system that works really well. It's a tiered system, first offering a vague hint, then building as you ask for more info until it just gives you the complete solution. I feel this is the best possible system a point-and-click game can have in place, allowing you to still feel like you've solved the puzzle on the first few hints, and ultimately saves you alt-tabbing out of the game for a guide in the worst case scenario. I felt comfortable negotiating most of the puzzles myself, but a few tricky and obscure puzzles had me stuck until a few hints pointed me back onto the right path.A must-play for Broken Sword fans, and a great point'n'click game for those new to the series too. A few in-jokes may be missed, but you'll still enjoy the ride.			"

												Final installment of Broken Sword series. Probably the best story of the five, for me. The game is back in 2D, very nicely painted graphics. This time you can skip dialogues (yay!). OK so the story begins in Paris again (duh!) at an art gallery where George meets with Nicole right at the time a robbery occurs and a single painting gets stolen... The story thickens a lot and people who like the Da Vinci Code book should definitely give it a try.			"

They have bought that amazing art style back. The interface is so much similar to the original games and the character designs are so on spot! Nico finally looks like the Nico i fell in love with and not the constantly changing versions of BS 3 and 4. Voice acting remains top notch!Long story short, if you have played BS 1 and 2, you're gonna love this! If you havent, dont fret and still give it a try, you'll love it either way.I really hope a BS6 comes along and is similar to the graphic design and interface of this game.			"
