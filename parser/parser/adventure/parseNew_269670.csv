												BADLAND: Game of the Year Edition is a side-scrolling action adventure game developed by Frogmind. In BADLAND you take control of a small creature residing in a forest filled with deadly traps and obstacles, but where did these traps and obstacles come from? That is what you must find out. Along the way you'll come across many different pick-ups which will help you on your journey, some pick-ups will even clone your humble forest dweller! Creating an army of forest dwellers (clones) to take on whatever the forest throws at you.+Absolutely gorgeous art style+Incredibly good world design+Simple gameplay, you keep your clone airborne while avoiding obstacles and traps using one key/gamepad button+One hundred singleplayer levels, 100 multiplayer levels and 27 battle levels +Excellent level design+Great soundtrack and sound effects+Most levels have very frequent checkpoints which is great if you're like me and die a lot+A wide variety of pick-ups, many of which change the appearance of your clones+Lots of interaction with the environment to avoid traps and complete puzzles+The difficulty increases at a reasonable rate-Apart from in the trailer there isn't really a story which is somewhat disappointing-A few levels don't have checkpoints which is rather frustrating-The speed at which the screen scrolls is dependent on what pick-ups you have and what speed your clone is going at which means if you're going really fast and suddenly stop you're screwedWorth Noting:BADLAND was originally a mobile game and has been ported to Steam, I wouldn't have known it was a mobile game had it not said on the store page but I know some people really hate seeing mobile games on SteamDespite being called Game of the Year Edition, BADLAND has not been awarded this title on PC though it did win an iPad GOTY award from Apple on the app-storeVerdict:Worth Purchasing (8/10)BADLAND: GOTY is a great side-scrolling action adventure game with a gorgeous art style, great world design and simple gameplay.

												Control a floating black puffball through a gauntlet of things that want to kill it. The developers came up with a lot of great ideas to flesh out this concept. The powerups are imaginative and fun, and the level design works with them beautifully. The best stages are a blast to play through as you bounce through rapidly-spinning gears or navigate a whole swarm of puffballs through a shredding machine. Only one may survive, but hey, that's all you need!I wish I could end the review here and give this my recommendation. Unfortunately, about 30% of the levels in the second half of the game take place in near or complete darkness. You have to navigate through mazes with no feedback except the glowing eyes of your puffball failing to move towards the right as they bump up against an invisible wall. Then you die and start over - yes, there's a time limit of just a few seconds.Some levels pull this dark maze trick off, but it's only fun when you're controlling a whole swarm of puffballs, and you can use them as a sort of ""throwing flour on a ghost"" trick to work out where the walls are. But there were numerous times where I had no such option available and had to just (literally) bang my head against a wall until I found the correct path. BADLAND is a good game with a major flaw that comes up far too often. On the plus side, they are very generous with save points and you do have the ability to skip sections you've failed multiple times. If you play this, you'll get a lot of enjoyment, but also a great deal of frustration.			"

												Badland is gameplay-wise a wholesome, simplistic, and very fun sidescroller, which will occupy you for a long time with its uniquely challenging puzzles. But on the side of art design and atmosphere it is on a whole new level, rivaling some of the best indie games out there. It has a level of professionalism rarely seen in iOS to PC ports, and a level of immersion and beauty rarely seen in games as a whole.Gameplay:Badland is not mechanically deep, nor does it need to be. The gameplay is simple: get your small flying creature to the end of the level. There are puzzles, level geometry, and machines which stand in your way, and powerups which can serve as either a benefit or a hassle, and the levels dramatically increase in difficulty. Originally released on iOS devices, Badland was controllable with one button (or more accurately, one touch), but for this Game of the Year release, it has been rebalanced for a new control scheme allowing the player to move in any direction, with levels modified to accommodate, which adds an extra layer of depth and challenge. The controls feel incredibly fluid and smooth, and the game makes use of a realistically applied physics engine to increase the vivid, immersive feel of the movement and the game itself. There are even multiplayer and coop modes, local and playable with up to four players on one keyboard.This game gets much harder than you’d think!Art:Badland is artistically beautiful, with gorgeous background art, highly detailed level design, and incredible sound design, the latter of which is some of the best I've heard in any game. It immerses you in an atmospheric world of nature and beauty and mysterious machines. The silhouette level design reminds me of Limbo, but has its own unique feel within the context of this game as well.The story is told by the images in the background and how they evolve over time. Eventually you begin to question the world you are in, what happened to make it like this, and what role this small creature has to play. The atmosphere is sometimes peaceful and sometimes rather creepy. The visual art and level design are supplemented by the incredible sound design, immersive, ambient and very realistic. This is a great game to put on nice headphones, sit back and relax, and play, and it has a feature called “Flow Mode” which provides uninterrupted gameplay and minimalistic, text-free UI which is gorgeous and one of my favorite things about this game.Negatives:Here is the short list of things I don’t like about this version of the game. They are mostly just immersion-breaking more than anything else.-Achievement notifications: Steam has its own achievement notifications, but Badland adds another: a banner that covers the top portion of the screen and breaks immersion. I’m not a fan of that, but it’s only there for a couple seconds.-Camera: yes it is a sidescroller, and therefore the camera is supposed to be my enemy, but it still isn’t easy when the threat of the left wall of the screen is always directly behind you and you never get to look at the middle or right side of your monitor.In all:Badland was a standout showpiece on the iOS market, a place filled with the scum of the game industry, but here on Steam I can see that it will likely stand out less among more popular indie games. This is why I encourage you to get it: it’s a lovely experience, a wonderfully fun puzzle game, and a beautiful audiovisual presentation, and not something to be missed.			"

												BADLAND is a casual game made by studio Frogmind. You take control of a flappy furball animal somewhere deep in the forest where odd things happen because of alien machines full of traps. Well, actually, you take control of more than one furball, as almost every level will grant you the option of cloning them! Tens or hundreds or furballs that you will control with one button!The controls are really easy and intuitive - you have a button to flap (with all your furballs) and you just choose the direction of movement. You can do this either with your keyboard or gamepad (Xbox 360 controller worked flawlessly). To be not too much casual, this game will push on you by moving screen to the right - any furball that goes off-screen dies. But don't get discouraged, the game isn't made to be hard and there are usually checkpoints before and after more demanding parts of levels.You might think this is the extended version of popular mobile game Flappy Bird (made by Dong Nguyen in 2013), and you might be actually right - the main gameplay element is same, with added furball clones, specific gameplay changing mutators like faster sidescrolling or furball size change, and beautiful visual style based on silhouettes that you may know from LIMBO (made by Playdead in 2011).The game offers huge amount of content, as there are hundred levels optimised for both singleplayer and local multiplayer (there are just smaller differences between SP and MP levels). But that's not all, there are also thousands of custom levels!Even though BADLAND is originally a smartphone game, it didn't get just ported, it got a rework with focus on many details to feel great on PC. There are still new updates with even more content and bugfixes, it's great to see active indie developers. BADLAND fully deserves recommendation for what it is - entertaining sidescroller with beautiful graphics.			"

Basic InformationTitle:  BADLAND: Game of the Year EditionStatus:  ReleasedDeveloper:  FrogmindPublisher:  FrogmindGenre:  Side-ScrollerRelease Date:  26th of May, 2015Type:  Single-player and Local Co-OpGeneral ImpressionBADLAND was a mobile gaming hit sensation when it launched in 2013 for Android and iOS terminals. I should know, since I really enjoyed playing it back then as I still do now, through Steam. If you would be unfamiliar to mobile gaming, you might make a mistake in thinking that BADLAND has inspired itself from Flappy Bird, also a game from the spring of 2013. That one launched nearly two months after BADLAND and it’s inferior to it in nearly all regards except for an even higher scale of difficulty. It was most fortunate that the success of their project, convinced Frogmind to release the title on all gaming platforms in 2015. From consoles to Windows, Linux and even relatively obscure operating systems such as the ones implemented by Kindle and BlackBerry. If those aren’t clear signs of this game’s popularity and quality, I don’t know what else might be. Over 10 million BADLAND downloads through the Google Play Store alone, says it all.I rarely have any words of praise for mobile games since the vast majority are little more than lazy attempts and/or cash grabs. It would be a massive blunder if you’d judge BADLAND from the same perspective. It is among those 10% of all mobile games that can entertain and never feel like a time waste, while also featuring a more than decent production value. So why did I compare it to Flappy? Well in BADLAND you also use pressure sensitive controls (or button-mashing for keyboards) in order to traverse levels through flight and obstacle avoiding. Control scheme itself is simple to understand but a bit harder to master on later levels that involve both speed and precision. You can jump-start our furry protagonist(s) with either the W key or Up and maneuver across the stage with A, D or Left and Right. The level design itself is both a blessing and a curse. Apart from the razor-sharp spinning wheels, lazers, moving gears and falling rocks which will instantly kill you, special care must be taken in regards to the haste and agility with which you must fly, tumble, roll through the level from start and all the way to it’s vacuum finish. The stage moves independently of your maneuvers so you fail and have to restart to the nearest checkpoint (mercifully, those are always in ample supply), unless you hurry up constantly. That gameplay mechanic by itself, sets it apart from your run-of-the-mill puzzle/platformers. Coupled with other features such as the possibility to control multiple furries (I call them that, but they aren’t really describable in animal terms) or clones, in your attempt to pass the stage with as many of them by your side. In some instances, you will need to use them to activate power-ups that can enlarge or shrink them enough to pass through narrow spaces or demolish obstacles with their increased weight. Not a dull moment in sight.And that would be impossible since the game’s popular with not only gamers or game journalists but most importantly folks who dedicate some of their spare time, in creating new and exciting levels for all BADLAND players to test out and enjoy. This wouldn’t be a GOTY version on Steam if collectors of all types were neglected, am I right? Achievements and Trading Cards are just the cherries on top of a cake that was more than fine even without them. You can’t go wrong if you purchase this title even outside of Steam Sales. Sure, you can still play the game on your smartphone for free but developers such as Frogmind deserve our full support. And hopefully we shall have BADLAND 2 on the Steam Store soon enough.Strong Points+ Beautiful art style and relaxing sounds.+ Seemingy simple yet addictive gameplay that is never repetitive.+ Huge replay value through user-created content.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- A bit  too difficult at times.Rating 90/100  This review was submitted for ReviewExperts, through the generous contribution of Daniël - REX ♥ Gaming.

BADLAND: Game of the Year Edition is a charming adventure/puzzle game with lots of levels and it offers really good gameplay. Previously for mobile devices, this game has now been ported to Steam-powered devices.If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.What is happening in the game:You, as a cute fluffy flying spinning cloning bouncing sticking dying respawning resizing reshaping creature, have to fly across the levels without dying and you have to finish with as many clones as you can. Simple as that.Pros: Visuals are simple, charming and great to look at. The character is really cute and the whole look of the game just makes you keep playing. The puzzling side of the game is great. You are not told anything, you have to figure things out by yourself. Usually, it's not hard, the hard part is actually completing the stage once you figure out how. And when you do, you feel like you accomplished something. There are a lot of levels. Really, you will need a lot of hours to complete them all. There are 100 of them and they usually last a few minutes, depending on how bad you are (or how good). There are even multiplayer and co-op levels built in, in case you run out of levels. If you are more of a couch player, this game fully supports controllers. For a port, this game plays really great. Apart from the obvious Windows support, you can also play this game on MacOS and Linux/SteamOS. Trading Cards, Cloud Support, Steam Leaderboards, Achievements ... this game has taken Steam seriously! Low system requirements, this game will run on pretty much anything.Cons: When you first launch the game, it just throws you straight into the first level. In case someone would want to check the setting first or anything like that, this can be slightly annoying. Some level are extremely hard, much harder than the ones preceding and following it.The final verdict:This is one of those games you just can't stop playing. Its art, music, levels, it all combines into a near-perfect experience and you will most certainly have a great time playing it.In case you want to try it out first, you can download free Android version here. And if you enjoy it, which you certainly will, be sure to buy it on Steam. You won't regret it.Greetings,BirdCuteNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

												BADLAND: GOTY is a interesting action adventure game with puzzle elements. This game originally released for mobile devices, after that later a developers decided do a PC port.You are a small creature, and find yourself in a dark forest with a lot of traps and barriers, your goal is to find a way out from there. The control in game enough simple, you just should use a WASD or arrows. In you way you found a lot of different boosters what you should pick up if you want escape from there. This booster for example re-size you, clone etc.Game have a single player, coop and versus modes. For all modes you can find a tons of levels, so you will not be bored even you play longer time this game.The game graphic style looks awesome, but in some parts for me too dark. The music and sounds also awesome.+challenging+tons of levels+steam cards and achievements +leaderboards+awesome graphic style+awesome music and sounds+coop-a bit to dark in some level parts-in some levels can be frustratingSo i think this game is looks very nice and if you are a fan of action/adveture games its game is must buy for you.

												This game can get really addictive. It's like Flappy bird on drugs. Basically you control the bird type creature and have to get through levels and go into some vaccum type things at the end of each level. The game adds power ups like mmultiply the birn into many clones, bird shrinker and expander, sticky bird which can survive sawblades,, accelerators etc. There are puzzles added and you have to strategize your  flight according to that. The screen keeps moving so you have to stay ahead of it, if you get stuck and the screen passes you, you will die. Controls are very simple you just use the directional pad and use 'w' or 'up' key to fly. You can tap and it'll fly like the Flappy bird or you can hold the key and it'll keep flying until it hits the cieling.The game can be difficult at times but thanks to generous checkpoint system, it's not really a problem. Graphics and sound are cool and keep you immersed.Recommended, check out gameplay videos and if you like this sort of puzzle/action game you'd love this.			"

												For an iOS game ported onto PC, this game really impressed me. Yeah it's an iOS port but it's a good port that one ups it's the original. PC version exclusively includes local co-op mode, vs. mode and full gamepad support. Best of all it includes a level editor. Personally I loved this game for the first few hours, it's addicting and the puzzles are fun. Although I did get bored of it after a while, then again I can see how other people love this game, there is so much content. Especially when playing with an extra person. The visuals are top notch but the gameplay is a bit like flappy bird (please don't give me crap for this). I know, this game came before flappy bird but we all know this game overshadowed this. The controls are very well responsive, so if you die it is your own doing. It does get a little repetitive and times and frustrating but it is fun. 7/10			"

												One of many fantastic 2D platformers, this game does not fail to entertain. Take your fluffy winged friends through bad lands and navigate obstacles as you immerse yourself into this wild adventure. I suggest using a headphone to appreciate the game environment.The objective is to safely negotiate each level while also trying to save as many clones as possible. There are power ups that speed up the flight or slow you down. The remaining ones either bulk you up or shrink you to a tiny spot on screen. I really enjoy using the latter.It all comes down to timing the flight well. Its challenging and fun. Fun because the key bindings are very simple and, challenging because you gotta be one step ahead and use exactly the required number of power ups to either squeeze through or wreck your way in a big way!How you fail a level you ask? Get ready to receive a good crushing from falling rocks and heavy machinery. Or just stop flight and let the moving screen drag over you and pop your eyes open! And the respawn starts at very convenient checkpoints, so there is no frustration over repeated tries unlike the flappy bird game where you just wanna crush those wide lipped 'birds' for being flappy for nothing!The ""Colorful Side Scroll Edition"" AwardI rate this game 10/10			"

												Never played it on smartphone, I'm not quite the mobile player, but it's so fun on PC, I can guarantee it, and from what I understand, it's made to be even better than the mobile version.It's ridiculously easy to play and laugh with it. The first levels I played them instinctively, but after I few more I saw the game requires some thinking too. It's relaxing, and incredibly optimized to play even on older laptops like mine at a constant 30fps (even 60fps) in HD graphics. It's flow and controls allowed me to finish some levels while talking on the phone, sharing with someone dear the joy I have.I believe Badland teaches us about making sacrifices in order to pass over some obstacles. It teaches us how our way in life is full of obstacles, but in order to survive and reach our goals we must never stop.			"

BADLAND: Game of the Year Edition is a side-scrolling adventure/puzzle game with lots of content, awesome graphics and excellent level design. Made by a finnish studio Frogmind. Previously only for mobile devices, this game has been ported to Steam-powered devices. It's a one-button physics game: touching the screen causes a troupe of silhouetted gremlins to fly forward and upward; releasing your finger allows them to float to the ground.Yes, the controls are really easy and intuitive. You can play either with your keyboard or gamepad. To be not too much casual, this game will push on you by moving screen to the right - any furball that goes off-screen dies. And the first levels are easy but the following require more patience and concentration. But don't get discouraged, the game isn't made to be hard and there are usually checkpoints before and after more demanding parts of levels.BADLAND: Game of the Year Edition is artistically beautiful, with gorgeous background art, highly detailed level design, and incredible sound design (great game to put on nice headphones to feel game atmosphere).

As I knew the game, I don't think twice. I recommend buying on sale because the full price I think is very expensive when you have free play on the mobile version. But the game is very good.BADLAND: Game of the Year Edition maintains the same good structure and beautiful appearance of the original on mobile system. It has a level of professionalism rarely seen to PC ports, and a level of immersion and beauty rarely seen in games as a whole.Currently  BADLAND  is available on all mobile platforms, and has been released as GOTY Edition for Xbox One, PS4, PS3, PS Vita, Wii U and Steam.  BADLAND  has been downloaded more than 45 million times. The sequel, BADLAND 2, was launched in December 2015 and continued the success of the original. With all these things, this game is easy to reccommend. I encourage you to get it: it’s a lovely experience, a wonderfully fun puzzle game, and a beautiful audiovisual presentation.			"

												Badland is one of those games that, at a glance, seems like it must be good. Visually, it's very impressive. It has simple core gameplay with some neat mechanics. Unfortunately, after giving this game chance after chance, I'd have to say that none of that means this game is actually any good.It's not all about the controls, but that's as fair a place as any to start. Trying to control your fluffy blob thing is a chore - it feels like simply to play the game you have to fight a constant battle against the controls. In open space, it isn't utterly terrible, but if you have the misfortune of contacting any background object? Anything could happen, and in this game, 'anything' generally means you end up falling off the left side of the screen to your death. This is especially an issue when you run into a 'puzzle'. There are basically two kinds of puzzles: one where you have to die repeatedly smashing yourself into the environment to figure out what part of it moves, and one where you know immediately what you have to do but trying to actually convince the controls to do that takes a frustratingly large number of attempts. Neither are particularly innovative.Now, to be fair, I haven't even mentioned the wide variety of powerups you can get. You can get a wide variety of powerups, most of which are used purely for the riveting gameplay of 'pick up exactly the right powerups or you die'. There are also 'clone' and 'superclone' powerups which give you a small (or large) army of fluffy blobs, and the levels that essentially amount to 'send your army of dudes through this obstacle course at high speed' are actually moderately fun. Far too often, though, having multiple dudes just means you'll eventually have to try to control multiple dudes at once (remember the controls? yeah, they're terrible) to do different things. This exponential misery is especially great because there's no way to actually control them separately - often you're reduced to smashing several dudes at a dividing point and hoping they end up going down different paths so that they can do whatever they need to do to advance you in the level.There's also a fairly well-documented phenomenon where the background of the level becomes extremely dark, which as you might imagine makes everything worse. I have no idea whether it's a bug, but every time I experienced it, restarting the game caused it to stop happening.The last straw (not as in 'the straw that broke the camel's back', as in the last chronological straw piled on the back of a camel that is already dead oh god why are you adding more straws) came when I decided that I would play through the entire game before reviewing it, regardless of how painful that might be, so that I could really give a complete picture of the game, and just in case it somehow magically became a good game right near the end. I fought my way to the next-to-last level (lasers, by the way, are quite a nice mechanic and it's a shame they're only in the last few levels), got a fair distance into it, and the game crashed to desktop. I opened it up again, got a bit farther this time, and it crashed again. I opened it up a third time, and it immediately crashed the first time I tried to pause.So, I mean, if you want a game to look at, it's great. If you want good gameplay, on the other hand, you might be better off looking elsewhere.Honestly, though, even if you really think you want this game, just get the (free) mobile version. I wouldn't be surprised if the controls are smoother there as well.			"

The game designers really though this one through. It's hard enough to be absolutely sure you won't make it, but in the end you always do because in the previous level they taught you everything you needed to know to finish this level succesfully. This is how great gameplay should be. + easy controls+ pick-ups make it challenging+ great puzzle/platformer level design + lovely design + actually, everything is great			"

												This game is fine for a time-waster, but it's not a good puzzle game and there's far better options out there.  If you have tons of time to kill, have at it.  If your gametime is precious, skip this one.  It's just trial-and-error-grow, shrink, speed up, and so on.  It takes time to figure out solution, but doesn't require any actual problem solving or thought.			"

												The game is mostly pretty good, but for me and a few other people the game begins crashing on the later levels. The crashes are random but they always occur at about the middle of the level, and force you to start it again from the beginning. If you press escape to bring up the menu after every new checkpoint the game saves it so you can continue from them after you start it up again, but it breaks the flow of the game and is very annoying. I contacted support, but after waiting 2 weeks they just replied that they are aware that this happens with a few people with nvidia gpus on levels with lasers, but have no idea how to fix it. Because of this i cannot reccomend this game.			"

												I've had Badland on Android since 2014, but finally picked up the PC version in a Humble Bundle. I was hopeful that playing multiplayer on a television with controllers would be better than having everyone crowded around a tablet, and I was right! Below is what I wrote about it back in 2014[medium.com]:At first glance you might want to call Badland an infinite flyer. But there are enough major differences that I do not think it quite fits. Much like infinite flyers, you have one basic control: touch to fly up, don’t touch to drop down. However, in most infinite flyers touching anything results in death. In Badland there are many things that will kill you, but usually the floor and ceiling are safe. Instead the game is based around set obstacles that you must get past.There are two main ways to lose. Contact with objects like saws, lasers, or getting squished between two otherwise harmless objects will kill you. Falling behind the camera also results in failure. Usually the camera continues forward at a slow but unstoppable pace. There are exceptions, like during maze sections where the camera will kindly wait for you to complete the puzzle. Failure is not the end of the world like most infinite flyers. Instead the game is riddled with checkpoints, usually placed right before each obstacle or puzzle.Badland spices things up with power ups found throughout levels. Some make you smaller, some bigger, some bouncy, some sticky, etc. Usually they are strategically placed to help you get past the next obstacle. As with any good puzzle game, Badland takes the limited number of different elements and combines them in new, more challenging ways as the game progresses to keep itself fresh.I have never played a game with a setting quite like Badland’s. It is a jungle world with pieces of abandoned advanced technology lying about. You see this world as a small creature trying to survive the day in this deadly world. The art style does a great job of presenting this beautiful world. The backgrounds are vividly colored, seemingly handpainted panoramas of huge objects in the distance. The objects in the foreground (as in, everything that you interact with in the game) are almost completely black. You might think that the background would distract from the important objects, but it did not. In fact, I only noticed things in the background if I was in an area with a lull in obstacles. I started to imagine what kinds of events might be happening on this world, what awesome sci-fi adventures were happening that my little fuzzy animal was completely unaware of. I also thought about all the hilarious ways that this little animal’s journey might be inadvertently affecting the world around it.There is no soundtrack to speak of in Badland. Instead, ambient jungle sounds permeate quietly throughout. Many obstacles make sounds, such as the buzzing of a saw or the sizzle of a laser. Honestly I did not miss the existence of a soundtrack until I looked in my humble library and realized that the game came with no music.There are 70 levels (not including community-made levels,) divided into different times of day. They of course get progressively more difficult. There are also goals besides simply reaching the end of a level. Throughout many levels you can get power ups that clone the little creature. The more clones that make it to the end, the better. It becomes very difficult to keep them all alive however, because they all obey your command to go up or down at the same time. Each level has three different objectives to complete, such as saving a certain number of creatures or collecting all the power ups in the level. It is the kind of game that I have enjoyed completing, but I doubt I will ever fully beat it.There is also a hilarious local multiplayer mode where up to four people control different creatures making their way through the same level together. It is competitive, so whoever makes it farthest wins. This multiplayer mode works best on larger screens, and it is the first game that I can think of that makes perfect sense to play on Android TV.			"

												BADLAND is an excellent party game with local co-op and versus, but it stands up well in single player. It is easy to pick up and hard to put down. It has a good mix of twitch and puzzling. There are plenty of levels and achievements to keep you occupied. There are many chaotic and exhilarating moments. The difficulty curve and introduction of new mechanics is just right.			"

												Gorgeous graphics,, extremely repetitive and tedious gameplay.  Might be ok on mobile, but out of place on PC.PROS:-Wonderful background graphics-Good silhouette foreground graphics (for the most part)-Good number of game mechanicsCONS:-Some areas are too dark in the background, and since there is no graphical method of distinguishing the foreground and the background, it can be hard to see exactly where the level is (not major, but does happen time to time when the background gets really dark, the foreground blends into it).-Frustrating and tiring control scheme (tap up constantly among other issues)-MUCH more suited to a touch/mobile interface; on PC, it is very out of place. -Despite the mechanics introduced, gameplay is very tedious and involves a small bit of repetition at times (for example, you have to choose to go top way or bottom way....but one of them guarantees you to your death so you just repeat and choose the other path next time). -Not entirely sure what dictates how many ""eggs"" I get when completing a level; there is no end-level user interface, it simply goes to a black screen and loads the next level but when you get back to the menu you will see that each level is worth up to 3 eggs.

												The game is really good. If your looking for a Limbo like puzzle game mixed with a little flappy bird then this is for you. Badland is a really fun game. It has puzzles that are fun and not overly frustrating. At least, until you get to the impossable ones near the end. It was fun to play and I only spent 2 bucks on it. Sadly the doomsday levels and user created levels are impossabily hard and I told myself after super meat boy that I'd never play the impossable levels again. Its just not worth it. For the fun stuff, its really fun. I just wish the game had the ability to create lobbies so you can play multiplayer better. A very good game for a cheap price. This is a mobile game worth playing.			"

I love how sometimes you just have to sacrifice yourself to allow the other player to move forward but you know that vey soon he will grab a ""friends"" blob (that's what we call them"" and get you back in the game.  It's fast paced and almost always funny!  If you find this on sale, it's a must buy, for 10.00 bucks I'd even say it's worth it for the amount of enjoyment you'll get as long as you are playing coop with a friend.			"

												This game is great!  For those who have played the app, the game is almost the same, with the same levels as far as I can tell. Controls for left and right have been added (and the levels have been slightly modified to accommodate), but the gameplay feels the same. The levels still constantly scroll, meaning the puzzles remain intact.  Multiplayer becomes much easier when everyone has a controller and doesn't have to huddle around a tablet screen.You play as a cute species of creatures navigating their way through a forest being overtaken with machines. There's an implication of a storyline, but it doesn't have a resolution (yet?). I'm hoping the developers will come out with a definitive ending to the adventure in the future. In the past they have mentioned that more levels are planned.The controls are extremely simple, but the gameplay becomes very difficult. You will die a lot, but every time you lose you are only sent back a few seconds earlier in the level, so it never becomes too frustrating. The puzzles are clever, and many are based on trial and error.  The sounds and graphics are spectacular, and provide an immersive experience when you play with headphones.The multiplayer aspect of the game (it's 4 player) is very well thought out. Those who have played more will consistently defeat beginners in the competitive mode, but in the cooperative mode, everyone has fun regardless of skill level. When you die, your teammates will either revive you within a few seconds, or everyone will die, starting at the previous checkpoint with everyone back again, so no one gets frustrated, and everyone feels like they’re contributing. It's entertaining to watch, and there's a lot of discussion because teamwork becomes essential as the difficulty increases.I highly recommend this game! If you have the app and only play single player, you won't see much by way of new content. But if you play multiplayer, it works much better here. If you don't have the app, this game is a must!			"

Badland is gameplay-wise a wholesome, simplistic, and very fun sidescroller, which will occupy you for a long time with its uniquely challenging puzzles. But on the side of art design and atmosphere it is on a whole new level, rivaling some of the best indie games out there. It has a level of professionalism rarely seen in iOS to PC ports, and a level of immersion and beauty rarely seen in games as a whole.Gameplay:Badland is not mechanically deep, nor does it need to be. The gameplay is simple: get your small flying creature to the end of the level. There are puzzles, level geometry, and machines which stand in your way, and powerups which can serve as either a benefit or a hassle, and the levels dramatically increase in difficulty. Originally released on iOS devices, Badland was controllable with one button (or more accurately, one touch), but for this Game of the Year release, it has been rebalanced for a new control scheme allowing the player to move in any direction, with levels modified to accommodate, which adds an extra layer of depth and challenge. The controls feel incredibly fluid and smooth, and the game makes use of a realistically applied physics engine to increase the vivid, immersive feel of the movement and the game itself. There are even multiplayer and coop modes, local and playable with up to four players on one keyboard.This game gets much harder than you’d think! But I totally recommend you playing in Co-op with friends having on your TV with big picture mode with controllers! Playing with friends take the game to the next level and makes it more fun. Art:Badland is artistically beautiful, with gorgeous background art, highly detailed level design, and incredible sound design, the latter of which is some of the best I've heard in any game. It immerses you in an atmospheric world of nature and beauty and mysterious machines. The silhouette level design reminds me of Limbo, but has its own unique feel within the context of this game as well.The story is told by the images in the background and how they evolve over time. Eventually you begin to question the world you are in, what happened to make it like this, and what role this small creature has to play. The atmosphere is sometimes peaceful and sometimes rather creepy. The visual art and level design are supplemented by the incredible sound design, immersive, ambient and very realistic. This is a great game to put on nice headphones, sit back and relax, and play, and it has a feature called “Flow Mode” which provides uninterrupted gameplay and minimalistic, text-free UI which is gorgeous and one of my favorite things about this game. Badland is truly a must try game with stunning visuals, awesome gameplay supporting 4 player co-op, Steam Achievements & Steam Trading cards support! GO FOR IT!!! 9/10 "

												evels can be challenging but not too much for my taste. All the more satisfying to pass them. The co-op and versus multiplayer modes are surprisingly fun with friends. We ended up playing a few hours in a single session and had plenty of laughs. The gameplay is simple yet challenging. And the level design is really good. You may tend to think that you have seen what the game has to offer within the first 15 minutes and I came close to thinking that too. But each level brings something new keeping the gameplay fresh and enjoyable. There are plenty of checkpoint but also a few levels completely without. Some of those can be a bit too difficult but man it feels awesome once you manage to ace them. The art design and atmosphere are excellent and the uniquely challenging puzzles creative. Was definitely worth it for me			"

												Let me just say that I was one of the first to buy this game when it came out on Android, and it became my favorite mobile game. It still is! And when I saw it was ported onto Steam, I bought it ASAP. What do I think of the port? It's great. It can be a bit unnerving to be able to go backwards now, unlike the mobile version, but it is a very minor problem that I quickly adjusted to.The art is fantastic, the atmosphere sometimes sunny, sometimes scary, but always mysterious. There is no soundtrack, but the ambience and sound effects greatly add to the tone.This version has bonus worlds, which really expands the game from what it used to be.And multiplayer has never been better. It was amazing on Android, the great race against your friends to see who can best survive the chaotic environment. Not only does this game have more unique multiplayer levels, it also has an added co-op too!The power-ups are fun, I love becoming a mammoth beast that crushes everything, or a swarm of swift creatures that are difficult to kill in numbers.The difficulty of levels increases nicely too, and I never find myself too frustrated to continue the game.So do I reccomend this game? Of course! From its great visuals to entertaining gameplay, it is truly a gem. It may not be my favorite game on Steam (Papers, Please, but THAT'S another review), but BADLANDS is definitely an entertaining game to pick up.			"

												It seems likes physics-based puzzle platformers are all going with the black foreground.  There isn't anything really wrong with that: Limbo, NightSky, and BADLAND are all very pretty games.  Badland falls short of the other two, though.  It rushes the player through the world in the pursuit of frantic action, without giving much depth to the action that it provides.  More often than not, puzzles are solved through blind luck.  Even still, the mediocre gameplay would be allright if it came with a nice soundtrack or compelling story... which this game does not.  Pick this up for idle amusement on a mobile device if you like, but there are better ways to spend your time on a PC.			"

												SO GOOD! Its basically a 2D physics game. It's no wonder it's award winning. TRY IT ON YOUR PHONE FIRST! Its free on the app stores and its the full game just with ads between levels AKA a great way to TRY before you BUY.  The phone version is literally the exact same game too. Overall:+Great replayability+Amazing visual artwork+Keeps you interested by swithcing up gameplay frequently-glitches every once in a while so you have to restart game to fix			"

												badland is in an incredible fun and unqiue game with challenging but enjoyable gameplay.Badland is a mobile port. I have played the original and I thoroughly enjoyed it on android and I thorughly enjoyed it on there. Having played this version I was very sceptical about it being released on PC. The controls of the game on mobile are extremely simple. All you do is tap the screen to go up and let go to go down. I didn't think this would work out well for a PC game.What badlands does to combat this problem is introduce a simple but definitely well needed feature. They make it so you can go left and right. You may think I seem completely crazy even advertising this as a feature, but trust me, without it the game would feel so bland on PC. As far as I can see the levels have also been edited to go with this change and you do need to use the movement to get to certain parts of the level. Not as much as I would have hoped though. The majority of the game you do still only use up. Which can make the game drag at some points. Outside of the trailer the game has no story. The trailer basically tells the story of them being clones and that is about it. I would have personally liked some kind of basic story but it isn't entirely necessary. You should definitely watch that trailer by the way because it is incredible!The challenge of the game is provided by use of obstacles and power ups. The screen moves along automatically. You need to try and keep up with this. If your character ends up going off the screen you will fail. There are also obstacles with spikes and such to avoid as well  and these get increasingly hard to avoid as you go along through the game. Pretty standard gameplay really but it still does what it needs to do well.But the real thing that gets the gameplay going is the powerups. You start the game with a few standard power ups that you can pick up during levels. These include size powerups to make your clone bigger or smaller, clone powerups to make copies of yourself and many more. You unlock more as you go throughout the game. The powerups are necessary for you to progress through the levels and you need to make sure to use them correctly to progress. This adds a real great element to the standard gameplay presented.Now what you will probably notice immediately is the incredible graphics the game has. It adds a real nice style and nice depth of colour to the gameplay. Many of the levels give a very dark vibe and then others give a nice colourful vibe. These contrast well with each other. I'm not certain, but I believe the PC version also has had a high upgrade in the graphics and looks way better.The biggest problem I found with badland is the laziness of parts of the mobile port. The menu seems to have just been ported straight over, without being edited, from mobile. This means that to navigate parts of the menu you have to slide your mouse accross the screen. While this method of control works great on mobile it isn't nice to have to do this with a mouse. You then just have the fact that the menu looks extremely mobile like. I mean the buttons are rather simplified to fit with a small screen on mobile. You even have a facebook and twitter button. The options menu does mostly stick with this trend as well. Initially the only option your presented with is a sound slider. It is only one slider and there are no seperate sliders for music and sounds or anything else. You do also have a very basic graphics options menu. This includes HD graphics, bloom, V-sync and fullscreen. But there are no resolution options or other customizable graphics options. There is also a controls menu with completely rebindable keys.Overall I have to say that I did thoroughly enjoy playing badland and will definitely go back to it and enjoy the highly challenging gameplay. I am nowhere near to completing it and I can only imagine it will get much harder. I would definitely recommend it to any fan of a challenging platformer. And the price is cheap for it as well!TheIronicGamers rating system Don't ever buy this game. Maybe consider it on a sale. An average game.A good game that should definitely be considered.A must play!Disclaimer: I was provided with a free review copy by the developer to right this review with.			"

												I cannot even begin to comprehend how this game has an average ""very positive"" rating. It's nothing more than a tanked up, prettyfied ""Helicopter Game""...or even a slightly enhanced ""Flappy Bird"" if you prefer.It's obviously a mobile game, and indeed that's what the ""GOTY"" tag refers to...It did win Game of the Year. On the Apple App Store. Not the iPhone. Just the iPad. That seems an overtly narrow category. Best game. On iOS. On the iPad. In 2013.There really is nothing to it...move from left to right, avoid the obstacles and try not to let the scrolling overtake you. That's it. That's the entire game. Aside from some new obstacles every now and then, it's the same thing. For 166 LEVELS. Seriously. I made it through eight before I switched off in sheer boredom. It also has ""missions"" which mostly seem to involve playing levels you've already played. And there's almost FIVE HUNDRED of them. WHY? If that's not enough, there are also over 40,000 user-generated levels. Seriously.And...why is it labelled as an ""action adventure platformer""? The objective is to AVOID the ground...surely that by definition means it's not a platformer? It's also not an adventure as there doesn't seem to be any story either.Boring. Boring. Boring.			"

												Don't be fooled by the 'game of the year edition' in the title. This game does not deserve GOTY status. This is a flappybird clone with powerups. There is no satisfaction or reward for completing a level. Rather it feels like a game of chance that you completed the level.This game should have stayed on mobile devices.			"

												[9.4 - AWESOME!]There is a truth that the world's gaming community has always concentrated discussed the results ""blockbuster"" during the second half of this year. Evidence that no one can deny the attraction of the Dying Light, Grand Theft Auto V or The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.Like a habit, every year AAA titles launched to satisfy the thirst of fans, and of course, help companies earn huge profits.However, I myself noticed that the big firms, ""scrambling"" product launch can create an invisible wall, and cover many small but worthwhile projects.Temporary bypass lengthy preamble and rambling on, today I am very pleased to introduce to you read about BADLAND: Game of the Year Edition - The game was developed by Frogmind - an independent game company from Finland - with a starting point from mobile platforms. Hopefully readers will not waste a single moment when I discovered the game.------------------CLONY--------------------------Just Imagine for a mysterious creature in the woods called Clony. Its identifying characteristics: Round Round, plump, and wearing his wings ruffled feathers. On one morning, he woke up, it still is it, but today forests to other truth. Yes, the machinery ...-------------------------I LOVE-----------------------------------+WHEN PEOPLE ARE ... VANDALS!Well, the humans is who destroy the environment, destroy natural. They cut the trees, they deforest, they repel all species with death machines. The truth is always easier to destroy build something, and we did, doing it every day, right?Storyline of BADLAND: Game of the Year Edition extends through two days of Clony pitiful adventure. It will ""be"" gradually feel the change of the forest - the home of it - to every little one: From early morning when the neighbors are not awake, suddenly there was something bothering him and the entire forest in the noonday sun; until dark, it struggled to escape the deadly chaos there.Clony not a single creature, but you will gradually see the changes through each screen play: All gradually disappeared in the destruction of science!BADLAND: Game of the Year Edition does not make players feel frustrated. 2D graphics with nature scene made me think to Ori and the Blind Forest, but is somewhat darker, more mysterious.Background music in the game is essentially ""symphony"" of all species, and it will change according to the circumstances taking place. Imagine that music would be like if the machinery destroyed the forests?+VERY ATTRACTIVE!BADLAND: Game of the Year Edition has not only a good story or beautiful graphics (and cute too), the gameplay itself was also very great then.Just one morning (in the game), players were able to become familiar with the remote operation of three navigation buttons (up, left, right) to help ""baby"" cute Clony fly and move under the ""helicopter control system"". Your job is to move from the starting point to endpoint.In theory, everything is easy, but the difficulty of the game increases with each game screen. It's no exaggeration to say that to a certain level, players will feel bitter ... because of dying constantly!You will gradually get acquainted with the power-ups (actually some special chemicals) help small chemical Clony big variable, fly fast or slow glide ""Clone Technique"" ... and above all do rhythm game become transformed over.Just one second slower reaction, or even a ""miss"" voracious another big variable results only, Clony will probably be stuck in the cavity because ... big bottom. Meanwhile, the screen will constantly go from left to right, try not to be left behind!If that were not enough, please rest assured, because along the way you'll also encounter the deadly trap: crushed stone, sawing machines, oblique, crushers and many other things will require players to not only react nhanhn but also performed a little tactics to survive.BADLAND: Game of the Year Edition only has 100 levels - in which the main storyline did over 80 levels - but perhaps no one can complain about a game platform charismatic and challenging so be .--------------------------DISLIKE--------------------------+A LITTLE DISAPPOINTMENT...BADLAND: Game of the Year Edition is really good, and probably the game could be perfect if you like to be cared in the multiplayer section.Indeed, in Section teamplay (Co-op) and countervailing (in Section Multiplayer) can support up to 4 players, however, only on one computer and can not play with a friend over the network .

												This is a great game for killing a bit of time, but beware, it can be addictive. You can easily start a level, get in a rhythm, and lose an hour or two. If you've played the mobile version, it's very similar, but I thought it was easier to control the character. It offers a good challenge, the art is very nice, it runs smoothly for me - IMO, there aren't any negatives to BADLAND.			"

												Like a poor man's Limbo crossed with Flapy Bird, only not as clever as the former or as addictive as the latter.The gameplay consists of holding right and pressing A sometimes. There's supposed to be puzzles in there somewhere, but most of it can be passed using the previously mentioned right and A combination. The levels are short and fairly uninteresting; as is the sound. About the only redeeming feature the game has is some decent background visuals.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It might be ok on mobile, but there's far better on pc. I'm glad I got this very, very cheap in a sale, but even so, I wish I could still refund it now.			"

												I'm not a fan of limbo or World of goo, and the game looked a bit alike, so i had the feeling I would not like the  game much despite the good reviews. Oh was i wrong, gave it a chance and got it on a sale,  this game is a great time waster and very addicting. I think there is no key remap, normally this would be a gamebreaker for me, but in this case the controls are so simple that i could not care less.Tecnically the game seems to be flawless so far and the backgrounds are cute.It has multiplayer, and you can even find a map editor online, though i haven't tried them yet.

It makes the game unenjoyable, because it far oversteps the boundary between being a fun challenge and being impossible to genuinely enjoy. The controls are incredibly difficult to handle, making maneuvering an irritating task. On top of all that, on numerous levels, the background is so dark that you can't see what your surroundings or what you're doing. If you're looking for a rage-fest, this game is great for you!			"

												Before the release for windows a bit more than a month ago, this game has been my absolute favorite on mobile since over a year, rather the only one I played there, because I'm not really convinced in games on my phone.Now played on steam, I think it is well accomplished. So that I gues everyone who already knows and likes it from the mobile, should try it here and similarly vice versa, too.			"

												Great art style.  Frustrating gameplay.  Get stuck constantly.  Reminds me of the old Mighty Bomb Jack, where the physics were just unforgiving enough to be more annoying than novel.  I didn't care for the game, but at the steam seasonal sale prices you could probably do a lot worse for your money.  My vote's a no, but I'll revisit the title again next year.			"

												This game just flat out doesn't work on Steam OS the developer has been contacted and just plain and simply doesn't care. He recognises that there is a problem and will not put in any effort to debug and fix this issue. Avoid this game if you either have Steam OS or just want the developers of you games to actually respond and be helpful if you have issues which are clearly their fault.			"

Product received for free
												I first played this game on the iPad when it was first released so I've had experience and understanding of the game's basic concepts.As a single player game, it is quite easy early on, but then it gets challenging as the difficulty starts to rise. You will need trial-and-error to fully understand the obstacles ahead, unless you have Flash-like reflexes.But the main reason that I bought this game was for the local splitscreen co-op. It's really fun to play with friends and occasionally troll them to their deaths.Still, It's not perfect and gets repetitive. I would recommend waiting for a sale if you are planning to buy this game.			"

												Before I write the review, I just want to say how awesome the people at Frogmind (the people who made the game) are. They did something on Facebook where the first 50 people who message them would get a free Steam key, which I sadly missed. However, I contacted them anyway, and they gave me one! It's so nice nice to see a company who values their customers so highly. Anyway, onto the review.I got this game on iPad about half a year ago, and it was one of my favourite games. It has a really nice art style, and the physics are awesome. Even when you complete single player, multiplayer never gets boring. Indeed, how can it be, when you are constantly knocking your friends into circular saws or blowing them up. I always appreciated the regular updates, which constantly brought in new content, something which I expect they will continue in the new game.I really like the function in GOTY edition that allows you to move back, something that I always wanted in the first game. It also has 4 times as much content as the original one, and 15 hours of playing time, which is ridiculous for just £6.99. It seems a realistic estimate as well, considering how long it has taken me to get as far as I am.The only 2 asks I have of this game are: bring in online multiplayer (which according to their website they are already considering), and please add in a level customizer, it would be so awesome!Overall, this is a great game, which I would definitely reccomend getting.

												Badland GOTY edtion.... what ?not another GOTY game... ? yes... but its worth it, if you havent already got the game in your libary YES.... What a wonderful looking game.. yes it's the great looking, simple but great. Think of Limbo, but with colour. You start of with your character Clony, blinking at you waiting for your to bring him/her to life. With a click of the key/button, Clony starts to fly up ....keep pressing.... Clony flys high... but you also need to move to the right. Yes Badland is a side scroller. You need to navigate through the badland... You have to move around moving cogs, spike bombs and many more interseting things. As you move towards the levels end you met other Clony on your way. This is were it might sound like a nightmare.... but you will have to offer some of them, to give yourself a chance to complete the level. Talking of levels, there are 100 levels, divided over four times of day, Day/Noon/Dust/Night. The level change depending on the time of day. There are over 300 missions included... and no I have gotten that far yet. With regards to achievements there are 77 within the game. So there is also something there if you an achievement hunter. Badland also has 3 different game types, single player, co op and  mutliplayer. I have yet to try the last two, but hopefully will get the chance to. So is Badland worth your money, Yes. Should you buy it, I would say yes. Badland Game of the Year Edition that was released in May 2015 for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Xbox One, Wii U and Steam for Linux, Microsoft Windows and OS X. So there should be a platform for everyone, whatever your favorite is.			"

												Simply boring and frustrating game.I mean, the game is challenging yea, but when the challenge is not in the game itself, but on the controls and layout, it's totally unfair.I tried to play singleplayer, I tried multiplayer, and both ways it sucks. The areas are too dark (I mean, REALLY DARK, you can't see anything), you can't see the path untill it's too late, and the speed is so fast that you gonna die before you realize what to do.The controls...omg!Sometimes I feel like I have no control over it, I just slam into everything and hopes for the best. Of course, most of the time I get killed. And when you get some clones, it gets worse, cause they stuck into everything, and blocks your path all the time.The concept of the game is good, but I feel it was not executed very well. Maybe it's because of the physics of the game, or make it a little less dark, or slow...but for me, it's not worthing. I always say that games are supposed to be fun, and I won't torture myself with games like this.			"

I lasted about 10 minutes before getting annoyed to the point of quitting.I hate flappy bird, but I love Limbo. Keep your flappy bird out of my Limbo.			"

												The Visual is amazing, the levels design is really good, but what turns me off is this:It´s a skill game where you have hardly any control over your character(s)And for me - that is an absolute no-go.Which is a real shame. I do love the look and the sound that reminds very much of Limbo.			"

												I like how creative they got with this game. This includes the backgrounds and the level designs. But most importantly, the local co-op is what makes this game interesting. The more people you play with, the easier (or more difficult) it is to solve some of the levels as everybody wants the honor of finishing a level with their own clone. My only disapointment is the fact that they didn't add the level editor to the pc. But I guess all the other ""pc only"" features outweigh this disapointment.			"

												""You control little weebles through a deadly world in an attempt to reach the giant vacumm cleaner."" That was the review I read 3 years ago before purchasing this game for on my iphone. Let me tell you, that was no mistake. Thoughout the years I have seen this game develope into something pretty fantasic and receive many, many rewards. If you havn't played this game you should really consider it now. The graphics are nice, the atmosphere is lively and mysterious, and the gameplay includes puzzles and timing. Overall this game is one of a kind and with the new controls for computer it's even better. 10/10			"

												Extreme Flappy Bird.That's what you are getting.  It's beautiful.  There is a lot of stuff to do, but at the end of the day it is Flappy Bird.  Sometimes it's really fun as you soar through the beautiful environments, sometimes its just stupid frustrating as the game demands more control over your character than it gives you.   The design of the game often works against itself, but the sum of its parts is enough to give it a solid recommenation.  The core ideas are great, but the execution of this game is just good.			"

It has a unique dark art design to it, with enjoyable and well thought-out levels, that were better than I had expected. It's sort of like, Limbo meets Flappy Bird, which if you've played those you'll likely understand. It's a nice little buy on sale			"
