												REVIEW OF RECENT GAME CHANGES by ALVARAKK, 16/01/2014 (updated 09/09/2014)MY BACKGROUNDI started playing DnT with first released on Facebook about one year ago and I have been playing regularly since. I was admitted to play-testing group and granted access to the developer's test-server. I am a pro-player, with some 5,000+ ranked PvP matches and reached top 3 ranking position consecutively in the last three PvP seasons and last stats show me at highest KDR (Kill-to-Death Ratio) in the game. I am currently ranked #9 in PvP season 4.Trust me when I tell you, Dragons and Titans is NOT WORTH your time or money. .* The game patch of 01/04/2014 introduced lock-on auto-aim which drastically changed the movement controls in the game, made several dragon combos obsolete, and completely removed the need for players to learn and master their maneuvering and aiming skills. In the recent months Wyrmbyte carried on to dumb-down the game in hopes of attracting more players -- ultimately failing in that too as player numbers in Multiplayer PvP at peak times of the day stand at around 400 now (compare that to DOTA2 or LOL where you have tens of thousands). They reduced the competitive aspect of PvP into a witless and uninspired routine of holding down the fire button and moving your mouse back and forth to control the firing range. Teamplay and coordination have been rendered obsolete in lieu of a contest where players compete only on who can dish out more damage fastest. The advantages of precise timing and tactical thinking have been stripped out of competitive PvP and matches have descended into routine of blindly rushing the opponents in the hopes of out-damaging them. Outcomes are primarily decided on what combos individual players picked up, which is random and unpredictable.* The update of 10/06/2014 continued the steady decline changing the mechanics of the matching-system.-Teams are now truly and completely random and unpredictable. The most shocking change is that the pre-match setup stage was removed, which is where you used to be able to get a minute's worth of chat with the 4 teammates the game picked up for you and discuss combos and tactics. Now, you are plunged directly into match with no opportunity to plan and prepare.-To make things worse, players can not choose or predict what map is going to be played (there are 3, each a completely different mode of play), so they don't get can't pick a suitable combo and enter matches blind and ill-prepared.- The other drastic change was that the restrictions on selection of dragon and weapons was removed. In the past players could only pick a weapon and dragon that was not already in use by one of their teammates and generally whoever was first to click it, got it and mostly refused to relinquish it. Whilst this caused a lot of heated pre-match bickering and some truly foul behavior between teammates, it also forced players to think about what combos best supported and complemented that of the rest of their team. This is no longer the case and players have foregon support roles and invariably stick with the cookie-cutter combos that give them the biggest DPS advantage. This change has also taken away from the formerly enjoyable variety offered by DnT 's myriad of choices, and along with it the need for new players to familiarize themselves with all weapons/dragons and take time to learn their strengths and weaknesses. To illustrate the point, most matches now include a bland carbon-copy selection of combos, with most players equipping Winter Floe and Skyburst and riding either an Imperial or Gemtalon.- In the same stroke, Wyrmbyte hammered-in the last nail to DnT's coffin by preventing players from teaming-up with more than one player. Thus, they dashed all hopes of players being able to form into clans or guilds and fighting it out in Full 5v5s. We are now left to suffer matches that are little more than a frustrating lottery and where skill and experience have scant impact on the outcome.OTHER ISSUESDisappointingly, Wyrmbyte continues to ignore feedback from their play-testers and experienced players alike, resulting in a completely unbalanced PvP and proving to the gaming industry that their diminutive team is just too amateurish and does not have what it takes to deliver an enjoyable gaming experience. Also characteristic of Wyrmbyte is their complete inability to improve and fix their game code, where the blight of bugs seems completely out of control. Major bugs that have been in existence at the early stages of the beta testing, persist still with no indication from Wyrmbyte as to whether they have any plans to sort them out. The introductions of STEAM client failed to stem the constant flow of speed-hacking cheaters that continue to abuse the game and take all fun out of it for genuine players. On top of that, new game issues and exploits are cropping up at an alarming rate and each new game update from Wyrmbyte is a guaranteed source of new and persistent problems.CONCLUSIONSSomewhere along the way Dragons and Titans drifted off-course and lost all sight of becoming a balanced and challenging 5v5 arena and is now being precariously carried-away into the chaotic waters of a mediocre free-for-all. The spectacular dragon themes and above-standard quality of art alone fail to sustain player interest and unsurprisingly their numbers are dwindling daily. This game had promising potential in its early life, which was however ultimately squandered by Wyrmbyte who failed time and again to improve and polish their product. RECOMMENDATIONThis game will disappoint and frustrate you. Stay away from it.There are better free MOBAs out there.UPDATEAs of 09/09/2014 there is still no option to choose map or predict which one will be played. No pre-match team screen to discuss tactics. Speed-hackers continue to dominate the game and the cheaters are completely out of control. Whoever in Wyrmbyte is making decisions on game development should hang their head in shame and just leave the gaming industry forever. So much fail.			"

												This game was quite dissapointing, I did buy the titans pass because it is fun for awhile, but it lacks many things that are standard in moba's these days. Advantages:- Dragons are awesome and well designed artistically - It's fun- graphics are average- lots of gamemodes and updatesdisavantages:- you can't pick your dragon with your team, which is just horrible for a MOBA, you can end up with 5 supports or none, you can also have the same dragon as somebody else, this is very bad designed and makes the game unbalanced. - you can't pick your game mode, it is rotated by the server, and you find out what gamemode you are playing after you select your dragon, some are better then others in certain maps. This is again, very poor design for a MOBA and even a basic MOBA needs this. - Developers reasoning for bad design choices is that there isn't enough players to allow for people selecting there maps, this is very counter inuitive, because I'm sure more people would play if you could select your dragon as a team and chose the map. Which brings me to my next point. - Small player base that isn't growing. - global chatroom has people of all languges speaking in it, it should be seperated by language as you cannot communicate properly- the community that there is have been quite immature at times and quite toxic, there is only a few exceptions. - lack of depth in gameplayI do not recomend this game, but since it's free, you should try to see if you have fun with it, It still can be very fun at times but I would suggest if you wanted to play a dragon in a MOBA, you should go and play Jakiro on dota 2. (EDIT: OR WINTER WYVERN)			"

												At the time this game was released on steam it was a really funny and addicting game. After the controls patch, that allowed easy strafing which got the balance all messed up and the recent patch, that allowed teams to have multiple copies of the same dragon/weapon ingame, you cant chose the game type you want to play anymore and new content is beeing introduced again instead of fixing bugs and balance - all this led to a frustrating and nearly unplayable game which is getting worse and worse. It's a real shame a game with such huge potential is sinking into obscurity.To all People that are playing Dragons and Titans or consider to play it:Please don't waste a single ♥♥♥♥ing Cent on this, this is the last opportunity to change the developers thinking and to maybe sort out the mess again.

												The game is great, don't get me wrong.. It just lacks structure in the shop aspects of the game, the prices change frequently and sometimes get removed entirely. When the time comes to buy a new dragon and or weapon, you don't buy the individual one you need for a certain job, you get what the random eggs/chests give you and that's it. This completely ruins the strategic aspect of the game entirely. Making it very hard to create a decent build or get the ""most efficient"" combination of weapon and dragon. Earning the in-game currency 'crystal' takes ages, especially when you consider the chances of receiving an exceptionaly less useful weapon/dragon.Pairing with your already non-combinable combinations of weapon/dragons you may already own.I give this a 3/5 rating based on the fact that you can't buy what you want with your hard earned crystals that take time to farm.

												This game has been out for some time. The more you play and the longer you play the more perks for your dragon and you. That part is good. There is a single player, co-op and pvp. There are only 3 maps so single player gets dull quick. Co-op allows you to play with other players on your team but the AI is relatively weak so they get steam rolled pretty quick. The only real joy would appear to be pvp. The matching system in pvp however makes it so as a new player you might be playing against very high level dragons. You will be killed easily and quickly by them, often. As such, while you may occasionally have a good game in pvp. Largely you will be used by high levels to bolster their kill ratios. There also appears to be a fair amount of hacking going on that seems to be unchecked. All in all, it appears like a very fun game but as a new player don't expect easy or enjoyable, you will be a wonderful target.			"

												Don't get baited.This game has the worst tutorial ever created. The controls are clunky and you have to jump through hoops to play 5v5 pvp.It is terribly unpolished and not worth the time. Dragons don't move by the standard right click to location they follow the mouse cursor, you press spacebar to fly backwards like a hummingbird and each dragon gets 2 skills only. You bring a weapon from the cash shop into battle that gives you 2 other abilities.There are tons of dragons to choose from but the game doesn't feel like it has a core element. There are dragons that clearly outrank others in terms of innate abilities. The games in game graphics are worse than they are in screenshots. The screenshots for this game seem to have been touched up to give it a better presentation.Comparing this to other MOBA/ARTS games out there, I rather play any other one than this.Edit: I have played a couple of multiplayer games as you can see to my play time; it’s really a cluster♥♥♥♥ of things going on. The Map isn't that intuitive given the movement limitations and controls.I've used a golem type dragon that fires boulders that ricochet when they hit an enemy or wall. Together with a Purple rod that allowed me to set mines and automatically teleport me to the nearest gold roost.During many exchanges I noticed players talk in the lobby about the weapon they purchased from the shop given them a distinct advantage.The main problem with control is the fact that all of your abilities directly are targeted at wherever your mouse cursor is. What causes the rift is that your dragon also follows the cursor religiously for movement. So when fighting you have to constantly be flying backward or standing still to get the 8 way directional aiming to do what you want.Standing still in a fight is never the answer, Flying backward slows down your movement considerably to almost about half. If the controls where polished a bit more and maybe rework the 5v5 map to better compliment the fact we are using dragons more it could have been a good niche market.There are tons of dragons to pick from and weapons to accompany them, variety is good. With the already oversaturation of the ARTS/MOBA market I can't recommend this game over anything else in its current state.			"

												The game seems okay but a lot mechanics don't really work for me.First of all there will be INSANE amounts of grind, absolutely insane. Each stage seems to have 10 levels, each level has 5 objectives to complete, three of the five objectives require specific dragons and items to be completed so you will more than likely have to buy them with real money if you want to complete the objectives.The reason you might want to complete the objectives is because they will give you rewards (like a new dragon if you complete all 5 objectives in all 10 levels, so 150 total ""levels"" * an average of 7 minutes per level = 1050 minutes/17.5 hours total assuming you finish them all in your first try, which you wont). Again, this is a huge grind if you want to do the single player missions to try and get new dragons or items or whatever else they may give you.Game difficulty seems to ramp up very quickly as well. I'm barely on act 1-5 (undead crypt?) and it's pretty much impossible to complete with all the dragons they throw at you. I opened one door and 5-6 very powerful dragons spawned. I used all 3 revives and still wasn't able to kill them.I haven't kept track of how much money you get per completed mission but it's very very little. Half way done with ""act 1"" and I only have about 400 gold or whatever the currency is. To purchase a dragon pack (3 random dragons) you need 5000, to purchase weapon pack (3 random weapons) you need 2500 I believe. Steam says I've played 2.2 hours, remove about 15-20 minutes to account for the tutorial and you can see how slowly you earn money.The microtransactions SEEM pretty reasonable compared to other games but I haven't spent too much time looking at and comparing everything. Some dragons are 3-5 dollars which isn't bad.The mechanics that don't work or that I'm simply not a fan of is the movement and combat. Most of the time it's just a huge mess of enemies clustered together flying around each other trying to hit you. My only recommendation would be a complete overhaul of the controls where you use WASD (or whatever keys you bind) to move and have the dragon shoot where your mouse cursor points (restricted to 140-180 degrees of the direction you're facing, otherwise it would just be silly). Whether the developers are interested in putting all this work to change it, I don't know.Options are terrible. I wanted to lower the volume and you can only toggle both the sounds and music on or off. You can change your resolution and that's about it. It feels like a really terrible mobile port or browser based game. The game has potential with the idea but it's not really worth investing any time or money into at this point. It is free though so by all means try it, but if you have bandwidth limits or something then I wouldn't recommend it (although it's only 300ish mb which is nice).If the grind is lessened and the controls are done better I think it would definitely be worth investing some time into. I have not played the PvP yet so any sort of balance or matchmaking issues are obviously not covered in this.			"

												Before I say anything else, let me be clear about one thing.  This game IS good for someone who is new to MOBAs.  Playing around on it can be fun, and you can have a good time just pounding on the computers if you want.  I like the way that you can mix the activatable abilities of your dragon by swapping in different weapons.  It's a feature I haven't seen in the other MOBAs I have played.  The weapons usually don't provide abilities that are broken with any specific dragons, so the balancing on it isn't too bad.However, if you are familiar with MOBAs, you'll only really play this one when you don't have access to your favorites.  The monetization of this game leaves a lot to be desired.  I get that they are trying to make money off of their product, but they didn't have to make it into some sort of CCG for dragons and weapons.  It's nice that they provide a daily login bonus, and that every 5 days you get another free (random) dragon, but the amount of gems that it takes to get the booster pack of dragons or weapons is pretty high, and you don't even have the option of picking out a specific one of either.  They love to point out how many gems you would have earned after each match if you had just been willing to spend the money on a Titan Pass, too, which I find to be very annoying.All in all, this game shows a lot of potential, but it's just not living up to it for those of us who are already familiar with MOBAs.

												Dragons and Titans. Let's talk. I saw this game, saw dragons, and thought ""Well, why not try it out. It's free so let's see what it's about."" And thus learned this is what a MOBA is called. For what it is, if you have no experience with any MOBAs it really is good. It's a great ""Get your feet wet"" kinda game. Hell, I spent over 850 hours playing it so it must be good right? Right?! Well, frankly, if there was a ""neutral"" button, I'd put it. If I had made my review a year ago, it'd be an absolute thumbs up reccomendation. As of now, I can't. It pains me to say it because this game is boat loads of fun. Was, I should say...First, let's discuss how you begin: You start off with the tutorial, and afterwards get a dragon egg pack. There are like, 30 dragons and the egg packs are random. You could get x3 of the same dragon, x3 support, x3 damage, or just x3 crap dragons you suck at. It's 100% random. You can get more egg packs for 5,000 gems which are the currency in game, but it takes a while. The first egg pack you get is free. I've heard stories of people starting out with x3 support dragons which suck for a new player. But again. Random.So, if you start out with dragons that are support or dragons that just arn't your playstyle, etc...you're going to have a tough time starting out. Did I mention 5,000 gems takes a while to get? Sure you can buy individual dragons, with REAL money, but....do you if you JUST are trying out a game?RNG aside, you start out now. There are 4 acts for the main storyline for single player, single player for the 4 MOBA maps, co-op vs ai, and pvp. You can only play the first act as the others are locked until you pay 20$ for the Titan Pass. I never got it. Payed for a few dragons though when they had a sale though. Alright, now for game play. You can choose a dragon and weapon combo. Some are better than others and are overused in PvP but that's besides the point. Each dragon/weapon has two abilities, some passive, others active depending on the weapon/dragon. Traditional MOBA however. You also have Runes which in truth are the main game changer. You have rune pages that you can customise for your game style. Each rune can be upgraded, but...RNG TIME! You need x3 t1 runes OF THE SAME to upgrade to t2, and x3 OF THE SAME t2 runes to upgrade to t3. How do you get t1 runes? A random t1 rune pack for 250 gems! And there's a super difference between a player with a rune page full of 15 t3 damage increase runes to a player with no runes, even if they have a same combo. Oh, and each pvp match gives you about 30-100 gems on average, with 100 being the cap. Co-op gives 20-40 and single player about 10-25. So, those 5,000 needed gems start looking harder and harder to achive. Sure the Titan Pass increases your gem income per match but....20$.Dragons are similar with you needing x3 t1 of the same dragons for t2, etc. But with random dragon egg packs....Weapons can be fordged to be better using reagents you find in game so that's easy to do. You get more weapons for 2,500 gems...but it's a RANDOM weapon pack that you MAY easily get more of the same weapon if you're unlucky and more than one weapon is 100% useless.But through all this it's a super fun game! It's engaging, you WANT to upgrade your dragons...you WANT to succeed for fun! So why not the reccomendation thumbs up?Well, let's discuss why I stopped playing. Remember when I said that Runes can make or break a game? I would have a full rune page of damage runes mix with T2/T3 runes and deal so little damage it's pathetic. Then randomly, mid match (Sometimes never) I suddenly deal massive damage. With a page full of Cooldown runes, I notice my cooldown's aren't getting reduced. Then suddenly, mid match my cooldowns half they were. My rune pages weren't always active. So, I send in a ticket like normal people and figure I'll stop playing for a while till it gets sorted out. That was a year ago. No comments back.Also, there were no updates to the game in over 6-7 months. So, while it was (And is if the bugs don't kick in) a super fun game, until the bugs get worked out, I don't see much more redemption for the game.Perhaps in due time I can update this and say it's back in business. But right now, it pains me to say...No.			"

												Spent a lot of my time on this game, so I think I am eglible for a review...This game was first released for playing only through Facebook, and those were the days the game actually shined. There was a (relatively) decent amount of players of all kinds and from all around the world, and also updates were applied on a daily basis... It was easy to lose your entire day to playing Dragons And Titans.After about a year after it came out, Wyrmbyte made a Facebook > Steam transfer which seemed like a happy deal for a lot of enthusiastic players, but also made the Facebook version less and less playable, gradually. In the first days of the Steam version there was a lot of lag since they didn't separate players on Facebook from the ones on Steam, but that wasn't as much of a problem as the Facebook version being unplayable.That said, the playerbase halved, since a lot of players were only people who enjoyed quickly logging into Facebook and having a quick game before going to work/school/lunch/...funeral?, and didn't have the time or will to go through the hassle of installing the Steam version.After a year of basically Steam-only DnT, the playerbase started to shrink even more.Since there was a lot of raging and reporting other players (clear example of a MOBA community huh?), the devs of the game decided to try and make the 10yr olds playing happy:  - basically added aimbot, removed any skill required  - removed map selection  - allowed more than one number of same dragon or weapon selected in the same team  - removed microtransactions and added a macro (some would think that'd be good but oh boy how wrong those would be! Christ it's supposed to be a F2p, and with unlocking EVERYTHING for the buyers for a year, while also making them earn 4X THE XP AND CRYSTALS (currency) it doesn't really thrive to remain f2p friendly.) The macrotransaction also nullified all your microtransactions from before, so despite the hundreds some had spent, they had to pay 20$ to get what they already payed for.  - made buying dragons and weapons random, no possibility of picking  - started adding new dragons and weapons on almost a weekly basis, but those were just so unoriginal and you could see the uncanny resemblance not just with some features from other games, but also copies of other DnT Dragons, with changed names!!  - there was even an ARAM map which they at some point decided to make more child-appealing, so it just became ... AM (all middle)?...To summarize, if you're looking to play, consider this:PROS:- free- visually decent- 20 min is considered an extra long game - fast paced and intense- a fair amount of dragons and weapons to choose fromCONS:- macrotransaction for 4x progress- no map selection- no skill required to play (should this be a pro?)- no victory tactics or strategy- no team roles- no teamwork required- no 3+ teams assembling- player base capped at ~250 (can't reach 300 despite unhumane efforts of Jesus, Buddha, Cthullu and FSM)- no in-match stat altering [with items or such] (since games are so quick,this may not be a major problem but only ability levelling being a personal strategy is concerning)- 90% of the community (therefore around 90 players) are still either toxic, or don't speak English so communication here is just the one between labradors and shrimps- no update since summer 2015.... is this con alone enough?- note: Even though no skill is required, since the game isn't being maintained a lot there are some people who don't play without... Inconviniently fair program tools for winning, so don't think you can use this game as an indicator you still know how to play games after you died 1234567898765432345678987654334567 times in Dark souls...Enjoy :)			"

												While I like this game, I really wish they didn't force people to buy the Titan Pass. It's kind of unfair how you have to pay to unlock acts now, and I wish they had a better way for people to buy the dragons they want instead of making people get 5,000 crystals for a random pack that probably won't even HAVE the dragon that people want in it. Do I recommend this game? Kind of but not really. Unless you like this kind of game and think it'll be fun to play. They have a lot of variety of dragons and their pvp is kind of fun too.			"

												Anybody who is new to a moba should play this game! Dragons and Titans doesn't feel overwhelming and its has just the right amount of pacing to get into it and have fun. There are no microtransactions for any player to feel frustrated and most of the items such as the runes, rune slots, the weapon packs, and dragon packs, can be purchased through in-game currency. However, the exeptions are that you can't purchase the dragon skins, the avatar riders, also the dragons and weapons individually. You can upgrade your weapons and the dragons you have so you can become stronger, faster and better. Players get to try five weapons and dragons each week as well. There are other ways to get free dragons but purchasing the Titans Pass can save you the hassle by getting all the weapons, all the dragons, the skins, the riders and all of the acts. When you do, the in-game currency gets an extra boost the more you play. Not to mention you recieve the latest weapon or dragon now and then. The Titans Pass only lasts for a year, but don't worry you still get to keep everything else except the currency boost. The only thing I can complain about are the Acts. If you do it for the story and free dragon they're okay but it does get tedious the more you play. I wish the makers of Dragons and Titans would be a little more creative on the gameplay for the acts. But everything else is very much worth it.			"

												This game is sort of pay to win. There is a rune system like LoL, but each dragon has 4 tiers in which each tier is significantly stronger than dragons of a lower tier. Dragons on the free rotation and dragons you first buy are all tier 1, and you must get tier 1 dragons of the same type to get a tier 2 of that dragon, and there are 4 tiers. Not to mention, you can't buy a single dragon or weapon of your choice with in-game currency, you can only buy packs of 3 random dragons or packs of 3 random weapons. Yes, random, so if you've farmed up the crystals you still won't get that dragon or weapon of your choice. Maps are also rotated on the server (EDIT: since review was written, this was changed to a vote system), so you won't be able to always play your favorite. Everything is done with the excuse of ""low playerbase"" or something.			"

												PROSThere are dragons and titans.There is a single player campaign.CONSPay to win. Dragons have to bought with cash. Weapons have to be bought with cash. If you want to upgrade your dragon, you need 3 dragons of same kind just to upgrade it to the next level.Lousy movement mechanics. It is ""click and hold"" versus ""click and go"". You can't dodge and attack at the same time since left click is your attack and right click is your movement. If you move, your attack will miss.Note : The in-game currency is crystal. "

												Personally, the game had the potential to be something, but it feels too empty. Positively, the dragons and weapons are unique, but encourages you to buy them with real money, giving it a pay-to-win attribute. The combat is too simplistic, you can upgrade your skills, but there is no way to obtain different skills for your dragon, except by adding a weapon which gives you extra two skills. If this was a browser game, it would have certainly obtained better reviews.			"

												 It's really no strategy involved. Eveyone does the something every game. It's a facebook app so it's more so made for the causual player. The concept of the dragons is the only thing that keeps my interest. A fade for right now. All the so call experts players do is play with their friends or so-call clans, which is basically the best stretagy in this game for winning. TEAM WORK. The rating system is a joke, just based on W/L. Rather than individual achievements. The losing team players may have better stats than the winning team, yet gets no rewards for KDR, structures destroyed, gold collected, minions killed or asssist , Just the L. Meanwhile, the winning team feeder who goes 0-8 and contributed nothing to the W get points, stupid. It's annoying to listen to the so-called expert players and moderators talk about how much strategy it take to win, really when either team can have the same dragons and weapon its no STRATEGY involved other than the team who has BETTER TEAMWORK WINS. Their's no in game gear to buy to adjust your STRATEGY, their's not picking of dragons or weapons to counter the other team STRATEGY. BECAUSE IT DOES NOT EXIST. Hell, you can't even see the other team pick until the game actually start, maybe thats a developer STRATEGY. A poster metioned this game is better than DOTA2, this game is childs play compared to DOTA2, clueless comment. Lets take DOTA2 for example, every charatcter has it's strenght and weakness, you can't play 2 of the same hero on different team .BTW it is the dumdness thing in any MOBA game to have the same charatcter on different teams. You have different roles for each player in DOTA2, support/carry/mid/hard lane/jugler etc. You have real STRATEGY involved, last hitting creeps, pulling creep wave, dening creeps, calling for ganks. You can counter any character with another one, for example Drow ranger or Sniper who are consider OP by noobs can easily be owned by a Huskar or Spring Breaker, Huskar can be handle by a Chos knight. Again picking the right character to counter your opponent, it's called STRATEGY. NONE OF WHICH EXIST IN THIS GAME. Next, it's the most buged game i've ever played always crashing, I tried playing with my game pad EVERY game I lagged out and crashed. All the so-called expert  players speed hack/cheat. Now, the nickel and dime aspect, i will disclaim I have spent more than $130 USD on this game and have played grater than 200 hrs. Everything  is randomized so you grind for 5K crystals and randomized a dragon or weapon you don't want, you can't trade it to another player, NO MONEY INVOLVED IN THAT,  all you can do is sell it for a fraction of what you grind for, basically a waste of your time. Then thiers runes completion which takes UP TO 48hrs to complete, why I have no clue, maybe they are using a sweat shop in China to do the work. Weapon forge can take an eternity,  again maybe this one is sent to India for completion, unless you buy instance item to complete forge, money grab basically. After 200 hrs, I have not randomized any items i want, thus spending my own cash, good marketing strategy. Bottom line, this is a causal game, repetitious game play with no real substance and indepth game play or STREATGY. They just celebrated 300,000 likes on FB, but at peak EST around 8pm thiers only around 500 players on. That in it self tells you everything you need to know about this game. That is all, peace.			"

												TL:DR: PAY TO WIN, salty community, heavy AFKing in matches, botting in pvp matchesGame has a good idea behind it...but it just doesnt follow thru properly.Games get pretty boring and repetative VERY fast, everyone votes for a map that will be run for the next 30 min by everyone playing, there are 4 maps total...you will only ever play 3 of them as one is consistently voted into oblivion.This might not seem like a pay-2-win game...but it is..it takes a VERY long tim just to buy a dragon pack (requires 5k crystals) and those dragons you get are completely RANDOM..you cant actually just BUY a specific dragon that you want.I tested to see how long it would take to reach 5k crystals i nthe first place (ONLY playing pvp) took roughly 13 HOURS.now that might not seem like much, but considering you dont have a choice in what dragon you get, and in order to upgrade a dragon, you have to have 3 of those dragons PER upgrade...meaning: 3 t1 dragons of the same type for 1 t2 dragon...and then 3 t2 dragons for 1 t3 dragon.this will take a VERY VERY VERY long time..so long that there is basically NO possible way of doing it WITHOUT paying money.There is an english language channel...and no one really speaks any english.People playing games dont speak english and when you say ""english?"" you usually get cussed out in spanish/portuguese/brazillian........ take your pick.People afk games if they die once, botting is pretty heavy, plenty in those 13 hours of playing.Just all-in-all.....not worth your time.

												 First of all, i don't know if i should be writing this review. You see, i am here for the dragons. And boy there are some. You see, the game does its name justice, and because of that it forced me to be playing frantically a genre i've come to hate and have very few, unpleasant experiences with. The MOBA.  Fortunately, riding a flaming winged terror and hunting down and killing strangers is as rewarding as it sounds. There's more to it though. I mean there's a ton of weapons, a lot of dragons, and you can unlock everything eventually by playing.  I would like to be able to unlock the single player campaign or the avatars but those remain to be seen. There are three arenas to play and those give the old run-and-hunt-and-avoid gameplay some diversity which is always good. The music also sets the mood, but some Rhapsody of fire would go perfectly with it.  To close, i would recomend Dragons and Titans. I would recomend it, because it was all i had hoped it would be and some more, i would recommend it because of dragons, which are always a wonderful theme if used correctly and of the tones of fun i had with it so far.  A last word would go to the pieces of fluff that seem to surround everything. Great job on that, and it really sets the mood.			"

												Well I love dragons and I like multiplayer games and this game was also free to play so this was a real treasure for me.I'm glad that I found it because it's fun to play!You can choose your own dragon and the range is large so you will definitely find one which will suit for you and you can also choose a weapon and a rider.There's an even a possibility to upgrade all this (more options if you buy a Titan Pass).The game starts with a tutorial so that's how you will learn the basics. After that you can play a missions, single matches, co-op matches and pvp. (Blue and red dragon teams 5 vs. 5 fighting and trying to release their own Titan and the team who manages doing that first wins the match.) While your playing you get exp points which will level up your stats.Soundtrack and game style are okey.There's also a little chat box so if you feel like you want to open up about your feelings that's possible too!Over all I really like this game and I recommend this for you!9/10			"

												Developers thoroughly incompetent at balancing, may no longer actually exist: Last update was at December 30th, 2015.Promises of updates from moderators rampant, actual update nonexistent.Even if not for that, it should be avoided due to ridiculous balance issues and rewarding long-time players far more than short-time players, with long-time players having significantly stronger dragons/runes/weapons as compared to players who have only recently started.Balance issues include, but are not limited to; ridiculous disparity of power between dragons, dragons with high speed or slowing effects always being useful, and a dragon that can be invisible forever while still being able to capture points on one of the three maps.Levelling is very slow. Gaining ""crystals"" is very slow unless you buy the ""Titan Pass"", which lasts for a year and gives you 4x crystal rewards, and because they didn't consider how it works with steam, cannot be bought again.If you haven't played it, you should play it once to understand what I mean, then never touch it again.

												Pay to win? More like Play to win!Personally I think Dragons and Titans is a lovely little MOBA. I agree that it can't really compare to games like Dota and League of Legends, but the potential is certainly there.The most common complaints I've seen in reviews are that the game would be Pay to Win and that the controls are clunky. One review even stated you can't attack and fly at the same time.I find these arguments unfounded. All dragons are quite balanced so buying more with money hardly gives you an advantage. The tutorial gives you the crystals(the in game currency) to buy a dragon pack and a weapons pack, both containing 3 random dragons and 3 random weapons respectively. Through playing PVP or the single player campaign you can earn more crystals. I've had pvp games in which I earned about 300 crystals and you need 2500 for a weapons pack and 5000 for a dragons pack.Further more there are a bunch of free to play dragons and weapons to choose from in PVP battles. These dragons and weapons rotate every other week between all the dragons and weapons available.As for the keybinding, I will admit that its hard to get used to at first, but it's hardly clunky. Once you get the feel for it you'll be twisting and turning and breathing whatever your dragons breathing down on your foes. Flying and attacking at the same time is easy to do, some dragons even have homing attacks that will find your target no matter which direction you're facing. There's 3 pvp maps with different game modes and the levels are well designed. Overall the PVP element is the best part of the game as it should be, but the single player campaign is a nice add on.The single player campaign allows you to unlock dragons. Now I've seen a complaint about that in one of the reviews that you would need to clear 150 levels before unlocking the dragon. In truth you only need to play through every level once to unlock the dragon. But I agree that the difficulty is really high even when played in recruit mode. You'll die a lot, get frustrated a lot and if you're anything like me you'll just give up on it and go '♥♥♥♥ it I'm sticking to pvp'But the thing I really like about this game is that you can endlessly combine weapons and dragons. Meaning that you could face off against a dragon with a weapon that shoots arrows one time and then be faced with that same dragon with the ability to drop mines and teleport the next time you face it. It also means that you can choose your own style of play.Further more, the more you play a dragon or weapon, the more experience is awarded to them, allowing them to advance ranks and become faster and more powerfull. So really, the more you play the more powerful your dragons and weapons get and the more likely you are to win!And if that isn't reason enough to give it a try. There's one argument that is sure to at least get me playingIts a Dragon MobA!			"

												If you like dragons get it ! If you like to jump into fast multiplayer team base matches as a dragon get ! Visuals are nice game takes a while to get accustomed to the features and controls; things like what weapon complements whats dragons abilites Nice mix of dragons indeed the game is NOT one dragons sprayed 100 different colours with different names ! Each dragon has its own strengths and weakneses and a role the play towards the success of the match Tanks and assasin types even crowd controling types as well as suppport dragons combine that with the hundreds of weapons to equip on your rider just make the game even better BIG NOTE + + + + + + + +Before the recent update called "" TITAN PASS"" This game was focused on massive grind with littel reward ALSO pay to play/win daily log in rewards previously where usless a few gems here an there u would have to save for months it was really bad A tier 3 dragon would cost you over $60 .... Not worth it. HOWEVER Since the update you basically get the following : 1) you unlock every dragon that is available AND any future dragons the release FREE of charge 2) you unlock ALL skins for ALL dragons AND any future Skins the release FREE of charge 3) you unlock ALL Weapons for all dragons AND any future weapons the release FREE of charge 4) all you exp and gems your given after each match are X4 ! 5) ALL story modes are now unlocked ( previously you would have to buy each mode )6)Daily log in system improved GREATLY SO ! if you log in each day the reward gets greater and greater giving you a Tier 1 Tier 2 and tier 3 dragon over 30days log in GET the TITAN PASS your getting over $300 worth of content for $15 ( approx) If you play for free basically see it as a demo version of the game I hihgly recommend to get the TITAN PASS to fully enjoy the game and not owrry about grind or not having a certain dragon you GET EVERYTHING and for a cheap price for an epic gameNOTE the only bad thing about ths game that i believe is getting worked on is matchmaking system and the Chat logs in all chat aside from those 2 this game is worht the price + more			"

												Is there a ""I kinda recommend it but don't have to high hopes for it cause the developers kinda gave up on it"" option?No? Ok then.As most of the reviews have said, this game is mostly smooth. Great Concept, But executed terribly. The character models may look iffy and well, as most people said ugly, look past that and you see a decent game. I also see some people talking about how this game is P2W (pay to win). But speaking from personal experience, it doesnt have to be. I know a bunch of top players who didnt pay a single cent.Also did i mention how the developers are just lazy?There was a glitch i believe that happened during February 29th 2016, Where all the dragons were avalaible as the free rotation. You couldn't upgrade dragons you had or sell them during that time. Guess when did the developers found out about it and fixed it?About a month later.Yeah, this game is great, and i love it. But developers put some goddamm effort to it for god's sake.But the true thing that makes this game terrible is the community. Salty af brazilian/spanish/russian mofo spamming chat.Afk idiots.Rage quitters.People with horrible internet.Take you're pick.But all in all, its an enjoyable experience as long as you look past its terrible spots.Should you try it? Well if you're bored, have a laggy computer that can't run Dota2 or Leauge of legends, then yeah sure why not. But don't have too high hopes tho.(Side note, for those complaining about the controls i have no idea what you're talking about its perfectly fine for me)			"

												Dragons and Titans, sounds like a awesome game, right? I mean it combines dragons; The mythalogicbeast that, flys with wings that shadow fear itself. spits pure firely death. and Titans; divine beings, descending from the primordial gods and preceding the Olympian gods! OH MAN THAT SOUNDS FUN, I GOT TO TRY THAT. Thats what I thought when I saw this game, By the red thumbs down in the corner there you can see that my opinion may have changedI have one word to discribe this game, Bland, Just Bland. Its a bland moba with somemore then BS play to win ways of getting characters. Think of League or Smite as a sandwich. This is also a sandwich but with no meat, or lettuce, or tomatto, no mayo. So just bread. bland right? yeah, first gold in this game is not used for a awesome item store where hundreads of possible set-ups can happpen. Its use to feed a titan. that runs straight down middle lane and gets killed unless you and your team destoryed those towers and got to the enemy base and destoryed most of the towers there. So gold is uselessAlso the way you get dragons is, get this, Luck. no you can't buy a champion you want, you have to hope to get it! Making you spend money, on things you don't need. OR you can buy the character pack for way more then its worth and get the characters that come out in that year, Funny that this game came out during the last quarter of the year.This game is just bland, just go and get League or Smite and have a much better timeI give it a Slice of bread/10			"

												  Declared as FTP Dragons and Titans without the Titan pass becomes a huge waste of time.  First of all FTP version  has 1/4*XP bonus of Titan pass. It may look as a fair balance but not in the long run as any gamer's intention.  Another downside of auto-aiming is the dominating of DPS dragons leading to repeating picks and same combos in PvP.Random PvP matches with no chat for tactics nails it for me. Here devs left the option of soloing the usual maps. Well solo missions are also limited for 4-5 same maps with bots. That comes as a mindless grind of time and game interest. Co-op livens up the game a bit though there all are focused on finishing the map in the shortest time so it lacks the fun of it.			"

												Well, the game itself is cool though I get the feeling that everything in this game was made half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ The maps are minimal - you can only play 4. The dragons and idea of the game is good enough but it just wasn't made as good as it could be. The players are one of the rudest and unhelpful bunches I've ever played with and I've been in enough games that it is past the normal, all-in-good-fun joking. Peeps get reported right and left just for the offense of being new and asking a question. If you are looking for a good game base with decent players, I wouldn't recommend this game. If you generally ignore all people in a game and just play doing your own thing, you'll do okay. However, this isn't a well-rounded game and from what I can see it is just a bunch of people from Europe and Asia playing because they can't any other good games. Keep in mind, I actually love this game but the community atmosphere is awful. It wasn't this way a year or two ago.			"

												It is one of the most clunky ""MOBA"" I've ever seen in my time of gamings.You cannot change your buttons for each ability ,and you need mana to spend your attack or right-clicks...and that is 1 of 2 spells or abilities without a weapon.I mean if a dragon has 3 abilites and a weapon could give it 2 more it would be fine ,but they took a lovely consept like that and threw it out a window.The whole game also feels sloppy the movement,the lanes, the abilities,and the combat the most important thing in a MOBA.Making a party is a little glitchy and isnt fun when doing so.The lvling up system outside of combat is wierd and i keep finding people with higher skill levels in the game.This game feels incomplete and from the combat to the animations, it is all crap.Giving it a 3 out of 10...000 on my scale and factors.Only redeeming factor is ...well...I dont know...its not that good in my eyes and could channge if the developers fixed some problems with the machanics.Thank you very much for reading my post and I might try playing the game on and off at times.Thank you and good-bye.

												Not being a big fan of MOBAs myself, I found this game to be extremely entertaining. I love the take on the genre, and I know others complain about the controls, but frankly, I found them to be a welcome change rather than click click click!Why is this game called Dragons and Titans?You're a dragon lord, who rides dragons into battle. Now, why this is cool is you get a dragon with it's own unique abilities, and your rider can use a helpful weapon, so rather than filling inventory with objects and potions you're using abilities you specify as you progress. Once you reach enemy base, you find YOUR Titan is trapped there, and once you break the cage, you free them.Now for the negatives I noticed.If you are just trying to practice to get a feel for the game, you will want to go and do the prologue and the acts. That's fine and dandy, but the learning curve is harsh even on Easy (because yeah, when I'm new, I'm going to hit Easy, k?) So you will find yourself frustrated time and time again with going through the entire thing after losing 4 lives (4 total, you get 3 hearts, and once you die after that, you have to start over).The biggest, most horrendously awful thing about this game:Sometimes, those acts bug out. Mobs will not come on que as they should to progress, leaving you looking around frustrated until you decide to quit. The good news here is that if you quit ""the match"" (again, this is an act, not playing with others) you will be able to try it again and then the enemes spawn accordingly. I don't know about you, but that seems almost game breaking to have to QUIT just to play the damn thing. I'm genuinely hoping this is addressed and repaired.Aside from that, I do recommend this game, it's fun, the music is fantastic, and you feel like you're getting somewhere (when things aren't wonky).===Edit===Also, some people are complaining that this is a pay to win game. As of 3/15/2014 this game actually gives you freebies for doing tutorials and stuff. Free crystals to buy a pack of dragons and weapons. No, you can't specify which ones you get, but I'm not complaining x3			"

												Worst made MOBA, they allow ALL types, no limit, destroyed there controls, only care for there money and allow a weapon to be used more then once, try going up agents 5 the same dragon, with 5 the same weapon your screwed.. i know from the inside how they treat and act, i was a mod for the longest time, they cant even allow mods to fix anything or bad, they only let a mute happen for a small time, in witch people can avoid with hacks thus, they don't even do anything about the hackers, they let them be! i tried for 2 hours to mute once a few people as they spam and spam.. there are about 3 devs ""one who left due to same reason me and other mods left"" there rude, care only for themselves, seem to use the money for vacations and mind you, don't you DEAR bother them when on a vacation! they snap at you like a dragon attacking pray! Mind you, no MOBA should allow 5 of same player and 5 of same weapon for that is WAY over the OP, you should not bother investing in this game, cuz you say one badbad thing about it, within there TOS they state ""will not refund blahblah"" and will ban you for no reason, they don't CHECK hackers, if anyone bothers to report you for hacking just to be an♥♥♥♥♥ then you are AUTO BANNED despite having all your money spent, perma ban, they wont even look at your tickets. mind you, threw testing and so on hardly anyone cares but for there own wants and inside the staff there are ""groups"" some are favored and some are shunned till they leave like myself and others who i will not mention unless they post here... Ann, the one in charge of talking a bit, is rude, and only helps people she sees profit in and uses them till there dry, and if you have a way to help her or the game make money, she is your beeeest friend, but somehow plans do not follow threw, she is your worst enemy.. she treats staff ""mods and council"" as there worker dogs and make them do♥♥♥♥♥♥otherwise barking at them. or ignoring, depends how she sees you and Scott, hes a good person, but unknowingly allows all this and seems to think this game will be ok.. THIS GAME IS UTTER♥♥♥♥♥♥AND ALL MESSED UP AND IS NO MORE THEN A MONEY TRAP WAITING TO TAKE YOU IN!!!! i spent threw-out time around 1k to help get game up, working with them only to be cast aside like a used rag doll and this is what i say...stay out of this game, its bad, they are so unbalanced its screwed up, this is a pay to play, with hackers that THEY ALLOW and spammers, trolls, and mods who dont do♥♥♥♥♥♥or cant due to how they never help by making is SAFE! it is a VERY unsafe game for kids.. people attack kids there as well as name themselves bad things and attack users for fun, and sadly., mods cant help and devs just ignore~ so i say stay the hell away for your own good and your own safety and do NOT let your children play this.. hope this helps, this is from an inside view from staff within this game for 2-3 years... have a nice day, and bewhere...

												The whole MOBA concept as we know it now is highly overrated as it's seriously flawed by a number of issues, such as too long matches, repetitive game play with same builds, and community harassment. I've played DOTA and LOL pretty extensively but eventually left both. As for DaT it has addressed a number of key issues of the concept while adding a nice twist to it. The game plays differently unlike any MOBA you've played before, but the new control system seems to work pretty nice since you cannot lose your character in the middle of the fight, which often happens with inexperienced players in other MOBAs, designers have put a lot of thought and imagination in the dragons and the main map feels better that a regular ""three lanes"" map. The matches are usually 10-15 minutes long, so even if you're stuck with a bad team, it doesn't hurt you all that much, hence no harassment. The flaw with repetitive builds was fixed with weapons that are chosen before the match: they give you two abilities along with the two provided by your dragon. This gives you an imaginable number of variants that will keep you from getting bored for a long timeAll in all, this game won't replace DOTA2 or LoL but will have a consistent player base that will grow over time. As for those claiming it to be ""P2W"", those players don't understand the whole concept of this model. DaT is a free to play title since no other player will get an advantage over you that you will not be able to get eventually, it does require some grind, but when you enjoy the game you don't really notice it. The only flaw I've come across - the game needs some polishing, but I believe it will get there eventually.9/10			"

												This is a great game with a rocky beginning - I highly suggest you get through the tutorial and play at least 2 or 3 of the 5v5 PVP battles before passing judgment.  In addition to the cool lore and novelty of a moba in which you fly on a dragon's back, there are several key features that I think are innovative and make this game different from the rest of the pack:* Pressing spacebar lets you move backwards but still face forward, which makes for some interesting mechanics in outmanuevering your opponents.  Breathing fire on your opponent while backpedaling is also just fun!* The typical 4 abilities of most MOBAs are split - you get 2 from your dragon and 2 from your weapon.  This means you can create a huge number of combinations of abilities, flexibility which is really cool especially once you unlock a lot of dragons and weapons.  In other words, the same dragon can be played in vastly different ways depending on weapon choice.* The matches are typically fast, like 10-20 minutes, which is nice - I don't have to dedicate as much time to drop in and play a game here and there.* There are no in-match items to buy.  I love this becuase I don't have to memorize a huge inventory to play the game (or spend time sitting there agonizing over my item choice).  I can just concentrate on the game itself.* There is much less focus on killing minions, and much more focus on fighting the other players dragons.The art is beautiful but a bit rough around the edges, and the interface is serviceable but could be a bit more intuitive.At its core, Dragons and Titans is a great game that does key things differently from the MOBA crowd.  It fits great for me as a game I can drop in and play here and there without having to read tomes to catch up on what I missed or be screamed at for being a newb every moment when I play again and forget item builds...It may not draw you in with its tutorial, but give it a chance to shine and it does not disappoint.

												ive played this game some time and after half a year of not playing i tried it again and easy enough i stil got some skills,stil this doesnt matter anymore because half the dragons have homing attacks and double my flyingspeed :/ also in the 2 games ive played again today i wasnt able to damage 4 players in my enemy team at point blank nuking all my skills and breath attack (again at point blank!), to me thats unacceptable in a pvp match.so if you're oke with playing against players who use godmode (mod/cheat) then go nuts play the game, because its freei reccomend ONLY to play the free version for maybe the singleplayer campaigne, the titanpass is a loss of your moneyfor me its dead because of the toxic raging cheaters that now stil play the game.player count today was 109 total so also epic long wait times for a match.best to leave this game alone or try the free version for a day and then delete it. it was fun but devs and cheaters killed it :/ "

												The game feels empty, lacking of stuff that makes it feel like you're actually flying mighty dragons, battling other powerful dragons. The movement mechanics are unique, but not any preferable movement system for me. Ontop of that, the game kept bugging out at all different times, and for what I've played, trying to get Crystals (ingame money) is much more tedious than it should be, which doesn't help the already lacking game.Also, as a 2014 game, the graphics and the animations are falling behind, the game has flat textures and the animations feel clunky.

												First off, I would like to make it clear that I have also played this game earlier, outside of steam, so my total playtime is probably at around five hours. With that out of the way, this game just is not very good. Its graphics are meh, though they certainly do the job, sound assets are pretty horrid, the voice acting terrible, the controls rather clunky, and the abilities very dull. It also feels very unpolished, with several bugs, a poorly designed UI, and an options menu so poor that it does not even include a sound slider. This, coupled with the terribly loud voices, forced me to take my headphones off while they talked. My overall impression of the game is that of lost potential. It was made to play in a browser, and that is obvious in its design. One could certainly make an argument for it when it was on facebook, as it is of much higher quality then most other games there, but here on steam, well... even the dragons cannot save this one.

I tried not to, but i couldn't help but compare this game to League and Dota, and unlike Dota and League this game doesn't seem to be action packed and pulls you into the game to make you want to win, instead i was simply flying a dragon and attacking some flying demon babies.Overall I'd really suggest you don't buy this smouldering lump of firey dragon sugar.

												So I saw this title and I thought, ""Yay. Dragons!"". But It turns out It's even crappier than It looks.Tutorials are MEANT to teach you about the game. It barely teaches you anything that MOBA shows.It's better If I make a list of Pros & ConsPros:+ Dragons+ Nice looking menuCons: - Tutorials are terrible[] No explanation about Hud (mana/health)[] No explanation about Spell[] Proving ground tutorial is annoying (mostly the spamming voice lines, can't take a single breath when she doesn't speak)- Clicking [X] in messages doesn't mean OK- 100 xp for 20 minute game (rip-off!)- Graphic locks to 60 Fps for no reason (It makes my game laggy)- No speed Upgrade ?I haven't seen the store because GAME forces you to go THROUGH the 30 minute tutorial. I'm disgusted how games forces people to check tutorial before they can check anything else.			"

												Totally lame.horrible gameplay, with an insanely long begginners guide required before you can play, yet doesn't teach you even half the controls!?? (they can't be found under keybind menu either)Game involves chosing your dragon, and equipping your rider with an offensive and a defensive weapon, then upgrading them.The amount of gems you aquire through quests/dailies etc means it takes about 1 week to upgrade 1 item 1 time...... pay to win incentive is just too strong, with very little benefit from doing so.Player A plays the strongest 'assasin' dragon in the game and has a +3 upgraded weapon and a +1 upgraded dragon, player B plays the weakest 'support' dragon in the game and has a +20 weapon and +17 dragon. Player B will almost 1 shot player A and 5 of his buddies all ganging up on a cornered player B.Do you like to play games which require a $50 investment to begin to compete in casual games (as there is no ladder ranking system currently)? Then this is the game for you! Or for $30 you could just flat out BUY one of the many better alternatives out there.			"

												This game is amazing! I especially like the fact that they got rid of the micro-transactions. That was a pain in the earlier version for me.Now they just need the fix the glitch where the friendly/hostile Chaos Titans get stuck halfway down the battlefield. They kind of rub up on the CGI rocks and can't do anything except move slowly back and forth. Sometimes the ally bots in single-player do the same thing at random places in the arena.Overall though, it's a great game!Side Note: I would like it if the devs lowered the random pack crystal amount for the dragons a tiny bit, like maybe to 3,500 or something. 5000 is a LOT.

												The community on this game is turning into a League of Legends I-play-this-game-all-day sort of community full of elitists. It's not worth playing due to this; so if you want a game that is actually fun, look somewhere else as this one gets boring, fast and PVP isn't enjoyable and at this rate never will be. Find a better game, or I hope the devs figure out what they're doing; because this game is going to turn into a failure very soon if the community keeps up; as the lack of new players will become a problem with moderators telling players to ""do us a favor and uninstall"" and generally doing a poor job as moderators.I'll play again when the elitism problem is fixed.

You earn so many free Crystals and Dragons that it's at least worth logging on for the Daily Bonus. Paying $20 for some shiney skins, crap Tier 1 Dragons, and 3 more spots to the story is just rubish. And with how easy it is to earn Crystals...it renders the double Crystals bonus useless.

Like every mobas, dont expect good team balance from this one but seriously the dragon and weapon balance is really one of the worts I even seen. It is fun but not for a long time.

												Dragons and Titans is a ""free to play"" MOBA using a dragon theme.  It worked, sounded ok, looked ok, played ok. Has Single player mode, CoOp mode and PVP mode.  Three random dragon pack cost 5,000 crystals and  3 random weapon pack cost 2,500 crystals.  You can earn crystals by playing matches, and you get 1 dragon pack and 1 weapon pack when you finish the Prologue. The tutorial map is a testing range. There are 40ish Dragons to play and 6 are free on rotation.  There are many weapons to use and 6 of them free on rotation.  Only one Map at a time is playable, it is voted on in lobby. There is 5 vs 5 PVP matches.Game looks Pay to Win because you can buy the Dragon and Weapon packs with real money till you get ones you want.  Buying the Titan pass for 20 dollars unlocks all tier 1 Dragons and weapons, single player campaigns and gives 4x crystals earned for one year.Try it, maybe you might like it.  For more info:

												This is an amazing game i dont see myself ever geting board of this game.this game does featureAlmost too many dragons too train them all a great plus that I love so dont think too many is a bad thing.There are a lot of spells that can be used like a spell that restors my mana and another for health some.  Also there is a PvP, Co-Op, and single player modes. Co-Op is the hardest to get into a match but my personle faverate. you have 5 players including you against 5 CPU's. Then there is PvP 5v5 players (The players in PvP tend to be more rude and complain more.) And Finaly we have single player in this mode you can set the game type you like and its you along with a team of 4 CPU's Against a team of 5 CPU's  another reason for some who may enjoy is weapons yes theres weapons for you ""Dragon lord"" to carry. the weapons have a set of abilitys aswell just as the dragon does wich you unlock those abilitys by gaining XP wich you get from killing damageing dragons or getting gold.  One of the best parts of this game is that its completely free.Also if you thought this reveiw was helpful please put that below.Post Note: (This game aint no minecraft so please dont expect there too be like 367,341,543 players or whatever.

												Game is random? Yes i give it that.Fun? Beyond fun yes!P2w? Not at all, everything you want in this game you can grind for, but of course there is the quick ""warrior walleting"" out of the grind. The only thing that you can't get in this game through grinding is some skins and avatars that can only be bought with cash. There is nothing you can buy to give you the advantage over other players.So would I recommend you playing the gaming? Do I think its worth the time and effort? Of course, through GRINDING i have gotten every dragon and weapon in game, as for the random, its not too hard to manage, you quickly learn how to use what you have very well.EDIT: I'll leave my original review there for everyone to see, but after some recent events I honestly can't recommend this anymore. I used to love this game with my heart and soul and it was amazing. But then the developers abandoned it, I just can't recommend it anymore. The free rotations haven't changed in months, the seasonal rewards are random t4 dragons, there are constantly people having trouble to connect to this game, there is an insane ammount of unbalanced weapons, dragons and combos in this game. It saddens me to say this but unless the devs come back to this game I recommend everyone stay away from it because you'll only be wasting your time.			"

												If you like dragons...you MUST at least try this game, no matter if others think is bad, you need to discover it by yourself.This game have too many negative evaluations, I think because maybe one tried it and had a bug (is something that can happen, but with any game) or had not a good impression at first time. And besides any possible reason, if one just do not like a thing or a game, should just move on and go to find a new one, not be so destructive against one, it's unuseful and give just bad repercussions, and there is no needed of that.The game is good and enjoyable, but it need more players! and when people come here to see the reviews and see all this negative votes are are discouraged and do not give it a try even if it's a Free to Play !!The game need more good reviews, I think that ANY player that like Dragons and Titans, should tell others that, and not only in the chat, but write a positive review here and suggest it to other people! And I'm here to do it!There is a part of pay to win too but it's almost insignificant, because if you like the game and enjoy to play as a DRAGON RIDER you'll gain things easy and with time, the beautiful aspect of this game besides the fact that you can chat and play with others, do pvp (players against other players) is that there are many dragons! And you can collect them and try them during the time, same for the weapons! that are many and different, this aspect make the game to have also a strategy side, it's not just about to throw your dragon against the enemy, but you have to learn each ability and potential, and also collaborate with others players and make a plan. You can also play easy against the computer in single player and with others too making co-op The game may seems repetitive or boring, but the fact is that every game have a line, its history and structure, each in its own way it is structured with certain bases, and the rest comes from the actions that one does and how he lives it, as it acts. And this one make no exceptions, and it works following a precise line.Personally I use a lot my imagination too, and I just love to see dragons, to play them and see the animations during the battles!!So let's give it a try!! it deserve it :)and share it Dragons Lords !!!

												Got boring after a few days because its a pay to win, like most free games, its not very much of a game becides getting dragons and weapons, and fighting things, I quit playing after a little bit, sorry but I just cant recommend it even if its ""free"" to play, you have to pay money to get dragons unless you have a LOT of gems (which I never did pay them and still only have the few starter dragons) Before you get all over me and rant about something just remember that I only  played it for a few days but didnt like it. Dont get this game, its a waste of space and time, unless you are rich, and have a thing for fighting on dragons all the time, but becides that, I cannot recommend this game...			"

												Game is random? Yes i give it that.Fun? Beyond fun yes!P2w? Not at all, everything you want in this game you can grind for, but of course there is the quick ""warrior walleting"" out of the grind. The only thing that you can't get in this game through grinding is some skins and avatars that can only be bought with cash. There is nothing you can buy to give you the advantage over other players.So would I recommend you playing the gaming? Do I think its worth the time and effort? Of course, through GRINDING i have gotten every dragon and weapon in game, as for the random, its not too hard to manage, you quickly learn how to use what you have very well.EDIT: I'll leave my original review there for everyone to see, but after some recent events I honestly can't recommend this anymore. I used to love this game with my heart and soul and it was amazing. But then the developers abandoned it, I just can't recommend it anymore. The free rotations haven't changed in months, the seasonal rewards are random t4 dragons, there are constantly people having trouble to connect to this game, there is an insane ammount of unbalanced weapons, dragons and combos in this game. It saddens me to say this but unless the devs come back to this game I recommend everyone stay away from it because you'll only be wasting your time.			"

												This game is a pretty obvious MOBA much like DOTA.  It is not as refined or deep as many other MOBAs but there is a fairly high amount of constant innovation despite the small development team.  Updates including new dragons, maps and other features are quarterly.  There is a fair amount of strategy and required synergy between dragons, weapons, spells and runes per map so while you can learn to play fairly quickly, to play well takes more time.The game isn't perfect but it is fun and the Titan Pass for full content is a pretty good deal.

												o_0 I really like this game because of all of it's action and stratagy that you have to involve in it and im not saying it's perfect. In act 1 you can get a free dragon after beating and theres up to act 3 right now and it involves a really cool story line sounds cool right, guess again. you have to pay for the other act's and a lot of the things you can buy with real money and or game money is kind of overpriced in my opinion because you only get 100 money per victory and it cost's 5000 for three random dragon eggs and 2500 for a new weapon, there is interesting runestoo and you can upgrade your weapens at the forge with stuff you find inbattle or pay for wich is the only cheap thing in my opinion. Other than that this game is amazing you really have to work with your team in battle to cover everything and it's still preatty difficult ven if youhave 5 ppeople in skype. you also get this portrait of a dragon and whenyou level up it fills up by that much more with i like to level up in forthat reason. So in conclusion i think it's an awesome game and can't waitfor future updates.			"

												Very good Moba game with dozens of different dragons and weapons as well as spells to do a bit of extra damage and runis to improve the stats of your dragon. Even through this game is Free to play it has very little Pay to win aspect. (being that the only thing you can buy that could make you OP are runis) but besides that everything is accessable through ingame curency. The game play is very good, with solid animations and sound effects. But again a bit of waring you will run into some players whom will seem like they are hackers because of how powerfull there dragons are which may be true if they are able to take multiple enemy players down by them self without losing a quarter of there health.

												Extremely fun MOBA. I refuse to be a wallet warrior and pay to level. D&T has a nice per year subscription model that gives you access to all of the current and future dragons and weapons on first tier for the year. Additionally buying the annual pass will increase your Gem and XP rewards. This game will allow you to play properly for free. There is nothing you can buy that you cannot get for free, however it will take a bit longer without the reward multiplier from the Titan Pass. Very fun and addictive. I would rate this 4 out of 5. The missing star is for a few of the bugs in game, especially the UI which tends to be a bit flaky at times, but otherwise gameplay is excellent.			"

You can instantly get higher tiers but its only a slight chance of getting a high tier dragon. Played this game for quite sometime Its good Not that bad.

Be warned that this is a pay to win game, with purchased dragons and weapons being considerably better than the free ones. If you're strictly a free-to-player, this game is not for you, as it wasn't for me. If you want to get anywhere without paying a dime, it takes a lot of time and a lot of grinding.			"

												Fundamentally, this game can accurately be described as Hoard + Dota 2. It's pretty fun, in a simplistic sort of way, which I like. And it has good microtransaction policies, which is to say there are none. Which I like. There is only one thing purchasable in this game (aside from the in-game currency), which is a sort of season pass, and, honestly, it's very humbly priced and a good deal ($20 for all the content made thus far, the future content they make for the next year, and 4x money). If you like the game, buying that is definitely worth considering, and it's still not pay to win, for the developers seem adamantly against that sort of thing.There is a good variety of dragons too, and it doesn't overwhelm you with the sheer amount like Dota 2 does. In this game, you play as the dragons (well, a guy riding them) and must protect the titans for the fate of the world. A lot more clear-cut than whatever story Dota 2 happens to have. Like, why the ♥♥♥♥ is a building called an ancient? An ancient is a really old living being, and those ""ancients"" are not living beings from what I can tell. They are buildings. And that word is mostly an adjective. Mostly. And on that note, there is a dragon that looks like a xenomorph!But anyway, it could use some extra polish with the UI presentation, but it's not unsightly. Matches are quite short, which you may or may not like, but I think it is a good thing, personally. You can also really customize your abilities and strategy, since your choice of dragon nets you two abilities, and your choice of weapon nets you two different abilities. So you can mix and match. It also has a good tutorial, so I'd definitely say this a good introduction to the MOBA genre.			"

There is a clear feeling of something that can be done in warcraft 3 with a custom map as well. seriously, DLC that goes from £12 to £30 for dragons, that's the model you're going for?  with graphisms and designs like these I'm sory but no. If you want to collect dragons, grab your phone and get into Dragon Town or Dragon World (I preffer the later) - or any of their clones. they have more imagination than the designs of these dragons.I didn't have many control issues until I had to use the q and w keys. they aren't rebindable? what do you do with all the french layouts using azerty? no, this game was not worth more than the 6 minutes I spent on it.

												I wasted 1 hour and 30 min into this game.the mechanics feel cheap and sticky Dragons are like cars with guns on them because you can go forward and back and the only obivouse dodge is a circle Minnion waves are akwardly Side qeusts feel empty and out of place unlocking items in game requires grinding for hours on and you cant get a dragon unless you get the credit card of course they have a random 3 egg and a random 3 weapon for free but doesnt help you to get a serten dragon also you need to get 150 points on a side qeust ACT 1 to even get a new dragon tier 3. this includes FARMING because the ACT 1 is made out of 10 missions meaning 10x15  so 1 mission took me 10min+ so lets calculate. naawh ♥♥♥♥ it trow it in the bin where it belongs im done with this game. also dowing 1 mission gives 1 point meaning youre gone do it 150 times on al mission on begginer modeyou can try harder modes but youre new to the game so that out of the qeustion.final result UNFREINDLY GAME			"

												Pros: Takes MOBA concepts and puts them on the backs of dragons, which is never a bad thing. Dragon, weapon and spell combinations offer plenty of play style options. Solo and co-op play as well as ranked battles.Cons: Rune system leaves a little too much to chance. Forces some social game aspects into the mix with Battle Marks. Only one map.I have mixed feelings about this game. However, I do recommend to try it out. It's free after all.			"

												Fun little moba, while most have you wait and bide your time, This one throws you head first into the action and matches quickly start out with a massive team fight. Games usually take between 10-20 minutes so its easy to do a few matches. As for shop items, Dragons and weapons are easily buyable with ingame money (Crystals) which are not to hard to farm up, or real money for a quick boost. Dragons come in packs of 3 random ones, but you can buy specific ones for real money. Vanity items such as skins and avatars are bought with real money.Apon starting a game you will choose one dragon and one weapon, all dragons have a general boost to character health and mana, as well as gold collection. Your dragon selection will modify your first 2 abilities as well as general stats such as speed, attack power, as well as attacks. The weapon you choose provides your last 2 attacks and each weapon is highly varied in which attacks it offers as well as utilities. Some weapon offer additional attacks, while others are passive buffs and still others boost in movement.  You also have 2 spells avalible to use.Dragons and Titans offers several game modes including a single player adventure mode which allows you to earn special rewards. All of the Pvp game modes involve freeing your titan from the enemies, but each mode involves somewhat different methods to go through. Gold is avalible to collect and return in all game modes. Gold offers experience as well as in some game modes provides additional benefits.Moba involves traveling through a wide and open map with various areas to explore. Unlike standard mobas this one does not have specific lanes, or a ""Jungle"" to explore. Collecting gold here and returning it to the hoards here will summon a chaos titan who is a powerful boss creature that heals allies and shreds towers. Aid your titan to help it push to the heart of your enemies base. Apon summoning a titan, all progress towards your enemies titan is lost so gather gold often to ensure you're the one with the advantage.Control points has 5 control points that when captured slowly weaken the enemies titan cage shields. Gold here just offers experience and no added benefits. Once a control point is captured, you can teleport to it from the hoard as well as function as a gold drop off. Aram is an all random mode that is just one quick fast paced lane where all dragons are randomly selected for the user while weapons can still be chosen freely. Gold is automatically dropped off and when the bar fills fully it will fire a set of 3 balistae to deal massive damage to anything in the path, This damage is enough to oneshot most dragons. Over all Dragons and titans is a nice fast paced moba that is still in active development. It stands differently to League of Legends as well as Dota 2, and I highly recommend it as a way to get people into mobas in general.			"

												Not bad and could be good fun if you like dragon (or crazy about dragon, like me). Though there're quite a bunch of bugs that I can see at a glance, considering it's free to play (the not-annoying kind, too), I'd recommend it to my dragon friends. I might consider buying the pack if their storyline has a bit more substance and that single-player mode carry more than just increased EXP when finishing them) Though I dislike the fact that that pack give ALL dragons and weapons. It's like...no fun! What's the point in gaining them if they're so easy to obtained?			"

												Pay to win? Not at all. It takes a little dedication of playing the game to get enough crystals to get the dragons and the weapons, but it is highly worth it. Plus, with the developers adding a new dragon and weapon every month, paired with the Freebie Fridays, I cannot see how you could get bored easily.The only thing bad I would say is the community. Most of the time, I just see people complaining about cheaters, which I figure is just them being a poor sport. The other half of the time, it's actual conversation, which, I, of course, don't mind.			"

												I have to say that this game is fairly good. Though I only have a few hours of gameplay to boast, I still think that I know enough to say that this game is worth your time. The system of dragon/weapon is easy to understand, the movement is simple, the matches are complex enough to be interesting but not complex to the point of overwhelming, and the act system offers more challenges than you normally find in an MOBA, along with the Titan Pass which offers you a complete collection of every item in the game for the low, low price of $19.99 (or $9.99 if you're getting it on a sale as I did.) To top it all off, the download is only a bit over 100MB.The only issues I really have with the game are that it's a bit grindier if you don't get the Titan Pass, and- mentioning the TP again- it seems that you are unable to play the acts beyond Act 1 without unlocking them with the TP. It's not much of an issue though, because the TP is only $19.99 and it's only necessary to purchase it once- no subscriptions and no extra DLC packages.			"

												If you like dragons, breathing fire, and watching other dragons (and their riders) burn, this is a game for you. This is a great MOBA style, fast-action game. It includes over 30+ dragons and weapons with content being released on a semi-regular basis. The community is friendly (mostly, but no community is ever perfect) and the moderators are always willing to help. The developers are constantly making bug fixes and performance improvments.			"

												Congrats for the game! A lot of reviews did not seem fair to it!First of all, it's a different style of MOBA, the dinamics are different. Once you get the hang of it it's quite interesting. Nice concept of evolving the dragons and weapons. From my point of view, it is an awesome game that any moba fan and arcade fan should play this. Some elements of randomness help to keep the game interesting.If anybody wants to chat about dis game, steamId: leoldflexian			"

												I really like this game because of all of it's action and stratagy that you have to involve in it and im not saying it's perfect. In act 1 you can get a free dragon after beating and theres up to act 3 right now and it involves a really cool story line sounds cool right, guess again. you have to pay for the other act's and a lot of the things you can buy with real money and or game money is kind of overpriced in my opinion because you only get 100 money per victory and it cost's 5000 for 3 random dragon eggs and 2500 for a new weapen, there is intresting runes too and you can upgrade your weapens at the forge with stuff you find in battle or pay for wich is the only cheap thing in my opinion. Other than that this game is amazing you really have to work with your team in battle to cover everything and it's still preatty difficult ven if you have 5 ppeople in skype. you also get this portrait of a dragon and when you level up it fills up by that much more with i liek to level up in for that reason. So in conclusion i think it's an awsome game and can't wait for future updates.			"

												The game itself is very well made, and all of it feels smooth and works well; however the only concern i have is how the single player campaign is set out and that you need certain dragons to proceed and get the ultimate prize from the single-player campaign, however this is talking about the BEST reward from it, so grind will be required but it isn't that bad.In terms of the PvP: the servers are a little bit jumpy in places but overall it is very stable and I have enjoyed playing it ever once in a while; so playing it constantly can feel a bit dull without access to everything, but working towards your next dragons is a great feeling.The currency is fair as it gives a fair amount per game and you get 3 dragons for the amount of 5000 gems; the only complaint I have about the currency is that you can't buy individual dragons without paying in real money and this is a handicap I feel, as you can't really get what you want when you want.Overall the game is good but it will take some time to get into, besides that it is a great game.

												I wouldn't say this is pay to win, but it's definitely pay to get what you actually want.You can purchase what you ""need"" with in game money but what you get is random; so if you wanted that shiny gold dragon on the list you either buy it with irl money or keep buying random ones with in-game money, which you won't want to do. Each random ""pack"" of dragons (which is only three may I add) costs 5000 in-game money and you need more than one to get the highest teir dragon... Storyline missions and battles only give you around 20-60 each. Don't think you can complete tutorial objectives to speed this up as you start out either, how about a 50 reward for a task that requires you spend 150.So you either want to pay or you're in for the hard slog for that shiny gold dragon you set your eyes on.This game also doesn't have much to do when it comes to the matches in multiplayer and from what I've seen there is only one map per game-mode, making it rather boring after a while. The tutorial is lacking... the options are even more lacking... i.e. prety much non-existent, and I can see why it makes some people think facebook game... I also came to the realization that this game isn't technically free to play at all and that's a misleading claim to draw you in. The DLC for this is literally the game and theres only two parts of DLC so far, which may I just say you will not want. Each DLC gives you 10 relatively short missions and you have to complete each mission 15 times over with different requirements to unlock the best prize. That isn't replayability, it's just a SLOG. No prize is worth the aggrevation of dragging yourself through the same 10 scenarios 15 times over! So this game is not only mingy, but misleading, very short on content and is money-intensive.I'm still playing it, but it's not getting a thumbs up from me.			"

												I have played this game for 42 hours on this acount (plus some more an my friends account) and i honestly dont see why it is getting so many bad reviews. I see some things that could be fixed, but not much.First of all, a lot of people are having problems with the compaign as in finding it too hard to complete or the time you have to put into it just to get a new dragon. i'm just going to mention that the dragons in it are not the best ones to have anyway. so i went through all the act 1 campaign missions with only having to restart once in recruit, and it was the last mission. you have 3 respawns before you die and it isn't too hard to complete. Yes its a bit difficult to be at recruit level, but i still managed to do it fairly easily. One thing that does annoy me is that after the first act is complete, you have to buy the second act onwards. now this promoted the game as a pay to win, and i know that people wanting single player aspects of the game will be unhappy about this, buy there is still a 5v5 single player match ♥♥♥♥hting with bots that can give you crystals.Secondly, they try to get you to pay for the dragons and weapons, but it really isn't needed. You get about 70 crystals per match (+ about 50-100 if you complete the mission that is given to you). this deosnt seem like a lot as the weapons pack costs 5000 and weapon packs cost 2500 crystals, but most matches you play pass really fast, and you will be surprised how fast the crystals stack up if you just play a few matches at a time.Another thing people are saying about this game is that the contols are clucky. me and my friends found them pretty easy to get used to, and i see new players not having much trouble moving around and fighting at the same time. its oretty easy to understand, right click somewhere to move to that location, letf click for your 1st attacka dn W, E and R for your other attacks. these are the basic controls that will be pretty much all you need to play in a match.The totorial is fairly okay, but you can get lost easily and they dont explain some things very clearly. This is pretty much my only problem with the game in my oppinion. Even if it's not your kind of game, it's free so i'd give it a try :3			"

												Want to play a MOBA without microtransactions? Titans pass gives you x4 gems which is the currency used to buy dragon eggs and weapon packs. Dragon egg packs cost 5000 gems  and weapon packs cost 2500 gems. Gems are earned by playing matches and is the only currency in game. Titans pass gives you all the dragons and weapons available. So you don't need to buy weapon. But that dosn't mean you need to stop buying  dragon packs. Because in this game. There are ways of making your favored combo stronger. BUT this involved getting to know every dragon. So dragon packs are the only way to do this. You combine 3 of the same dragons to increase its teir. A higher teired dragon has more health and reduced cooldown for abilities. There is also more health regen. Likewise. Weapons themselves can be paired with any dragon. Allowing versitility of the play style of over 27 dragons and weapons to make combinations with, and a growing list of weapons and dragons monthly. Titans pass gives you all the content you would get from microtransactions for a solid year. So any dragon or weapon to be released is yours. But as mentioned. Your farming quest is not over when you buy Titans pass. Because you still need to farm Mastery, another way to maximize your dragon. By playing your dragon more, the dragon itself gains xp going up in mastery rank with 5 teirs. First teir is basic, Second teir is bronze theird is silver fourth is gold and 5th is platnium. With each mastery upgrade to your favored dragon it gains more health and becomes faster and stronger. But don't let that fool you into thinking its an automatic win. Because combos and team mate support is the basic structure of this game. With good combos, and good team support. You have a better chance of winning. And with titan pass. You get to start with your favored combos early. And believe me there are over 70 combos currently to chose from. How? Because of runes and weapons forge. That is why. Not only do weapons have their own play style coupled with dragons. But there are 30 ranks which you the player earn. You buy runes packs of 3 to give your dragon those extra stats you need to make your combo you want TO WORK. THAT'S RIGHT. 2 runes activate every time you level. So you need to pick wisely what your combo will be. Survivability? Damage? Support? Tank? What will you play? There is so much to chose from. In any other MOBA you would have to shell out hundreds of dollars to get the oppertunity you get here for 20$. And even if you don't pay. You could easily achieve such status in a month of playtime. They give you 3 dragons every 15 days as long as you log in everyday and claim the daily reward. 1 basic dragon one t2 and on the 15th day a random t3. It's insainity what happens during the games now. With people shelling out their best combos games get hectic. WHen you think you can charge in solo is usually the time you should backup cuz flames and bolts are flying all over the place. Learning manuverability is extremely important in this game. and besides all those nice things. Skins. Yes skins. and avatars. If you buy titan pass you get any skin and avatar made for the next year. Best of all you get to keep everything you earn in this game, or buy with titan pass. You keep all the dragons weapons except the gem bonus for a year. You would need to buy titan pass again after the year is over. And a year LOL come on.... 12 months for 20 bucks for crap that would cost you hundreds ( Who in their right mind would pay that much for any microtransactions on a moba?!?) This game isn't trying to rob you folks. This is probably the only customer friendly moba out there, They literally catter to our whims in forums. So we could use more devs to catter to our whims if you decide to buy this thing. I wrote this review because the people who rip on this game are savage at filling the steam reviews with garbage.  "

												Russian and EnglishЯ лично не люблю free-to-play - опыт показывает что когда игра ""надоит"" денег разработчики просто продадут её кому-нибудь  или перекроят так что играть без доната будет невозможно - но пока в эту игру можно играть, надеюсь так и останется. Я оказался прав. Баланс игры не был даже поправлен, и вряд ли будет - разработчики теперь просто ""пихают"" туда мини-аддоны (+1 оружие, дракон и т.п.) и всё. Ждите перепродажи игры с её полной перекройкой.Первые ласточки - теперь уже невозможно выбрать карту для сражения. Но хоть НАКОНЕЦ-ТО добавили античиты и чуть убрали доминацию тач-падов.Итак игра формата Доты на драконах - правда с несколькими плюсами: - поправляю - теперь эти плюсы работают только для ко-оп мачта1) Намного быстрее - матч не больше 15 минут2) При использовании дракона и оружия мастерство растёт - но опыт оружия ничего не даёт, а вот здоровье и скорость дракона растёт.3) Вы всегда получите 2 ед. ресурса за игру для прокачки (ковки) оружия - если соберете их (используйте радар)4) Постоянные мини-достижения за которые вы премируетесь небольшой суммой кристаллов - сыграть 3 раза подряд в мачт (неважно в одиночной или мульти) к примеруВердикт - надеюсь игра останется на этом уровне ""бесплатности"", но жадность людей штука коварная...Имеет смысл если вы очень любите коллекционировать - дракончики бесподобны. I, hypostasial, dislike games free-to-play - experience shows that when game earn ""a lot of money"" delopers often selling it as franchise or will make gameplay impossible without donates - but this day this game can be played with no donate.Balance even wasn't ""attempted to be fixed"" and i had a big doubt that it will be - now developers just add ""new content"" (+1 weapon, dragon e.t.c.). Will wait for franchise soon with full change of game model i think.Now you can't pick game map. However they AT LAST added anti-cheats and fixed touch-pad superiority.So,.. we have a Dota-style on dragons - but with few features: - fixing - now it's all working for co-op only1) Fast - match no more 15 minutes2) Mastery of weapons and dragon will increase with every game - no boosts for weapon, but dragon get more health and speed3) You always get 2 points of resourse that needed to forge weapon - if you manage to collect it on map (use radar map)4) Permanently repeated mini-in-game achievments that give you a bonus small pack of crystals - like to complete 3 matches and no matter in single- or multi-modeVerdict - I hope that this game will continiue that type of ""free"", but human's greed is very treacherous vice...This game will be interest if you like collecteables - dragons are unmatched in that.

												after 10 minutes I already knew the controls suckthey expect you to have 3 hands: use stuff like WASD, use the arrow keys and use the mouseafter I changed them, I noticed it wasn't the buttons that sucked, if the arrow key controls would just stay they would make no sense, they literally combined 2 systems: 1 is rotate with left & right, move forward & backward, the other is press right to go right etc.the game itself doesn't really look promising in my opinion and the dragons are uglyothers may like it but I already hate it and I wouldn't recommend it(I remember it was free though, it would be a crime to ask money for that)			"

												Don't. Simply... don't. This game is about as deep as a puddle with a whooping two abilities per rideable dragon. One of which is the default attack. The graphics are quite low fidelity as well. And frankly the awkward control scheme (shift to move forward, space to backpedal again) seems more befitting for some sort of Ihpone game where you only have so little options available. Not worth it. At all.			"

												MOBA based on dragons, weapons and elements.Choose to either play the campaign or jump into games VS real people or bots. You pick a dragon of your choice, being different from each other and depending on its element, will give you two unique abilities - Q and R. Q is your main attack, it cost little mana and normally has a small cooldown, W is your secondary attack, usually if your dragon has an escape or damage reduction ability, its situated here. Now for the weapon, you get to pick an item of your choice to wield into battle, giving you the other two abilities, your E and R. Depending on what type of build you wish to play, these items will give different skills. Example is a mace that gives massive mana regen as a passive, your E, while the R is a dmg ability. Some items are strickly support, some are healing, some are damage and some are a mix of both. This allows you to play the same dragon with different weapons to create completely new builds and playstyles.There are no items in this game, the gold you collect from killing enemy players and minions is stored on your person and requires you to return back to base and dump the gold in a pile. This then gives you experience depending on how much gold you had stored away.Three different gamemodes, ARAM, normal MOBA with three lanes and a zone capture gametype.You begin the game with 3 random dragons and 3 random weapons, so if you don't get what you want, you will need to play a bunch of games for crystals to buy the desired items or pay real money for bundles.The objective of both the ARAM and normal 3 lane MOBA is to destroy the turrets linked to a statue, then destroy the statue to deactivate a forcefield that weakens your dragon and slows down his speed. Do this several times until you reach your titan and release it from its prison, (attack the main objective, like the nexus in LoL) and the game is over.I play League of Legends a lot of the time, so that satiates all my MOBA needs, but I do recommend trying it out, its free and pretty fun if your willing to get the hang of it.Personal Rating: 3/5			"

												Wow. This game. The detail. The thorough, clear, and easy-to-follow gameplay. Comparative to Shrek SuperSlam 2 for the PS3, this game has incredible controls and also very neat graphics. They even added shadows! I think this games hours will be skyrocketing. It is only a matter of days before I am sure that people find this game, and can dig in. I would give it an 87/100 only marking it down for the reason that.... actually no..... 90/100.... no no no no...... probably 99/100 simply because they have an American, an AMERICAN, in this game. I highly reccomend this game to Dota, Smite, and Lol veterans alike. 10/10.			"

												Free to play! IT boasts ... yet also sports a 'click here to pay 19,99 euros for a Titan Pass' after the first Act. Yeah, so, NO, this is not an entirely free game. I'm sure a truly free game is impossible, but I'd rather have seen them be upfront about it. I've played only a little bit and quite liked it. It's alright. But to be honest, there are far better MOBA style games out there and this one doesn't look particularly good either. It's not a horrible game, but I probably wouldn't spend the 20 bucks on it. It's a bit hard to recommend this one and it's certainly not free to play. I would probably believe them when it comes to it not being pay to win though. But yeah, I don't know about this one. At least anyone interested can try it out for the first Act.			"

												This is basically League of Legends. With dragons. And a campaign and a different item system and upgradable dragons and items and more fun.Don't let the devs hear this but I'd even pay for this game. Luckily, it's free to play and even free to win. The only thing you can purchase for real life money is the Titan Pass which unlocks many items and dragons which are also unlockable in free gameplay and some skins which you can't get for free, but which don't give you an advantage.And now stop reading and get this game and ride your dragon to victory.

												I don't normally give review to games because I'm a lazy♥♥♥♥♥dude. However, I'll give exception to this game.I totally recommend this anyone.SPOILER ALERT!It's a moba with different maps same goals though free the Almighty Titan of your side but with diffent perks to give you too, different dragons upgrading them into different tiers to get bonus stats, different weapons you need to forge or to improve them; for short, this is a unique MOBA category.You may think this is pay to win, but it's not. Even if you have a cool highest tier Dragon and Forged Weapon but you don't have strategy and you don't know what to do, you'll be an advance turkey for Thanksgiving to your opponent. For forge items, you may loot it within the game. For upgrading your dragons, save some crystals and use the random pact. But I recommend you guys to buy the TITAN PASS so that you can test all weapons and dragons that is suited to your play style and taste. It has a lot of perks too like you can get all skins and avatar skins too. You won't regret  buying it.This has a little bit difficulty in maneuvers (specifically in your basic attacks/1st skill and movements) at the start but you'll get a hang of it and that's a challenge. Plus, it's not even heavy to download this game. The game is growing as well. OVERALL: this is 10/10 "

												This type of MOBA/Mission game is so well balanced because of the variety of abilities you can have that aren't even recycled on different dragons. Despite the fact that it takes game money to buy weapons and dragons, it is quite a fun game with incredible dragon dynamics such as their mouth opening for a breath attack or their tail swaying as they fly. For the stages, they are quite interesting for their is always something for gold that you collect from everything. And if that doesn't get any better, you can even improve your weapons along with friendly developers that actually respond to any problems you post. If you're a MOBA person, then this game is PERFECT for you... At least until some point into the future			"

												I recommend this game because it has many fun elements. However it also has its cons.Pros - Tons of Dragons you can play as, with just as much weapons to use.- Single Player and Co-op mode for those who don't want to deal with PVP- Good storyline that is not long and obnoxious.Cons- Unable to select map and team- In Single player, the map is always MOBA- Crystal rewards are too little for players without the TITAN PASSIt is a very fun game, and as a big dragon fan, I adore all of the varying dragon styles. If you have the free time, I recommend playing this game.However, make sure it doesn't crash or close before entering a multiplayer map. Mine closed as the timer was counting down and now I am unable to play it. Other than that, no real problems with this game. "

There are constant connection problems with joining the server/game, and my connection is perfectly fine, for what I know.

												I'll elaborate on this later, but the anwer is YES.Dragons and titans isn't like other MOBA's. The action is much faster paced and a lot more fun. If you didn't like LOL and DOTA try this instead. If you like those two... this may still be for you.There's a combination of strategy and skill needed to win each match. Protect your stuff, gather gold , and free your titan!HIGHLY recomended.			"

												I'm making this short simply because I feel lazy at the moment.Pros:Dragons and WeaponsAct 1 - Solo campaign 3 free dragons and weapons also there is a free rotationControls are good may feel weird for you, but I found them to be straightforward The ForgeUpgradesCool mapsFree to playCons:Not that many modes just 3Money would help upgrade fasterPoor OptionsVery grindy if you don't spend any money which is normal for a f2p game right? (I was thinking warframe which I also enjoy.)That covers just about almost everything. I truely recommend a try and while playing please don't think about any other moba such as LoL or dota because this is different, it may share similarities, but it's still it's own game. I played this game on facebook and I must say that Wyrmbyte has improved Dragons and Titans.			"

												I recommend this game because it has many fun elements. However it also has its cons.Pros - Tons of Dragons you can play as, with just as much weapons to use.- Single Player and Co-op mode for those who don't want to deal with PVP- Good storyline that is not long and obnoxious.Cons- Unable to select map and team- In Single player, the map is always MOBA- Crystal rewards are too little for players without the TITAN PASSIt is a very fun game, and as a big dragon fan, I adore all of the varying dragon styles. If you have the free time, I recommend playing this game.However, make sure it doesn't crash or close before entering a multiplayer map. Mine closed as the timer was counting down and now I am unable to play it. Other than that, no real problems with this game. "

												The patch of 01/04/2014 which introduced an auto-aim really did dumb down the key strategic aspect of the game and  in my opinion this was one of the stronger points of the game. It no longer requires any skill at all to play which is painfully obvious after playing one match after another with 1-3 of your 4 teammates where always going afk, and pulling out a win albeit unlikely is still possible. By reducing the competitiveness of PvP to the extreme that they have, and not only with auto-aim but with matchmaking as well they made this feel like a ""grade school level"" type of moba where even basic levels of tactics, strategy, and intelligence are obsolete as Teamplay and individual skills no longer exists. The developers of this game boasts that this is a fast pace game and in fact it once was, today however the number of users using 1 hit kill hacks or speedhacks has made the community who do still play legit feel unmotivated during gameplay which is likely why there are now so many afkers on both sides in every match. While this can still be a fun game to play especially when both team are actually competing at their best, this however is becoming a rare sight. To give you some prospective, out of 30 matches I played today only 6 of them where interesting or engaging battles with all 10 players participating the others where mediocre 1 sided bouts often lasting under 60 seconds due to large amounts of afk'ing going on right from the start of the match, and at lest 4 of them had 1 or more hackers in it.In short the game itself is very fun and recommended,  it's the community's lack of interest or motivation to participate in the matches they chose to join that is in my opinion dragging this game down. And I believe that is ultimately cause by a horrible lack of competitiveness that the developers have now brought to the game.With that said I wouldn't recommend this game to all the competitive players of a moba genre, though I would recommend it to the more casual players,  first timers, and  perhaps the younger crowd of players just looking for a good time			"

												among many moba games i played, i can say i like this one more than most.the controls feel more ""action"" based than the rapid clicking of the right mouse button ou're pprobably used to in a moba. a refreshing change.the skills setup for each ""hero"" is left up to the player:a dragon gets their own 2 skills(one your basic attack, triggered with the left mouse button, and the other a skill usually exclusive to that dragon). it also gets 2 additional skills from a weapon you have chosen(among the free rotation weapons and what you already own), allowing a healer to set mines or cannons and a close ranged nuker to assassinate from long range.i cant cover everything but i will say this: rather than the pay to win people in the review section say this is, the experienced(or atleast the guy who played this game longer) will have an advantage, unless the person who pays really opens up their wallet to forge his weapon to the max right from the start and instantly jumps to a fully upgraded dragon(and even so the advantage is small enough to allow everyone a chance at winning)			"

												Ok, first I have to say, I am a pro at this game. I am level 27 and have 86 in game hours. That said this is a very unique game.It is very well balanced. It's never happens that some rich kid that spent a ton of money in game comes up with some superweapon and annihilates everyone. The games are rank based so if your a lvl 2 noob the youll play level 1-5 players  who are also noobs. The number of weapon - dragon combinations are staggering. with over 30 wepons and 30 dragons that can be combined in any way you have millons of combinatons. And the viarances on the playing style on each is so different you will never exaust   the posibilites. And the balance between the different weapon am dragon types is amazing.If you were expecting graphics likw in a multimilon dollar game like bioshock, well, you'll be dissapointed of course. This game is free. No money needed. In fact, paying money in game only gives you different options. It doesn't give you more powerfull options. Paying money makes absoultely no difference in pvp games. As far as as free to play goes, this game is excelent. Allowing players to spend money without unbalancing the pvp games.If you want a free to play moba, this is it.			"

												First the bad stuff:-EXPENSIVE game if you are gonna use euros to unlock dragons... you can unlock random dragons but you don't know if you will some of the old dragons you got (coming back to that later) or someone new to test.Also buying a single dragon costs just as much as buying 3 random ones and you get the first rank of the dragon... not the 3rd rank (something that is a really bad deal for what? 3-5 euro).-There are 3 diffrent ranks between the dragons that increases armor (or hp or whatever) and movement speed... something that means if you meet someone that you just as great against... and you got the first rank and he got the 2nd or 3rd rank of the same dragon... he will win because of his small stat gain... I do love the dragon ranks... but it would have been enough with just the graphical coolness of higher rank dragons... Removing stats on diffrent mastery ranks would be really smart...-The lore and the dialogs feels like are written by a 5 year old... some of the dialog is so bad and some of the missions feel so stupid that I some times started to wonder why I even tested this game at all...There are mobs in the act 1 missions that are so annoying... like some ghosts that are protecting some crypts you need to destroy... They all just fly towards you and push you out of position and you take damage without the monsters having any animation at all... almost like you thought it was made by an indie game company without any animators... or any interested programmers to actually make a decent mob script...-Every time you complete an act you get an dragon... The main problem with that is that the act is so long and the amount of gems (that you can use for unlocking more dragons) is so low... you rather feel like playing lol or any other type of moba game because you progress a lot faster in those games.. But, yeah you can also get mastery on the dragon by doing ALL the challanges on every mission in every act! That's 15 reruns of each of the missions you actually would'nt want to play in the first place! 15!!!!!!-there is no way to do practice games vs bots to try out dragons. I know it's a free rotation every week but yeah. If you want a player to waste 5 euro on one dragon you better let him have a taste of what he is gonna buy or else the player will find something else to waste his money on... and that won't be anything related to this game... unless he buys shyvanna from lol... because she is a dragon thingie... same with Ao in smite... or whatever that chinese dragon's name is...I felt that these things needed to be highlighted in the review because these are pretty annoying and game/mood breaking things that I have noticed so far in the game and it's the first impression a new player meet in this game.Good things about the game.-The movement system is quite functional. easy to move around and holding space makes you fly backwards while you can use your skills in the direction you are pointing... It may give a good feeling in pvp.-Game looks ok/good graphical. Of course there could be some major improvements in the graphics... but I liked it...-There are tons of interesting and cool looking dragons... gives you the interest of wanting to try everyone of them... To bad there is'nt a 20 dragon bundle pack of rank 2 dragons or whatever...-The way you get to chose your two first skills by the dragon type and the two other remaining skills by chosing items is actually really well done. I liked it a lot... To bad I will use my time playing smite instead untill they manage to do some major changes in how their greedy minds works...-I am pretty certain that if you play this game for a month or two... all the negative things I wrote won't really be an issue as you will have unlocked a few dragons just by gems and dices that the game will be worthwhile to game full time. That and the horrible campaign will be long gone memories that you would never have to touch with your mind ever the f... again....			"

THIS FEELS A LOT LIKE ""VORP""!  And I loved that game, too bad it was taken off Kongregate, but I am wondering if they're by the same people as this games ""Legacy Controls"" play exactly like VORP!.Give it a try guys, it may be buggy, but it's free and fun.  (for now...  I've heard rumors that it's ""pay 2 win"" but my first match I went 11/0 so...  yeah)9/23/2014Literally impossible to play due to a glitch.Short version: their server bumped me out the second I was buying my first dragon pack.Now I the game won't let me progress through tutorials until I buy dragons.I don't own my 3 dragons anymore that I earned (see my screenshots)Yet I'm still missing the 5,000 gems I used for transaction.Great job guys, hope my support letter to you will get this fixed soon.

												Love this game! Awesome dragons, awesome weapons. My one and only complaint is that there is no way to buy the dragon or weapon or skin or avatar, etc you want. You either have to grind out 5000 gems and buy three random dragons, or do the daily reward. And even then, you're only getting dragons. There is no way to buy avatars or skins except by the Titan Pass. I don't like the Titan Pass because it takes the fun out of playing and grinding to get new stuff. I like having to earn gems to buy dragons, I just wish I could get more than just dragons and weapons and runes with the gems I earn. Even if the avatars and skins were like 10,000 gems or more then at least I could earn them myself. A good idea for the people making money on this game: Let people choose between grinding out a lot of gems to get the skins or avatars or buy them for real money. OR They can buy a specific skin or avatar with real money AND hold events every now and again to win a free or reduced price avatar or skin. There just needs to be some way that players can get one specific thing in game they want. The Titan Pass takes the fun out of the game because it unlocks everything and leaves nothing but the gameplay, which is totally fun don't get me wrong, but part of the fun is grinding to unlock things bit by bit. It gives players a sense of accomplishment to unlock things themselves. I have read through a good portion of the reviews and like 90 somthing % of them that like this game, complain about the Titan Pass so I am not alone in this and you might want to change it so that your number of players increases. People will pay $5 for an in game dragon. They are unlikely to pay $20 for every dragon. Yes, there are exceptions because it is a good deal if you look at what you're getting for $20, but for the rest of us, we're looking at the fact that you're taking away the fun of unlocking things. Forgive the repetitiveness and lengthiness of this review and I really hope those in charge of how this game works will take my ideas into consideration.			"

												/!\ the mentionned bugs were fixed within a day ! Please keep this in mind while reading ! /!\I did not play a lot, I do not hide it. Yet I feel like I have played enough to give my impressions on this game.What I noticed first was graphical issues. Some textures seem to me missing whatever quality / resolution I am using. Maybe this will be fixed later, maybe this did not happen to other people, but on my side it does. This isn't game breaking but it did not gave me a good feeling at first, I'm afraid.Looking at the different solo missions available, it is quite obvious that dragons and titans is about playing it again, again, and again. Playing a few memorable missions is something I would like to do, but, please, don't make us play 15 times the 10 missions of every act. This does not make me want to keep going. Sure, there are rewards awaiting you if you are patient enough to accomplish this, but I don't feel like it is worth it.The controls are pretty okay to me. Right click to move, left click to attack. It has auto aiming so you can move around and attempt dodging fireballs and stuff while breathing stuff at others. Every playable character has its regular attack, different from the others, and its active skill. You can equip a weapon to gain two more active skills. Gold isn't used to buy stuff but when returning it to your team's horde you get experience points.  I liked things being this way : simple, allowing you to play right off the bat without wasting your time setting up the perfect build.I'm coming back to the farming / grinding thing : everything can be bought at once with the titan pass as well as the next year's new weapons and mounts (I have no idea is this is still worth it from now on... I don't know how fast things are being added) or one by one with real money. And, god, this is expensive if you don't take the titan pass. Or you can grind, and grind, and grind to get enough gems (the in-game currency) to buy a pack of three mounts that can be mounts you already possess ! You apparently can upgrade them if you have x times the same tier of a mount's type but I still did not went to this point.There is an annoying ""bug"" where there is an ""attention"" pop-up seemingly wanting to tell me something... But it is empty and there is no way to get rid of it, forcing me to quit and relaunch the game. This is pretty annoying when this always happens after around 20, 25 minutes of gameplay.To sum it up : a pretty easy MOBA to get in with little work to put in builds. If you want to get new stuff, buy it or grind a lot. Since it's free to play, giving it a try will not hurt anyone. I just hope you won't get the few annoying things I got while playing.I am recommending this to people who know nothing about MOBAs and would like to know the very basics of what it is. I find LoL and Dota2 quite harder to get at first so this game might be a good start.Cheers !			"

												I believe this will be the first review written by someone who has more than a few menial hours invested in the game. I've played a season and a half, last season I was ranked somewhere in the top 50. To begin with, this game has epic potential, I discovered it by chance via fb apps and after many hours and a terrible kdr (kill death ratio) , I grew to love it. The mechanics, the community and the competitive spirit. Making my way up the ranks I watched in awe at how good the pro players were and worked at getting a decent, well thought out rune set and understand the strengths and weaknesses of the multitude of dragons and weapons available. The negative reviews here were likely written by people who failed to grasp, that this, like most moba's, has a learning curve and that you need to adapt to get any joy from the game. How many of us kicked off Dota2 or LoL and mastered controls and gameplay immediately? Last season the game suffered immense balance issues with the release of a terribly OP'd dragon and weapon. This was fixed, somewhat at the start of season 4 and a great many dragons were improved.You may at this point ask yourself why I don't recommend the game. The truth is, I don't recommend it for anyone who enjoys a competitive moba experience, I don't recommend it for anyone who enjoys a challenge. Those aspects no longer exist in the DnT universe thanks to the fantastic work the devs did with the controls.The game now gives you the option of using ""legacy"" controls, that don't provide auto-aim or strafing and the new controls which do. They claim it's to make the game easier and even out the playing field. They believe this ease of play will attract new players. It isn't and I doubt it will. What it has caused is the current boycott of pvp matches and micro-transactions. if you have a look at their fb page you'll be greeted with tons of negative comments from the once loyal community, including those who stuck with this game since open beta. To summarize, pvp is a mess, stay away from it.Get This Game IF:You enjoy ease of play akin to the My Little Pony collection.You have no interest in moba or pvp.You own the directors cut of Eragon.You're bored out of your mind and you'd like to login on days like this to read the excellent lore.Avoid like a Justin Bieber concert If:You love a challenge.You have better things to do, like watching paint dry.Have an interest in Esports.

Its not only that this game is completly pay to win. In addition there is no real punishment for leavers. At multiplayer i never had a game where it was 5v5 till the end. The last bit of fun at this game is totally ruined by leavers and BOTs that makes really every game like a 2v3, 3v1 etc.			"

												If you are planning to try this game or thinking of getting Titan Pass, please read the following. Also notice the number of game hours I have (~960 hours).  This game is very badly broken. There are far too many OP combos that can not be played against. You will receive assurances that they are being fixed but they haven't been for 3 seasons at least. Some examples of OP unplayable combos: 50% of available dragons + Truth's charge (Any map) Venomtail + Sparrowthorn (Any map) Venomtail + Winterfloe (Any map) Rimrock + Sparrowthorn (Any map) Lunaveil + Sphere of wudeng (Ballistae Alley, but OP on any map) Goldenclaw + chillblade (Any map) Magmascale + chillblade (Chaos Unleashed / MOBA, but OP on any map) Autobot + chillblade (Chaos Unleashed / MOBA) Swiftwing + Unity mark (Chaos Unleashed / MOBA) DarkOne + chill blade (Any map) Dreadnaught + Rodar (Ballistae Alley) Gravelurker + Truth's charge (Nether gate)So skill really makes no difference in this game. Use any of the above combos to get lots of kills. Kills translate to higher ranking and more crystals, so you can buy more dragons. You can combine dragons to make more powerful dragons so you can get more kills, so continues the cycle. Some of you reading below will say I am a bad player complaining because I don not have the dragons listed below. Trust me, I have 10+ highest level (T4) dragons including 5 of the OP combos mentioned below. As a principle I refuse to use OP combos. So most of the time I am either getting killed or just defending against OP combos (using a defensive combo - see below). As I mentioned, the above weapon combos are unplayable against, which means you have a 90% chance of losing against them. Only way to counter the Truth's charge weapon is to use the Chillblade weapon. So you will see lots of 'so called pros' running around with those combos. The only other way you can keep yourself from being killed every 1-2 minutes is to use a Tanglewing dragon + Rainmaker combo (my defensive combo). The moderators and devs do not care about fixing the game and in fact are the people who use the OP combos. So if you are a new player, you are only helping them increase their ranking. What can you say about people whos only sense of importance is getting higher ranking using an OP combo on an online game... ;-) This game allows duos (where two players can play together on same team). This just makes a broken game even more impossible to win. So two already good players will duo with OP combos making the odds of winning impossible. So you can bring complementary combos (e.g. two combos that almost slow enemy to a halt, combos that give unlimited health + mana, etc) So by the end of the game you will see they have killed like 15+ times each. I have rarely seen mods on here who are sensible. The only qualification for being a mod on this game is to support the game no matter how broken it is and to of course prove it is not broken by using an OP combo. So that entails using the OP combo to show its broken and of course to keep telling players that nerfs and balances are coming. Trust me, they are not. 3 seasons ago, the DarkOne + Truth's charge was OP and we were told it was nerfed. Guess what, it still is OP and impossible to play against. The game has 5 vs 5 PVP games mostly where you can use a preselected dragon + weapon combo. However it is so badly broken that it allows more than one player to use the same combo. So it is not unusual to see all 5 players using the same dragon or combo. So you will see games where you opposite team has 5 Dreadnaughts + Rodar's sceptre combo. That dragon is basically has the highest health and one of the highest damages in this game and can heal other dragons. Rodar's sceptre weapon increases your dragon's damage. So you know playing that game has like a 0.001% chance of winning. Hell, even if you have two Dreadnaughts in your team or enemy team the game becomes unbalanced since the 2 of those dragons will just outheal any damage you take or inflict. Unlike other games, you can not pick what dragons or weapons you want to buy. 5000 in game crystals get you 3 random dragons out of 30+ possible dragons. 2500 crystals get you 3 random weapons out of 25+ possible weasopns. You do not know what dragon you will get and if you get duplicates you are stuck with them. You can sell or use duplicate dragons to create higher level dragons, but given most dragons except the OP ones are useless, you are just wasting your time. So you can grind for hours and let yourself be killed hundreds of times by OP combos in the hope that you can get enough crystals to get better dragons. But after all that effort, you do not control which dragon or weapon u get. Despite all the above, if you still want to go ahead and try the game, my advice is that you try it for free. Do not waste any of your money on Titan's pass. Yes, they will say you get 4 times more crystals per game. Yes, they will say you will get access to all dragons and weapons but you already know you only ever need one of the 2 OP weapons and one of the above mentioned OP dragons. Better yet, keep making multiple accounts to get dragons + weapons. Since each new account gets 3 free dragons and weapons, you might get lucky with an account and get one of the OP combos above. The when u want to use that OP combo switch to that account to play, then create another account to try and get another OP combo... :-)I hope this review helps you understand what you are getting into for this game and what you will get in return for your money. My advice is simple - do not invest your money or time in this game. Try any of the other games that this game tried to copy very badly - Leage of Legends, DOTA2, plenty others... At least there you will supporting a community that really cares.			"

												Okay, so I've been playing this game for a while and here is what I have to say.It's pretty damn good, the visuals are nice, the various dragons keep matches interesting and I can assure you, you'll have a hard time finding only one you like.A lot of people tend to compare this to something like League of Legends, or DOTA. I honestly don't understand that comparison, I've seen LoL and I've played DOTA. And while all three games are MOBA, they're all unique in their own way. So with that out of the way, let's get onto the pros and cons of this game...Pros-VarietyOh yes, there is quite a selection to choose from, with lots of dragons and weapons the choose from. Each mixing together in their own way. Some for better, some for worse.-CommunityThe community for this game is usually rather friendly and welcoming, I believe a major factor to this is the smaller player base in comparison to something like DOTA.-OriginalityAlthough the game is rather standard when it comes to MOBA maps and gameplay, they aesthetics stand out from the rest. While most MOBAs have you going toe to toe in some sort of arena, forest, etc. This game takes it up a notch, you're flying on the back of these magnificent beasts high in the sky, fighting on various planes to free your Titan as the battle between light and dark wages on.-StoryBesides the ""Lore"" tab on all of the weapons and dragons, the game also has a single player story mode, something I've never seen in this kind of game before. In which various events call upon you to help. Whether it's bringing the Myre Bog back to peace, or fighting through Magekeep in a desperate struggle for power. Most of the story is rather interesting, albeit with some problems.-ForgingAnother thing I find rather unique to this game. You will get various gemstones throughout your playtime, those are used in the Forge to buff your weapons, giving it various perks such as shortening the cooldown for abilities, the mana cost of some abilities, or even just a flat out increase of damage.Cons-MapsThe maps are your typical MOBA style maps, although usually with some sort of twist. The problem being there's only four maps as this is being written. Chaos Unleashed, Baliste Alley, Nethergate and Towers and Titans. It's a shame, alongside the fact all multiplayer matches use the same map. The maps rotate on a vote system every thirty (30) minutes.-The PlayerbaseDon't get me wrong, the community is lovely, and most have a really good attitude. But the issue is how small it is, as it can lead to long queue times. Other than that there's not much to complain.So in conclusion, Dragons and Titans is nice little MOBA with new aspects to it, while still keeping it familar to fans of the genre. And if you like it, a Titan Pass is only 20 USD a month for a year's worth of content.			"

												A good concept ruined by poor execution. All dragons, while unique in appearance are all very similiar. Each dragon only has two attacks, and almost all of them have a standard breath attack. So really dragons only have one attack that is different from another dragon. The way they tried to fix this, was with weapons. Equipping a weapon will give your dragon two more attacks depending on the weapon you equipped. The problem is, this doesn't make things more unique, it makes them more stale. Say you and another dragon have the same weapon equipped. Well now you and that dragon only have one unique move between each other, and he's a completely different dragon. This is made even worse by the fact that there is no item shop in game. Dragons scale with levels, thats it. So while you might do good damage to an enemy DPS, theres nothing you can do to help you damage against a Tank, or if you need more HP to survive, theres no way to get it.Speaking of ""no way to get it"", thats what I have to tell you bout a dragon you might want to buy. You see, you don't just buy the one you want, oh no, you have to get lucky and play whats basically a slot machine and hope you get lucky. Oh you got the one you want you say? Well guess what, dragons actually have different levels outside of the game that make them stronger. So while you may have gotten that awesome Gemtalon I, he's nowhere near as strong or awesome as Gemtalon III.Its a watered down moba, aiming to cash in on the popularity of dragons by locking them all behind a slot machine and hoping you spend a bunch of money to get one, before you realize the game isn't deep enough to warrant spending money.

												An interesting game no question about that. The idea is great and the story is adaptable, but I do have my...pieves.For one the map on the home page of the game is to say the least confusing.The next is in my opinion most of the dragons share the same body type (two wings,Two leggs) that is most likely my biggest pieve. But other then the two things I didn't like it is still a great game, I totally recommend this game for any dragon lovers like me.I give this game a good...4 stars :D			"

Its not only that this game is completly pay to win. In addition there is no real punishment for leavers. At multiplayer i never had a game where it was 5v5 till the end. The last bit of fun at this game is totally ruined by leavers and BOTs that makes really every game like a 2v3, 3v1 etc.			"

												I believe this will be the first review written by someone who has more than a few menial hours invested in the game. I've played a season and a half, last season I was ranked somewhere in the top 50. To begin with, this game has epic potential, I discovered it by chance via fb apps and after many hours and a terrible kdr (kill death ratio) , I grew to love it. The mechanics, the community and the competitive spirit. Making my way up the ranks I watched in awe at how good the pro players were and worked at getting a decent, well thought out rune set and understand the strengths and weaknesses of the multitude of dragons and weapons available. The negative reviews here were likely written by people who failed to grasp, that this, like most moba's, has a learning curve and that you need to adapt to get any joy from the game. How many of us kicked off Dota2 or LoL and mastered controls and gameplay immediately? Last season the game suffered immense balance issues with the release of a terribly OP'd dragon and weapon. This was fixed, somewhat at the start of season 4 and a great many dragons were improved.You may at this point ask yourself why I don't recommend the game. The truth is, I don't recommend it for anyone who enjoys a competitive moba experience, I don't recommend it for anyone who enjoys a challenge. Those aspects no longer exist in the DnT universe thanks to the fantastic work the devs did with the controls.The game now gives you the option of using ""legacy"" controls, that don't provide auto-aim or strafing and the new controls which do. They claim it's to make the game easier and even out the playing field. They believe this ease of play will attract new players. It isn't and I doubt it will. What it has caused is the current boycott of pvp matches and micro-transactions. if you have a look at their fb page you'll be greeted with tons of negative comments from the once loyal community, including those who stuck with this game since open beta. To summarize, pvp is a mess, stay away from it.Get This Game IF:You enjoy ease of play akin to the My Little Pony collection.You have no interest in moba or pvp.You own the directors cut of Eragon.You're bored out of your mind and you'd like to login on days like this to read the excellent lore.Avoid like a Justin Bieber concert If:You love a challenge.You have better things to do, like watching paint dry.Have an interest in Esports.

												DaT is a good all round MOBA.  However, I feel that the amount of in-game unlocks you can buy is stupid: to play the other chapters of a quite good single player campaign (for a MOBA) you have to pay £15 for the titan pass; to get new dragons or weapons you can only buy with crystals(the in game free currency) 3 packs so you can't buy just one unless you want to spend £1.50 on one.At the end of the day it's a free game to play which is good and it has a unique MOBA playstyle but the purchases tarnish a otherwise okay game			"

												Okay, so I've been playing this game for a while and here is what I have to say.It's pretty damn good, the visuals are nice, the various dragons keep matches interesting and I can assure you, you'll have a hard time finding only one you like.A lot of people tend to compare this to something like League of Legends, or DOTA. I honestly don't understand that comparison, I've seen LoL and I've played DOTA. And while all three games are MOBA, they're all unique in their own way. So with that out of the way, let's get onto the pros and cons of this game...Pros-VarietyOh yes, there is quite a selection to choose from, with lots of dragons and weapons the choose from. Each mixing together in their own way. Some for better, some for worse.-CommunityThe community for this game is usually rather friendly and welcoming, I believe a major factor to this is the smaller player base in comparison to something like DOTA.-OriginalityAlthough the game is rather standard when it comes to MOBA maps and gameplay, they aesthetics stand out from the rest. While most MOBAs have you going toe to toe in some sort of arena, forest, etc. This game takes it up a notch, you're flying on the back of these magnificent beasts high in the sky, fighting on various planes to free your Titan as the battle between light and dark wages on.-StoryBesides the ""Lore"" tab on all of the weapons and dragons, the game also has a single player story mode, something I've never seen in this kind of game before. In which various events call upon you to help. Whether it's bringing the Myre Bog back to peace, or fighting through Magekeep in a desperate struggle for power. Most of the story is rather interesting, albeit with some problems.-ForgingAnother thing I find rather unique to this game. You will get various gemstones throughout your playtime, those are used in the Forge to buff your weapons, giving it various perks such as shortening the cooldown for abilities, the mana cost of some abilities, or even just a flat out increase of damage.Cons-MapsThe maps are your typical MOBA style maps, although usually with some sort of twist. The problem being there's only four maps as this is being written. Chaos Unleashed, Baliste Alley, Nethergate and Towers and Titans. It's a shame, alongside the fact all multiplayer matches use the same map. The maps rotate on a vote system every thirty (30) minutes.-The PlayerbaseDon't get me wrong, the community is lovely, and most have a really good attitude. But the issue is how small it is, as it can lead to long queue times. Other than that there's not much to complain.So in conclusion, Dragons and Titans is nice little MOBA with new aspects to it, while still keeping it familar to fans of the genre. And if you like it, a Titan Pass is only 20 USD a month for a year's worth of content.			"

												If you like dragons...you MUST at least try this game, no matter if others think is bad, you need to discover it by yourself.This game have too many negative evaluations, I think because maybe one tried it and had a bug (is something that can happen, but with any game) or had not a good impression at first time. And besides any possible reason, if one just do not like a thing or a game, should just move on and go to find a new one, not be so destructive against one, it's unuseful and give just bad repercussions, and there is no needed of that.The game is good and enjoyable, but it need more players! and when people come here to see the reviews and see all this negative votes are are discouraged and do not give it a try even if it's a Free to Play !!The game need more good reviews, I think that ANY player that like Dragons and Titans, should tell others that, and not only in the chat, but write a positive review here and suggest it to other people! And I'm here to do it!There is a part of pay to win too but it's almost insignificant, because if you like the game and enjoy to play as a DRAGON RIDER you'll gain things easy and with time, the beautiful aspect of this game besides the fact that you can chat and play with others, do pvp (players against other players) is that there are many dragons! And you can collect them and try them during the time, same for the weapons! that are many and different, this aspect make the game to have also a strategy side, it's not just about to throw your dragon against the enemy, but you have to learn each ability and potential, and also collaborate with others players and make a plan. You can also play easy against the computer in single player and with others too making co-op The game may seems repetitive or boring, but the fact is that every game have a line, its history and structure, each in its own way it is structured with certain bases, and the rest comes from the actions that one does and how he lives it, as it acts. And this one make no exceptions, and it works following a precise line.Personally I use a lot my imagination too, and I just love to see dragons, to play them and see the animations during the battles!!So let's give it a try!! it deserve it :)and share it Dragons Lords !!!

												If you are planning to try this game or thinking of getting Titan Pass, please read the following. Also notice the number of game hours I have (~960 hours).  This game is very badly broken. There are far too many OP combos that can not be played against. You will receive assurances that they are being fixed but they haven't been for 3 seasons at least. Some examples of OP unplayable combos: 50% of available dragons + Truth's charge (Any map) Venomtail + Sparrowthorn (Any map) Venomtail + Winterfloe (Any map) Rimrock + Sparrowthorn (Any map) Lunaveil + Sphere of wudeng (Ballistae Alley, but OP on any map) Goldenclaw + chillblade (Any map) Magmascale + chillblade (Chaos Unleashed / MOBA, but OP on any map) Autobot + chillblade (Chaos Unleashed / MOBA) Swiftwing + Unity mark (Chaos Unleashed / MOBA) DarkOne + chill blade (Any map) Dreadnaught + Rodar (Ballistae Alley) Gravelurker + Truth's charge (Nether gate)So skill really makes no difference in this game. Use any of the above combos to get lots of kills. Kills translate to higher ranking and more crystals, so you can buy more dragons. You can combine dragons to make more powerful dragons so you can get more kills, so continues the cycle. Some of you reading below will say I am a bad player complaining because I don not have the dragons listed below. Trust me, I have 10+ highest level (T4) dragons including 5 of the OP combos mentioned below. As a principle I refuse to use OP combos. So most of the time I am either getting killed or just defending against OP combos (using a defensive combo - see below). As I mentioned, the above weapon combos are unplayable against, which means you have a 90% chance of losing against them. Only way to counter the Truth's charge weapon is to use the Chillblade weapon. So you will see lots of 'so called pros' running around with those combos. The only other way you can keep yourself from being killed every 1-2 minutes is to use a Tanglewing dragon + Rainmaker combo (my defensive combo). The moderators and devs do not care about fixing the game and in fact are the people who use the OP combos. So if you are a new player, you are only helping them increase their ranking. What can you say about people whos only sense of importance is getting higher ranking using an OP combo on an online game... ;-) This game allows duos (where two players can play together on same team). This just makes a broken game even more impossible to win. So two already good players will duo with OP combos making the odds of winning impossible. So you can bring complementary combos (e.g. two combos that almost slow enemy to a halt, combos that give unlimited health + mana, etc) So by the end of the game you will see they have killed like 15+ times each. I have rarely seen mods on here who are sensible. The only qualification for being a mod on this game is to support the game no matter how broken it is and to of course prove it is not broken by using an OP combo. So that entails using the OP combo to show its broken and of course to keep telling players that nerfs and balances are coming. Trust me, they are not. 3 seasons ago, the DarkOne + Truth's charge was OP and we were told it was nerfed. Guess what, it still is OP and impossible to play against. The game has 5 vs 5 PVP games mostly where you can use a preselected dragon + weapon combo. However it is so badly broken that it allows more than one player to use the same combo. So it is not unusual to see all 5 players using the same dragon or combo. So you will see games where you opposite team has 5 Dreadnaughts + Rodar's sceptre combo. That dragon is basically has the highest health and one of the highest damages in this game and can heal other dragons. Rodar's sceptre weapon increases your dragon's damage. So you know playing that game has like a 0.001% chance of winning. Hell, even if you have two Dreadnaughts in your team or enemy team the game becomes unbalanced since the 2 of those dragons will just outheal any damage you take or inflict. Unlike other games, you can not pick what dragons or weapons you want to buy. 5000 in game crystals get you 3 random dragons out of 30+ possible dragons. 2500 crystals get you 3 random weapons out of 25+ possible weasopns. You do not know what dragon you will get and if you get duplicates you are stuck with them. You can sell or use duplicate dragons to create higher level dragons, but given most dragons except the OP ones are useless, you are just wasting your time. So you can grind for hours and let yourself be killed hundreds of times by OP combos in the hope that you can get enough crystals to get better dragons. But after all that effort, you do not control which dragon or weapon u get. Despite all the above, if you still want to go ahead and try the game, my advice is that you try it for free. Do not waste any of your money on Titan's pass. Yes, they will say you get 4 times more crystals per game. Yes, they will say you will get access to all dragons and weapons but you already know you only ever need one of the 2 OP weapons and one of the above mentioned OP dragons. Better yet, keep making multiple accounts to get dragons + weapons. Since each new account gets 3 free dragons and weapons, you might get lucky with an account and get one of the OP combos above. The when u want to use that OP combo switch to that account to play, then create another account to try and get another OP combo... :-)I hope this review helps you understand what you are getting into for this game and what you will get in return for your money. My advice is simple - do not invest your money or time in this game. Try any of the other games that this game tried to copy very badly - Leage of Legends, DOTA2, plenty others... At least there you will supporting a community that really cares.			"

												this game would be awesome IF it wasn't for it needing soo many tweaks and fixes.  First of all is the targeting.  you virtually have no control over it.  sure you can hit the space bar to select the closest one to you, but too many times a bird would fly by and the dragon would act like the dogs from teh movie ""Up"" when they saw a squirle and immediately auto target the bird.  This is the game breaker for me. Too many times have i had a definate kill then all of a sudden a bird would fly by and my targeting would jsut switch and let teh enemy dragon get away.Second, there are alot of balacing/Tech issues with the game.  The Server lags tremendously. too many times do you hit a skill button and it does nothing, in match making it puts you in with other players that are way higher developed than you.  For Example, when the more you play a particular weapon or dragon, the higher rank you get with it. it goes through the typic progression of no rank -> bronze -> silver -> gold -> diamond.  when you rank your dragon up it moves faster and gets more health and the weapons get shorter cool downs on the skills it gives you.  this is a huge advantage in games as either they can jsut out run you and get away or chase you down with you having no hope of escaping.Thrid, is how oyu upgrade your dragons.  they go from I - IV and they get bonuses each time they upgrade.  you upgrade by getting 3 of a particular rank. you get dragons either by random chance by using crystals or you can buy the rank 1 for 2.99.  if you have a dragon you really like and want to get it to rank IV you either have to get really luckky with the random eggs OR you can by it for 81$ US.  Also as you lvl up you can start using Runes and to get runes you have to buy them with either crystals or using real money and even if you use real money the runes you get are totally random.  this is basically a pay to win game and if I am going to use real money i want a definate choice on what I spend my money on, not a random chance.Lastly is the game type selection.  Instead of letting you choose the game type you want to play, the map is voted on and then for the next 30 min you HAVE to play that map.This game is a huge let down because it has to the potential to be a great game, not only on the PC but console platforms too.  The game play is fun, but incredibly fustrating with all the issues it has that I mentioned above.  If they made the tweaks/Fixes to the issues i stated above I would definately recommend this game, but as it stands now I can NOT in good conscience recommend this game.			"

												It's a nice game, I guess, although at times it can seriously seem like an iPad app or something. If you don't get the dragon or weapon you want, then oh well, you'll have to go spend some money on it. Quite literally you have to pay for almost everything in the game. After beating the first long string of levels and unlocking the Noxwing, you have to pay some money to unlock the nest stupid long string of levels. It's also annoying that you have to rebuild your perks back up every single time you start a new level. Seriously, I play one level and max out my perks, then go to the next level and they're all gone again and I get slaughtered in about five seconds because of that. It also has numerous glitches that make it so you have to restart whatever level or challenge you're trying to do.			"

												This game is pretty fun. Not sure what anyone doesn't like. Now before you say that I am a high level player and I steamroll everything, let me just tell you I am only level 20. Sure I have played for a bit less than a year, but its still fun. I still win PvP against tier 3s and level 50s with max runes as they say. There are no no microtransactions in here unless its to buy a dragon which you really want, or an avatar which does nothing for gameplay. By the Dragon Pack, you can get any dragon in the game, but only 3, so it is fair. Play it before you judge it. Also you might want to get a decent computer for this.			"

												Too similar to other slow-paced mobas, this game only removes the floor from the levels and adds clunkiness to controls which doesn't make you feel like you're flying at all. Once I finished the entirely-too-patronizing handholder of a tutorial, and the main event tutorials, and saw my random selection of dragons and weapons, I knew the limitted vision of the creators wasn't going to keep me interested in this game. Bear in mind these are five-dollar dragons each. I got a dragon...made of wood. Then one...made of swords. The wood one, it blew THORNS like a reed pipe *toot toot toot* which brings me to the shallow sound design. Granted, it's a moba and isometric, but it'd be nice if the attacks, (since you only ever have four,) ought to be somewhat impacting or 'effective' sounding. The fire breathing sounds like a 10th-of-a-second loop of generic fireplace rumble. People say the screenshots don't reflect the game accurately, but I disagree, it's the angle of perspective from which they're taken that makes the game appear far more immersive than it actually is. The screenies look like they were shot from a TPS or at least quarter-down perspective, but in the main game this view isn't often available...the usual top-down affair is the mainstay. Click the screenies to view them in their full resolution and know, that's the BEST this game can look, from its most complimenting angle. All in all, have to recommend against this title, with so many more open and less expensive to enjoy mobas proliferating Steam these days. Just because this has dragons...doesn't make it worth playing. That's -all- it has. They aren't terribly attractive/compelling dragons anyways.			"

												THIS GAME IS TERRIBLE!!!!! it does not work right, cant even get past the tutorial stages because the game does not work correctly. you think hey maybe you can restart the game and it will fix the problem. well guess again cause it dosent let you back on for half an hr because of some server issue. Ive played betas that work better than this garbage. Dont waste your time people and definitely dont waste your money.			"

												I've played almost every MOBA and LoL and DotA 2 are by far the best. These games are just poorly made duplicates, with terrible encentives like Dragons and Titans. ""WOW!"" It has dragons (really cool bc dragons are beast) and titans (theyre also really cool divine people) and yeah sounds cool. Actually, does it  sound cool or is it just lame? The gameplay is filthy, it is also a bit P2W. There also isnt much strategy at all. Ill list them.- NO ♥♥♥♥ING ITEMS!!!!!! I mean, what the actual ♥♥♥♥.- 4 spells on each dragon, and about 15 dragons maybe. However, the Q is always a normal attack, usually fire breath. Sometimes a beam of light or something. So. really u have 3 spells now. they also have no strategy, normally theyre all dmg spells and basically all you do is spam them all on the enemy and hope for a kill. - Also, if you are a good player, and get fed heaps, it still wont mean that u can just fly around the map and burn everyone in 1 second. No, instead you are still weak as p!ss beacuse of the fact THAT THERE ARE NO ITEMS!!!!Basically, the game is absolute sh!t  "

												7/10I haven't played it very much yet, but I feel I can say it's a game I would recommend playing, and it's only 500MB. It might not be a big game like LoL or DotA, but I've enjoyed it. Yes, it didn't exploit the idea's potential, but it's a good game. The graphics aren't very good, but they aren't that important - though the level design looks very good to me.Some of the other reviews said that this is a pay to win, and I would say it definitely isn't. Yes, you have to play quite a lot to unlock new dragons - and this may be the only true downside I've found in this game - but you can get everything obtainable without throwing real money in it.For the gameplay, I must say it was pretty entartaining, though it wasn't too funny, but I guess it would be really nice to play with a bunch of friends while talking via voice chat.

												Hoard + Dota in a fun way :)No in-match items: Hoard all gold for a titan spawn and for a personal xp, and feel no pain as newcomer. You only have to pick a weapon for your dragon at picking phase, which is not very complicated.No counter-pick playing: You won't see enemy team until match start. Good for newcomers too.Not exactly pay2win: You can buy unlocks, but you also can earn them for playing in any game mode.So it's an easy-to-start game, not like most MOBA games.But remember: stick to a team from a start!Also, DRAGONS!

												Great concept but terrible execution. Game is unbalanced as hell, and bug ridden. Every update introduce new unbalanced items and new bugs. Old bugs drag on for years and the devs pay little attention to the quality. The game started on a good concept but was ruined by the developers due to ignorance and incompetence.There were 3 maps in the game, 2 of which were rubbish and nobody used to play maps other than the chaos/moba map. Instead of improving the other maps, they would force players to play random maps so the un-performing maps would be played. In addition, the 3 maps play differently, and the dragon/weapon selection would perform very differently depending on the map. This means no matter how much effort you put into this game, the outcome of a match is randomized, depending on which map it puts you into. This gives you an idea of the kind of people they are.The dragon and weapon selection is made before entering a game, and before you see any of your teammates or their selections. This means the player cannot choose combos that compliment the teammates. For a moba game this is horrible as players can never find a balanced team. Getting into a game with all support units against all attackers means a waste of 5-20 minutes of time.The game had a skill shot pvp system where players had to aim their shots. To dumb it down in a failed attempt to attract players, it was chcanged to auto-aim. So instead of maneuvering and finding an opening to shoot the opponent, players now hold down the mouse button and sit idle until someone dies or escapes. The weapons/dragons that are harder to hit but hits harder, are now auto-aimed just like the easier to hit pee shooters. They were left un-balanced after auto aim was implemented 1-2 years ago. Very little attention was paid to balance the gameplay, as a matter of fact, that there are only about a quarter of the dragons/weapons that provide competitive performance. The rest create useless combos that cause teammates to hate you.The game is plagued with hackers and lag bugs. Hackers would speed hack to win. They are reported by various over a year and no action would be taken. As a matter of fact, we would write support/report emails and would not hear answers for months, or ever in most cases. The lag bugs cause problem in gameplay where players take damage from the position they were in 1-2 seconds ago. Thus from your own computer, you'd think you are out of fire range but would still be taking damage. Furthermore, players are harmed by all kinds of invisble fireball, dragon breath that the server decided not to display.It is not bad to try out the game to taste the concept of a lighter version of moba. But the game is far from good and the devs are less than competent to bring it up to standard.			"

												This game has a lot of potential but it has not reached it. I am relativly new to the game and it is fun but there is not much stratage in it. All you do is button mash.1. Change the controls. There needs to be a way to make the game more than a holding the Q button for 15 minuets.2. Graphics. The graphics are not bad but im allways for better graphics :).3. Better chat. The chat is had to read.4. More teamwork. There seems to be limited or no team work.I think this game could be great but it needs work.			"

												A nice F2P game, works like LoL, DOTA etc. With diffrent gamemodes.You can earn ingame premium currency easy, this takes a while but that's to be expected.You level up your ""profile"" and unlocks shops at the world map to upgrade yourself with weapons and runes etc.After doing the tutorial its just to jump in and play, even though the tutorial could use a remake since it dont cover everything.There are a lot of dragons to be gained and if you find one you like it rewards to play with it a lot since you gain mastery levels in both your dragon and your weapons that make them a little stronger.Try it out and see for yourself.

												This game is fun and interesting, though it does tend to have a bit of a steep learning curve. The previous problem of it being pay to win seems to be largely fixed, since there is nothing other than cosmetic items that can't be obtained through simple hard work and chance. Even so, even with only three dragons, I'm finding that the game is still fun and has yet to lose any of its playability. The list of different dragons and weapons is long, and each combination makes the experience unique. No dragon seems to be better than another, as each one has its own individual characteristics, and thereforesome are better for certain roles than others.I recommend the game, and think it genuinely is fun. The developers do seem to listen to the players, and have adjusted the game to not have any exclusivity. Dragons and Titans obviously is not at the level of such games as League and Dota, so it should not be compared to them. However, as far as mobas go, it's a pretty great game to play. At the very least, you should give it a try.			"

												If you haven't played any MOBA before then playing Dragons and Titans is your best bet to introduce you into it. If anything it's a very simplied MOBA and easy to understand, that and it has wyverns dragons.			"

												Ok whre to start. This Game is quite different from the usual Dotalike games. Its faster and round are shorter with usally more kills.The movement system is one of the biggest differences. There is no klick to move to location. Instead the dragon moves forward by either pressing shift or right mouse button. And it is always facing the mouse coursor. Space is used to move the dragon backwarts. There is no sideways movement.Most skills are skillshot fiering in a specific pattern from your dragon. For example dragon btreah usally fires out of the fron (duh) It less complex than other titles because it doesnt have items to buy in a match as you collect gold. Instead your skills will be determined by dragon and weapon choice for a total of 4 skills (two from each) and 2 additional spells like it it done in lol. There is a huge selection of Dragons (about 30) and weapons (about the same amount) all of which play somewhat differently. You get 3 random dragons and weapons permanently as part of the tutorial. Other than that you have the usual rotation of free dragons and weapons.The forced tutorial is one of the worst parts of the games. You have to go through serveral singleplayer mission + one match against the AI (a quite short one, just explaining the dota like mechanics) if you want to have full access to the multiplayer part. This should take about 45 minutes of gameplay and could be a letdown for some people.The game is somewhat pay to win. You can pay for dragons  and weapons(randoms or specific ones) and only radom weapons ad dragons can be bought in ingame currency. Dragons can be upgraded by using 3 Tier1  or tier 2 dragons of the same type. They get some slight bonuses for it. Like 8% less mana cost and 4% more speed. Something about that line. It is achiveable by just playing but it will take quite a long time and you have to be lucky to get the right random dragons. Buying a tier 3 dragon costs about. 45€There is a forging system which make weapons a bit stronger (something like 5% more damage, less cooldown, less mana cost) which can be payed for to get it as lot quicker.And there is a rune system. which you can buy runes for with real money. (only random) Of couse tier2 and tier3 runes are available for non paying players too but they take a long times to craft it seems. (about 3 days for one tier 3 rune and one day for a tier 2 rune). Sadly i cannot asses how strong tier 3 runes are in comparison to tier 2 and 1. Here could be the part where the real pay to win could lie.In total i would reccoment the game though. Its free and has dragons and it seems quite balanced and knowing the game is more important than bought 20% performance. You have to endure the tutorial though. Which isnt actually that bad.			"

												I like this game 'cause I don't have to spend my time in battle thinking what weapons should I buy, which items should I store, bla bla bla -well at least you only think about how you lvlup your dragon ability and weapon ability. You get into the fight with the Dragons and the weapon that you choose, and focus on the battle.Most of all, this is about dragons. Yeah I love dragons. It's very hard to get the Dragons or the Weapon that you love most without real money. And the runes... yeah, the runes for me is the symbol of pay to win. We can buy runes with crystal alright, but real money make it faster.Overall, I don't think the negative comments will stop me from recommending this game.			"

												Dragons and Titans is a fun ""action"" MOBA, it offers alot of dragons to play as and a good amount of equipment to use, and best of all its pretty simple. I feel that the game is pretty far from a competitive game though, as hard as it is to believe it feels like an ""all in good fun"" MOBA. If you are looking for something thats MOBA like but not all the way through you should at least try Dragons and Titans, its not as bad as you might think.			"

												From what I read people don't understand that this is a BROWSER PORT.ok now that's out of the way.Decent MOBA much better then VORP! which had a similar design but with no balance and control issues.this is not pay to win.  you can get 3 dragons every 5000 crystals (which is not thatm uch) and 3 weapons every 2500. and you get 3 of each just though the tutorial more then enough to get something you like.the single player needs more work some of the mission are unbalanced and im not excusing that because this is a PVP focused game. Giv it a try see if you like it			"

												I gave a thumbs up because 1. I couldn't decide between yes and no 2. To get your attention, Let me put it this way, this game is basically terrible version of Dota/LOL, but with dragons instead of heroes.Personally I really like the dragon designs, but thats about it. Like seriously.If you've played Dota or LOL then don't play this game, go back to Dota or LOL. You will definitely be disappointed with this game.If you haven't played Dota or LOL, then go and play them. Don't play this game.But you can just try this game for 10 minutes or something, I mean it's free so there's nothing to lose, I guess.  "

												This is the worst game on steam so far, of over 20 that I've played.  It has no redeeming qualities.  The worst part is, it's the first game that has locked up my $10,000+ gaming supercomputer.  The controls suck.  You have to start from level 1 over and over.  There is nothing good about this game and it doesn't have any of the RPG qualities it boasts about in the description.			"

												This is a very unique game in many ways. Not every game is going to be the next big thing, but I can see myself playing this a lot more. Of course, the tutorial is a bit clunky, as it has been pointed out, but it gets you used to the new controls. I think that the graphics are decent, but like all things could be improved. Overall, I give this game a very high score, and encourage you to try it out.			"

												This game is pretty fun! Flying around as a dragon is awesome. The story line gets a little slow and repetitive, but the PVP is awesome! Leveling up your dragon is exciting also. The only downside to this game that I'd point out is having to pay real money for things if you want better items. You can earn some stuff, but if you want, for example, a different dragon rider than you better have a good job.			"

If I could, I would put this game in the featured items tab, because that's where it deserves to be. It has a great storyline to follow, a very simple and descriptive tutorial (people just complain because they don't listen to what it says when you start), a great, simple forging (item crafting) method, and last but not least, great designs for items, dragons, titans, etc.!

												Amazingly bad. Forces you through several matches to unlock basic systems (including the rune system which starts unlocking at level two but you cannot actually access until you go through enough of the mandatory quests to unlock the rune forge itself). Balance is terrible, it amounts to whichever team can focus fire down a dragon first will snowball and win. No keybinds for assigning skill points for leveling up, wouldn't be a problem if not for the fact that your dragon is mouse controlled. If you like holding down your left mouse button continously for 20-40 minutes then this game is for you!			"

												The concept would be good, but the game has a lot of flaws. And by that, I mean, a LOT.First of all, let's begin with the tutorial. It's one of the worst training levels I've ever seen. You will also get bored of it really quickly.Then, I'd like to get into the controls: it's sometimes unclear, and some of the moves have two or more alternative functions aswell, meaning, that we may perform a specific attack without intention. Also, it's a mouse-cursor-following control, which is perfectly fine for games such as Diablo, Space Hack, Magicka or Path of Exile. For this game, I'd be more happy, if I got keyboard-controlling option.The other thing is the characters/abilities. Basically, we have 3 dragons to select (you have to buy the others by real money, but I'll tell more about it later), that has only 2-2 abilities. Then, we have a selectable item, which will provide us 2 more. For a game like this, it feels too few. I know, Awesomenauts also has 2-2 abilities for the characters, but it is still much more fun, and it doesn't feel like if it would need more. Also, as I said before, because of the controls, we may activate an ability by accident.The difficulty: (I'm going to talk about the botmatches) Well, the tutorial isn't really helpful, and the bots can♥♥♥♥♥♥you very quickly, and then win the moba gamemode. To compare with another game, Dota 2 is also hard, but it doesn't feel that bad.The gameplay: It feels empty and blank. You will get bored in really short time.The largest fatal flaw: One thing, that the game is pay to win. But it really got carried away with it. This is not just ""Pay to Win"", but ""Pay to Do Everything"" or ""Pay to Breathe"". I mean, that you have to buy characters/items for real-money, if you just want to finish a single ""quest"". And the reward just doesn't worth it. You will feel, that you just wasted your time (and money). If it's ""F2P"", then players shouldn't be limited down this much. Maybe if we would pay for some exclusive things/quests, I'd say, ""OK, let it be, I will still have fun with the rest of the game"", but this is like a cruel joke. If you handycap the F2P players that much, then make the game ""Pay to Play"" each month, and much less players will be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off. Summa summarum: Dragons and Titans is a huge disappointment. It is a pity, because it COULD have the potential to be a great game. Unfortunately, they didn't make it.			"

												So much bad reviews now only if they can get it to start. It is true that the game encourages you to buy or lose your life buy playing hours of this game. The repetitive style of the game is terrible. MOBA, ARAM and other maps are like rts in some ways which is fine. The only thing this game has you going are the dragons and the weapons. They need to lower price dragons and weapons and actually get the steam download to start on the pc. I will reccomend when they fix it. If they dont then i will not reccommend it at all			"

												wow so many negative reviews about things that are totally pointless.""hurrdurr its pay2win""""its clunky controls""""the tutorial is crap""no, and no.This is a MOBA. The tutorial takes about 20 minutes, this gets you enough ingame currency to buy 3 random dragons and 3 random weapons. Each dragon has 2 abilities, and each weapon has 2 abilities, you can use any weapon with any dragon. You also get 2 spells to use on long cooldowns.With the standard controls you hold Right click to move, and leftclick to attack with your primary ability. You can use Q W for your dragon abilities, E R for your weapon, and D F for your extra spells.If you pay, you can get things earlier than others, stronger dragons, upgrades, etc, but you can earn these through playtime anyway. The only thing that is pay2win is potions, that are only available for the single player campaign anyway.			"

												55+ Hours played is more then enough time to judge a game, anything below 15 hours I would not take seriously as a opinion or judgement on a game.That being said there is a reason this game has a very low rating on Metascore as well as other gaming sites.Regardless of what they do, or how they do it..... the Devs here do not listen to the community.Match making is by far one of the worst systems I have seen used, you are in either group a or group b.Group A - Below 1250 EloGroup B - Over 1250 EloYou start out at 1200, and yes I have seen a lot of people with 900 elo.The game is quite simple when it comes to mechanics and the way it is played, problem is most of the people that play it do not speak english or are just dumb as ♥♥♥♥. Do I recommend this game..... No in fact I told one company that advertises to stay far far away from it.The devs do not fix common bugs or problem, they want to work on what they feel like and do not care to work on anything else. I know this because I have actually talked to them.... So do yourself a favor, do not waste the time or money.			"

												Bugs:I was trying to edit my controls during tutorial 2, the screen was permantly blurred afterwards like I was drunk driving the dragon.When rebinding the controls the hotbar labels did not update, also it allowed me to bind multiple commands to one key.Control issues:I thought it might be easier to play using wasd for movement and binding your attacks on the mouse and keys surrounding wasd, however there is no 'move direction' keys, so it's really clunky. Also usign the move commands on the keyboard make your dragon lurch forward in 'steps' unlike the mouse which has smooth movement. Didn't want to continue after not being able to find a comfortable control scheme.			"

												I loved the game at first, but the more I play it the more it irritates me.  At the lower levels, you can spend a few hours here and there having a blast, learning how to play and what dragon and weapon combination you can do the most damage with.  Unfortunately, leveling up too soon slows to a near halt, and you begin to realize just how unbalanced some of the types of attacks are.  An ""update"" early in 2014 added an auto-lock aim and the ability to strafe.  Add that to certain overly powerful attacks from certain dragons and you have inescapable death.  Seriously.  That's not an exaggeration.  It's impossible to avoid the attacks.  This kills the fun and often causes me to rage quit.  However, all that aside, I always end up going back to the game and trying again, with the (possibly foolish) hope that at some point perhaps I'll figure out how to defeat this foe, or the more likely hope that I'll get to play a few matches in which those particular attacks don't appear before I face them, die, and repeat the process.Recommend w/ caveat:  If the devs fix the balance issues, I would absolutely, enthusiastically recommend this game.  As is, I recommend it only if you want to spend the money to buy the over-powerful dragons so that you can have the cheap thrill of hollow victories.  Or if you actually don't mind the occasional futile death match.			"

												A fantastic game, that genuinely has been given unfairly bad reviews.The game is genuinely a unique ride, from start to finish. I've clocked in my fair share of Draconic combat, and thus far, I've genuinely enjoyed myself. There are most certainly aspects of it that are less than enjoyable, such as certain dragons feeling unstoppable, but in truth, every dragon can be beaten, but it's a matter of how well you play your own Dragon, and work with your teammates.For a free title, the game has quite a massive selection of unique Dragons and weapons to choose from, though they are unlocked via random bundle packs that are purchased via in-game currency, called Gems. 3 dragons per hatching pack, 3 weapons per weapon pack. It certainly adds an air of eagerness to earn more Gems to try and unlock more dragons, as well as trying to get lucky to obtain a weapon you may have your eye on. The controls take a short bit of getting used to, but once you're used to them, they're surprisingly smooth, and let you maneuver your way through the skys fluently, while breathing various elements at your enemies, to deter them, as well as throwing out interesting techniques, unique to each dragon.Is this game perfect? Definitely not. Is this game fun? Most certainly. Is it worth the asking price of 0 dollars? It got me to buy a founder pack, so hell yes it is. It frankly is a game worth trying, before passing judgement, and I don't regret any of the time I've spent in it so far.			"

												Loved it for about three hours since it's babies first moba. Everyone is equally awful at this game unless they were some of the blessed few who purchased all the content and stats before the new grind everything mentality.The key issue is essentially matchmaking issues. Bronze dragon matches are fine, everyone is a bronze, once you get to gold, you immediately get shafted by fighting a full plat opposing team.Getting new dragons is a painstaking process, leveling existing dragons is an impossible process.There are several ways to improve your statistics, gain ranks through battle, purchase dragon eggs which can randomly increment your favored dragon if you get multiples(Same with weapons), and grind from bronze-plat through battle. The only thing worth doing is the first two as the third will send you skyrocketing to fight the most korean people on the server.With randomized upgrades, matchmaking, and gameplay types, it's just fun enough to download for a few hours, but not fun enough to create lasting appeal.Also the dragon balance is♥♥♥♥♥♥and the developers have no way of interpreting feedback.So no developers, no community, bad balance, and horrible amounts of grind. I'll head back to dota, thanks.			"

												Unfortunately I cannot recommend this game to new users.  It is a fun game actually, however I am not sure what exactly the developers were thinking pitting low level players/dragons against high level.  It completely ruins the fun of pvp, which is the only place this game is fun past 30 minutes.Pre 1250 rating, it is fun for new players becauase you are paired up against like levels and experience, but once you reach 1250, your pathetic lvl 15 player does not stand a chance.  I mean it is so unbalanced that it becomes moronic.I only about lvl 22 now, but there is no sign of fun anymore, as I have passed 1250, and it is now utterly ridiculous.It goes something like this:You are level 15, with a 1200 rating.  You join pvp, and are paired up against other lvl 1-20s.Then you hit 1250 rating because you are doing well and having fun.You are now paired up against all lvl 40+ with max runes and teir 3+ dragons, gold or higher.Lvl 15, vs all lvl 50s...Who's bright idea was that?  Ruined game.  Only veterans will stay, which is why there is a low population.Strong 'do not purchase' anything, until they resolve that moronic rating system.			"

The dragon types and kinds are vast and there seems to be no end in sight. Not only that but the skins for certain dragons are rare and a sight to behold. So many dragons to choose from you have to play more than once to familiarize yourself with them. I've bought the Titan Pass twice, missing one year entirely, (Life happens to everyone.) and I will continue to renew that subscription every year. Worth it for the amount of hours I've poured into this game.For anyone who loves dragons, flying, or fighting in general this is the game for you.			"

												When it comes to recommending this game, I would have to say I am more indifferent than yes or no.  I'm just saying yes because to me it can keep one's attention and, all-and-all it is not a bad game, though it has its as flaws, like any other game.I'm not going to give a brief overview of the game, you want to find more official, better detailed ones, because I would probably miss a few important things, I'm just going to tell about my experiences and general opinion of the game.So it has good art, the dragons and weapons are beautifully designed and look great.  The environment looks really good, for me I am not really picky about general looks, but this game has got it down.  The biggest flaw is that it can become tedious and often times boring relatively quickly.  In order to get more dragons, weapons and runes, you must have crystals, the in-game currency.  In singleplayer you get roughly 50-70 crystals a match and for multiplayer and pvp a little more, I can't really say I play singleplayer more then anything.  So let us say I played ten singleplayer matches and got a total of at least 500, at most 700, not bad, but dragons and weapons require a very large amount of crystals to purchase.  Runes are only 150 per pack so that is fine with me, but a 3 pack of weapons is 2500 crystals and a 3 pack of dragons is 5000.  So let us say I am very unlucky and I get 50 crystals per match, I would have to play 100 matches to get a pack, and each match takes about 10-15 minutes, which is quick, but that would take at least 1000 minutes or 16.6 hours.  That is a lot of time.  It used to be you could just buy a dragon or weapon for money, but they got rid of that and made one thing called a titan pack.  You pay 20 dollars and you get one of each tier one dragons, one of each weapons, all the avatar skins, all the dragon skins, Acts 2-4 are now playable (yes, you must pay money to play the story line), all of your rewards are quadrupled for a year, and you will get all new content(like a new dragons or weapons) for a year.  I gotta say, that is actually extremely good.  Before they did this if I wanted to buy all the dragons, weapons, and such it would be more than that, so to me that is an improvement, though now it you only wanted one dragon, you have to pay the whole 20 dollars instead of 3.99 so it can be a double-edged sword of some sort.  Gameplay is good, but it gets very boring, the storyline is okay, but it is more about the multiplayer function.Going into the multiplayer function, I have only played multiplayer matches three times, but in those three times, the teams seemed to be a little lopsided.  But since you really can't have an overpowered dragon, you can increase certain things, but you can still be defeated easily if facing multiple enemies, so it depends on the players and their teamwork, and how well they use their skills too.So in conclusion,- dragons and weapons take a large amount of time to get- multiplayer matches can be lopsided- becomes tedious and boring quickly- you must pay money to play acts 2,3 and 4- you have to buy everything if you only wanted one thing, you must pay $20 if you only wanted to spend $3.99but,- the designs are great- singleplayer is always fun, at least to me- matches are quick- you get free dragons from the acts, all three tiers of a certain dragon, though you need to have certain dragons and weapons to fulfill requirements- you spend money once and you basically get everythingAll-in-all, if you are a casual gamer, this would be a good game, you can put time and effort into it, and you only have to make one purchase and that is it.  I apologize if I left something out, these were the things that I noticed in the game.If I were to give it a rating out of 10, 10 being the best: 6/10			"

												Curretly I do kind of like this game, but it has a huge amout of problems, specifically to do with the balenceing.Now the game and each of its' maps are and always has been ruled by a select few dragon and weapon combinations that have the highest DPS and pretty much beat any other dragon/weapon in the game, as you can no doubt guess, this plays hell with the game balence, as if you meet one of these wonder combinations on a map it's suited to, then you've pretty much lost before the battle's begun. Wait you cry, what about support and other roles? I'm sorry to dissapoint you, but appart from 1 or 2 healing dragons and weapons which are hardly ever picked anyway, this game is deicded purely on who can dish out the most damage in the shortest amount of time, there's hardy any skill involved when facing an opposing dragon, just simply who is the highest level and who has the highest DPS build.Now the matchmaker, if you could call it that, is also unbalenced. Unlike in most other MOBA's, there's no pregame lobby where everyone selects their dragon and weapon, no, instead you select the dragon, weapon and spells [pretty much the only spells anyone uses are the healing spell and the base teleport] you want before you jump into the game and the matchmaker throws a bunch of random people together, which combined with the fact that there can be multiple coppies of the same dragon/weapon on either team and the imbalenced combinations I mentioned above means that the game is pretty much decided before it even starts, which is very bad game design.Now as I said above multiple maps with one map being in rotation at a time, the map to be put into rotation is selected by the comunity via an in-game poll. So, four very different maps, sounds extensive for a MOBA right?  However practically no one votees for the standard MOBA map called Towers And Titans and Nether gates hardly ever shows up in the map poll. So there are pretty much only two modes, Balistae ally which is pretty much a single corridor where three high damage balistae bolts are shot from each side every couple of minutes. The other most played mode is Chaos unleashed, wherein you collect gold to summon Chaos who helps you detroy some structures. Having only one map in rotation and knowing which map is in rotation creates some serious balence issues, people can simply pick one of the afformentioned wonder combinations that is suited to that specific map.And know we get on to the Pay to Win aspect of the game. Now the game isn't pay to win as such, practically everything can be unlocked by playing for free, unfortunatly the vast majority of the very best stuff is placed at such a high amount of RNG and luck that it is just not practical to get them as a free to play player, so to get them, a little bit of money is called for.

												I'm quite enjoying the game, it kind of has a League of Legends/Heroes of the Storm feel to it. However, there are a couple of issues with it:~Occasionally when you click to purchase dragons/weapons, it does nothing at all and players have to restart the game to get it to work.~Occasionally you'll get stuck on the dragons screen when you try to examine a dragon.~There NEEDS to be a volume control! Not just toggling the sound/music on/off. The sounds are really loud.~If you want different avatars/skins, you HAVE to purchase the entire DLC pack. It would be nice to also have multiple mini-DLC's for purchase as well, like just for skins, or just avatars, etc.Hopefully these issues will be resolved sometime in the near future. Other than that, this really is a great fun game.			"

												Awesome dragon fights, and 30 or so cool dragons got me to download this game.Pros:~Has several game modes. I always like a game that lets you have a free play mode, multiplayer mode, or a Story line.~Cool dragons, each with it's own legend.~Tips for each dragon, which make it easier to fight if you take the time to read them.~Cool weapons to go with the dragons, also with they're own legends.~Challenging gameplay across all modes, but it's still not hard to complete~In game purchases. Most of which are not nessesary, but they give you a boost.Cons:~The map for forging weapons is a little to extensive and it costs an unreasonable amount of materials to upgrade anything. It also takes forever to find the resources in game, so you may have to buy them.~It takes forever just to get enough gems to get any new weapons or dragons ~You absolutly HAVE to buy new avatars with real money, not gems. And one thing I found particularly funny is one of the weapons:Unity Mark: The Engine of MagicThe pros definently out weigh the cons, and this game makes a great MMORPG or just an RPG if you don't want to play PvP or Co-op.EDIT: I just found out its called a MOBA. *Has major DUH! moment*			"

Personally i love multiplayer mainly because it beats playin with the computer. 10/10 graphics and dragon types, the selections are almost endless and the fact that you can wield different weapons while riding a dragon is beyond me!

												While I don't regularly play this game as much as I did before, I still enjoy Dragons and Titans. Its gameplay is simplistic, and pretty much everything is well-designed, both in mechanics and art/figures. If you are feeling bored and trigger-happy, then this game might be good for you.However, the gameplay doesn't involve much strategy. When you pick a game mode you just do a specific attack/defense pattern, and hope for the best. Secondly, the matchmaking system can be a nightmare very often. It just picks five random players for a team, so you frequently see copies of dragons on the same team. Or another case is when the opposing team has several powerful dragons, then your team is screwed. Thirdly, too many of the features require actual cash to be unlocked, like Acts and specific dragons or weapons.Overall, this is a nice game, but it's not worth investing a lot of money in it. Dragons and Titans is only a casual game, albeit a beautiful one.			"

												It might not be the best game out there in this particular genre but that doesn't mean this is pure♥♥♥♥♥♥either. I believe this is a good game for people new to MOBA gaming. It could act as a gateway for casuals to turn into hard core players. I, for one, enjoy this game a lot. I haven't played much multiplayer (I'm hoping to get to that) but in single player, the rounds are pretty short (Chaos Unleashed takes about 20 minutes I believe or somewhat off). Others may find that a negative aspect of the game but for people like me who play this at school, I don't have an hour or more of uninterrupted school time to play just one match. I wouldn't have wanted to play an hour much either if I had the time. The only major issue is that I feel like the game is pushing you to buy a Titan's Pass. You can only do Act 1 (a dissapointment since I wanted to finish the rest to get all the cool dragons they offered). After each match, you gain a painstakenly small amount of Runes which is fustrating because Dragon eggs are 5,000 and weapons are 2,500. About the eggs and weapons, you can only buy cases of three and have to rely on pure chance and luck to get that weapon/dragon you're looking for after countless hours spent just saving enough to get them in the first place. That problem just pushes you EVEN FURTHER to get a Titan's Pass. If only they made it a little bit more easier to earn stuff then I'd be content. The next issue I'd like to address about this game is the Options menu. It's not very advanced. (It's an improvement from the Kong website.) You can't adjust the loudness of the sounds and music. Either you keep it or disable it all together.			"

I feel they give too much with the Titan Pass they've just added though. Making it give you all dragons and all wheapons takes away the POINT of playing, which is to EARN dragons and wheapons. Plus skins were a way to show 'Hey, I REALLY like this dragon guys' and to show that through getting a skin JUST for that dragon. Kinda sad they did that, but I do approve of taking away the cool down on forging and rune combining.			"

												First of all i tryed it for about 10 mins the dragon should be able to move up and down but as far as i know it does not,i got a code when i bought my radeon card it does not work.And like most mmos all they want you to do is buy this or buy that all the cool stuff you buy and is not earned. But i guess it seems cool to play but i would rather buy a game and play it rather than pay along the way,to get cool stuff that is. Remember nothing is truly free even when they say free there is all ways a catch 22....			"

												As a fan of Dota 2, I was surprised to find how enjoyable I found the more casual Dragons and Titans. The games are pretty short, and the different dragons&weapons seem nice and different, and the game even has a pretty good option for buying every single dragon and weapon in the Titan Pass. I'll probably buy it later, although I'm still considering it. What I've looked of the global chat the community is terrible as always in MOBAs, but the ugliness hasn't reared its ugly head in the matches themselves yet, thankfully.The game isn't very deep, but it's fun. Perhaps at later points the nastier sides of the game, such as the grindy nature of upgrades, start to show, but haven't seen any major problems rising from it yet - I've managed to crush people 30+ ranks above me in the matches despite their probably better rune-pages. (Dragonkin is crazy good dragon, if you get it as one of the three free dragons you randomly get at the start, it's Call of the Kine ability is ridiculously good. It helps a lot when you can summon additional DPS and bodies to fights early on, and they are still good later on, two summons meaning that you pretty much win most 1v1 fights since they are more like 3v1 fights)			"

												You don't have to take it from me as it is free to find out how much you do or do not like it.  Stuffed full of bugs.   No way to understand the mechanics and thus almost no way to improve as a player.  Plenty of bugs.  The tooltips on abilities do not reflect reality nor does the incomplete wiki.   Did I mention bugs.  Balance is awful.  One dragon type completely dominates each map (there are 4) thus you play against a team of 4-5 of those until you are forced to level one yourself.  Then...nerf...  The player base has dropped off significantly.  500-800 when I started to 200-400 today.			"

												I give this game a 7/10.As far as MOBAs go, Dragons and Titans is a boiled-down MOBA that is GREAT for beginners. I have a friend who never plays them, and she actually gave DaT a try and loves it. There are no items to deal with in the game, and experience is granted by killing enemies and collecting gold. Potions that drop on the map restore your health, and there are numerous spells you can use in-game (similar to other MOBAs). There are various ways to play and the map cycles every half hour. There's even a single-player campaign to unlock new dragons, and you can upgrade dragons and weapons over time. Dragons are also really well-designed and are really cool. I have a total of five, right now due to weekly rewards and the single-player campaign, not to mention the three you get for free for playing through the tutorial stages. The downside? It is a boiled-down MOBA. Experienced MOBA players might find the game a bit dull, overall (especially if you're coming from DOTA). I played LoL for a while, and I currently play SMITE, but Dragons and Titans is stilll a fun game to play with friends. It just doesn't take nearly as much skill, in comparison. Another downside is that much of the content is locked behind what they are calling the Titan Pass, a $20 pass that gives you access to a bunch of extra stuff (like the other three single-player campaigns). Granted, if you're THAT into the game that you're willing to pay that's great. But I feel it is a bit much for someone who only plays casually. Lastly, queue times for PVP games can be rather long due to a small population of players. I had a PVP queue last at least 5 minutes a few days ago, for example (I've never waited more than a minute and a half in SMITE). Overall, Dragons and Titans is a great MOBA for beginners, and shouldn't be counted out just because it started out browser-based, or because of the boiled-down features. Give it a shot - the darned thing is free. If you don't like it, uninstall. If you do, though, keep playing and I hope to see you in the sky someday.			"

												wow so many negative reviews about things that are totally pointless.""hurrdurr its pay2win""""its clunky controls""""the tutorial is crap""no, and no.This is a MOBA. The tutorial takes about 20 minutes, this gets you enough ingame currency to buy 3 random dragons and 3 random weapons. Each dragon has 2 abilities, and each weapon has 2 abilities, you can use any weapon with any dragon. You also get 2 spells to use on long cooldowns.With the standard controls you hold Right click to move, and leftclick to attack with your primary ability. You can use Q W for your dragon abilities, E R for your weapon, and D F for your extra spells.If you pay, you can get things earlier than others, stronger dragons, upgrades, etc, but you can earn these through playtime anyway. The only thing that is pay2win is potions, that are only available for the single player campaign anyway.			"

												55+ Hours played is more then enough time to judge a game, anything below 15 hours I would not take seriously as a opinion or judgement on a game.That being said there is a reason this game has a very low rating on Metascore as well as other gaming sites.Regardless of what they do, or how they do it..... the Devs here do not listen to the community.Match making is by far one of the worst systems I have seen used, you are in either group a or group b.Group A - Below 1250 EloGroup B - Over 1250 EloYou start out at 1200, and yes I have seen a lot of people with 900 elo.The game is quite simple when it comes to mechanics and the way it is played, problem is most of the people that play it do not speak english or are just dumb as ♥♥♥♥. Do I recommend this game..... No in fact I told one company that advertises to stay far far away from it.The devs do not fix common bugs or problem, they want to work on what they feel like and do not care to work on anything else. I know this because I have actually talked to them.... So do yourself a favor, do not waste the time or money.			"

												Bugs:I was trying to edit my controls during tutorial 2, the screen was permantly blurred afterwards like I was drunk driving the dragon.When rebinding the controls the hotbar labels did not update, also it allowed me to bind multiple commands to one key.Control issues:I thought it might be easier to play using wasd for movement and binding your attacks on the mouse and keys surrounding wasd, however there is no 'move direction' keys, so it's really clunky. Also usign the move commands on the keyboard make your dragon lurch forward in 'steps' unlike the mouse which has smooth movement.

The repetitive style of the game is terrible. MOBA, ARAM and other maps are like rts in some ways which is fine. The only thing this game has you going are the dragons and the weapons.

Most of which are not nessesary, but they give you a boost.Cons:~The map for forging weapons is a little to extensive and it costs an unreasonable amount of materials to upgrade anything. It also takes forever to find the resources in game, so you may have to buy them.~It takes forever just to get enough gems to get any new weapons or dragons ~You absolutly HAVE to buy new avatars with real money, not gems. And one thing I found particularly funny is one of the weapons:Unity Mark: The Engine of MagicThe pros definently out weigh the cons, and this game makes a great MMORPG or just an RPG if you don't want to play PvP or Co-op.EDIT: I just found out its called a MOBA. *Has major DUH! moment*			"

												I loved the game at first, but the more I play it the more it irritates me.  At the lower levels, you can spend a few hours here and there having a blast, learning how to play and what dragon and weapon combination you can do the most damage with.  Unfortunately, leveling up too soon slows to a near halt, and you begin to realize just how unbalanced some of the types of attacks are.  An ""update"" early in 2014 added an auto-lock aim and the ability to strafe.  Add that to certain overly powerful attacks from certain dragons and you have inescapable death.  Seriously.  That's not an exaggeration.  It's impossible to avoid the attacks.  This kills the fun and often causes me to rage quit.  However, all that aside, I always end up going back to the game and trying again, with the (possibly foolish) hope that at some point perhaps I'll figure out how to defeat this foe, or the more likely hope that I'll get to play a few matches in which those particular attacks don't appear before I face them, die, and repeat the process.Recommend w/ caveat:  If the devs fix the balance issues, I would absolutely, enthusiastically recommend this game.  As is, I recommend it only if you want to spend the money to buy the over-powerful dragons so that you can have the cheap thrill of hollow victories.  Or if you actually don't mind the occasional futile death match.			"

I really love playing he game, seeing how far I come and all the dragons to discover!

												This is a fun game that is fun to play with friends and family. Though I HAVE to admit it DOES get boring after awhile, but the moment you get close to finishing forging your weapon, or close to buying 3 more dragon eggs, or even close to ranking up one of your weapons is when it gets fun. The misc. missions are fun along with the Runes Master feature and the Daily Prizes feature that help entice you to come back and play again. Though, it would be nice if they added a new map, but the game is fun in all ways, for me Single Player and Co-Op are not as challenging as the PvP, but in PvP expect to find a few players whom don't seem to be damaged by your attacks, I think they're hackers, but it could just be their dragon.

												Dragons and Titans is a moba style game that feels like a very simple version of League of legends. Though this game is by no means boring to play. The is a great satisfaction from gaining new dragons and weapons while also trying to increase mastery of each dragon and weapon. This game offers single player, co-op, and PvP for all player to play as they wish but the best fun is PvP obviously. I hrecommend this game if you are looking for a time killer but want to still have fun.Above is my original review for this game. Now since they updated the game it sucks big time. Everything cn be purchased with real money so all those hours i spent plaing to forge my weapons 100% is now meaningless. buying dragons and getting random ones doesnt matter since any one can now have a high chance of winning. The effort put into getting stronger weapons and dragons is lost since this is now literally pay to win. it was better when you were actually better because you worked hard for it. I dont recommend this game to anyone anymore, unless they change it back to be a hard grind for power.			"

												The Idea was great, but as other already said, sadly the execution is poor. The mouse control is really ackward, having to hold right click to move while directing the dragon, becomes worse when you attack and aim in the same way. I manage to get lost on the first level, this right there is a big fail. No minimap, nothing to help you around. Plus the dragon is so slow, it makes the travelling boring.			"

In fact dont even bother PVP unless you have tier 3, full runes, ect... thiers just to much elder advantage. This game will likely fail.Additionally Support is pretty much non-existant. Tickets will go ignored for weeks. They just dont seem to care, as long as they get thier microtransactions...Edit- Been waiting on a ticket for over a month now, no email, no resolution.

												Quite a few people mention things such as high level players picking you off in pvp at the early stages, however that's just not true. You can literally pick up the game, start playing and be competitive from the first match till your last - here is why.You start with 3 random dragons which may or may not be high level dragons (each dragon has 4 levels, and with each level you get stat increases such as higher speed or lower mana consumption).Like with most MOBA's, you start each match with just the basic attack unlocked, and as you harvest minions / gold you earn EXP, and when you lvl up you gain an experience point which you use to lvl up current abilities or unlock new ones. You have 4 abilities in total, and two spells which you may change before each match. As you lvl up, you unlock more spells - so yes, higher level players do have access to more spells, but that just makes sense - if it wasn't that way, what would be the incentive to lvl up in the first place?Now - when you join a pvp match EVERYONE starts with the basic abilities of their chosen dragons. Yes, those that have played with a specific dragon for a long while will have mastered his dragon (bronze, silver, gold and I think platinum), and they will receive health and speed bonusses for each lvl), however this rarely causes you to be outmatched in a way that is unforgivable.I just started a new game, and from the first match I played till now I have ALWAYS been competitive. In most matches I can easily obtain a highest score with dragons I haven't even mastered yet - and that's while playing against those that have. So it's just utter garbage that you're cannon fodder for experienced players.Sure, if you're in an inexperienced group you might get wasted every now and again by a better team, but that's just logical, and not due to an unfair advantage.I agree that we need more maps. More maps would make the game feel less repetitive. And perhaps even a few additional game modes (dungeons / raids perhaps?). Oh, and there are not enough support type dragons in my opinion that specializes in buffing / debuffing other dragons. I mean, they have 2 healing dragons, and then one that heals and steals mana, but not in such a way to be a healer - more of a support healer. So perhaps a few more dragons that offer support for their team members rather than just focussing on attack.We also need more players - I think new blood is always good for a game.So in short - I'm enjoying the game and find most pvp matches challenging (other than Ballista Alley which is usually over in just a few minutes).Give the game a try.1. It's free2. Good selection of Dragons (other than support dragons)3. Nice dragon designs and decent graphics4. Fun to play5. Did I say it's free?			"

												This game is not pay to win.Through the tutorial you get enough of the ingame money to get 3 dragons and 3 weapons, matches dont last that long, and counting on how well you did counts on how much money you get. If you play the game enough you can beat anyone who would say this is pay to win. The only thing you really have to put money towards is a different avatar and thats all in all quiet minor. I play League and Smite, this game should not be compared to either of those games because it might feel similar but the gameplay mechanics are completely different. If you want to try something a bit different give this game a try its well made and from what ive seen the game gets updated quiet often.			"

												Not quite sure why ppl are giving bad reviews... When I first starting playing I found it annoying that I was always playing against Tier 3  players w/ Platinum weapons/dragons.. so that's why I recommend the Elite Starter Pack, that way you get 7 dragon/weapon packs. Then you have more options when playing the campaign aswell.  On a side note, I finished Act 4 and didn't get a Autodrake...so hopefully when i go thru the harder difficulties i'll get the tier 2 & 3 dragons.Found it kinda interesting that they have you take 3 tier 1 dragons to make a tier 2 dragon, and again 3 tier 2 dragons to get a tier 3. So it takes 9 dragons of the same type to get one tier 3. I seem to be able to buy a 3-pack of dragon eggs almost every week as long as you use the Epic war marks on your First win of the day match to get the most bang for your buck. The trick to farming Crystals is paying attn. to the current Quest and switching between PvP and Single-player modes to grind the quest out... (This was easier before the new random map queue system) Hate when the Collossus gets stuck on the MOBA map.Once a few more bugs are fixed and some more DLC comes out I think this game will be great! I'm just sayin that cuz i <3 dragons and need a break from LoL every once in a while.. "

												Interesting to play with a friend but hackers are starting to rule in PvP. Game requires a lot of grinding if you want to have a top dragon and weapon without expending cash. Community is quite inmature and will yell at you and rage quit if you don't know them. Also, the account of Facebook can't be passed over to the Steam one (can't be linked to keep the progress and bucks of the Facebook account). Servers are quite frail and random DCs occur now and then.I think the game would be better if one could arrange a party of 5 people instead of just 1 friend at the same time. So much wasted potential but still fun to burn the dead hours.			"

												I have played this game for a few hours messed with some PvP and some bot games but honestly the matchmaking system is pretty bad it always pairs me up with 25+ and im only rank 6. This game also has VERY SPANISH HEAVY CHAT. So if you don't know spanish you are kinda SoL on this one. It's NOT paid to win but unless you have the titan pass you will be grinding for days for a new set of dragons eggs. yea a random set of 3. It's main flaw is that it is incredibly grindy for the crystals (in game currency) You get about 50-60 a game without the titan pass sometimes but very rarely more and if you have the titans pass it 4x your winnings.

												Dragons and Titans is a moba style game that feels like a very simple version of League of legends. Though this game is by no means boring to play. The is a great satisfaction from gaining new dragons and weapons while also trying to increase mastery of each dragon and weapon. This game offers single player, co-op, and PvP for all player to play as they wish but the best fun is PvP obviously. I hrecommend this game if you are looking for a time killer but want to still have fun.Above is my original review for this game. Now since they updated the game it sucks big time. Everything cn be purchased with real money so all those hours i spent plaing to forge my weapons 100% is now meaningless. buying dragons and getting random ones doesnt matter since any one can now have a high chance of winning. The effort put into getting stronger weapons and dragons is lost since this is now literally pay to win. it was better when you were actually better because you worked hard for it. I dont recommend this game to anyone anymore, unless they change it back to be a hard grind for power.			"

												This game is pretty fun! Flying around as a dragon is awesome. The story line gets a little slow and repetitive, but the PVP is awesome! Leveling up your dragon is exciting also. The only downside to this game that I'd point out is having to pay real money for things if you want better items. You can earn some stuff, but if you want, for example, a different dragon rider than you better have a good job.			"

It has a great storyline to follow, a very simple and descriptive tutorial (people just complain because they don't listen to what it says when you start), a great, simple forging (item crafting) method, and last but not least, great designs for items, dragons, titans, etc.!

												(The following review contains strong language. Hussa for steam censor.)Yeah this may be an unorthadox review, but i decided to go for it. Here´s the review of the ACTUAL game:(07/10) - GoodThe game is fun. There is a ton of content and while you can´t really purchase items ingame, you still have them, granting thousands of possible dragon-weapon combinations. The leveling is also fun, tho it may take a crap load of time... like so much in this game.If you are sick of other people, check out the singleplayer campain, it´s really good as well.That was the review. The problem is, i can´t let that stand. There is just soooooo much wrong with this game, it´s just unbelievable and completly ruins this i-could-have-been-super-fun-to-play game. For each of the following points, i will subtact one from the score, thats how utterly horrible they make the game. And don´t get me wrong, there is tons of♥♥♥♥♥♥wrong, but these are just the biggest porblems:- Unbalanced. What the serious ♥♥♥♥? There is no ♥♥♥♥ing match, which is fair. The developer somehow has no clue on what they are doing and need soo much time to patch let´s say an op dragon, that i´m seriously asking myself what the ♥♥♥♥ they are doing all day long. When i got that dragon as an enemy in a game, i already knew i will loose it. THATS how you destroy fun in matchmaking. And then the patch finally comes (after a ♥♥♥♥ing month!!!) and overpoweres another dragon/item... wtf?Minus one point for unreliable, overpowered crap...- Cheaters. They exist, sure, but does anyone do anything against them? Nope! Cmon man. There is a top ranked player where every ♥♥♥♥ing body knows he´s a cheater, and noone gives a ♥♥♥♥. When you got a cheater in a game, well, fat chance, it´s ruined. And when that happens in a game where no OP♥♥♥♥♥♥was present, ohhh the rage. Yeah... minus one point, for completly ignoring important stuff.- Hitboxes. Ok, here we go: Hoooolyyyy ♥♥♥♥balls!!!!!! If i could, i would ♥♥♥♥ing give 2 minuspoints. THAT ♥♥♥♥ING BAD. Jesus. There is litterly more where the hitbox is wrong, than stuff where it´s right. Heck, even the ♥♥♥♥ing menu buttons are a bit off. And you cant even play some dragons, as their hitbox does not in any way correspond to their attacks. Seriously, i threw one dragon away after 3 matches as i couldn´t hit♥♥♥♥♥♥while hitting hit. Unbelievably horrible! Minus one point, for not being two...- Randomness. There is a ♥♥♥♥ing reason why you can´t program something truly random. Because it has nothing to do in a ♥♥♥♥ing videogame! In none! Unless you got a roulette simulator, get that♥♥♥♥♥♥off your game! I said it for hearthstone, i say it here too, get that in your head defs. ""5% to fear each attack"" what the ♥♥♥♥? so with luck you completly♥♥♥♥♥♥someone? Yaaay, that must be suuper fun... Let´s spin the wheel: Oh, you hit the 1% box: Minus one point, i´m sorry...- All that other stuff. Yeah, ima just sum them up as a minus one. I mean come on, the game does ♥♥♥♥ing NOTHING for 25 seconds when you click on ""exit game"". 25 ♥♥♥♥ing seconds!! Then there are unlocks which you will never get in your lifetime. One ♥♥♥♥ing lv 3 rune takes 5 days to craft. ONE ♥♥♥♥ING RUNE. Are you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me? And yeah, overall design, response, controls (!!!) and presentation is just bad. Minus one point, for aaaall those little things that just make the experienece worse and inevitable dragging the whole thing down.So here is the actual review for this game:(2/10) - Just BadThe game is good while being horrible. Wait till it get´s patched (a lot, considering the dev actually get´s a tip on what to do) and then play it. Saw me rage there? Thats what the game will do to you if you play it in this state...			"

												Kind of a good game actually. I played it first on browser, then I downloaded it on steam.Pros :+ Wide choice of dragons, they keep updating the dragons+ Amazing dragon design with some additional skins for several dragons+ Each dragon is very different from the others+ Each dragon can be paired with one weapon, which adds two skills to the dragon's skillset+ Great variation of weapons+ Good use of roles, with combinations of dragons and weapons you can make almost any role+ Each weapons and dragons can be upgraded, which is really cool+ Each weapons and dragons can get higher mastery, increasing in-game status+ Good variation of game modes, I'm hoping them to add more though.+ Campaign mode will let you unlock dragons+ Rune system that lets you modify in-game status by applying runes+ You are allowed to use a few selected dragons and weapons you may not own, these selections will be randomized each weekCons :- You get to recieve 3 starting dragons and 3 starting weapon, to unlock more dragons it's pretty expensive. New players may not be encouraged by this- You may buy dragon eggs, but those aren't worth it, they're just too expensive for 3 random dragons- If you want one non-random dragon egg, it's still not worth your money.- Level 15 cap in game is just too shallow- Subscription system! Blergh!- Oh and there is one Cthulhu overpowered dragon and it aint fun- Missions reward you so little- Missions are repetitive and not interesting- Ofcourse you can unlock a dragon from campaign mode, but it takes you 15 levels for one dragon. And mostly it will be a crappy one- Bots are sometimes just too soft- The control is total crap- Auto aims may seem nice from the outside, but it really isn't. It's really annoying- This game is just too greedy- No item system in a MOBA. That's not simple, that just shallow- Your dragon rider looks like an old perverted dude. And you're stuck with it for a long timeI'm not actually pro for this game, but it's still kinda potent. This game may make iti big, but the greedy developers may not agree. I'm 51-49 Pro-Con for this game.			"

												Initially i thought this game was pretty cool. Giant titans and dragons everywhere. But once you play it, the game is not so satisfying. The PvP matchmaking makes no sense, since you can be matched with players far beyond or below your level, that is just unfair to me, since in this game the longer you play, the stronger you get (as most games thought). The target system is what made my blood boil the most: i can't find out how to switch target at will, being stuck with the ""stop attacking to change target"" strategy. I also did not like so much the gamemode choice : if you want to play PvP in an unpopular map, you'll have to wait eons for the whole community to pick it, since you can't even choose it at your will.If you want to play a specific map that is not currently being used by the community, you have to play single player, which means just you and AI.

												This would be a fun game if it weren't for the abysmal controls. The camera is locked to your dragon, and rather than having either forward/backward/strafe + mouse aimed abilities or having your dragon move in the direction pressed turning automatically, you have this strange conflicting setup. You can right click to move your dragon, but you also need to use the mouse to aim. Dragons apparently have no necks and can only fire abilities straight forward. There is no strafe key, you can only use the keyboard to move forward, backward or turn, which makes piloting difficult since you have to fight the auto aim/orientation when near an enemy. The only way to strafe is by holding down right click, but that renders you unable to aim at specific enemies.			"

												This game play's well for it's specific genre. It's a decent piece on it's own, however, the community that is normally playing is less than 200 players according to the game itself. If that isn't the case, then that's just how big individual servers are. When playing single player, the game does freeze up. I'm using a high quality computer, and have the game on low settings, and still have issues with freezing. Multiplayer is definitely fun though, but communication is definitely in need of a few updates. Related to: You can see what everyone on the server is saying, IN GAME. and you can type to everyone on the server IN GAME. It's much more confusing this way, instead of having comms for in a game, and comms for outside a game. The hud would be nice to see some updates, but it's still well rounded. Lastly, paying for campaign is a rather big turn off. I get that the game needs to have an income, but, the first act was annoying as it was, paying for something thats going to be equally annoying, isn't on my bucket list. Maybe make it an unlock from doing certain things like achievements, ect. Make people want to play it more, before paying more. That concludes my review of the game, I do recommend this game with a 3.5/5 stars			"

Its gameplay is simplistic, and pretty much everything is well-designed, both in mechanics and art/figures. If you are feeling bored and trigger-happy, then this game might be good for you.However, the gameplay doesn't involve much strategy. When you pick a game mode you just do a specific attack/defense pattern, and hope for the best. Secondly, the matchmaking system can be a nightmare very often. It just picks five random players for a team, so you frequently see copies of dragons on the same team. Or another case is when the opposing team has several powerful dragons, then your team is screwed. Thirdly, too many of the features require actual cash to be unlocked, like Acts and specific dragons or weapons.Overall, this is a nice game, but it's not worth investing a lot of money in it. Dragons and Titans is only a casual game, albeit a beautiful one.			"

												I loved the game at first, but the more I play it the more it irritates me.  At the lower levels, you can spend a few hours here and there having a blast, learning how to play and what dragon and weapon combination you can do the most damage with.  Unfortunately, leveling up too soon slows to a near halt, and you begin to realize just how unbalanced some of the types of attacks are.  An ""update"" early in 2014 added an auto-lock aim and the ability to strafe.  Add that to certain overly powerful attacks from certain dragons and you have inescapable death.  Seriously.  That's not an exaggeration.  It's impossible to avoid the attacks.  This kills the fun and often causes me to rage quit.  However, all that aside, I always end up going back to the game and trying again, with the (possibly foolish) hope that at some point perhaps I'll figure out how to defeat this foe, or the more likely hope that I'll get to play a few matches in which those particular attacks don't appear before I face them, die, and repeat the process.Recommend w/ caveat:  If the devs fix the balance issues, I would absolutely, enthusiastically recommend this game.  As is, I recommend it only if you want to spend the money to buy the over-powerful dragons so that you can have the cheap thrill of hollow victories.  Or if you actually don't mind the occasional futile death match.			"

												Its such a good game. Easy controls, so many game types. And the one game where everyone gets together and works together to win. Such lovely community on this game and the art is beautiful. The game it self if beautiful and so creative. The dragons look fantastic and the game offers a challange. As well as that the game requires stratagy which is a great quality to have in a game. I like the fact the dragon can be a supporter, attacker etc..Just a great game to play.			"

												Curretly I do kind of like this game, but it has a huge amout of problems, specifically to do with the balenceing.Now the game and each of its' maps are and always has been ruled by a select few dragon and weapon combinations that have the highest DPS and pretty much beat any other dragon/weapon in the game, as you can no doubt guess, this plays hell with the game balence, as if you meet one of these wonder combinations on a map it's suited to, then you've pretty much lost before the battle's begun. Wait you cry, what about support and other roles? I'm sorry to dissapoint you, but appart from 1 or 2 healing dragons and weapons which are hardly ever picked anyway, this game is deicded purely on who can dish out the most damage in the shortest amount of time, there's hardy any skill involved when facing an opposing dragon, just simply who is the highest level and who has the highest DPS build.Now the matchmaker, if you could call it that, is also unbalenced. Unlike in most other MOBA's, there's no pregame lobby where everyone selects their dragon and weapon, no, instead you select the dragon, weapon and spells [pretty much the only spells anyone uses are the healing spell and the base teleport] you want before you jump into the game and the matchmaker throws a bunch of random people together, which combined with the fact that there can be multiple coppies of the same dragon/weapon on either team and the imbalenced combinations I mentioned above means that the game is pretty much decided before it even starts, which is very bad game design.Now as I said above multiple maps with one map being in rotation at a time, the map to be put into rotation is selected by the comunity via an in-game poll. So, four very different maps, sounds extensive for a MOBA right?  However practically no one votees for the standard MOBA map called Towers And Titans and Nether gates hardly ever shows up in the map poll. So there are pretty much only two modes, Balistae ally which is pretty much a single corridor where three high damage balistae bolts are shot from each side every couple of minutes. The other most played mode is Chaos unleashed, wherein you collect gold to summon Chaos who helps you detroy some structures. Having only one map in rotation and knowing which map is in rotation creates some serious balence issues, people can simply pick one of the afformentioned wonder combinations that is suited to that specific map.And know we get on to the Pay to Win aspect of the game. Now the game isn't pay to win as such, practically everything can be unlocked by playing for free, unfortunatly the vast majority of the very best stuff is placed at such a high amount of RNG and luck that it is just not practical to get them as a free to play player, so to get them, a little bit of money is called for.

												I've played this game many times over the course of a few years. And I spend more than imagined time playing this game. It's addicting, amazing, and beautiful. The dragon types and kinds are vast and there seems to be no end in sight. Not only that but the skins for certain dragons are rare and a sight to behold. So many dragons to choose from you have to play more than once to familiarize yourself with them. I've bought the Titan Pass twice, missing one year entirely, (Life happens to everyone.) and I will continue to renew that subscription every year. Worth it for the amount of hours I've poured into this game.For anyone who loves dragons, flying, or fighting in general this is the game for you.			"

												I love this game. Its a game that you play when you dont know what to play. Its easy to get into, there are tons of different dragons and weapons to aquire and use,the graphics are not that terrible, and the best part is that its free. My biggest complait (and i think this stands for most people in this games player pool) is that its super easy to get into, but the battle can get a bit... iffy. For example the auto lock ahould be a toggle, so for new people to the game they have a bit of a crutch, and for seasoned players there is some challenge. But overall, great game. (but just a side note, the player pool for the game is a bit low, so dont expect for matches to start super quick) :P			"

												When it comes to recommending this game, I would have to say I am more indifferent than yes or no.  I'm just saying yes because to me it can keep one's attention and, all-and-all it is not a bad game, though it has its as flaws, like any other game.I'm not going to give a brief overview of the game, you want to find more official, better detailed ones, because I would probably miss a few important things, I'm just going to tell about my experiences and general opinion of the game.So it has good art, the dragons and weapons are beautifully designed and look great.  The environment looks really good, for me I am not really picky about general looks, but this game has got it down.  The biggest flaw is that it can become tedious and often times boring relatively quickly.  In order to get more dragons, weapons and runes, you must have crystals, the in-game currency.  In singleplayer you get roughly 50-70 crystals a match and for multiplayer and pvp a little more, I can't really say I play singleplayer more then anything.  So let us say I played ten singleplayer matches and got a total of at least 500, at most 700, not bad, but dragons and weapons require a very large amount of crystals to purchase.  Runes are only 150 per pack so that is fine with me, but a 3 pack of weapons is 2500 crystals and a 3 pack of dragons is 5000.  So let us say I am very unlucky and I get 50 crystals per match, I would have to play 100 matches to get a pack, and each match takes about 10-15 minutes, which is quick, but that would take at least 1000 minutes or 16.6 hours.  That is a lot of time.  It used to be you could just buy a dragon or weapon for money, but they got rid of that and made one thing called a titan pack.  You pay 20 dollars and you get one of each tier one dragons, one of each weapons, all the avatar skins, all the dragon skins, Acts 2-4 are now playable (yes, you must pay money to play the story line), all of your rewards are quadrupled for a year, and you will get all new content(like a new dragons or weapons) for a year.  I gotta say, that is actually extremely good.  Before they did this if I wanted to buy all the dragons, weapons, and such it would be more than that, so to me that is an improvement, though now it you only wanted one dragon, you have to pay the whole 20 dollars instead of 3.99 so it can be a double-edged sword of some sort.  Gameplay is good, but it gets very boring, the storyline is okay, but it is more about the multiplayer function.Going into the multiplayer function, I have only played multiplayer matches three times, but in those three times, the teams seemed to be a little lopsided.  But since you really can't have an overpowered dragon, you can increase certain things, but you can still be defeated easily if facing multiple enemies, so it depends on the players and their teamwork, and how well they use their skills too.So in conclusion,- dragons and weapons take a large amount of time to get- multiplayer matches can be lopsided- becomes tedious and boring quickly- you must pay money to play acts 2,3 and 4- you have to buy everything if you only wanted one thing, you must pay $20 if you only wanted to spend $3.99but,- the designs are great- singleplayer is always fun, at least to me- matches are quick- you get free dragons from the acts, all three tiers of a certain dragon, though you need to have certain dragons and weapons to fulfill requirements- you spend money once and you basically get everythingAll-in-all, if you are a casual gamer, this would be a good game, you can put time and effort into it, and you only have to make one purchase and that is it.  I apologize if I left something out, these were the things that I noticed in the game.If I were to give it a rating out of 10, 10 being the best: 6/10			"

												Unfortunately I cannot recommend this game to new users.  It is a fun game actually, however I am not sure what exactly the developers were thinking pitting low level players/dragons against high level.  It completely ruins the fun of pvp, which is the only place this game is fun past 30 minutes.Pre 1250 rating, it is fun for new players becauase you are paired up against like levels and experience, but once you reach 1250, your pathetic lvl 15 player does not stand a chance.  I mean it is so unbalanced that it becomes moronic.I only about lvl 22 now, but there is no sign of fun anymore, as I have passed 1250, and it is now utterly ridiculous.It goes something like this:You are level 15, with a 1200 rating.  You join pvp, and are paired up against other lvl 1-20s.Then you hit 1250 rating because you are doing well and having fun.You are now paired up against all lvl 40+ with max runes and teir 3+ dragons, gold or higher.Lvl 15, vs all lvl 50s...Who's bright idea was that?  Ruined game.  Only veterans will stay, which is why there is a low population.Strong 'do not purchase' anything, until they resolve that moronic rating system.			"

												Dragons and Titans used to be an awesome game. After several buffs and nerfs, the game wasn't any longer fun to play. Things that I used to like about D&T that changed: The possibilty to invite up to 5 friends to form a team. Having to use all different dragons in a match. The old controls system without auto-aim. Anything before the Titan Pass.D&T couldn't afford itself after the yearly Titan Pass, for it didn't create any beneficial profit.What D&T should of change is: Starting with the Titan Pass (Same price for a month is more than enough). Remove all Runes (stones collected within the matches), since this allows players to easily use hacks and sometimes stay low profile, and as well helps to keep the abilities of the dragons balanced. Remove the use of repeated dragons in a match. Weekly updates, including at least 1 weapon or 1 dragon. At least 3 Moderators per chat (since not all are always able to be online). Weekly developer or admin visits so players notice the interest of the D&T team towards them.And last but not least, team XP in matches, instead of individual (This will give players a more pleasent and friendly match, since it will encourage all to assist for a common cause).Some new ideas:Replacing the collection of stones for Gold pieces to buy some upgrade for their weapons/dragons with a prior limit set, within the match. The upgrades could either have just a few levels but several type that does not mess the balance in match, such as ''Returning to hoard ability cooldown'', ''Short protective shield for teammates'', ''Dashing a small distance'', and stuff like that.Anyways, there are many things that can be changed to make the game not just as good as it used to be, but greater. Lets not forget the improvements keep players interested, but every change must to be properly debated between D&T team, in order to avoid colliding every feature or element in the game.At the end, there is far too much that can be improved in Dragons and Titans, but the income must to be well thought, that way the D&T team will always feel excited to work with such awesome game. The concept that this game handled is very insteresting and satifying, specially to those who love dragons. But if anyone wants the players to return to this game, a lot has to be done and responsabilities to be assumed. Thanks D&T for so many fun moments and to allow me to meet some of the coolest and easy going people to play with.			"

												I don't have many hours on the game yet, but for my first impression I must say that this game is highly addictive and fun! The game still requires a bit of developing though. User interface isn't too pleasant. Perhaps that might change in the future. The fast paced matches make it a great game for when a player does not have much time on their hands. Menu's need a bit of appearance touch up too. Earning crystals in order to get new weapons or dragons is a bit of a drag and disappoints. Perhaps making it easier to earn crystals would attract even more players. All in all I'd give this game a solid 7/10. Easy to play, fun, however it lacks a bit of a player skill aspect.			"

												I like the game a lot, it has a fair to wide variety of dragons/weapons you may choose from. Each dragon/weapons has its own unique attacks, however, I will complain that I don't feel certain dragons/weapons are balanced out in a fair way. The game has 4 different maps, and a voting system for which map you would like next after a 25-30 minutes time period. Some maps seems to be a bit laggy, and the servers are down (for multiplayer) sometimes, which can be frustrating, but it's a pleasure to play versus your friends, rivals, and even enemies. Runes also make this game interesting, allowing your dragon to gain small buffs that overall make a huge impact the more you level up in battle. This adds a nice complexity to the game, allowing you to easily twist and turn past a few of your dragon's/weapon's weaknesses, or to allow you to try and make it slightly less of a weakness. The rating system is a nice feature, making so you don't play against newer players, adding challenge, but also making it so that they don't get creamed and can learn a few steps at a time of how the game works. While the game is no longer in developement, I think it'd be nice if it was. One last thing, it would be nice to have a way to gain more crystals (the currency in the game) other than buying the titan pass, which gives you 4x crystals, but only for 1 year. I think making it so you can gain crystals in a faster manner (with either the titan pass's 4x crystals no longer working or if you can't/haven't gotten the titan pass). I've heard complaints about not getting very many crystals after a match, making it so you must grind (which is very annoying) Singleplayer or Multiplayer. With the game no longer in developement and the fact it has ""died"" a quite a bit, people think the $25 for the titan pass is no longer worth it.I do really enjoy this game though, and I myself don't want to give up on it. Hope the devs decide to go back to it and give it a little more love  <3~DragonFire			"

												For those that can't take the complexity and seriousness of games like Dota 2, Smite, or LOL, this is a game for you. It's very simple and is easy to learn. The overal gameplay is fantastic, with good graphics, plenty of dragons and weapons, and amazing maps and modes. However, the only setback is the community. Waiting for a match takes a while, some people are jerks, and when you just start out, finding players at your rank are hard.			"

												Dragons and Titans used to be an awesome game. After several buffs and nerfs, the game wasn't any longer fun to play. Things that I used to like about D&T that changed: The possibilty to invite up to 5 friends to form a team. Having to use all different dragons in a match. The old controls system without auto-aim. Anything before the Titan Pass.D&T couldn't afford itself after the yearly Titan Pass, for it didn't create any beneficial profit.What D&T should of change is: Starting with the Titan Pass (Same price for a month is more than enough). Remove all Runes (stones collected within the matches), since this allows players to easily use hacks and sometimes stay low profile, and as well helps to keep the abilities of the dragons balanced. Remove the use of repeated dragons in a match. Weekly updates, including at least 1 weapon or 1 dragon. At least 3 Moderators per chat (since not all are always able to be online). Weekly developer or admin visits so players notice the interest of the D&T team towards them.And last but not least, team XP in matches, instead of individual (This will give players a more pleasent and friendly match, since it will encourage all to assist for a common cause).Some new ideas:Replacing the collection of stones for Gold pieces to buy some upgrade for their weapons/dragons with a prior limit set, within the match. The upgrades could either have just a few levels but several type that does not mess the balance in match, such as ''Returning to hoard ability cooldown'', ''Short protective shield for teammates'', ''Dashing a small distance'', and stuff like that.Anyways, there are many things that can be changed to make the game not just as good as it used to be, but greater. Lets not forget the improvements keep players interested, but every change must to be properly debated between D&T team, in order to avoid colliding every feature or element in the game.At the end, there is far too much that can be improved in Dragons and Titans, but the income must to be well thought, that way the D&T team will always feel excited to work with such awesome game. The concept that this game handled is very insteresting and satifying, specially to those who love dragons. But if anyone wants the players to return to this game, a lot has to be done and responsabilities to be assumed. Thanks D&T for so many fun moments and to allow me to meet some of the coolest and easy going people to play with.			"

												I like the game a lot, it has a fair to wide variety of dragons/weapons you may choose from. Each dragon/weapons has its own unique attacks, however, I will complain that I don't feel certain dragons/weapons are balanced out in a fair way.

												A good game that becomes boring after few weeks. Don't look my hours I played a lot more and even before on facebook. Fun, but not enough. I last played it last time in the begging of 2015.			"
