												This is a surprisingly nice adventure game, blending 3 genres into one game nicely. Puzzles are plentiful and varied, everything is logical and falls good into darkish atmosphere. A bit on an easy side, though.			"

												A very good example of the casual adventure game.Wonderful and detailed artwork, albeit with fuzzy cutscenes and mediocre voice acting.Great selection of puzzles including 'find the object' (you can bypass this with a minigame of mahjong if you want) that consistently keep you engaged.A great game to drink and decompress with that makes you feel clever without straining your brain.

Artifex Mundi delivers usual quality, but only thatAnyone who has already played an Hidden Object Game by Artifex Mundi, knows that this developer delivers beautifully designed games, which form the best the genre currently has to offer. The first game in the Nightmares from the Deep series does not disappoint and proves to be another fine release from Artifex Mundi. However, the game does show its ""age"" a little bit: it was actually already released early in 2012, and this shows – it's not as meticuously polished as Artifex Mundi's more recent releases.Don't take me wrong: I enjoyed playing this game, but I didn't felt ""drawn in"" as much as by other games from Artifex Mundi. This was mainly due to the voice-acting of the different characters, which proved something of a disappointment. This is a pity, since the story itself is more than interesting and offers  a nice twist on the well-known ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" theme, although the ending could hardly be more cliché.Somehow the different elements of the game – point-and-click, hidden object scenes, puzzles and cutscenes – didn't add up for me to something really engrossing. Most of the separate elements are perfectly fine, with the hidden object scenes standing out as beautifully drawn as ever. The puzzles range from very easy to moderately difficult, and add some variety to the gameplay. I was especially pleased to find the option to choose for a game of Mohjang instead of the different hidden object scenes., with the Mohjang games gradually increasing in ""difficulty"". The music in this kind of games often strikes me as bland, but that's just a matter of personal taste I guess.As is well-known among collectors of achievements, games by Artifex Mundi offer excellent possibilities to achieve perfect games without too much difficulty. As usual, two playthroughs are needed for this, but both need to be on the same profile in order to let all the achievements unlock. Something to keep in mind, as I made the mistake of starting the second one on a new profile, and playing through it for a third time would be stretching it way too far ;-).Overall conclusion: recommended, mainly to fans of the Hidden Object Genre "

												...and here we have another Artifex Mundi caliber HOG. I've been meaning to play this game for ages now. Finally being able to find the time, I'm rushing here to give you my full review. Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart is one of Artifex Mundi's earlier games, thus it is quite possible to encounter amateur mistakes or some clumsy animations now and then. Yet, the charm attached to the developer’s name doesn't fail to entertain us anyway.Here we have Sarah Black, the curator of the Caribbean Museum and the mother of one cheery teenage girl, preparing the exhibition of a life time. The mummified corpse of Henry Remington, most notorious pirate of the Caribbean Sea back in 1800s is finally discovered and retrieved from his resting place: ""Davy Jones' Locker"" a.k.a the bottom of the sea. The corpse is delivered to the museum for the exhibition, and Sarah prepares him to be displayed. Just as we were thinking that he seems kinda handsome for a corpse that's been lying at the bottom of the sea for some centuries, he comes back to life, kidnaps our daughter, summons his ghost ship and sets sail to Skull Island... Oh, where did I see that before?Okay, okay, I'll say it. I have no idea about the rest of the series yet, but this first game is basically a retelling of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest without Captain Jack Sparrow to lighten up the mood. But as the first instalment of the Nightmares from the Deep series - and possibly the most clumsily done - The Cursed Heart still finds means to keep you interested, with a detailed story of its own, weaved out of countless nautical folktales. Hey, I'm glad that we have a name for the protagonist at least, contrary to ""Madame Detective"" of Left in the Dark.Artwork is most brilliant with its eerie depictions, nautical themes and an expected amount of undead roaming around. At this point, no one expects Artifex Mundi to present bad artwork, even with its older titles. What I do wonder though, is that how they've managed to make cinematics in lower quality than actual game artwork. Cinematics are blurry and less presentable compared to actual in-game artworks. Same goes for the voice acting: voice acting itself is beyond par, but the lip synch is non-existent: people do move their mouths rhythmically, that's all. I think this is forgivable considering that this is an older title though.Here comes the gameplay: we have quite enjoyable and clear HOG scenes, some FROG scenes, a good amount of enjoyable puzzles and alternative Mahjong games if you are bored of object hunting. It takes at least 2 playthroughs to complete all achievements - one for HOGs, one for Mahjong games. The map is not interactive, but you get used to the environment quickly, and there is little backtracking aside going back to the ship to place a Dubloon on a chest and listen to an undead dwarf tell a story now and then. What's that about? You gotta play the game to learn!Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart is probably not Artifex Mundi's best game, but it is a promising title and the start of a possibly enjoyable journey on a series. If you'd manage to grab it on sale, you'd enjoy it thoroughly when you'd be in the mood for a pleasant little HOG.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												I used to play these ""hidden objects"" games a lot back then, so I was expecting Nightmares from the Deep:The Cursed Heart to be to my liking, and I was very curious about it since the day I found it on Greenlight. Well, it didn't disappoint :)The hidden objects scenes didn't give a headache and the mini-games were just right - neither boring nor needlessly complicated. The story of the ""main"" chapter is interesting, the cutscenes are enjoyable to watch and the ending was kind of captivating.Also, undead pirates are badass! <3			"

												Hidden object and adventure.Highs:I was impressed by the animation that went into portions of the game.  It went beyond the usual throw-in story of most hidden object adventures. The plot was decent and you were reminded pretty constantly of what was going on by contextual clues.  The location of the next hidden-object puzzle is usually hidden in the most-current location (a picture, etc) otherwise you can just spam the hint button and it will get  you to the right area.High resolution puzzles made it easy to pick out the items that were required and lots of hidden object puzzles were present in the game (with only a couple of exceptions)Lows:The doubling back to the ""guardian"" to unlock the chest that takes like 20 doubloons to open was kind of annoying.  It isn't required throughout the game, but that's not made apparent while you're playing.A couple of the puzzles had sections that were a bit hazy and fuzzy on large monitors.All in all, this was a good game.  I enjoyed the story.  Not so much the fact that you were a talking character (and female at that) which disconnected me from the main character a bit.  But, still it's a game and it was a good one even if some of the sequences were pretty obvious.			"

												  Short game, trite story, beautiful art, nice theme song.  This is the first hidden object adventure game I have ever played, but I am a veteran of the old 90's style point and click adventures.  For the most part you wander around, seemingly at random, until you find a ""swirly"" spot to click on.  This will start a hidden object scene search, upon completion you will be awarded an item, although some items are found without hidden object searches as well (general environment finds).  Some of these items are used in puzzles, some of them are keys, and the rest are your traditional use on environment items that adventure fans are familiar with.  None of the puzzles are challenging, and all are logical.  The only exception to this rule is the ""Urns"" puzzle - the final one in the game.  Thankfully you can hit a button and skip any puzzle if you want, but this version of the game also has a strategy guide which you can access from the menu (probably not during a game though, but I never tested this).  This version of the game does come with some digital ""extras"", most notably 8 beautiful (up to 1080p) wallpapers which are taken from the memorable scenes in the game.  In fact you can see three of these in the screenshots on the Steam Store page.  Naturally you get to play back any video you have already seen, and there is also some concept art (but not much, six images to be precise).  Oh, there's also a mahjong game if you want to play that instead of finding hidden objects, but I never tried that feature.  For the price I feel like the game is too short, versus something like Monkey Island II - another zombie themed pirate adventure, and probably the best adventure game of all time.  However, it's worth playing if you like pirates and the sounds of thunder and lightning and want to have the beautiful wallpaper art on your desktop (I do).			"

												Ok, I have become shamelessly addicted to these hidden object games. Having played three, I now consider myself an expert on them. Definitely. Anyway, this is a good one. Just don't judge it on the quality of its story and voice acting, both of which are subpar at best. It seems to be a genre convention actually, so I can go with the flow. No, these games depend more on the quality of their artwork, the level of interactivity in scenes, the quality of the puzzles (if any), and how well things sparkle and zing when you click on them. No really, when you find that hairbrush hidden carefully in the background of a scene, you want some fireworks when you click on it. It's satisfying, I admit it. I get the impression, reading around, that this developer is considered a good one when it comes to HOGs. I wouldn't know, but on the strength of this it's well-deserved. The game's quite long; it took me a little over 6 hours to complete the game (including the two bonus chapters as this is the CE) which is about twice as long as some HOG games. Like most of these games, the difficulty level was towards the easier end of the spectrum, but frankly that works just fine inbetween bouts of Spelunky and Jets 'n' Guns. It's relaxing, and strangely compelling. Interestingly, each hidden object scene also offers a mahjong game. You can either do one or the other, and the more of the HOG you complete, the easier the mahjong game becomes (and vice versa). It's a good way of trying a different approach if you're stuck trying to find a particular object. That didn't happen very often with me, but I appreciated the option. There's no time limit on completing each scene, but if you do them quickly you can gather a few Steam achievements. The achievements were a little bugged though, not all of them registered, if that kind of thing is important to you. Puzzles? Yes, plenty of those, most of them very easy, but they're a nice change of pace. The game surrounding the hidden object scenes plays out like a point and click adventure, with an inventory and objects that must be found and used in the appropriate places, so there's plenty of variety to keep you going. There's even a map!So overall then, the best HOG-like I've ever played (out of the three I've played over the last month). GOTY in the HOG category so far, in fact! But seriously, if you like this kind of thing you can't really go wrong. The artwork is excellent, the music and presentation are great, the storyline and acting are like fingernails on a blackboard, you'll love it.			"

												This Hidden Object game is one of the best on steam, this is the collectors edition of this game even though it listed as the standard version.  There are storytelling sections including vivid 3d visuals combined with some of the best voice acting for pirates in a pirate game even better than Assassins Creed Black Flag.  This story has it all from Mystery, to Action, to even Romance!  It does all these things, and does them all really well.  Difficulty for players would be a bit above normal.    No worries if stuck, there i a fully illustrated strategy guide, a puzzle skip option, and a hint button for puzzles so anyone will be able to finish the game.  The map is structured well with clues leading to more clues not just random running around to check every part of the game.  The ability to play the game and have it progress as you move makes it one of the few Hidden Object games that can be used for speed runs.Completionist Advice:The game has many achievement bugs, best way to avoid these seems to play the first game through on expert doing all of the hidden Object Puzzles using no hints and skipping no puzzles.  Collect all the coins, do not put them in one by one, and when you have 12 coins put them all in.  Second playthrough on normal do Mahjong instead of HIdden Object puzzles to clean up the rest.  The hardest is to beat a puzzle in under one minute best done on second playthrough on the first couple puzzles, just click like crazy!*Would be 10/10 Perfection but achievement bugs knock off a point.Rating:  9/10  Value:  9.99			"

												If you like hidden object games this one at least has a plot. Artwork is very pretty, Map feature makes this an easy one to work around. Typical bizarre plot about the ghost of a pirate that kidnaps a young girl to substitute for his long lost and ghostly lost love. The player is the girls mother and you have to rescue her. There is an extension to the game to get home. Inexpensive good first or second game for someone who's yet to experience true classics like the Syberia series, or perhaps some older DOS games like GABRIEL KNIGHT! That's that stuff I like.3.5/5, not the best in its genre, but great for kids. UI takes a bit of getting used to.			"

												The Cursed Heart is one of ArtifexMundi's first Hidden Object Games and it shows. Compared to their later games animation is nearly fully absent, voice acting is rough, and the puzzles are relatively simple.However, that does not take away the fact this is a very good HOG entry. The story is a compelling myth which encourages you to continue playing, the AM staples of randomized hidden object puzzles are already present, and it never feels unnecessarily difficult.And for those who have no patience to solve hidden object puzzles, you can play a simple mahjong game instead.Definitely worth picking up, if only for the bonus adventure in this version that nicely ties the story to the sequel's.

												Do you like puzzles? Pirates? Mahjong? Short but interesting story lines? Good graphics? Point and click games? If yes to all or most of those questions then this game may be for you. It offers a variety of puzzles throughout the gameplay but tends to focus mostly on hidden object puzzles which can be turned into Mahjong if you prefer. Decent story line that remains interesting yet simple to follow and is enhanced by good graphics and decent voice acting. Story line - You are a curator at a museum and you're setting up a big exhibition with the help of your daughter. After a few 'unfortunate events' at the museum your daughter is whisked away to Skull Island and being held prisoner by an undead pirate captain. Can you complete the puzzles and save your daughter? And what would the captain want your daughter for anyway?I experienced no glitches or errors of any kind and if I got stuck on a puzzle there is a help button to speed things along. My total gameplay was around 6 hours which included completion of the main story and also of the dlc. Great if you're inbetween games at the moment and want something to pass the time with or if you have just one day off school/work and want to complete something.			"

												Largely paralleling Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart is a hidden object game (HOG) that compensates its lack of substance and numerous narrative issues with excellent production values and a continuation of Artifex Mundi's proven casual adventure game formula.The consistent poor delivery of a story so full of tone and logical issues is by far the worst aspect of the experience. Though I wouldn't say I expect much from games of the genre, The Cursed Heart was an unexpected low for a developer that I know to be better than what they showcased here. It's shallow, abysmally voiced, and weighs down an otherwise mostly enjoyable game. It's hovers right between ignorable and so-bad-it's-good, but winds up more obnoxiously persistent than anything else.A slightly awkward world to navigate combined with the often unclear objectives were also a bit annoying, in the sense that I had to continually check my map for where to go as opposed to a more natural form of progression. Despite these issues I would still consider The Cursed Heart worth checking out if you've exhausted the rest of the developer's catalog. Its high production values and addicting game design (the reason for which I'm still trying to figure out) are as exceptional as ever, it's mainly the developer's pedigree which brings the experience down, having demonstrated a better knack than most for the genre and in doing so set a higher standard which they as are also going to be judged against.

There is a Guide button which shows what to do and where to find items.Hidden object items can be mouse hovered to show the item's silhouette. This is nicely reduces the hint usage.Have good tutorial.Nice backstory.Full voice over, though some of the actors are not good and one of the pirate's line has no voice.Bonus adventure.Achievements and trading cards.Cons :Cutscenes are low quality and very blurry.The Puzzles are too easy. Less challenging.To complete 100% achievements, you have to play the game twice. You have to play all hidden object scene in classical way, restart the game and play all hidden object scene with mahjong. Both with the same user profile. It doesn't matter you do mahjong first or classical first. Too much effort, I prefer single gameplay.IMO, the story development is kinda dull. The story is predictable.Overral : 7/10.			"

												First game in a present three game series.Story: Museum Director Sarah Black is putting together an exhibition surrounding pirates and one pirate captain in particular, Captain Henry Remington.  Unwittingly Sarah triggers 'ancient' magic and revives the cursed Captain.  Captain Remington upon his revival steals Sarah's daughter, Cory.  Of course, Sarah follows and stows away on Captain Remington's summoned ""ghost"" ship as it sets sail for Captain Remington's island.  As Captain Remington's story unfolds the player discovers his personal history, his cursed 'life' and why he stole Sarah's daughter.  Sarah with the help of a surprising ally convinces Captain Remington that what he wants to do will only cause more tradegy.Gameplay is basically set up to occur in three distinct arenas, the museum, Remington's ship, and Remington's island.  The tragic tale of Captain Remington is revealed through the various characters (mostly his undead crew, who were cursed when he was, assuming the player talks to them).  Rather reminscent of the 'Pirates of Caribbean' first movie and the tale of 'The Flying Dutchman'.   Captain Remington's entire tale is told by the Guardian of Remington's chest, which contains the collateral of Remington's Davy Jone's bargain, whenever coins are found and given to the Guardian.  Very keeping with the Davy Jones motif and legends.     The puzzles are classic, nothing hard or head scratching.  The game even includes a 'treasure hunt'.  (When I saw the 'treasure' map, it reminded me of 'Treasure Island'.)  There are enough hidden object scenes to keep this a Hidden Object game.  The puzzles and hidden objects scenes are intergrated well enough into the storyline that they do not stand out, which in my opinion is a very good thing.  However, since the gameplay arenas are limited to three areas there is a lot of back and forth movement within the area until everything is completed.  Some may find this annoying but the amount of things needed to be done and accomplished within the area keeps the gameplay moving.        Being the first Artifex Mundi game I have ever played I found I enjoyed the well written storyline as well as the overall gameplay.  This game would and did bring me back to buy more, not only of this series, but other games by them, as well.			"

												A very well done hidden object point and click adventure game! The story wasn't that interesting but it was a decent backdrop to the fun puzzles. It was also a bit odd how they told basically the whole story in the first quarter of the game but then every time you collected a dubloon you'd get pieces of the story. I kept waiting for the dubloon cut scenes to tell me something I didn't already know but they didn't. Not saying it was a bad way to tell it, just kind of unnecessary? Oh well. The puzzles were fun. I liked how interactive they were. A lot of the times you didn't just assemble the items and click them on to the screen but you actually had to follow instructions and pick up a tool to manipulate different things, etc. I really thought that made the game so much better than other ones I've played. I didn't get stuck or get frustrated with any of the puzzles. They were mostly pretty easy (in fact, the only time I used the hint the whole game was when I kept over looking a small item lying on the ground which I needed to pick up to progress >.<).The hidden object puzzles were pretty good. Sometimes they were a bit weird on how they labeled things (like one where there's something that looks like a ribbon rolled up but they called it a ""spring""). They also have items that need extra actions to find or complete which makes the HOPs more fun. These actions usually made sense to do so I never encountered any frustration with them like I have with other games. Voice acting was okay. Nothing great but nothing horrendous either. Cut scenes were cool but low resolution. Overall, I enjoyed it very much. The bonus adventure available through the ""Extras"" on the main menu is worth playing after too.			"

												Do you enjoy hidden object games? If so, this small Pirate Ghost themed Puzzle game hits all the right spots.First play through, just casually going about the adventure took roughly 3 hours to hammer out, which for this type of game is just right. Not too long, and nothing too short so that your cup of tea is still warm.The story isn't anything amazing, but it is interesting enough that it sits alongside your puzzles nicely, giving just the extra little touch of interest, to keep you wanting to do 'just one more puzzle' before you have a break.Visually the game is nice, some of the cinematics are a little fuzzy, but the general look and feel of the game, is pretty pleasing to the eyes.Overall, for a hidden item puzzle game, I would score Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart 7/10.

												Got this in a bundle and played it for the cards, but I must say, if you are into hidden item/Myst-style games, this is a very good game to get. For the price, I think you will get a reasonable amount of play time in.The artwork is appealing and the Pirate Zombie theme is great if you like that. Puzzles are not too challenging, and there is definitely a lot of backtracking throughout the map. The skip functionality doubles as a hint tracker that recharges, ensuring that you wont be stuck for too long.There is also a find-the-items minigame (among all the other minigames) and you can play mahjong as an alternative and I thought that was really nice.The story is meh, nothing too special, but for the price I would personally wait for it to go down before purchasing (but I am also very frugal lol)			"

												It was my first experience with Artifex Mundi's games and I was so hooked that I'm buying any game from them once on Steam.Nightmares from the Deep puts you in the shoes of Sarah Black, a museum curator in the Caraïbean Islands, and interested in the pirates stories. After receiving the corpse of the famous Henry Remington, don't ask how but you awakened him. Taking your daughter as hostage, you sneak into his ghost ship and find yourself in a race against the clock to save your child.The story is beautiful as you're also diving into the pirate's past and love story. Besides, Remington is cursed because of a pact with Davy Jones, only you can undo it. And Davy Jones is important for the trilogy anyway. The gameplay mixes point-&-click, puzzles and hidden objects scenes. It's well balanced: all the puzzles aren't too hard but are not too easy (though one or two of them could be seen as harder to understand). I didn't find anything wrong or buggy.The graphics are correct but beautiful too as between the boat and the island, you have also that surnatural aura surronding you. As for the soundtrack, nothing bad can be said.Also, you have a bonus chapter, showing how you rescued another poor soul on your way home. A well-constructed plot, a nice ambiance, a balance for the difficulty, you have everything in this hidden object game. Never hesitate for this one!			"

The puzzles and hidden objects scenes are fairly shared. The game features an inventory where you can store items to combine with the environment to go deeper in the story. The game have two difficulties and have a guest feature : all the family can play the game and resume it where they left. There is also a map which is useful to not get lost despite you can't fast travel with it but can show some hints if you play in the easy mode. Also you can use the Hint/Skip hourglass whenever you want and wait until its refill to use it again. But be warned that you may not skip or use a hint in any puzzle or hidden objects scene if you wish to have some achievements.There is some choice of puzzles and there are two kind of Hidden objects scenes. The first Hidden objects scene features the name of the objects to find some are found easily (normal one) and some others need you to interact with the environment or to combine two items to found them. The second Hidden objects scene let you find the shape of the items to find.(#):From the beginning to the end I've a very bad issue: all the cut scenes were full of pixels and I've seen one or more discussion on steam despite I didn't read them all. I tried to switch to the lowest resolution, I think its changed something even if the cut scenes are still bad.(*) :The game has some achievements that can be missed, mostly challenging achievements, including finishing the game on hard mode or using no hints in the puzzles or hidden objects scenes. There is currently a good guide for that (Chapter 0 - Achievement / Arquivamentos):

A Guide for Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart
By: Bennyton

			ENG If you liked this guide / gameplay share and mark ""liked"" it to improve the ratings and make it easier to find the guide in the steam community for future players! ♥♥♥ Welcome to another step by step guide.		


The challenging achievements require you to finish a puzzle or an hidden objects scene or a domino game under a minute. And two achievements require you to find 3 objects in 3 seconds or find all objects with a few misclicks in the hidden object scenes.(@):As I said in the key features, you need two playthrough to finish the game. One to finish the game with all the puzzles and hidden objects scenes perfected and another one playing the mahjong game instead of the hidden objects scenes. The good thing is you can skip all the cut scenes and puzzles in your second playthrough if you succeeded your first one. The mahjong game consists in taking all of the mahjong tiles, to do so you need to make couples. BUT there is one main trap to not fall in... you need to play a new game in the same user ! If you don't you'll not have the last achievement that require you to have all of the previous achievement in one user session !			"

												The Cursed Heart is a great hidden object game with beautiful graphics and a storyline that will actually keep your interest.  It is a story of a pirate ghost who wishes to resurrect the love of his life.  Unfortunately, this ghost pirate wishes to use your daughter as a means to resurrect his mistress.  The hidden object games are well done, the puzzles are simple, yet require at least a little bit of thinking.  Great game from a well known source that makes great hidden object games.			"

												It's such a rare thing for a hidden object game to get everything right. Invariably the story is lacking or the graphics are muddled or it's just plain boring even for the genre. That's why titles like this should be treasured, because there's a rare level of artistry put into creating them. Nightmares from the Deep goes significantly beyond the standards of hidden object games to create a journey perfect for new and experienced players alike.I absolutely adore the opening to this game, and no one can take that away from me. You're the curator of a Caribbean history museum that just got the body of an infamous pirate, fresh from the ocean floor. Dark magic brings him back to life, and instead of keelhauling you or looting your museum, he kidnaps your daughter and drives his ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed ghost ship straight through the building. From that totally metal setup you're tasked with exploring the ship and their secret pirate isle to uncover the story of your undead antagonist and a way to stop him.You'll run across plenty of roadblocks in your travels, whether they be locked doors or deep water or broken equipment. These roadblocks are more sensible than the foot-high fallen trees and dusty cobwebs that hold you back in other such games, and this attention to detail deserves to be noted. Your challenges are, for the most part, logical and approachable and tie in well with the story, which itself is a cut above most dreadful plots you might find yourself dragged along for. There's characterization and pathos to uncover and an ending you might not be expecting at first.This is all meaningless if the puzzles are garbage, but here again Nightmares from the Deep shines. The hidden object scenes are crisp and detailed, with your objectives clearly displayed for your clicking pleasure. There are multi-part items to find like ones inside of other objects, and side scenes with components to assemble to make new items. Each scene earns you an inventory item needed to progress or solve one of the game's many other puzzles. These are almost always creative and engaging, keeping away from safe, banal options like chess puzzles and Tower of Hanoi so often seen in other games.I can also call this one of the few hidden object games for people that hate hidden object games, because as it turns out the object scenes are even optional. During any scene you have the option to toggle a Mahjongg mode where, instead of sniffing out items, you match tiles to earn the items needed. You can even flip back and forth between modes if there's a particular item you can't find OR a pair of tiles you can't match. This is an incredibly novel addition that contributes so much to the enjoyment, as you'll never be stuck for long on a single scene. As if that wasn't enough, the game offers robust hints and skip functions to keep frustration as far away as possible.There are minor complaints I can make, such as a surprising amount of backtracking being necessary or the terribly low-res cutscenes being almost unintelligible. But honestly, the shocking level of care and quality that Nightmares from the Deep is crafted from leads me to wave these objections away. This is very much one of the best hidden object games I have ever played, from the mechanics to the story to the graphics to the sound. It's an automatic recommendation from me, even to those who profess a dislike for the genre.			"

												Picked up my first hidden object game on sale. didn't expect much from the game, but it was a nice and forgiving introduction to the genre. The game is short and the story isn't much of one if anything, but the puzzles can be fun for the 30 seconds they last and getting around is quick and easyAs most other reviews say, the sound quality is bad and i found it annoying that the lips didn't sync with the voice audio. On another note, trying to play this at 1080p in fullscreen caused the image to noticeably resize itself each scene. Not sure whether that was my own fault or not, but there are only a handful of options in the game and resolution done automatically through the game. I ended up just playing in window mode to avoid this especially since i knew the game was short. The only other thing i can think to say is that my mouse had lag issues during the game which required me to adjust my DPI on the mouse software itself as there is no mouse sensitivty setting in game.I cant judge the game too harshly because i haven't played any other of the genre. i would say that if it weren't pirate themed i wouldn't have an interest in it. If you are interested wait for a sale. I wouldn't purchase this game or any of the sequels at full price.			"

Short version: 81%Nightmares From the Deep: The Cursed Heart is a nicely drawn, although somewhat easy hidden object puzzle game with an engaging pirate-themed ghost story. Long version:As most hidden object puzzle games, Nightmares From the Deep: The Cursed Heart features truly astounding hand-drawn graphics, although they are maybe a bit too fairytale-ish for a game that takes places on a ghost ship and a haunted island.The story dares to venture away from the usual ‘bad unknown evil cursed the magical land’ formula; our main lead, a museum curator, involuntarily gets wrapped up in a bittersweet pirate ghost tale of two lovers torn apart by fate. The narration and the voice acting are clunky, and the daughter character has the annoying damsel in distress syndrome, but the plot and some of the dialogues really make up for these shortcomings.The puzzles, including the hidden object scenes, are somewhat on the easy side, but they offer a nice variety to keep the game constantly interesting and fun to play. And frankly, nobody should expect more from a one-afternoon long, nice and relaxing game like this one.			"

												The version you buy, is not the same version you are shown on the store page.  All the cutscenes which originally are of excellent quality, have been compressed heavily to where they look like blurry smudges.  This is a known issue of this version, but it has not been addressed, and will likely never be fixed.It's a great game, but the version being sold on steam is crippled. "

												This game is one of those casual hidden object games, which one can find plenty of around. The game nods continuously towards ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and similar ""Cursed pirate stories"", which could be a plus or a minus depending on your personal preferences. It does boast rather nice background art and multiple ""exotic"" objects to manipulate from ""all around the world"". There is also a variety of ages where objects come from - modern, XVII-XVIII century and end of XIX century (if you care to go for a ""bonus"" adventure available under ""Extras""). Some of the foreground objects look a bit cheap, though, and cutscene video quality is really way too low. While being very accessible overall (as a casual game should be) ""Nightmares"" does not explain everything (like ""Skip by playing Mahjong"" option or how to start hidden object minigames) very well in the beginning. However, there are no giant mechanical flaws in it, and the ones existing do not detract too much from the experience. Although the voice acting and overall sound assets are so-so, they do help to complete the ""pirate mystery"" atmoshpere. The storyline is super-simple and although it tries to add a couple of twists, overall there is nothing grasping about it. There is a little humor to be had and there are even a couple of jokes that might make you smile, but overall the game tends to overplay ""serious mystery"" part a little bit too much for my taste. A couple of cheap jumpscares are also available.  Having completed all of the available adventures I can say that the game does provide some casual fun for those, who appreciate the appropriate setting and do not mind to solve some simple puzzles (with ample hints available). Overall it is a good title to buy in a bundle and casually enjoy when you don't want to strain yourself or spend much time with a game. Perhaps, it could also be worth a try for HOG fans when on >75% discounts.			"

												Ok, so this is the first game for me on Steam. That being said, this isn't my first computor game. I am a huge fan of Hidden Object games, and this one is actually pretty solid. As far as I can tell you have your main storyline, which isn't anything that's going to blow you away, but it fills it's purpose. It's not a straight up ""find these objects, then move to the next room"" type of game, there is a lot to do here, and the great thing about it is you have a very useful hint button for when you get stuck...trust me you will. I just started last night and I've had to use it quite a few times. I'll finish the full review when I complete the game but you can't beat the price, so I'd give it a shot. If you love Mahjong and Hidden Object games, along with a decent story, this is your game.Ok, So I'm not gonna lie, I got bored with this game pretty fast. But in all fairness, Borderlands 2 went on sale 3 days after I bought it...so that's a technicality.It's a good game if you like ""these"" types of games.Here's my statistical review, the numbers are based on a scale of 1-100 (70 is average)Similar to Metacritic I geussPros-Graphics are very well put together, might be the best part of the game.-A variety of differing puzzles and tasks to keep you entertained for a little while, its fun at first, for me at least.-Very simple, my 2 year old could probably figure this out with some practice.-The story is decent, predictable, but fits with whats going on around you while your doing various tasks.Cons-They make it way to easy to cheat, you can literally press the hint button throughout the entire game, you don't have to solve anything.-The voice acting is cringe inducing and just...god awful. I didn't expect much from this kind of game but come on.-The puzzles vary, but they get repetitive to a point where playing the puzzles just becomes a chore.Gameplay-66/100Graphics-82/100Audio-44/100Concept/Story-69Features-60Entertainment Value-53/100Overall Game Score-62/100 (Below Average, it serves it's purpose and provides you with some puzzles to solve whenever your bored)Buy it when it goes on sale again. This isn't for the casual gamer, you won't like it if these type of games aren't your cup of tea.........Hope you guys liked this review, I plan on reviewing every game I play on here, so all your feedback helps. Thanks.			"

												This is kinda like The Book of Unwritten Tales, except that it is good.Besides the traditional point and click, Nightmares from the Deep is fuuuuuull of minigames and minipuzzles that award you an object to allow you progress the story. Most notably, often they present you a messy Scene of Hidden Objects, in which you have to find a list of many items, after which you are awarded with one single object. If you don't like the Hidden Objects minigame, you can replace it for a match of Mahjong without any side effect. Other than the Hidden Objects minigames, the objects are never really ""hidden"", which is great.Contrary to some other games of the genre (*cough cough* BoUT *cough cough*) the puzzles here make a lot of sense. You will never find yourself thinking ""I'd never expect to use bettles for this!"". Still in this comparison, NotD will not present you with jokes and puns befitting a primary school kid (which is definitely a plus if you're not one). The developers from NotD do not seem to despise any specific other genre of games either, or if they do, they do not sign their game with that. Respect is definitely a plus, unconditionally.About the bad, the graphics suck at some points specially the talking animations, and the voice acting is dull, which is weird since some of the CG scenes are pretty decent. The game is not FullHD, fullscreen just stretches it. The story is very cliché too. The game is quite short as well.If you like puzzles get this game. You're going to have some fun, though not much of a challenge. If you want graphics and fireworks, you'll potentially get disappointed.			"

												Top end in it's genre.I realy enjoyed this game.Pro's:- very enjoyable (easy) puzzles.- good hidden objects scenes.- extremely good graphics for it's genre- the option to hover over an object's name to get a shadowy reflection of what the object looks like (realy handy for some of the items if you're not a native english speaker). (Something i realy miss in other hidden object games since i don't know every english word for every item)- option to skip the rest of a hidden objects scene by doing a game of mahjong instead (if you realy can't find an object and don't want to use a hint)Cons:- voice acting is bad (but that's the case with most of the games in this genre)- just a tiny bit too easy (but that's a quite personal opinion here)			"

												I had a huge addiction for these hidden object style casual adventure games a few years ago until I totally burned out on them.This game was my first, tentative, step back into the genre. And a good one at that. It's not the deepest game you'll ever play (no pun intended), but it entertained me enough to play it through to its satisfying conclusion.Gameplay consists of traversing (pretty much) static screens of a museum, a pirate ship and a mysterious island, gathering items and solving decently fun puzzles. Items are generally gained by playing a mini-game, which is either the traditional hidden object one OR a game of Mahjong. The critical detail here is that you can choose which one to play whenever you want!I went through the game only solving the Mahjong puzzles and had a great time.The game is a great introduction to the genre and a solid example of how to do a casual adventure game right.Steer clear of it if you're looking for a particularly serious or challenging experience though.

												This game was a happy surprise.  I've always liked Hidden Object games as a relaxing kind of guilty pleasure: mind on stun, if you will, and just play with the pretty pictures.  This one is a successful meld of adventure and puzzling.  The story is clear and present, driving the action to the puzzles in a satisfying way.  I enjoyed the voicing and the art, although - as is always the case - a couple of the objects were real ""wha"" moments, as in ""wha zat?"" (so it's a good thing the ""sonar"" shows outlines).  The tasks were generally clear, the solutions were fun and not ludicrous or mood-breaking, and overall this was a fun way to spend a few hours.  I even went back to get all of the missing achievements.			"

												So, the story for the game is actually pretty nice, and the puzzles/ hidden object sceens are amazing, for that I really enjoyed the game.  I did however, have problems getting a couple of the achievments at fist, one being finish the game in expert mode. I had done this, but it didn't give me the achievemnt. It wasn't until I looked on the steam forums that I saw others were having the same problem and the developers of the game said that they would have a fix for this, but it hasn't been fixed as of yet. So in order to get the achievement I had to finished the game in the 'extras' section  all at once. (No exiting the game and coming back to it later) and that worked. The other problem is the cutscenes are super blurry. I mean- the game would be so great, if the cutscenes didn't go super pixilated, but they did. I looked this up on the forums as well and the developers said they would fix this issue as well. I am hoping that the sequels to the game do not have these issues, but I will still play them because I found this one to be fun and entertaining despite the issues. I would say get them on sale, as it seems it would be worth it then, not at full price with the couple of bugs that are going on.			"

												A good hidden object/mahjong driven game with good art and a good story. The videos are a bit fuzzy at times and the voice acting sometimes spotty which is a shame cause otherwise this is a good game.The puzzles are not difficult to figure out and the hidden object/mahjong sequences are rather good. You will most likely never get stuck on a puzzle for a long period of time. The game even has 2 playing modes: Adventure and Expert. On Adventure mode the game will show you on the map the next location you need to go to and will sparkle around objects you need to interact with whereas on Expert these helpers will not be activated,I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys hidden object games/mahjong with a bit of adventure and good story thrown in the mix.

												Nightmare from the Deep: The Cursed Heart is 1 of the 3 games that I had gotten in a package that I had bought. I thought the sequal was amazing, this one might be even better! Artifex Mundi has a reputation of heart throbbing hidden object games for people like myself. If you are into a tale of tragic love story between a pirate and his lover, than you definitely should play this game!			"

												I didn't expect a whole lot from this casual point-and-click adventure game, but it pleasantly surprised me. It was slightly longer than I expected for the price, the puzzles fit the theme fairly well, and I like the twist on the ""search the screen for the hidden item"" that makes it into its own minigame that I enjoyed playing. Don't expect the second coming, but if you want a quick, simple and engaging P&C adventure, then it's a good choice for a few bucks.			"

												This is a relatively easy casual game with a good story and beautiful art. The hidden object aspect of it is very well done. It's not very challenging and I finished it in 4 hours. But I did like it so I will continue to play it to get the achievements but next time in expert mode. The only thing I was dissappointed with was that the mahjong and cursed coin achievements don't work! Other people complained about this as well so hopefully they will fix it soon.			"

												Artifex Mundi does it again... this title certainly delivers the level of quality and enjoyability that I expect from these games. With that said, I found a few exceptionally good things, and found a few things to be less enthused about. Firstly, the good: the game is beautifully illustrated, it has fantastic subject matter and setting, and it is satisfactorily full in length of gameplay. The voice acting and writing / dialogue are decent. The weaknesses are mostly that it eventually becomes slightly tedious, as clues later in the game require less intuition and more room-bypass-clicking legwork; in this regard there is a sense of the length of gameplay being somewhat inflated by unnecessary backtracking and uninspired search-errands. The puzzles are not particularly inspired either, however, some of the hidden object scenes are fairly challenging, and there were word usages and terms I was unfamiliar with (e.g. cockade) that upped the challenge bar. It is a very well-polished game, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I cannot help get the feeling that it somehow underachieves. Recommended: [ 7 / 10 ]			"

												With voodoo zombie pirates, the story is definitely reminiscent of the Caribbean inspired by On Stranger Tides, the source material for the Pirates of the Caribbean and Monkey Island franchises. Since I love both of those franchises and enjoyed Artifex Mundi’s Grim Legends: The Forsaken Bride, this game was an obvious follow-up choice. Similar to Grim Legends: The Forsaken Bride, the story relies on the Damsel in Distress trope to motivate the player, although the player is playing as a female character in both games (mom in one case and twin sister in the other). On a more personal note, it was fun to start off in a museum and play a character who is a museum professional since that’s my job in reality as well. I liked that the bonus adventure was about how to get off the island and home because it tied up the loose ends in the storyline.There are some nice gameplay features Nightmares from the Deep has that Grim Legends: The Forsaken Bride doesn’t have (or if it does have them it didn’t really explain how to use them). For example, I appreciated that the purpose of the Mahjong games was explained better. The puzzles were fun, even though a couple of typos (probably from translation errors) did cause a little confusion in a couple of puzzles. I did have a little bit of trouble with a bug causing achievements to not unlock properly, but it didn't ruin my enjoyment of the game (multiple playthroughs!) and it has now been resolved so new players should have no trouble unlocking achievements.TL;DR – If you like pirates and adventure games, this is a good bet for you!

You receive the dead body of  Captain Remington, who was - back then in his days - a feared and cruel pirate. In fact, you are the one who brings him back to life and Remington flees with your daughter to Skull Island. Obviously, it is your task to rescue your duaghter and break the curse that keeps the old Captain alive. One should not expect a deep and emotionally moving story behind such a game and so didn't I, to be honest. That's simply because such games are ment to be played casually: easy to learn, even easier to master! In comparison to other games of this genre this game made a quite good attempt and at least tries to build up tension and most of the time keeps you a little curious, indeed. Of course, this isn't comparable to extraordinary RPGs, for example, but within its own genre this game knows how to sell its plot well (therefore my STORY-rating is pushed from a 2 to a 3).The difficulty was mainly rated with the highest difficulty-level in mind. There are two modes you can choose from: ""regular mode"" that shows on your maps all places where actions are available and gives you a shorter charge time for hints, and ""expert mode"" that doesn't give you hints at all and lets your hint-bar fill up more slowly. If you play this game for the first time, expert mode can be really hard, indeed, because you have to spent more attention on clickable items and have to backtrack a lot to find spawning hidden-object-scenes, but there is one big downside: the game offers a complete ""strategy guide"" ... I would rather call it a ""click-through"", to be honest. It's an entire list of all objectives, you have to fulfill, including all clickable items with a beautiful photo gallery. This is ... *clearing throat* ... ment to be nice, really, but this game is simple enough and offering a complete walk-through is destroying the last bit of a challenge completely ^^"" Without this ""feature"" my rating would probably have been a 3 of 5 due to the expert mode, but in this case I decided to reduce it to a 1 out of 5 because even the ""clever puzzles"" (as stated in the game description) weren't clever enough in my opinion but rather easy-peasy.The gameplay is solid and the voice acting is ok. This game is actually just a simplified Point&Click-Adventure (because the game chooses the appropiate interaction-method with objects automatically, e.g. ""talking"" while hovering about persons, magnifying things that can be inspected, and collected objects from your inventory aren't combinable, at all) with hidden-object-/mahjong-elements and - let's be honest - it's hard to screw something up that's as simple as clicking ; ) Autosaving works perfectly fine and I didn't bump into bugs or crashes of any kind. However, there doesn't seem to be a way of starting a new game as long as your current campaign isn't finished, despite of creating a whole new player-profile; not the end of the world, but mildly annoying. Due to some restrictions I had to play this game three times to earn all achievements. Mini-games can be played in two different modes: One is the common hidden-object scene and the other one let's you solve the object finding by playing mahjong. To earn the achievements ""Self-guided Tour"" and ""Mahjong Master And Commander"" you have to solve all 28 mini-games in a playthrough either only as hidden-object-puzzles or only mahjong-challenges, and during my first run I tried out both mechanics and wasn't able to complete these puzzles a second time in the other mode. I'm not sure if this was intended. If it was, then I've got to criticize that this design-decision artificially lengthens the game time for those who want to get a Perfect Game.The graphics are generally good and offer a decent resolution, the only thing that disappointed me, was that the game description claims to have ""AAA-quality cinematics"" that it clearly doesn't have! The cinematics didn't scale with the resolution and because I play with a FullHD-monitor, probably as most players these days, I had to watch horribly pixelated cutscenes. Either the devs didn't test the quality on a common monitor or they simply lied ... no matter what applies, it's awefully negative, in my opinion.I decided to decrease the rating for the game's replayability, although I personally played it three times. The reason simply is, that on one hand I only would have needed two playthroughs - maximum -, if I had paid a little bit more attention. And on the other hand I want to evaluate games as objectively as I can, which means, that I have to be aware of people that don't care for achievements like  I do. These people would probably not consider to replay this game, because it doesn't offer new challenges, alternative endings or anything else that makes this game worth playing again.~Conclusion~""Nightmares From The Deep"" is a decent game. Those of you who like hidden-object-games will probably have some nice hours to spend with this. I personally don't think that it offers any original ideas or breakthroughs in this genre and didn't create tension or fun above the ordinary, but on the other hand I don't see any severe reason to prevent you from buying this game, if that is the kinda game you like and enjoy, because despite the misinformation about the ""AAA-cinematics"" it offers a solid quality and I consider it as one of the better hidden-object-games on the market.

It has a nice story that you constantly want to know more about, good graphic if you look away from the bad animated movie clips and this game is one of the few where I think the puzzles is a bit hard. And now to the downsides. The small film clips shown during the game is really cloudy, things disappear and I personally think that this game is to short compared to other games in this genre.5.5/10			"

												This is a point and click style pirate adventure that is extremely lackluster. The puzzle aspect of this game is elementary at best. The hidden objects arent even the slightest challenge. Ultimately, this is a game designed for the very young. It is too easy. I'd also argue that there is too much plot for this kind of game, but in the end, I didnt much mind it. About 3.5 hour completion time for me. I used a few hints to help me figure out where to go, but not many.			"

The story takes elements from Pirates of the Carribean, rather heavily, up to having a heart in a chest keeping an otherwise immortal pirate king alive. I get the impression that Artifex Mundi just takes ideas from other places and uses them as their story, but whatever the story is not very important here anyways.Overall, a solid game, maybe not worth the full price but certainly worth checking out on sale.

												It's an Artifex Mundi first-person adventure/hidden object game, this time offering mahjong as an alternatives to the hidden object scenes. As always with AM, the scenes are gorgeous, the voice acting is okay, and the story is pretty good. For some reason, though, this particular game has some of the worst translation errors I've ever seen. I finished it some tme back, so I can't remember specifics other than spending over half an hour on one scene, with my husband looking over my shoulder, trying to find what they called an ""onion,"" only to discover through sheer random clicking that they really meant ""(a string of) garlic."" There were at least half a dozen instances like this throughout the game, into the bonus chapter, and it's severely annoying as well as a huge strike against a HOG. If you like HOGs, I'd recommend picking this up, but only if you get it on a good sale.			"

												Never played a Hidden Object game before, but this one made me keen to check out others. It's game design is like an old-school point-and-click adventure game, where you travel from one location to the next and find objects to interact on the environment, but broken up by the occasional hidden object section (along with other types of puzzles). Sure, the story and voice-acting aren't stellar, and there's a LOT of backtracking, but it's still really well-paced and compelling. I found myself completing the whole thing in one sitting! True, it's only a few hours long, which you can view as a positive or negative, but I found it to be the perfect length for this type of game.			"

												Nice game, but I actually found it a little too easy. I played the expert mode and didn't need the hint or skip button for the puzzles, HO scenes or generally during the game. I admit, I normally play the casual mode because I often get stuck in the game and forget where there are still puzzles to solve or where I can use objects. But with this game I found it quite obvious where the items in your invetory could be used. It's a nice game if you have some free time and if you ran out of other options of Point & Click /Hidden Object games on Steam ;) If you decide to get the game I would recommend to wait for when it is on sale (I paid ~3€), or get the second part (Nightmares from the Deep: The Siren`s Call), which seemed to be more developed and which I definitely enjoyed more.

												It's an Artifex Mundi first-person adventure/hidden object game, this time offering mahjong as an alternatives to the hidden object scenes. As always with AM, the scenes are gorgeous, the voice acting is okay, and the story is pretty good. For some reason, though, this particular game has some of the worst translation errors I've ever seen. I finished it some tme back, so I can't remember specifics other than spending over half an hour on one scene, with my husband looking over my shoulder, trying to find what they called an ""onion,"" only to discover through sheer random clicking that they really meant ""(a string of) garlic."" There were at least half a dozen instances like this throughout the game, into the bonus chapter, and it's severely annoying as well as a huge strike against a HOG. If you like HOGs, I'd recommend picking this up, but only if you get it on a good sale.			"

												Very easy to recommend Hidden Object game.I love they way the story is told in this game and it is decent one.The graphics and sound very good. The cut scenes are worth watching at least on the first play through. The Hidden Object scenes are nicely presented, with a decent alternate mah-jong game. A few good logic puzzles and quest object to find keep the scenes moving nicely. The achievements require very little effort.Difficulty: very easy, suitable for crayon eaters.			"

												Pretty standard point and click fare and a fairly pleasant experience that's more suitable for kids, despite the truely woeful voice acting and run-of-the mill storyline.  The static visuals, transitions and bits of FMV are done reasonably well, with only the animations letting the side down in the graphics department.  Controls are fine and make for a smooth experience when running around the various scenes.  The game also has various mini-games within the main game, amounting to search and logic puzzles and a mahjong alternative if you don't feel like doing the search tasks.  There's nothing that will tax you too much.It's an easy recommend, though the game does leave you with lots of unanswered questions, such as ""What's wrong with subtitles?"", ""Why do all pirates sound like they're trying to be Australian?"" and ""Where's the voice volume setting?"".

												Again a HOG (Hidden Object Game)!This one rode on the ""Pirates of the Carribean""-Hype of some past years. But this ""makeup"" is, like all powder, rouge and gloss, only a superficial incentive to buy the game.The background-story is a rescue-adventure, with some drama and romantics, so if you took the hint of powder and rouge and gloss, yeah it's a game aimed more for a female audience. But it doesn't break your crown to play it if you don't fit into this type of audience... The artwork is fine, gameplay is very organic and it has a easy playability. Experts may race through this game in a couple of hours - if you want to get all achievements you might to have take your time. Those type of games are games without consequences (at least quite often if you do it all right), there will be only one Ending ... a happy end. Sighs I am a grimm type of person, so I often like to mess up all the glamour, the beauty and the pretenses... so, yeah, no luck for me today. Games that have a hundred or more ways to mess up things, or to send the protagonists of a story into impeeding doom... yeah, that is where I do excell. And probably you also will miss the shocking effects of the protagonist falling into the deep abyss, chained to a cannon. Well, never mind. The game is still fun to play, and very much so. It is type of eye candy that makes your eyes get stuck onto the screen, till you have squeezed even the last drop of dour enjoyment out of this game.7,99 Euros is a little bit too high as price for this game though, but still - if you like these genre, buy a copy of it and enjoy it in a dark, unlit room... But don't be afraid too much about Davy Jones.			"

												I must say, I haven't completed a lot of HOG games. Three, if I recall. So, due to that fact, I can't really rely on past experience in order to review a game of this genre. But still, I can identify one that is of higher quality, and that title is Nightmares of the Deep: The Cursed Heart. I've also come to know that Artifex Mundi's games (most of them) are actually pretty good, overall. And that's exactly what I can say for the first entry in Nightmares of the Deep (NotD). It is a pretty good HOG.Originality reigns in this title. And I love it. You'll find numerous puzzles, and all of them are different in such a way that it amuses me. Just like in all HOG's, you complete these puzzles in order to receive an item, unlock an object, etc etc. Completing this certain task will lead you to another, and another, and another, until you reach a critical point in the game and achieve some objective you were trying to accomplish. Same with HOG scenes. There is, however, a twist in this part of NotD. You can skip the entire section that consists in finding, or assembling hidden objects, and replace it with a mahjong game. I've found this feature entertaining and distinguishes this HOG from others out there.Graphics wise, the scenarios are pleasant to look at. A negative aspect might be considered as the cutscenes, which are of lower resolution. Same with character animations, and the horrible lip sync, that are clunky and not really believable, which is obviously not the point of an HOG, to look realistic, but I'm sure they could have done a better job in this department.Looking at the story, it's actually a strong point in NotD. I won't spoil it, of course, but I can say it's pretty interesting. I also enjoyed the fact that some storytelling is told through ghosts scattered around the different scenes. And I must indeed admit, pirates plus HOG equals and awesome combination. The soundtrack is catchy and it looks like we're searching for Jack Sparrow or something related. Achievements add replayability and a ""bonus chapter"" that could have been totally implemented into the main game is always compelling, I guess.Overall, I recommend this HOG title, 100%, for the average, hardcore, or beginner HOG gamer, and for the ones who just want to take the genre for a spin.

												Recommended.Not awesome but a good game.Mix of adventure, puzzleing and find-the-object game, with good graphics, good story, good music and effects.Short as a breath (7 hours main and extra adventure) but, nice to play.Puzzles are a tad easy and, I never felt stuck. Find-the-object is a bit more tricky because translations to other languages where probably made just with one of the acceptions of an english word and, they doesn't correspond to the real name of the object in other language. You should first figure out what was the english name to try to guess what the hell do you have to search in your own language. This is the only flaw I see in this game.If you go stuck, you can play Majhong instead and get the object or, you can just skip the mini-game and get the object.This and the fact that puzzles are straigth-logic, save lots of frustration often fell in other point-and-click adventure games.

												I'm very close to starting to NOT recommend these Artifex Mundi casual point-and-click adventrure Hidden Object Games (HOG).  It's nothing particular to this ""Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart"" game.  It's more of a recurring motif problem.  To wit, their Achievements combined with the inability to either save a game or just plain quit a game and start over.  In this case, I'd made my first run through on Casual and doing the HOGs.  So, I started up another run on Expert and was working on the Mahjong games in place of the HOGs.  About a quarter of the game in, I realized I'd just done a HOG instead of a Majong (i.e., I'd messed up the Achievement).  Without a way to restore a save or just quit and start over, I'd have to finish the entire game knowing I couldn't get the Achievement and restart another run.  No.  Not gonna happen.  So, I'm upset, frustrated, and uninstalling the game.Now, as to the game itself, it's a little below par for Artifex Mundi.  For some reason, it's a bit hard to see the objects in the HOGs.  Also, there are a lot of cases where you get stuck, only to realized that a HOG has popped up somewhere on the map that you'd otherwise have no reason to re-visit.  If a HOG re-activates like that, there should be a quest type of task that would take you back to the area to see the now-active HOG.  And, finally, the voice work (heck, even the role) of the protagonist's daughter is really annoying.Other than that, it's pretty much a standard Artifiex Mundi HOG (decent graphics, mostly tolerable voice acting, and reasonable puzzles).  I got about 3.6 hours out of my first run.  If I'd gone on to continue the last run, I'd probably have gotten about 5-1/2 to 6 hours of ""enjoyment"" out of it.  So, if you decide to buy it, I'd suggest getting it on sale.			"

The animated bits suffer from a bit of pixelation, but it doesn't detract too much from the game.The puzzles are relatively easy, but the hint option is there if you need it (just make sure you don't accidentally hit it while walking about :( ).Four of five stars, and what seems to be a good way to get into the genre.

												One of the best hidden object games I've played so far. It has a solid story, solid game play and the voice acting is actually decent. I guess my only issue is that the extra storyline was short, but it was still nice and answered a question that was lingering after the end of the game.If you're into this genre of games then you'll probably like this one. It has a fair amount of hidden object scenes mixed with other types of puzzles. There is also a helpful map which clues you in on which area to go to next so you can keep progressing. Though some hidden object scenes get revisted and they're not as challenging the second time around.Story is rather straight forward and doesn't have that many twists and turns, you can figure it out pretty quickly. But it's still told well and who doesn't like pirates?!Long story short, buy the game.			"

The story is dumb and you should pay no attention to it, but it had a nice balance of I Spy-like object searches and ""normal"" puzzles that you will find in first-person puzzle-adventures such as this. They also did a nice job at constructing a location that requires you to backtrack a lot but to where it isn't a drag going back and forth all the time.			"

												Pros:+ Beautiful visuals and excellent mood+ Very good UI+ You can freely switch between HO scenes and mahjong+ Cutscenes are nicely animated and quite smoothly blend with ingame visuals+ Believable HO scenes with mostly relevant objects, not just random junkpiles+ Perfect difficulty level (though this is of course subjective), I played mostly in Expert mode, switched to the easier mode just a handful of times to check which fields to visit when I ran out of ideas. Managed not to use any hints until the very end of the game, which almost never happens with me.Cons:- Very clichéd story. Though at least it's not a guy saving a woman, instead two strong and capable female characters have cardinal role in the story. (One is the protagonist, but the other is not the daughter - to avoid spoilers :) )- The daughter's voice is annoying, the dub sounds very beginner- Some cutscene animations aren't lip-synced with the dubOverall: 9/10Haven't seen such high quality HO/adventure game since I played Dire Grove.EDIT: There are so many typos in the Extra adventure, seems like they didn't ran the HO word list through even a Word spell check. Come on creators, you didn't make such mistakes in the main game.			"

												Nightmares from the Deep: The cursed heard is a casual point & click game. I'm going to be very brief because there isn't much to say about a point & click game. Usually the only thing that changes is the art and the story.This game took me 3-4h to beat without the help of any walkthroughs. The puzzles are very unique and fun to do (the final urn puzzle is a bit ""challenging"" for the casual player and it took me a while to do it) and the art is also pretty.The story kinda reminds me of pirates of the caribbean (mainly at the end because of the heart scene) but that's probably a coincidence.TL;DR : Game is worth playing if you love point & click games. However there aren't any unique features besides the puzzles and story.			"

This game is no exception, it's simply brilliant, entertaining and a lot of fun. I have a new love for these types of games and actively seek them out nowadays! You start the game as a museum owner pursuing an undead pirate who has kidnapped your daughter. You quickly realize that the villain is entangled in a tragic, centuries-old love story, and wants to resurrect his mistress with the girl’s life force. You feel sorry for the pirate, but you have to stop him before it is too late for your daughter. - Recommended!  "

												I enjoyed playing this game and you play a female in this one which is surprisng and this one is a bit more challening as sometimes you have to combine items which can be tricky at times. There is a option to play mahjong which involves choosing the same two items like two bottles or two swords and quite easy to do when stuck combining a object..It has dead pirates who are real helpful as long as you give them something and if you give one pirate coins he tells you the history and what happened and can be spooky at times the hint system is helpful.  Captain Remington sounds similar to Blackbeard who looked like he devil in battle and was know to cause fear in his enimies.It is worth your time and buy it on special, I did and enjoyed my time playing the game, a bonus adventure is available,  after doing the main game and can take a hour or longer to do. You are nominated the new captain of the ship and need to find the message from a ship wrecked. I was not expecting another undead person who was cursed by Davy jones and was interesting to do and worth doing and would recommend this game.			"

												Normally I don't play or even recommend hidden object type games as I have in the past seen them as sub-par.  But I have to admit that once I found  this developer - ""Artifex Mundi sp. z o.o. "" I was hooked on their games.  I had so much fun in this game that I actually played through it 3 times (mostly to get the achievements, but yes I enjoyed it too).  So - gameplay was good, I had no issues at all.  Puzzles were challenging without being ridiculous.  There is a hint system but I didn't use it.  The game follows a story so all of the puzzles are story driven and themed.  There is a great mix of puzzle types in addition to the hidden object puzzles.  I got all of the achievements in 3 play throughs - the last being a speed play for myself.  For this type of game I feel that this is a very, very good game so I give it a 10/10 and my enthusiastic thumbs up.			"

												I'm not the sort to prejudice games over things like their being hidden object puzzlers; and the Artifex Mundi games are by far the best examples of the genre. Nonetheless A.M. has followed the method of if it isn't broke don't fix it, meaning they reuse their puzzles with cosmetic variations from one game to another. This has the unfortunate result that if you've played one of their games you've played them all.That's O.K. if you think of the games as more visual novels with bonus puzzle content. Granted the writing isn't amazing; but it isn't bad either. I know I've yet to play an A.M. game I could make myself stop playing before the end. That's, on average, over 3 hours in one sitting. And, most of their games include a bonus chapter that extends gameplay another hour.They do manage to do this without unnecessarily padding game length that overstays its welcome. I know that doesn't sound like much in an industry with triple AAA titles that boast hundred of hours of gameplay. But, for cheap casual games this is an achievement.My recommendation, because of the ""if you've played one you've played them all"" problem, is pare your selections down to their better games. That would be Enigmatis 2 (but not the mediocre Enigmatis: the Ghosts of Maple Creek) as a top pick, Grim Legends 1 & 2 if you liked that, and the Nightmares from the Deep trilogy if you just can't get enough of these games.

												This is the first real Hidden Object Game that i've ever played. I say ""real"", because I played games on flash sites, and facebook which labeled themselves as such, but this is the first high quality one i've played. The first thing that surprised me was that the game wasn't JUST hidden objects like it's Facebook cousins. It was hidden objects+Classic point and click inventory based adventure game! I loved it!PROS-Fantastic graphics! Seriously, the art is amazing!-Creative, but not insanely difficult puzzles.-Fun and entertaining storyline.-The ability to skip hidden item sections and play a game of mahjong instead.CONBad voice acting, zombie pirates sound so polite, and Captain Remington literally sounds like he's reading his lines. You can hear in mid sentence, when he is having to continue reading from another line and/or page. It's just bad.			"

												I actually liked this one. HO games of this series tend to have the same features- a female protagonist- a somewhat bad voice acting- beautiful art- a kind-of-silly story.This, like all the others, has all of these features. While other titles (like Alice's Journey or Tales of Glass and Ink) are however dull, boring and feel too easy and lacking a decent storyline, this is one of the best of the series. The story actually has somekind of a sense with an ending that surprised me a little -which is way more than you can ask for with these games-, interesting minigames and the genuine ability to make you want to finish the game, which is not something that one should underestimate. Again, like all HO games it is not worth more than a couple pounds, and it should be bought when on discount. Other than that though, it is a very enjoyable couple of hours. Strongly Recommended, especially if one is -like me- weirdly drawn to this kind of games despite their silliness.			"

												I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the game.~The plot is fast and straightforward and does a great job at avoiding too many details that could otherwise bog the pace down.~You feel a drive to keep going and even though it's not timed, you feel an urgency to go as quickly as you can. You can skip cutscenes and even lines of dialogue so you don't slam to a stop.~I felt invested in what happened next. Usually I feel like I'm just going through the motions to get to the end.~I don't remember any puzzle solutions that were too illogical. If they didn't want you to use an item on something they usually gave a reasonable reason. I think there was only one time I found an item and didn't go, ""Oh, I've been looking for you."" It helped keep me from backtracking more than was necessary.~Unfortunately, there's a lot of backtracking. A LOT of backtracking. You do get maps that help you figure out where to go, where you've been, where you need to go, and the areas you can ignore. At one point, you have to travel from one side of the island to almost the other far side for a continuing objective...~You collect a type of item and have to carry it back to a certain location each time you find the item in order to get back story. Sadly, the hint system is set up so that even if you only have one of the item you have to take it to the location or it won't give you any clues. The backstory is told twice -- from characters and objects you find to the repeating objective. So not only is the system a pain in the backside but is also redundant. :(Don't let the backtracking and ongoing objective talk you out of this game. It's really fantastic and of all the HOG games I've bought/played, I would recommend this one without hesitation. I mean at one point, I was yelling at my screen, ""MAMA'S COMING, BABY!"" What other game could make you feel that way?			"

												Go Poland, yeah. Lewandowski scores 5 goals in 12 minutes and Polish teams make good games :-)Okay, enough of patriotic notes lets evaluate.Cool and fun game. I enjoy a good hidden title and that one is good with atmosphere and interesting plot.Beautifully drawn locations that make sense. The problem was the videos - when I watch them on full screen they are poor quality - fix that devs, please.The hidden objects mini games are well made, but I would prefer sth a bit more challenging, maybe a bit smaller items and more clutter in the screen (on hard difficulty). Mahjong alternative was a fun idea, though.A few typoes like harpun (harpoon) and one annoying mistake (says onion but should be garlic).All in all, well made game. Short (2 evenings of relaxed gaming) so the price should be no more than 5 euros.I'm gonna wait for further discounts (bundled titles would be welcomed) from this publisher.Dobra robota, rodacy :-)			"

												I'm not the sort to prejudice games over things like their being hidden object puzzlers; and the Artifex Mundi games are by far the best examples of the genre. Nonetheless A.M. has followed the method of if it isn't broke don't fix it, meaning they reuse their puzzles with cosmetic variations from one game to another. This has the unfortunate result that if you've played one of their games you've played them all.That's O.K. if you think of the games as more visual novels with bonus puzzle content. Granted the writing isn't amazing; but it isn't bad either. I know I've yet to play an A.M. game I could make myself stop playing before the end. That's, on average, over 3 hours in one sitting. And, most of their games include a bonus chapter that extends gameplay another hour.They do manage to do this without unnecessarily padding game length that overstays its welcome. I know that doesn't sound like much in an industry with triple AAA titles that boast hundred of hours of gameplay. But, for cheap casual games this is an achievement.My recommendation, because of the ""if you've played one you've played them all"" problem, is pare your selections down to their better games. That would be Enigmatis 2 (but not the mediocre Enigmatis: the Ghosts of Maple Creek) as a top pick, Grim Legends 1 & 2 if you liked that, and the Nightmares from the Deep trilogy if you just can't get enough of these games.

												This is a very decent collection of hidden object puzzles that is encased in a shell of inadequate point and click adventure game conventions, and edutainment minigames. First- The meat of the game, which are the hidden object puzzles, is quite scrumptious. It's as good as the best 2-d drawings, but with the addition of some animation tricks which only the video-game medium could provide. HoweverSecond- The rest of the game is lacking. The story is poorly written and poorly performed (from a voice acting and animation perspective), and the remaining gmaeplay is usually tedious. A) The ""narrative"" experience this game has to offer is not captivating because of the lack of quality voice acting, the extremely low number of animation frames, and just inadequate writing and scripting. The only postive is that the setting is firmly in the ""Age Of Sail"" fantasy pirate genre. B) The ""point and click"" adventure game aspects are usually illogical (as is typical for that genre). The puzzles are not solved by rational thinking, but rather by thinking within the perspective of the game developers.  C) The other minigames within the game are educationally entertaining at best, boring at worst. You have tile matching puzzles, tile swap puzzles, simple instruction following, and shape identification. D) The game also offers Mahjong solitaire as an alternative to the hidden object game sections. The art assets for this are certainly less artistically drawn.This is still a very good game if you want to play about 20 hidden object puzzle pages.			"

												An entertaining Hidden Object game with enough puzzles thrown in for good measure to keep it from bneing too samey. It's flexible in that it also allows for Mahjong to relpace the Hidden Object parts. There are also several difficulty levels that change how quickly the Hints and Skip recharge, if active ares are highlighted and how often, penalties for misclicking in the Hidden Object searches etc.All in all an entertaining few hours. My only gripe is that the cutscenes are extremly low res compared to the rest of the game and spoil the atmosphere with a fuzzy laggy cutscene.9/10 would play Pirate-themed Mahjong again! "

I've played it three times now. Would definetely recommend. Takes about 3-4 hours on the first run if you're taking your time and reading/clicking everything (or doing all the Mahjong). Last run took me about 2 hours.			"

												This was not nearly as polished as other Artifex Mundi games, but it was still enjoyable.The plot is reminiscent of Pirates of the Caribbean, just slightly more convoluted and tragic.  The resolution of the artwork was somewhat blurry compared to what I am used to from this studio, which made cutscenes harder to watch, and many of the hidden object puzzles a challenge.  I found myself having to use the sonar feature fairly often because I couldn't distinguish one object from another, although it was never so bad that I had to use a hint.  I honestly preferred playing the mahjong.  The background locations were pretty, though.  The point-and-click puzzles were mostly logical, although there was a lot of backtracking for what felt like very little payoff.  Also, I really hope you like collecting ingredients for recipes.The voice acting and music were decent, and there was even a bit of humor with the pirates on the ship.I was slightly disappointed with the bonus mission.  While the puzzles were pretty good, the spelling, grammar, and word choices were terrible: ""tukan"" instead of ""toucan,"" ""perl"" instead of ""pearl,"" ""wires"" instead of ""yarn with knitting needles""... it just got worse and worse.  I can overlook small mistakes, especially in bonus content, but some of the errors made finishing the hidden object games nearly impossible without resorting to sonar or hints.Overall, it is a decent little game.  It has its shortcomings, but it was relaxing enough and interesting enough to occupy an afternoon.  It took about 8 hours to beat it twice through on expert mode (once for each set of achievements) including the additional mission, so I feel like I got my sale-price money's worth.  I would give it a 6/10.			"

												One of the better HOGs I've played on steam, a very enjoyable game. For being all haunted pirate themed, it's not too scary, only a few very mild jumpscares in the game.You play a museum conservator who is about to display the corpse of the legendary pirate captain Remington in your museum. You manage to wake him up and he kidnaps your daughter in his haunted ship. You'll have none of that and axe your way into his ship to get her back. There are two areas; the haunted ship and Skull Island. The difficulty of both the hidden object scenes and other minigames is pretty good, neither too hard nor too easy. If you're stuck on a hidden object scene, you can choose to play mahjong instead. in the mahjong there are a few matches of different colour that takes away one HO item each, you can switch back and forth or just play either. There is however an achievement for both playing all mahjong games and finding all HO items without using hint, so an achievement completeist will have to play the game through twice. Luckily for that all conversation and cutscenes are skippable.All HO scenes are used more than once, and all found items are removed each time, making the 3rd go around pretty easy. The art is beautiful, the voice acting is good and the music and sound effects set a good haunted-pirate themed mood. The animations in the cutscenes is probably the worst part of the game; they get so bad it feels blurry. The story is very good, to save your daughter you have to find out what's going on with the pirate captain and you learn his story through collecting and handing in dubloons to the pirate's cute-creepy companion.There are maps available on both locations but they're useless as it only tells you where you are and cannot be used for teleporting or seeing if an area is cleared.Highly recommended for any fan of HOGs, pirates or really games in general.

												This is well worth the buy! This game has an impressive amount of quality, and a few new twists on gameplay that I was very pleased to see! The story is enjoyable, and any romantic will be very pleased with the plot twists and turns we go through to reach the very satisfying ending.The gameplay is excellent and will not disappoint - well-constructed, enjoyable and steadily more complex Hidden Object scenes teamed with enjoyable puzzles and a robust hint system. As with many games in this genre, they make good (if not enough) use of a map to help navigate and figure out where you need to go next. The only bit of gameplay I think they could have improved on was the map itself, as there is no quick travel option.  Which makes sense in-game context, but still means quite a bit of traveling back and forth. Honestly my only quibble with the gameplay.Visually, it's stunning - the little bit of CG they use is well-done and matched to the artwork rather than trying to be realistic. A choice I applaud and definitely praise them for. The one bit of 'regular' CG is used for a deliberately creepy and eerie set of characters and was still a careful mix of realistic detail blended into the style of the art. The Hidden Object scenes were done in the art style of the game, not quickly patched from photos - the creators going that extra length always wins points with me. Very solid, consistent, and delightful visuals.Which just leaves audio, and this is a spot where the game falters just a wee bit - not in the music, but in the (mostly great) voice acting. Towards the end of the game, some lines are just not delivered well, or with odd inflection. Thankfully not by any of the major characters in the ending. The sound effects are minimal but spot on, but the music . . in full honesty it's mostly forgettably pleasant and appropriate for where you're hearing it. Nothing outstanding, but at least nothing that throws you out of the mood set by the game.			"

												This is the game that made me take the hidden object genre seriously.  Aside from having a great storyline, gorgeous graphics, and some well designed puzzles, The Cursed Heart is tremendously atmostpheric.  It also has enough different tasks in the game to make it not feel like a back to back needle in the haystack hunt.  I would recommend this game to all hidden object fans as well as gamers who are willing to give hidden object adventure games a chance.  The Cursed Heart offers an all around great experience.  8.5/10			"

												This is a good game, part of a good series. The story and voice acting are a bit sub par, but the art work is lovely and the puzzles are engaging. It was a bit on the short side (I think this had something to do with the hidden object scenes and puzzles not being terribly difficult.) Pirates an't really my thing, but I still enjoyed this game.			"

												Do not buy this game if you want deep strategy or action.Do not buy this game if badly recorded audio offends your ear holes.Do not buy this game for full retail, but this is Steam, so that pretty much goes without saying.Do buy if you want a quick hidden object game with puzzles that are very easy to solve. You'll feel slightly smarter for the 3 hour play time. If you know what you're getting into (and if you get it in a bundle,) this is a recommend.			"

												It’s a point-n-click adventure with hidden-object scenes. For the genre it is very good: the object interaction is logical, there’s a useful map, the pirate-based story is interesting (if a little clichéd), good artwork and it has lots of little videos to show events. If this genre interests you, I would definitely recommend it, because it’s the best of these that I've played. It also has a few extra things, like wallpapers, a hint system and a puzzle replay menu.If you hate hidden-object scenes, the game gives you the option to play mah-jong instead.			"

												This game was cool for what it is, a story-telling hidden object game. Personally, the daughter of your character is really irritating and constantly having to revisit every spot on the map can get really old really fast. The story was cool and the artwork is unique. Overall, I'd give this game a 2.5 out of 5, your children may get more out of it than you.			"

												Definitely recommended for all the ""Hidden Object"" -game lovers.. and if you're into mystery solving point-and-click adventures but not so keen on pixel hunting you may as well replace hidden object parts by playing mahjong! + Puzzles+ Decent voice acting+ Ineresting story and environment+ Challenging yourself toggling harder difficulty or not using any hints duing gameplay- Cutscenes would give out much more if they we're HQ - How come fireflies cannot escape a lantern like this?? xD http://c453.r53.cf1.rackcdn.com/8303/NM121.jpg "

												Got this on a coupon.A decent point-and-click. Most of the puzzles are hidden object or mahjong, but there are a few other scenarios to break up that monotony. The thing about this game that makes it odd is that has a lack of challenge, both good and bad. There is no good challenge in the sense that you are told exactly where to go and when, and there is really no way to lose. I'm playing this to have a spooky pirate skellingtons adventure, not ""Gone Home: Pirates Edition"".There is no bad challenge in the sense that every action taken in the game is logical, and there isn't a whole lot of guesswork. In other games of this genre, I might, due to an obscure objective, just do random stuff until I find something that works. Thank goodness that is not the case here.The art style is fine, but it quickly becomes obvious that almost everything is a 2D image. It's really noticeable during the dialogue sequences. The dialogue... works. It's certainly not the best, but it does its job in telling the story.If you really like point-and-click games, and this is on discount, or you have a coupon, you might want to pick it up. It's not particularly innovative, but it's still a neat little diversion that will last a few hours.			"

												This is an excellent game in the weird and hard-to-pin-down ""adventure/puzzle/hidden objects"" genre. It's my favorite genre, and sadly lacking in high quality games, but I digress. This is one such high quality game! Decent voice acting, well-integrated puzzles, beautiful graphics/scenery, nice low-key background music.

												You don't like point-and-click adventures? You don't like puzzles?Neither do i, and yet... it took all of about 2 minutes for this game to reel me in. It's a casual point-and-click adventure where the protagonist is on a quest to rescue her daughter from a risen-from-the-dead (or was he ever truly dead?) pirate (which may sound horribly campy, but it actually fits the story very well). It offers a ""hint"" button to help the... ah... less puzzle-oriented of us out when we're stuck, and offers an alternate mechanism for finding hidden items in some contexts (namely, a Mahjong mini-game, where matching tiles substitutes for finding items). As others as mentioned, the quality of the cinematic cutscenes is rather poor (specifically, each pixel is about 15mm across, but the motion _is_ fluid), but the cinematics are nonetheless used to great effect, providing cohesive transitions between non-cinematic scenes, which ties them to each other in a way i've not personally seen in games of this type (admittedly, my experience with them is limited, as it's not really my genre - perhaps that's a common thing to see in other games of this type). The non-cinematic parts are of course graphically impressive and the controls are trivial (well, the singular control - the mouse). The voice-overs are a definite ""meh"" but they aren't bad. (Some of the pronounciation irks me, but there's no accounting for taste (tomato, tomahto, and all that).)At 8 Euros for parts 1-3 (on sale), i kinda feel like i've cheated the publisher, as opposed to feeling cheated myself.So... back to playing... where were we... right, we've just left the museum and... aaaarrrrggghhh! A pirate! Click it! CLIIIICK IT!!!PS: plays flawlessly on my Mint Linux.PPS: After having finished it, some closing thoughts:- None of the puzzles felt ""arbitrary"" to me, in contrast to some puzzle games i've played (i'm looking at you, Lego series!).- A couple of the words for hidden items were a bit confusing (or completely new to me), but the ""sonar"" feature made that a non-issue.- It felt a bit short - roughly 6 hours (without using the Hint feature), including the  Extra Adventure which gets unlocked after the main story. Nonetheless, the pacing felt good - it never went long without something to do and i was never left scratching my head for more than a few minutes at a time. Likewise, backtracking was not problematic because navigation is swift.- Unlocking all achievements requires 2 play-throughs (once using the Mahjong search feature and once without it), and i'm very unlikely to play any game of this type twice.- i feel that 8+ Euros is a tick too high for today's market for this type of game, but not overly so. i won't impulse-buy an 8 Euro game, but will certainly bookmark it so that Steam notifies me if it's on sale.- i will likely impulse-buy future titles by this publisher if they're priced at 4 Euros or less.

												I've been on a HOG game binge recently and got through about 18 others before playing ""Nightmares from the Deep,"" and this has been the best yet. Interesting HO scenes and mini-games. It's more of a love story than a pirate adventure when you get into it. Graphics were better than expected, and even the voice acting was good, (for the most part).Not a terribly difficult game to beat and a very good introduction to Hidden Object Games if you haven't played them before.

												It's apretty decent puzzle and hidden object game, the setting is remarkably well-thought out and intricate, but the distance you need to travel in-game seems slightly too far each time you find that one element you need to progress, the addition of a quick-travel would greatly remedy this problem. The bonus adventure, however, feels less fleshed-out and the hidden-object scenes don't alays grant the items you were looking for (which is a pet peeve of mine).Regardless of these minor issues the game is very enjoyable, especially the main story, and the absence of collectibles is actually a relief for me, considering the amount I've been looking for recently.

												Nightmares from the Deep is a typical adventure game but with ""hidden objects"" minigames.  You go through hidden object minigames to get certain objects.  You use objects in certain locations.Story is nothing special.  It is a typical / cliched pirate love story.Most of the scenes looked fine, but the video cutscenes are horrendous.  They are highly compressed, showing lots of artifacts.  It felt like I was watching Youtube in 240p.  It looked like this game was designed only with mobiles in mind.Voice acting was decent.  Most of the voice actors sounded like amateurs.  For some of the voices, it sounded like they used a cheap microphone.For gameplay, it was on the easier side, and that's a good thing.  I didn't have to click-scan every pixel.  Every interaction had a wide area of clickability that made sense.  Sparkle effects on the map and in every location hinted at what to do next.The only thing I didn't like about gameplay was the constant back and forth traveling.  Fast traveling on the map would have helped.  For gameplay, I thought it was well thought out.Conclusion:Highly compressed video cutscenes.  Typical pirate love story.  Adventure gameplay was easy.  Needed fast travel.Decent game but could be better.			"

Summary:This is the second Artifex Mundi game that I have had the chance to play, and was a breath of fresh air after giving a fairly negative review on Demon Hunter: Chronicles from Beyond ( Read here).  What is so confusing for me however is based on Steam information Demon Hunter was released in 2014 and this game in 2012...it almost felt like learning from their mistakes but with that timeline couldn't be the case.  Enough about that however, this was a cohesive and fun puzzle game that pushed me through to the end.Pros:As I am just getting into modern hidden object games, you couldn't call me a veteran in the space.  Besides this, I felt like there was enough challenge and at the same time intuitive items that it was fun piecing through everything.The art, especially on the pirate ship portion of the game that is toward the beginning I felt was very well done.  Characters, environments and objects all blended together so well.  This is one of the huge weighing factors on why this game is rated positively.  The game was tighly put together, and you could see their inspiration.nes will sometimes have you forgetting you aren't in the main story with The Witcher 3.The mapping system is quite handy if you get stuck and are not sure where to progress, and it was made quite accessible.-Where I felt they got puzzles wrong in the aforementioned Demon Hunter game, I felt they did right in this game.  They provide you a clear objective, and the puzzles are imaginative enough to keep you interested.  A lot of reused concepts here, but well executed.Cons:You have the option to play a game of mahjong instead of playing the hidden object mini-games.  While they were fun enough, it was far and away from being one of my favorite times in playing mahjong.  While I appreciate that they gave players a separate option if they weren't interested in hidden object games...at the same time, it almost feels like the reason you play a title like this is for that very reason.  This was surely done because of having a target demographic that has low-end systems, but the in-game cutscenes were pretty horrific in quality.  And sadly, it was just bitrate and encoding, not actual art, rendering or writing!  If you run this game at 1080p, I can only assume the videos are in 640x480 with a low bitrate.  It is so pixelated and messy, it definitely pulls from the environment.The story was actually pretty darn good.  If there was a con, they could have maybe rewritten the beginning of it however.  It teeters on what you would expect as a plot device from a Goosebumps book.  Sadly I'm not here to propose a better opener, but it could have been done as well as once you are swept into the story.

												What I was looking for when I started this game last night was something I could be a little bit detached while playing. I stumbled onto a genre that I actually really love with this Artifex Mundi point and click style game. There are different puzzles, hidden object areas, and side games like Mahjong as you find your way through this haunted pirate adventure.The hidden object parts were my favorite, I wasn't expecting to be so into this style of game either. After expecting to check it out with a passing interest I actually played through it almost 3 times so that I could get the 100% achievement. It isn't a game or series that you will be able to completely emerse yourself into the characters and story. However, if you want a more casual game to change the pace a little bit, this series is definitely worth a look.The mini games are interesting, and you will definitely have to put on your problem solving hat from time to time. I found most of the game to be very asthetically pleasing, but there are some parts that don't look so great. The cut scenes especially tend to be very blurry and strange compared to the beautiful artwork displayed in the still scenes. I wasnt expecting to be blown away by that aspect of the game so not having my hopes up surely kept it from pulling me out of the experience.The story is about a museum owner who brings in a pirate exhibit and runs into a barrage of problems. She is harassed by the haunted pirate who sold his soul to Davy Jones eventually ending up on Skull island fighting to right the wrongs caused by the ghastly fiend. It has enough there to keep you interested even though the games are definitely the driving force that keep you hooked.

												I really liked the pirate theme, it made a good story. The moving cutscenes were pretty blurry for me but it is an older game. There were more HOs than puzzles in this one. The HOs were pretty challenging too. You have to play through twice to get all achievements. It is best to do a run doing the HOs and then another playing the Mahjong game instead. On the second run you don't even have to finish it to finish the achievements. I quite enjoyed this game for the HO genre.			"

												Dr. Black is the single worst museum curator in the history of terrible museum curators (you don't store priceless works of art in unprotected storage! Nor do you ship improbably mummified corpses in non-climate controlled packing crates!), but that doesn't stop this from being an utterly charming game, especially after you make it out of the museum. None of the puzzles are too tricky, and it's usually pretty obvious what you have to do or where you have to go next. Also, you can play mahjong instead of looking for things, which is an excellent change of pace.The storyline requires a little suspension of disbelief (see: corpses mummifying underwater, among other things), and gets a little... uncomfortable about two thirds of the way through, but ultimately is charming, and the art is a delight to look at and interact with.

												This is a very decent collection of hidden object puzzles that is encased in a shell of inadequate point and click adventure game conventions, and edutainment minigames. First- The meat of the game, which are the hidden object puzzles, is quite scrumptious. It's as good as the best 2-d drawings, but with the addition of some animation tricks which only the video-game medium could provide. HoweverSecond- The rest of the game is lacking. The story is poorly written and poorly performed (from a voice acting and animation perspective), and the remaining gmaeplay is usually tedious. A) The ""narrative"" experience this game has to offer is not captivating because of the lack of quality voice acting, the extremely low number of animation frames, and just inadequate writing and scripting. The only postive is that the setting is firmly in the ""Age Of Sail"" fantasy pirate genre. B) The ""point and click"" adventure game aspects are usually illogical (as is typical for that genre). The puzzles are not solved by rational thinking, but rather by thinking within the perspective of the game developers.  C) The other minigames within the game are educationally entertaining at best, boring at worst. You have tile matching puzzles, tile swap puzzles, simple instruction following, and shape identification. D) The game also offers Mahjong solitaire as an alternative to the hidden object game sections. The art assets for this are certainly less artistically drawn.This is still a very good game if you want to play about 20 hidden object puzzle pages.			"

												An entertaining Hidden Object game with enough puzzles thrown in for good measure to keep it from bneing too samey. It's flexible in that it also allows for Mahjong to relpace the Hidden Object parts. There are also several difficulty levels that change how quickly the Hints and Skip recharge, if active ares are highlighted and how often, penalties for misclicking in the Hidden Object searches etc.All in all an entertaining few hours. My only gripe is that the cutscenes are extremly low res compared to the rest of the game and spoil the atmosphere with a fuzzy laggy cutscene.9/10 would play Pirate-themed Mahjong again! "

												It's apretty decent puzzle and hidden object game, the setting is remarkably well-thought out and intricate, but the distance you need to travel in-game seems slightly too far each time you find that one element you need to progress, the addition of a quick-travel would greatly remedy this problem. The bonus adventure, however, feels less fleshed-out and the hidden-object scenes don't alays grant the items you were looking for (which is a pet peeve of mine).Regardless of these minor issues the game is very enjoyable, especially the main story, and the absence of collectibles is actually a relief for me, considering the amount I've been looking for recently.

												I really liked the pirate theme, it made a good story. The moving cutscenes were pretty blurry for me but it is an older game. There were more HOs than puzzles in this one. The HOs were pretty challenging too. You have to play through twice to get all achievements. It is best to do a run doing the HOs and then another playing the Mahjong game instead. On the second run you don't even have to finish it to finish the achievements. I quite enjoyed this game for the HO genre.			"

												This is one of the earlier of Artifex Mundis games, which I knew going in so I knew some things weren't going to be as good as they get in later releases. This is still a beautiful game with a good story which we have gone to expect from them if you've played their games before. The things I didn't like with this game is: 1. The voice acting. It is of course rarely good in hidden object games, but this was on the borderline to embarrassing at times, and took away a little piece of the mood and feel to the game.2. The length. It took me 3,5h to complete this, all puzzles and hidden object scenes, no hints and I even did the bonus chapter. The puzzles weren't very challenging except for the last one in the game, which for me took a little more effort to see the pattern and complete. The only reason I'm might sound negative toward this game is because Artifex Mundi really have delivered before (I started in the middle of their games based on release, which might have been a mistake) But in the end; It's a gorgeous game, with good sound (except voice) and okay puzzles. A little short, but still a stable hidden object game with a good story. 6.5/10			"

												Ok so after reading some reviews i expected to get around 10 hours playtime. But i finnished the game 2½ times in 7 hours (that includes some afk time).  100% achievement done. The game is easy for experienced hidden object players and it is a mix of puzzles and hidden objects which both are easy without hints. Did not use a single hint in both expert mode or normal mode. So what do i think about the game? It's alright. i wish it was more hidden object scenes tho and maybe a bit better quality on the movie scenes. I would not pay full price for it but on sale you should go for it if you enjoy those kind of games. I would probably give it a 6 out of 10 in this genre. Maybe a 7 if it wasnt that easy			"

 DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY THIS GAME IF YOU FIND IT ON SALE!Recently, I adquired this game in order to fill my free time, mainly.The first impact I had about Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart was the scenarios being pretty well detailed, where I found some cool mini-games, puzzles, memory testing, etc.If you're a fan of challenges which make you struggle a bit in order to succeed, this is the right game!Even if you aren't an adept of this genre, I assure you that it'll please you. And now you ask, ""What would make me interested in a genre I don't usually play?""Well, this is a game where you don't have just challenges which make you focus more than you'd imagine. At a certain point, you'll notice that the story itself is envolving and starts attracting you more and more.I became an huge fan of this game and I'd reccomend it to any person, since it has enough elements to attract almost everyone!

												Nightmares from the Deep is a typical adventure game but with ""hidden objects"" minigames.  You go through hidden object minigames to get certain objects.  You use objects in certain locations.Story is nothing special.  It is a typical / cliched pirate love story.Most of the scenes looked fine, but the video cutscenes are horrendous.  They are highly compressed, showing lots of artifacts.  It felt like I was watching Youtube in 240p.  It looked like this game was designed only with mobiles in mind.Voice acting was decent.  Most of the voice actors sounded like amateurs.  For some of the voices, it sounded like they used a cheap microphone.For gameplay, it was on the easier side, and that's a good thing.  I didn't have to click-scan every pixel.  Every interaction had a wide area of clickability that made sense.  Sparkle effects on the map and in every location hinted at what to do next.The only thing I didn't like about gameplay was the constant back and forth traveling.  Fast traveling on the map would have helped.  For gameplay, I thought it was well thought out.Conclusion:Highly compressed video cutscenes.  Typical pirate love story.  Adventure gameplay was easy.  Needed fast travel.Decent game but could be better.			"

Summary:This is the second Artifex Mundi game that I have had the chance to play, and was a breath of fresh air after giving a fairly negative review on Demon Hunter: Chronicles from Beyond ( Read here).  What is so confusing for me however is based on Steam information Demon Hunter was released in 2014 and this game in 2012...it almost felt like learning from their mistakes but with that timeline couldn't be the case.  Enough about that however, this was a cohesive and fun puzzle game that pushed me through to the end.Pros:As I am just getting into modern hidden object games, you couldn't call me a veteran in the space.  Besides this, I felt like there was enough challenge and at the same time intuitive items that it was fun piecing through everything.The art, especially on the pirate ship portion of the game that is toward the beginning I felt was very well done.  Characters, environments and objects all blended together so well.  This is one of the huge weighing factors on why this game is rated positively.  The game was tighly put together, and you could see their inspiration.nes will sometimes have you forgetting you aren't in the main story with The Witcher 3.The mapping system is quite handy if you get stuck and are not sure where to progress, and it was made quite accessible.-Where I felt they got puzzles wrong in the aforementioned Demon Hunter game, I felt they did right in this game.  They provide you a clear objective, and the puzzles are imaginative enough to keep you interested.  A lot of reused concepts here, but well executed.Cons:You have the option to play a game of mahjong instead of playing the hidden object mini-games.  While they were fun enough, it was far and away from being one of my favorite times in playing mahjong.  While I appreciate that they gave players a separate option if they weren't interested in hidden object games...at the same time, it almost feels like the reason you play a title like this is for that very reason.  This was surely done because of having a target demographic that has low-end systems, but the in-game cutscenes were pretty horrific in quality.  And sadly, it was just bitrate and encoding, not actual art, rendering or writing!  If you run this game at 1080p, I can only assume the videos are in 640x480 with a low bitrate.  It is so pixelated and messy, it definitely pulls from the environment.The story was actually pretty darn good.  If there was a con, they could have maybe rewritten the beginning of it however.  It teeters on what you would expect as a plot device from a Goosebumps book.  Sadly I'm not here to propose a better opener, but it could have been done as well as once you are swept into the story.

												Probably first hidden object game I played here on Steam but for some reasons I only started it and never played again. Now, after some time, I completed it. How was it? Interesting and fun. Sadly I can compare it to many games BUT if you want to play something casual, something that will relax you with not heavy story, not heavy puzzles - yes, it's good choice. Also, not sure if it's standard or not, but having a other way to solve stuff using mahjong is really amazing (my most favorite thing in Nightmares from the Deep). Backgrounds looks solid, loved every skeleton in this game. I'm not sure if this game is a good as start point for someone who never played hidden object games before but if you have idea what kind of games are those - try it. I enjoyed it and I will be sure to check the next game in series.			"

												This is an older HO game, as the low-def animation makes evident, but even showing its age, it's still a solid middle-of-the-road title.  There are plenty of HO screens to play (or to avoid by playing a Mahjong minigame, if that's to your tastes) and while they do repeat, no objects respawn.  There's lots of running around, and a pirate/ghost/love story that's rather romantic, if you don't think about it too hard.On the subject of not thinking too hard, this, like most Artifex Mundi HO games, leans to the easy side of the spectrum, so have no fear of the higher difficulty setting.  Also, despite the game already being a respectable length to begin with, there's also a modest bonus chapter.			"

												I've been on a HOG game binge recently and got through about 18 others before playing ""Nightmares from the Deep,"" and this has been the best yet. Interesting HO scenes and mini-games. It's more of a love story than a pirate adventure when you get into it. Graphics were better than expected, and even the voice acting was good, (for the most part).Not a terribly difficult game to beat and a very good introduction to Hidden Object Games if you haven't played them before.

												I bought Nightmares from the Deep expecting adventure game like Secret of Monkey Island et al. It turned out to be more of an interactive story intervened with puzzles. It was a bit awkward at first, but once I got used to it, I must say I quite enjoyed the game. The story might not be very original, but it's coherent and captivating. The puzzles mostly consist of ""find hidden object"" scenes, but there are also some more demanding ones. Though I wouldn't mind if there were more of those. Overall it's a good game and I can easily recommend it. The only major flaw is that you cannot get all achievements in one run, because you can either solve ""find hidden object"" scenes OR mahjong puzzles, not both at the same time - and there are separate achievements for each of those. So while the game has little if any replay value, you'll be forced to play it twice if you're a completionist.			"

												Love the graphics and colors too. If you play in italian, have a huge imagination searching for objects, because there are many terms ""lost in translation"". Love the story.			"

												Absolutely fun, and for a few bucks, more than worth it. Pure point and click and long enough to feel satisfied when finishing it. The extra adventure was a nice bonus.			"

												I enjoyed this one but it seems some of Artifex Mundi's other titles I've played are newer and a bit more sophisticated. Still fun! ****			"

												a very short but decent HOG from Artifex Mundi which is a guarantee for high quality HOG.pros.high resolution.good sound tracks.decent story.great graphics.cons.nonefor hardcore HOG fans is a should buy. but definatly not for the full price. that price for the length of the gameplay time is not fair. I highly recommend that game on sale or from a bundle.i give the game 7/10 due to the short time of gameplay +1 for cards =8/10			"

												First game in a trilogy of one of the best hidden object games out there. Great, fun, ridiculous story (as all the best are). Puzzles that are fun and just challenging enough. Good art and pretty good animation. Overall great game.			"
