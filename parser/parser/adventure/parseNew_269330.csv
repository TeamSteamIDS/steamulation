												Chronology is a game I've been following ever since I saw it on Greenlight, and I'm very glad it got its chance to be released. The game is very imaginative, and the way you progress and use the mechanics make for a really fun experience. I also really like the voice acting, the design of the world is very pretty, and the music and sound is absolutely phenomenal. The game has a pretty good sense of humor, and I really enjoyed the exchanges between characters. The game's length isn't the longest you can find, but it feels right for the kind of game it is, and more than makes up for it with content. You will not regret picking this game up.Overall, I give this game 88/100, and would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle games, or likes the use of time manipulation in a game.			"

												Colorful, cute, fun and pretty. Enjoyable no matter what your age is.You control 2 characters one with the power to rewind / fast forward time and the other a snail that can freeze it.  Obstacles broken in the future are fixable in the past, anything ranging from ruined machinery to dead plants from the future that you can go back in time to save or fix.   It was a good feeling to see the dead plant grow massively after just a little help!The snail is useful as in you can hop on the snail's shell then switch control to the snail and go for a ride and jump off the shell to a higher platform, and it can slide along the games surfaces to reach area's the inventor cannot reach. The game has full controller support but is playable with keyboard but I always suggest playing platformers with a controller. I highly recommend the game, as it's one of those games that is obviously a labor of love made to bring enjoyment into peoples lives instead of the usual cash grabs that copy and paste what is popular for the day.

												Chronology is a fairly short but fairly fun puzzle platformer that will has a delightful story and uses gameplay mechanics similar to Giana Sisters without the brutal difficulty. The story is about an old scientist who wakes up in a devastated post apocalyptic world and finds an item he can use to go back to the past. He uses this power to go back and confront his mentor who is the cause for destroying the future. Along the way he meets a genetically engineered snail with the power to freeze time. I found the characters heartwarming especially the snail. The old man had a bit of a crotchety disposition but it's understandable if your mentor plotted behind your back and used your research to destroy the world. Who wouldn't be a bit crotchety about that? Overall I found the story fun, the puzzles were well done and I only looked to a guide to figure out one of them. So to sum it up, this is a nice little family friendly game. Featuring solid controls and puzzle mechanics.			"

												*could have minor spoilers, use some caution when reading*I know what you're thinking. Another platformer, another day, right? Same old, same old? With the copious amounts of platforming games available on Steam, what makes Chronology worth a purchase?Chronology, thankfully, gives you a lot of reasons.As described in the trailer, you play as an older gentleman and his friend, a snail. The present time in the game is set after an apocalyptic event, and using a special device he invented, the old man can travel back and forth through time at will. The snail (who has some sort of robotic shell) can stop time. Together they use these abilities to progress further, to tackle challenges, and to save the world from destruction.The very first thing you see here is the art of the game; no lame, overused, big pixel graphics here. The world is beautifully exhibited in the past time and hauntingly dark in the present time. The overall look can be described as having been painted on a canvas; Osao Games, developer of Chronology, seems to be inspired by Studio Ghibli in terms of artistry here, and it shows: attention to detail, such as curtains blowing in the wind as you pass them add a definite touch. The transitions going from past to present give a stark contrast: former architecture in the past has broken down in the future, vegetation takes over parts of a city; it's little things like these that add so much to the visuals.The music here fits in well and is very, very awesome, ranging from happy, to urgent, to bleak, to pensive, and it seems that every scene you are in is complemented perfectly by a fitting musical score; whoever made the music to this, you get my props for that one, man. The audio for the rest of the world is vibrant and gets the job done. Voice acting in this is great, which surprised me. I didn't expect this level of quality in the audio!The gameplay here is simple. You can utilize a gamepad or the computer keyboard's arrow keys + spacebar. Controls here are tight, and work really well and are very simple. The platforming aspect of the game is transformed through the use of the time machine in your possession; landscapes change from the past to the present. This leads to very cool and unique platforming (for example, jumping whilst in the present, using the time machine, then landing on a ledge in the past). Other puzzles include planting a tree in the past in order to climb up it in the present. The potential uses of time here are great, and it adds much needed fun to the dry platformer genre. The developers made an excellent choice by telling you the controls, and then they let you play. That's it. You are in control, and you learn how to tackle the game's puzzles on your own. Once you meet your snail friend, they'll give you a small clue on where to use her time-stopping powers, but other than that, it's all on you, and I love it for that. It's rewarding when you figure out a puzzle through your own assumption; that being said, more experienced people will sort of breeze through some puzzles, but even I got stuck at a cleverly designed puzzle at times.The only negatives I could see to this game include minor audio bugs, which most likely will be sorted out, and some players may find it a bit easy to get through as it is relatively short, and the final climax at the end is slightly underwhelming. However, this game is solid at almost every level.Overall, I'd recommend Chronology for anyone, at any age. It's an awesome game that rekindled my love of platforming games in a time where I didn't seem to like them anymore. It's unique, fun, simple, and just generally great. It's worth $9.99, definitely, if this kind of game interests you, although I wouldn't shy away from a discounted price.If I had to give this game a numeric rating, it'd be a 9/10.			"

												Chronology is a game that very nearly didn't exist at all, and wouldn't that be a shame. The game was Greenlit on Steam last year only for the original development company, Progressive Media, to fold beneath it. Fortunately, former team members wanted to see the game come out, and formed Osao Games to complete work.A lot of times it can be worrisome when a game changes hands like this, but the final product is a thoroughly charming experience that should be a staple of everyone's Steam library.The gameplay centres around a two-character mechanic: a little old inventor, and his trusty companion, the snail. Neither character is given a name beyond that, but neither do they really need them. The inventor is able to travel back and forth between two time periods: 'Before' and 'After' the cataclysm which starts the game. The snail is able to stop time, but her hard shell also serves as a positionable platform for the inventor to stand upon. While in some cases, that merely gives an option to ease up a tricky platforming section, in other cases it's critical to solving puzzles.This means, to address the elephant in the room, that Chronology really doesn't play like Braid at all. The intended effect, per the developers, is something like a cross between Day of the Tentacle and Lost Vikings. It's not a bad comparison, really-- you'll find yourself constantly adjusting the environment in one time to affect the other (taking boxes from After into Before, growing plants in Before to solve puzzles in After, and so on), and you'll need to use both Inventor and Snail's abilities to their fullest to figure out some of the harder tricks.What's most impressive here is just how thoroughly the game hybridizes puzzle and platforming. You're never making a series of annoying jumps just to get to the next puzzle-- the question of how to set up those jumps <i>is</i> the puzzle. Chronology never pulls a new gimmick out of nowhere only to drop it after a single puzzle: it teaches you how to solve the doozies by teaching the components singly and then expecting you to put the pieces together.And believe me, there are some <i>hard</i> puzzles in there. They make logical sense when you figure them out-- more than once, I found myself saying aloud, ""Oh, that's clever!"" -- but there were a few where I must have spent ten or fifteen minutes trying different things before the obvious-in-retrospect solution came to mind.It's not a fast-paced game: you can always take a leisurely look at the puzzles to see what you have to do, and there are only a couple where twitch movement is even at all necessary. Good timing is often important (learn to switch times mid-jump) but the game is overall pretty forgiving. You have unlimited lives and you always respawn at a convenient spot when you inevitably fall to your death (or fall into toxic waste, or die to a sawblade, or drown...). The closest thing to a fly in the ointment in that respect is the fact that the game only saves at chapter breaks. Chapters are short enough that I can't complain, but I don't recommend quitting out mid-level after just finishing a tricky puzzle.The game is fully voice-acted, which was a pleasant surprise. Of particular note is Nicki Rapp voicing the snail: recently she's been in Broken Age as Dead Eye Courtney, and Walking Dead as Lilly (and let's never forget Psychonauts, of course). The inventor is played by Brett Dunnelly, who gives him a pleasantly crotchety character. The background music is thoroughly pleasant, providing an excellent enhancement to the game, easily manipulating tension. It's well worth picking up right on its own.The graphics-- well, they hardly need mention, but that's not because of anything bad to them! The cartoony art is downright gorgeous both still and in motion, and the attention to detail is wonderful. I'll gladly hand in a few points of gamer cred to admit that when I saw that when the snail backs up, the little red lights on her shell flash, I squealed like a little girl. Osao definitely went the whole nine yards here, even in places where they could have cut corners. Before and After are never identical-- After's ruined world skews broken supports, twists platforms, grows every tree. The game is outright beautiful.The story is, for its part, a bit unremarkable. I don't honestly mind that-- it goes well with the cartoonish art style, and it's quite well-told. I can't call it light-hearted, given that it starts with an apocalypse, but it's consistently upbeat. The story respects itself well enough to be played straight-- it's never smug or condescending. No, instead it's a perfectly servicable children's story, and there's a lot of charm to it.The game itself is a bit on the short side, but it knows to get out while the going's good. While I think another level or two wouldn't have hurt the game, it never wears out its welcome.(Review also available at http://www.gamesxtreme.com/article/4102/chronology-review/ , transcribed here with permission)			"

												Please note that I'm writing the following critique from a stand point of an adult who's quite used to puzzle platformers. I can see how this game would be appealing to a younger audience or those new to the genre.Except for the length. This is a very short game and I was able to beat it in less than 2 hours.This game feels heavily underdevelopped. The time travel and time stopping mechanics are interesting, but very little is actually done with them. There are only two time periods that you can jump between (not too bad, but I've seen better) and very rarely did the actual passing of time between them come to play. More often than not, you might as well have been jumping between parallel universes or something along those lines.The time stopping is also rarely utilized and with a handful of exeptions, usually to make stationary things that could have been stationary to begin with. Altough, looking back, I think I also missed a few opportunities to use this ability to make the timed platforming easier. Overall, I found that I mostly forgot about this ability and when it came to the puzzles, it was one of the last things I tried applying, unless the need was obvious.Overall, the concepts in this game had potential. But I don't feel like they were fully realized. I was missing more inteplay between different mechanics and elements in the game. More use of the time travel aspect of this game about time travel. More mixing different mechanics in with the platforming.			"

												Nice graphics. Decent gameplay. Mediocre plot. I accidently trapped myself twice by jumping into an area that I assume was supposed to be inaccesible.Mostly puzzle based platforming until the last level and then it switches to skill based. The game feels like a long tutorial especially since it took only about 2 hours to finish.Main reason I wrote this review is to point out how horrible the protaganist is. He is mean to the snail constantly even though the snail saves his life multiple times. Also, to progress at one point I was forced to cripple a child for life in order to steal his cane as an adult in order to grab a hook that was out of reach. The old guy I steal it from even has his entire life perspective changed as a result. Before breaking the kid's leg, his adult self was grateful for the home and his life. After, he blamed the house for a miserable life. I actually tried to find an alternate solution because I felt so terrible.TLDR: Pretty, short, and I didnt understand the moral of the story.			"

												It's as timey wimey as it gets. My favorite part of this little game is when I break old geezer's leg in his childhood. Meh, he's a minor character anyway and sacrifice was needed in order to save the world. I can't help but compare Chronology to The Silent Age (another timey wimey game), and in my mind a game like that shouldn't be too easy like The Silent Age. Chronology has everything: good puzzles, rememberable characters, sacrfices, anti-hero and a deadbeat villain.			"

												This game feels like it was probably rushed  to be finished.  It's not bad, and for younger players this will be awesome.  I think I expected more from the cool concept of stopping time and traveling through time - again probably a product of rushed timelines or lack of imagination. ProsGreat conceptArt was pretty fun to look at and most of the time very well doneLoved the cannon exit door puzzle (needed more like that)ConsCharacter/Story Design very one-dimension (give your characters real names for pete sake! The ending was real lack laster - the disappointing payoff spurred me to write this review.)Bland Puzzles (i think some were entertaining, but none went too far past simple platforming and bring this object back in time.)Controls a bit awkward on PC. (I dont understand why the menu screens pull up so slow)If you're looking for something as clever as Braid, this is not it, but it'll hold your attention for a few hours.Recommend for Kids YES. Recommend for everyone else - eh maybe hold off til this goes on sale.   "

												A nice game with overall good puzzles thats definitely much too short for my taste. You can rush through it in about 2 hours and i think 10 bucks is a bit much for that.The graphics is really well made, especially throughout the switching worlds. The story is not bad but could have used more than only three characters. Especially with the time travel ideas i think they could have done a lot more. I can only remember one occation where it really felt you had made an impact on a person - and even felt kinda bad for it. I would have loved if they had put in more of that but the story is pretty short and doesn't have any twists or turns.So overall - nice puzzle platformer which could have done more "

												Almost everything about Chronology is fun. The voice acting isn’t over abundant, but it is solid. The music sets a decent mood while not being over bearing. The mechanics of the game are funky in the beginning, but you can get used to them. The puzzles and platforming give quite a challenge while not making you want to ram a keyboard through your monitor. All of this is welcome, but that just makes it all the more sad when the game comes to an end. It gave me a few hours of play with a great and satisfying story. I just wanted more. I guess that’s really my only complaint is that I wasn’t ready for Chronology to be over when it was. If they were to create a full scale game based off of this, I would pick that up in a heartbeat.Full Review: TheVideogameBacklog.comChronology is a pleasant way to spend a lazy afternoon or three. The stew of world-morphing, co-op characters, time-freezing, delayed device effects, and character-as-platform give a lot of grist to the puzzle-making designers, and the light platforming keeps the experience from being a snooze. But bring a controller.Full 2nd Opinion Review: TheVideogameBacklog.com "

												First off, let me say, while I overall recommend this game, the only reason I wouldn't recommend it... it's too short. I finished it in about 2-2.5 hours, and that was with some futzing around trying to solve puzzles. If the length of the game is enough to deter you, then I'd let this one pass. Otherwise, read on...The game is a platforming puzzle game that mimics the artwork and feel of Teslagrad, Vessel, and Limbo, but with the mechanics of something like Braid. You are an old man who wakes up in a strange place and need to figure out where you are. He discovers his lost timepiece and with it, the ability to control time. You use the device to travel between past and future, altering the world in ways that allow you to overcome puzzles and advance to new areas. You can interact with certain objects in the environment, carry them with you between worlds, and use them in the past to influence the future, etc.This is inherently the difficulty in the game: figuring out how to manipulate the past to affect the future, etc.About a third of the way in, you meet a snail companion, who also has an uncanny ability; he can stop time. Together, you must use your powers to help the other succeed.The puzzles are clever and challenging, but nothing that will keep you too stumped. The platforming is ok, and sometimes it's a bit frustrating, but it's nothing that's too unforgiving or would make you want to put it down.The music is pretty good and fits well with the game ambience.If you don't mind a short game that's more pleasing with the visuals and music, then this one is worth a go. I might suggest waiting for the price to come down, but <$10 isn't too bad.			"

While I don't take that as a negative please note that. I enjoyed Rayman a lot which may have similar auidence I found this too childish.- The puzzles are not always very logical especially given the target auidence, platforming is straightforward and linear- Graphics are very good and animation is what you would expect for an artsy game- Story is decent for the short time game has to offerIf you are looking for a game for your kid then this might be a good choice.

												This is a really nice game, it's currently (time of writing) on offer as part of a bundle for £3.01, it's worth it. The game is short around 3 hrs and I finished the game, take in to account I stopped halfway to make food/drink etc so this could easily be done in 2hrs. The game has a nice story, loved the main character but the snail got a little annoying. The puzzles are a bit on the easy side. The game uses a similar mechanic to Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams, instead of swiching between dream worlds  you switch between the past and the present, you also have the ability to pause time.My main gripe is that the game had a few bugs some objects would disappear when being carried, to get past the load screens I had to tab out and tab back in, dialogue would sometimes repeat.If you can get passed the few gripes I have it's worth a try. I got this game as part of the jingle jam2016.			"

												     'Chronoglogy' is quite a gem. An expertly crafted platformer, the game boasts a beautiful art style to complement its sharp gameplay. The story is simple, but effective. An unnamed, elderly inventor is determined to find his shady mentor after one of the pair's contraptions causes apocalyptic destruction. Along the way, the inventor encounters a friendly snail with the ability to freeze time. Combined with the old man's penchant for traveling from past to present, the slimy companion introduces a unique gameplay structure.     The player alternates between the two characters in order to solve brilliantly designed puzzles oriented around manipulating time in order to alter the landscape and circumvent obstacles. The snail's shell serves as a movable platform that can be used to cross gaps, sawblades can be halted in mid-air, and impassible walls in the past become ruined structures in the present. Switching time periods in the middle of a jump can turn certain doom into a saving ledge or platform. These basic mechanis build and combine in interesting and challenging ways as the levles progress. One particularly creative head scratcher involves multiple time switches, an anvil, and flaming cannonballs, all to simply open a door.      The game's visual design is superb. Colorful character models and environments seem to pop off the screen. The bright wimsy of ""before"" transforms into the dark, dilapidated melancholy of ""after."" The contrast underscores the narrative's focus on regret and the consequences of terrible decisions. Puzzle construction also reinforces this relationship. In one of the game's shining moments, a decision made concerning a young child in the past has subtly profound implications in the present.      While the time spent in ""Chronology's"" world is welcome, it does not last forever. The entire experience can be completed in around 2.5-3 hours, leaving the player with a distinct-- and regrettably brief--brush with greatness. Osao Games should be commended for this effort, a game that merges artistic integrity and ambition with incredibly enjoyable platforming mechanics. Warning: ""Chronolology"" also contains blatant disregard for the laws of the space-time continuum.      Score: 9/10  "

												Pretty short, casual puzzle-platformer. With time control, of course, but that's nothing new. Chronology oozes charm, from its quite pretty, hand drawn levels to its spritely music and just twee enough to be fun and not annoying voice acting. The writing is nothing to brag about, I even feel it misses a chance to pull a good timey wimey twist right near the end. Spoiler:  Wouldn't it have been a gas if that kid whose leg you break turns out to be the Mentor/Villain from the future? Where the game really shines is the individual mechanics of the two characters you play, (The Inventor and The Snail) who both control time in different ways. Going through the puzzles seeing the interesting ways their mechanics interact and fit perfectly into one another is what sells the game for me. Of course, being as short as it is, it feels like the game doesn't push that to its full potential. But definitely this game is worth picking up, especially if you like 2D platformers but can't keep up with the extreme difficulty that has become the fad with the revival of the genre.			"

												As much as I liked this game, I have to say I am really disappointed by its length. Took me 2 hours to finish it and that's pretty much all there is to it, as there's no replayability whatsoever.Also, one of the puzzles requires you to cripple a kid/man for life. I know that this is a video game and the characters are fictional, but seriously? That's pretty mean for a protagonist who's trying to save the world from destruction, if you asked me.Still, Chronology is a solid and colorful platformer with a clever use of the time traveling concept. While controlling the snail, you can also stop time, but I honestly feel it's not used much throughout the game.I will recommend this game, but I'm not sure about its price tag. It's not that 4,99€ is a lot of money; it's just that I've played many similar puzzle/platformer games with the same price tag that took me a lot longer to finish. Maybe get it while on a discount.

												Full review: http://www.canadiangamer.net/2014/05/12/chronology-review/Chronology offers some interesting mechanics with it's two different playable characters and it's time manipulation. It's sad to see these not being used in very many intriguing ways though, as most of the challenges seems to be simple challenges, solving mild inconveniences in your path towards the right side of the screen. It does shine at times when it slows down to present you with one of its more inspired puzzles, requiring you to use your full arsenal of time-controlling powers. The world is made more interesting by its wonderful art style and lovely music, making progression through it's short 2-3 hours a joy for eyes and ears. I only wished my brain felt as stimulated afterwards.			"

It felt great playing as a little old engineer and his snail buddy.It's short and sweet.Also it has a nice soundtrack.I liked the switching between two times deal and the snail being able to stop time.I thought I was never get that old lady off the phone.I recommend this game if you like puzzle platformers.

												The game is short, but the gimmick runs long.   Great concept, great atmosphere, pretty good gameplay, story exists I guess.  No real motivation to play more than once.  If the game was any more expensive I wouldn't recommend it, but it's all together in a nifty package were everything seems satisfying, so: props.Look at the screenshots, don't over hype it, if you like what you see you'll probably enjoy this small excerpt of a game.

												Chronology was a fun experience, but a little lacking.  It's definitely worth a playthrough, and I would recommend it, but I'll try to keep my thoughts concise enough to be helpful.Pros:-Interesting gameplay concept.  I had a lot of fun just conceptually with the idea of not only switching between two versions of the levels, but more importantly controlling the two characters in tandem.  It was a lot of fun, and the game's strongest point.-The game, while in a level, feels extremely responsive and well crafted.  Switching between the Old Inventor and the Snail is very fast, as is changing the time period.  Moving around and platforming feels good, rewarding and all around pleasant.  While there are a few quirks here and there, they're to be expected, and overall I think the dev team did a wonderful job making sure the play experience during levels was enjoyable.-Every one of the game's backgrounds is a delight to look at.  The art is cartoony, and fits the feel of the game extremely well.  The music, as well, made my playthrough immersive and pleasant.  I'd very much recommend dropping the $3 on the OST.Cons:-Length:  The game, to be honest, felt really just too short.  The length of the levels would be fine, but the difficulty was a far cry from... well, difficult.  Admittedly subjective, but as someone who isn't that great at puzzle games, I breezed through this one almost without stopping.  I was stumped for a very brief moment on one or two parts, but otherwise it was more about the experience of playing the game, rather than solving any puzzles.-Out-of-gameplay experience:  While the actual platforming and game mechanics felt amazing, the rest of the game left much to be desired.  With no ability to skip cutscenes, replaying the game feels needlessly cumbersome.  The inability to set custom controls was harshly felt, as by default my controller defauled to using the top face button for jump.  I had to go into my controller's settings and re-map the buttons to match up with hte game's control scheme, and that was not appreciated.  There was also no option to change the resolution of the game, only toggle between fullscreen and windowed  It is possible to resize the window, but it would still be appreciated, having defaults in the menu that resize it to maintain window ratio for recording or just comfort purposesFinal Thoughts/Summary:  Chronology is a fun, interesting title, albeit on the easy and short side, with a cute story and a lot to offer aesthetically.  Mandatory cutscenes and no custom control mapping curbed my appetite for replaying the game, but I would still recommend it for a single playthrough.  At a $10 pricetag, ($8 early sale at the time) however, and most of my on record gameplay time coming from leaving the game running while afk, I wouldn't recommend picking it up unless it greatly interests you.  If a future update were to fix the issues, however, I would love replaying the stages and finding little quirks in the gameplay.			"

												This is a mediocre (bordering to awful) puzzle game, that looks great but have game breaking flaws and nothing special gameplaywise. There are one or two pretty clever puzzles in the game but apart from that the rest is pretty much just reusing the two most overused core mechanics from puzzle platformers (stop time and swap between worlds), and they have both been used in much better games before. The devs must also have realized that the snail would break some puzzle solutions and therefore they sometimes arbitrarly don't alow you to call her to you. It's also very short. I finished it at 1,8 hours acording to steam and it would have been shorter had it not been for the fact that you can permanently get stuck in a chapter and since there are no mid chapter checkpoints, you can have to replay the entire chapter again. I would guess you would finish it in about 90 minutes in a blind playthrough. Yes the chapters are very short but you shouldn't force the player to replay the entire chapter if they quit mid chapter (did this once) or if something with the game phyiscs breaks (this happend two times). But the worst of theese where when you give away your timeswapper just before the final confrontation (because reasons...) in the end of the 7th chapter, if you are in the wrong world (the current timeline) you are permanently stuck since you can't interact with anything and the platforms that you move forward with does not excist in this timeline. This is just incompetent game design, even for a 5€ game.There are so many better games in this genre. Stay away from this tat.			"

												I don't write reviews quite often but I need to write some of my remarks on why I abandon playing this game for this game lacks common sense. -Spoiler warning- I liked the first parts, cool graphics etc. But when I reach to the city, it was a terrible experience, I thought old whimsical adventure games came back to haunt me again. The part that you want to get a ticket to ride the elevator is a complete bullcrap. This game is a good example of needing talent to create story driven puzzle games. Nonsensical puzzles are far more frustrating that any bugs you can encounter within any game. Anyway I am going to give this a thumbs up but not that I liked the game but for the efforts they put into creating it.			"

												Chronology doesn't seem to know what it wants to be, or how to go about expressing whatever it eventually decides on.It's a puzzle platformer in appearance, but more akin to a point and click adventure game in structure. Time manipulation is introduced as the driving mechanic but then barely used in any interesting way, or completely forgotten for more tired adventure and platforming standards. There's this setup to an involving time travel narrative that's rather quickly exchanged for the dull relationship building between your character and a talking snail that does little but demonstrate that you're kind of a jerk.All of Chronology's best ideas are left on the wayside for an experience that feels painfully typical. Puzzles are bland and extremely simple in construction, only ever becoming difficult do to the finicky interaction icon that makes it hard to discern what exactly you need to interact with, or the backgrounds which while beautiful tend to be hard to make out from objects in the foreground. Progression always felt tedious, puzzles slowing me down but providing no satisfaction to solve beyond the knowledge I'd never have to sluggishly make my way through them again.There was a point when Chronology seemed promising, but it flounders around with its direction so long as to never feel cohesive or engaging. Its mechanics are disorganized, poorly implemented and rudimentary, and its narrative may as well not exist for as little substance as it has. The artwork is wonderful, but animations are choppy and the lack of vsync made for omnipresent screen tearing. It feels like a game formed in a puzzle platformer mold, with a handful of modifications having been made to differentiate it from the pack that probably did more harm than good in the long run.			"

												Not a bad game, and certainly better than most of the puzzle platformers I've played recently (looking at you Logigun and Gateways). It it super short, only about 2 hours. The art and music are nice. I honestly couldn't tell you what the story was about, as it was pretty bare-bones, not captivating, and didn't make much sense. The voices of the characters are not fitting, especially the snail, which sounds like an 5 year old boy for some reason. There are multiple bugs. Items you have to use get stuck on your snail and you cannot pick them back up, making progressing impossible. This problem is furthered by the fact that there are no save points, if you quit the level you have to do the entire thing over. Luckily levels arent that long. Another big is sometimes things that should be interactable aren't, leaving you to spend some time switching time and hoping that it fixes itself. The other biggest problem is with puzzles. While many are cool and intuitive and make nice use of mechanics, some make no sense. Most of the time it's because you didn't know that object that looked to be part of the background was interactable. In one instance you're supposed to know that a light in the background can be jumped next to and that causes it to be knocked down, even though that's never happened before in the game, and there are other similar looking lights in the room but one is just usable for no reason. Usually when I looked up solutions I thought ""well how was I supposed to know I could use that, or that it would do that to that object, that has never happened earlier in the game and that's not reall reasonable"", or ""that looks like the background"". Also the platforming isn't that great, as your guy moves super slowly and jumping feels like he has lead weights tied around both ankles. Most of the jumps you have to make take multiple tries and you may just BARELY make one time even though you were standing on the very end of the ledge, and you just barely landed only half way on the other ledge. All in all its a cute fun little game. Wish the puzzles made more sense or were more obvious that what you had to do was even an option. 6.5/10.			"

												I'm into puzzle platformers and the truth is I got disappointed by this one.First, it's a very short  game, it takes 2-3 hours to finish everything and it has not really challenging puzzles. It's very linear too, so you better not get stuck somewhere because you are forced to progress solving one puzzle after another.Second, it has a few action-platformer and adventure elements but doesn't succeed at these either as they are developed/presented in a very simple way and are not original at all.Finally, although I felt it had potential at first, the game mechanics turn out to be too simple to create complex and interesting puzzles and probably that's why they ended up with this short and easy game. Anyway, I believe they could have made better puzzles.Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad game and it's even entertainig, but for a similar price there are way better and more interesting puzzle platformers out there such as Teslagrad, The Swapper, Braid, Limbo or Blocks That Matter.

												Although really brief, this was a surprisingly well done puzzle platformer.  It only takes about 90 minutes to play through; but the hand-drawn looking art style and time mechanic really make things interesting.  I did find the snails voice to be somewhat irritating; but thankfully she didn't talk too much.			"

												The first four of eight chapters have no challenging puzzles at all, it took me less than an hour to get through them. Starting on chapter five the puzzles became a tiny bit more challenging, but mostly because of the somewhat clumsy interface. I only got stuck once, in chapter six, but that was because I missed a location where I could use an item.It was also in chapter six that the game started crashing on me several times. The worst sort of crashes that completely lock up your computer. I haven't had that happen in a game on Steam for a long time. No big loss the game wasn't enjoyable so I didn't miss much.			"

												Chronology is about a man who wishes to correct his mistake of ignoring the fact his mentor took control of an item they have both worked on. Your goal is to go and fix your mistake by going through the present and the past and solving puzzles to stop him. Even though Chronology is extremely short, I enjoyed it. It felt like a childs story book. The art and music for Chronology is really wonderful and fits with the theme of time. I would assume this game is built towards a younger audience because of it's simple puzzles and puns, which is fine. I'm not sure if it's worth $10, but hopefully the developers will add more.. (Even though they havent done anything since launch other than patch a few things to actually make the game beatable).			"

												This is a short but very exceptionally polished platform/puzzle game. You are an inventor whose mentor has destroyed the world, and it's up to you, your watch that allows you to flip between two times, and your friendly snail (?) to put things to right.  The game took under two hours to finish, and there's no replay value, but the experience is very well done. The story works, the artwork is beautiful, and the puzzles are just on the right edge of challenging (I had to get help to solve one, and it was because I missed a game cue that should have tipped me off). Definitely a good choice for anyone who wants to stretch their brain a little bit and enjoys colorful imaginative worlds.			"

												Chronology is a clever puzzle-solving platformer. The developers included several different mechanics which gave them the ability to vary the puzzles quite a bit. There isn't a lot of re-hashing the same puzzles over and over, but a good amount of diversity, which I quite liked, while still maintaining a sense on continuity. The story was interesting, but certainly not the strongest point of this game. The mechanics were good for the most part, although the jumping seemed a little clunky to me, but certainly not a game breaker. The graphics are charming and well-done. The whole game felt a little short, but it was definitely a good experience. I'd recommend this game if you're into solving puzzles, and some mild platforming. Chronology earns a 4 out of 5 stars on my scale.			"

												For its small price (got it for 2 euros or something) this game is well worth buying. It's nothing groundbreaking, even though it offers a unique time-travel based mechanics (more like just two parallel 2D worlds between which you jump to solve puzzles, oh, and you can stop time). It's pretty close to Braid, Limbo, Fez, Swapper and many other indie puzzle platformers where basically every next puzzle is a scripted thing which you just need to figure out.I think it took me an evening to complete it (dunno why it shows I only played it only for 2 hours).. The artwork is good, music too, the puzzles are interesting. As with most puzzle games, after the game is completed, there is nothing to come back to - so well, no replay value, but for the small price it's fine.SPOLIERS AHEADI found 2 bugs and had to restart chapters 2 and 7 cuz I was stuck. Namely, in chapter 2 the plant for some reason wouldn't grow in the future after I planted it - the bug wasn't there the next time I restarted the chapter. In chapter 7 the cannon puzzle got completely broken for me. Namely, every vertical shot would result in a cannon loaded with a fireball, even though the fire wasn't running between the tubes - I guess this happened after I put a few balls on fire and shot them. Also, the water wouldn't extinguish the fire on the door after I shot 2 balls on fire at the door in a row. You can imagine that such bugs are especially nasty when you don't know how to solve the puzzle on the first playthru and still experiment with things to kind of ""brute-force"" solve it - only to find out that the puzzle is bugged. And no save feature - had to redo the whole chapter 7 once again and watch a walkthru - and it worked. Was also stuck with the phone puzzle in chapter 6 until I just watched a walkthru for that piece - didn't guess you can reach the lamp in a jump.Anyway, a good game, 7/10.I hope this will be one of the last games in this row of indie platformers cuz frankly I think people are pretty much bored with all of them by now, much like by 2002 everyone was bored with the RTS genre.PS. Oh btw that puzzle where the kid breaks his leg and walks with a stick in the future - uhm, dunno it felt inappropriate somehow..			"

												Chronology is a short puzzle platformer with an emphasis on short and puzzle. At times it feels more like a point and click adventure than a platformer, in fact the only time i got stuck in the game was in one of the ""point and clicky parts"" with the  toothache plant. Despite getting stuck for 20 minutes I finished the game in just a little over an hour.The controls are fine, although they could be improved. In some of the puzzles you have to switch between the characters and use their special time manipulating abilites, it would be nice if you could control the snail and the inventor at the same time or at least use 2 different buttons for their abilites.The story is told as you solve the puzzles and is really straightforward, the game seems suitable for children.Overall it was a short but nice little experience.

												Being a lover of Platformers, Time Travel, and Indie games, I knew that I had to pick this one up when I finally discovered it.It's a simple platform game but the puzzles involved make very challenging at times.I have to say what I loved the most about this game was the art. I found it beautiful and I loved how detailed everything is for a 2d game. The soundtrack was a nice background to the whole game. I really liked the song they used during the credits. I think the only downside to this game is how short it is. I would have loved to continue playing, I had a lot of fun and there were quite a few chuckles to be had over the commentary between the two characters. All in all it's a decent price but if you can get it on sale like I did, then it is a game I highly recommend you pick up.			"

												A reluctant thumbs up, mostly because of the low price tag.I won't lie: the levels were pretty darn good: a 2-layered level design ('past' and 'future') where puzzle solving is central. When the snail comes in, you also get the ability to stop time. And those mechanics work well together (sort of like Lost vikings, but by far not as advanced). On top of that, it has beautiful graphics and sounds, so what more could you ask for...right?Unfortunately, the game runs out of steam as it goes on. By the time you descend into metropolis, the puzzles lower in quality to an average point 'n click game, and almost suddenly it becomes nothing but basic platforming until the end. As said by others: it's short. That wouldn't be that bad (short games can be good too), but the storyline and boss battle seem to just be there because the developer ran out of money and/or ideas. Certainly compared to the intro, it's an anticlimax. :-(Again: for five bucks, you can't expect miracles. And I certainly had fun with it. Just...know that the quality of the introduction won't last long...			"

												A fun and relatively short puzzle game.Pros:Pretty, fun, appropriate background music -- the only exception is the song during the end credits which is, quite frankly, awful. It doesn't fit the game at all.It's fun to control both the old man and the snail.Switching back and forth between the present and the future adds an extra element of thoughtfulness in regards to completing the puzzles.The puzzles are somewhat complex, but not frustratingly so.Cons:The loading screen that occurs between each level takes 2-3 minutes to load. While this doesn't seem that bad, actually sitting through those 2-3 minutes multiple times becomes very tedious. It's not even that graphics-heavy of a game; I can't guess why these sort levels take so long to load.The ending is very anticlimactic. In fact, the last level is the shortest one of all. SPOILERS AHEAD SPOILERS AHEAD And you don't even beat the mentor/boss yourself. The snail comes in and saves the day (by itself, not from you controlling it).			"

												I got this game as a part of a Humble Bundle. The game looked enough like the sort of retro platformer I would like, and in that aspect, it did not at all disappoint. It is a short game and even if you are really slow in figuring out all puzzles (only two or three of which are really challenging) it would not last beyond 10 hours. I completed the game in a shade under 4hrs.The only gripe I have with this game is that that there is no save in between the levels. If you exit the game somewhere in between, you will have to replay it from the last checkpoint. While it is not always a problem, some puzzles which require timing to see you through can pose problems if you have to redo them. Barring that one minor and entirely forgiveable flaw, I thoroughly enjoyed the game and how the time bending / stalling mechanics have been used to create puzzles.The art is colourful, lively, and relaxing.Is the game worth the asking price? Definitely!			"

												A somewhat dated platformer. But charming enough... Less than a couple of hours in total. Worth a buck or two, no more.			"

												A cute little game about an old man and his snail. Not exactly the most challenging, but an interesting concept and I really like the soundtrack. Quite short, but a great way to unwind for a couple of hours.			"
