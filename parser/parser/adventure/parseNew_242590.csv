												This is where you can create your SR4 characters / clothing, put it in the SR4 official site and download it back in game (Pre- launch function)No Cons this time , since it is Free and was a cool free software before the SR4 launch back in Aug 2013.*Can still use now if anyone want though			"

												Even though this is marketed as something akin to a demo for SRIV, Inauguration Station is still VERY useful for people who own the full game.  Why?  Even after owning the full game, it is the easiest and most straight-forward way to modify your character's appearance and clothing.No more bouncing from random shop to random shop looking for a specific piece of clothing to purchase and unlock.  Have an idea for how you want to tweak your appearance, but not sure if it'll come out looking okay?  Use this tool and see, rather than spending 500 credits in-game.This tool DOES require you have an account at the official Saints Row site in order to save what you make, but registering is free and easy.  Definitely worth your time.  If you have SRIV, you should install this too.			"

												this is the pre saints row 4 release that let you make your character to be ready for the games release. Now with all the reviews that are downrating because the community features were down ignore them because of 9/30/15 they have had the servers up and running. The perks of using this instead of making your character in game is that you can get 1 outfit of clothes for free, and some clothes in the inauguration station are not availible for purchase in the game.

												The Saints Row IV: Inauguration Station is like the Presidential version of SR3's Initiation Station. What I mean by that is you can create your own character (who happens to be the President of the United States of America!) before you play the game (SR4) itself! Amazing! New clothes, and features, like the voice of Nolan North (Deadpool) and Voice Pitch. The only con of the Inaug. Station and SR4, in my opinion, would be the fact that Planet Saints was renamed Planet Zin because of Zinyak temporarily taking over- the world, I guess? But I suppose I shouldn't let a minor detail like a store being renamed ruin the experience. If you don't have Saints Row IV, or you do, but you want to create your character first, then I would recommend the Inauguration Station.			"

												There's not much to say: It's not really a demo, it's a character creator for SR IV.While it works the very same as the in-game thing does, this is actually everything - IAD, tattoo shop and all available clothing - in one place. So you see, it's pretty useful if you don't feel like running around the city looking for shops and cache.Apart from being able to use pretty much every piece of clothing in the game (even some you can't buy in-game at all - Presidential top) and saving cache, the huge advantage here is you can create your character(s) in advance, so you don't have to bother when you start playing (in co-op it gets long and boring when one of you is trying to get their character right). I myself recreated (more like downloaded and edited) my favorite models from SR III, so now they are ready for more adventures.In short: Very useful, I recommend.			"

												I quite liked Saints row 4 inaugration station, being avle to play around with your character. It is actually very interesting to see how very ugly you can make your character. I quite liked running around without a shirt on with loads of tatoos on. There are many different items of clothing, tatoos, and options for your body, but there isn't nearly as much character modification than there is in Saints row 2, Saints row 2 had no format to what your character had to look vaguely like, but in Saints row the third and 4 there have been character formats and you could only change it, still quite largely, but not as much as in Saints row 2. Overall, I wuld certainly recommend Saints row 4 Inaugration station, because it is a method( that doesn't include cheating) of changing your character's appearance if you don't like it. You can also share your characters with the steam community-and others, of course- so others can use your characters if you think they are very good. :)			"

												it seems weird for me to write a review for what should be a demo, but I have to admit that I have put almost as many hours into this as I have the actual Saints Row IV game. The reason for this is because I like making VGCW characters in saints row, because I am a huge nerd. That being said, what the ♥♥♥♥, game? Why are there clothing options in the Inauguration Station that aren't in the full game? Why are you so bad at this Voliton? I made a kick♥♥♥♥♥Bowser, but you guys took out the apocolypse armor so now he looks like some fat yellow doofus. Unfortunately, you can't really push the limits of the character creator in this game as much as I'd like because it has to fit into the actual models of cutscenes, but I feel like the clothing customization is lacking. I at least wish I could make my own tattoos or patterns. shrug. it is kind of funny to use what little is available and make something so stupid.			"

This is apparently not possible. I have tried several times to register and failed due to server errors. I found numerous forum threads from people who could not access the community. They were unable to upload their character and were thus unable to receive the achievement for same.

												I was interested in purchasing this game, after downloading this ""demo"" it was pretty frustrating to not be able to successfully create and link to an account.  Even going onto saintsrow.com to create an account still wouldn't allow me to access said account in this tool.  Unfortunate.Character building looks cool, but there's some obvious backend issues that will keep me from purchasing this game.			"

												Same as the SR3 Station, allows to create a character for the game, or import your SR3 character (you need to have an account created on internet's site dedicated to the game, to manage multiple characters online), or even see the characters created by the community and put online. You can eventually download them to play with.			"

												This game sucks.  Jokes are lame and dirty. Missions are very point A point B ish.  The graphics are sub par.  If you're someone who laughs at evening sitcoms, you might get a laugh or two.			"

												Do not waste your time downloading this ""demo.""     You will not be able to do anything besides look at tatoos you can place on your character. You cannot do any gaming or even see how the game works. Thumbs down with extreme prejudice			"

												This is not a demo. This is a trailer. The only gameplay it offered was the character customization setup, which has been severely cut down on since the second game. Admittedly, it made me very enthused for the game, but I am left incredibly disappointed by this ""demo.""			"

												It is described as a demo on SR IV site, it is not. It is a character creator. You can't enter the game. That said it is even useless as that, because as I found out, the online service for upload-download is offline and was promised to be working again...a year ago. This behavior doesn't reflect a good company and because of that I skipped to buy SR III or IV when it was on discount. Their forum has many disgruntled costumers who already bought the game. I chose to skip to enter their club and I advice to you too as long they can't decide what to do with the online service.			"

												Saints Row IV: Inaguration Station is a character creator similar to the Saints Row the Third's Instalation Station. What you do is create characters for the up comming, Saints Row IV. Just like the Instalation Station, you can make characters, change their clothes, add tatoos, and upload for all of your friends to see. It's pretty much the same loadout, except Planet Saints, is now Planet Zin. The one change I noticed (other than the clothes and possibly tatoos) is they changed the zombie voice with another. And now, you can change the pitch of your voice to make it more deep or a f*ckin chimpmunk. I have 2 characters already up on the website (the Red Sniper and Spy). go check them out at http://www.saintsrow.com/profile/MixMasterHeavy "

												When I imported my character from Saints Row the Third to Saints Row IV, there was the issue of said character being completely naked. By first importing the character into the Inauguration Station and using that save for Saints Row IV, I was able to overcome the aforementioned problem. Beyond that, the Inauguration Station is a great way to freely mess around with character designs.			"

												Lots of fun for messing around and making characters.However, for a while now the upload/download system has been broken so you likely won't be able to get characters from this into the main SR4 game (at least, not without writing everything down).			"
