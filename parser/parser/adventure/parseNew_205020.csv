  Introduction            	Lumino City is an amazing puzzle game with one of the coolest artsyles I have seen in a long time. The story follows Lumi as she goes to the city called “Lumino City” and tries to find her missing grandfather. The gameplay is similar to a typical point and click adventure and it’s not hard to get the hang of. Not only is the artstyle and soundtrack amazing, the puzzles in Lumino City are perfect, not too hard or too simple. You should be able to play Lumino City on really any PC. The only problem I had with Lumino City is that you cannot cancel an action once you started it. This got very annoying while misclicking, but this is a very minor complaint.  Pros                Great difficulty  Beautiful artstyle Easy to get the hang of Amazing soundtrack Great pacing Intriguing story Simple gameplay    Cons               Cannot cancel actions once started  No graphics/audio options      Conclusion                 	Lumino City is a beautiful point-n-click puzzle game, with an intriguing story and great difficulty. If you are looking for a really cool puzzle game that is not super easy, Lumino City is what you should get. This beautiful game is not all looks, the puzzles and story are amazing. The $20 is well worth it, and if you see this on sale, definitely pick it up.   Video Review

												This game is very hit and miss. It usually does things amazingly well, or very poorly, sometimes both at the same time. The best thing about this game is the art design. The world is very attractive, and you can tell that a lot of time and work has gone into making the world and puzzles. The manual you get is also very detailed and impressive.The worst thing about the game is the character movement. A lot of the time you don't know where you can and can't go, and even worse, when you click the wrong spot, it won't let you pick a new spot until you've arrived at the wrong spot. This along with the character's slow movement speed is a mild form of torture.The puzzles were very creative and some were quite rewarding. The downside is that some were simple and tedious, meaning that you would know exactly what to do, but it took a while to complete all the actions required to solve the puzzle. Others had somewhat arbitrary solutions. The gear puzzles were awful for this, because you could connect gears to turn the gear at the end, but it would have to be done in an exact way. There was no flexibility for multiple solutions. Worse yet, there were times where you had to add gears that did nothing at all. That's just pointless and it ruins the puzzle for people who have a brain and aren't solving it with a solution guide. The story and music were underwhelming. The plot without spoilers is that you play as a child fixing problems for adults who are too incompetent or lazy to fix them for themselves. I wanted to enjoy the game more, but it was just too tedious for the most part, and the fulfilling puzzles were too scarce.  "

Short version: 81%Lumino City is a game that instantly grabs the attention with its unique, imaginative art style. The price tag is undoubtedly steep, but it is attached to a rather long game with a plethora of surprisingly difficult puzzles.Long version:In 2011, a game called Lume awed its audience with its fun and creative art design, filmed entirely at a hand-made paper and cardboard house. It took years for to finally get a sequel, but a single glance tells why: the game takes place in an entire city now, crafted with even more detail. Just building this set probably took years, and it’s a marvel of architectural design and crafting.Great art style alone wouldn’t make a game though, as Lume painfully proved it. So we finally get a full-fledged puzzle adventure with a huge number of unique brain twisters. They share one fallacy of Lume, sadly: none of them are ever explained, so sometimes it is a task to figure out the basic mechanics before any attempt can be made at the solutions themselves.This problem is present in the levels too. There are no hot spots, so most of the game time is spent clicking frantically to finally find that one interactive pixel that holds the key of progress. Sure, this turns Lumino City into an old-school puzzle game that doesn’t hold the player’s hand, but it also makes game mechanics feel dated and frustrating, preventing us from fully immersing ourselves in the magical atmosphere of the scenery.

												I had the pleasure of playing this game at EGX and boy, It was not just my favourite indie game of the convention it was my favourite game of the convention. The art style is unique and incredible, the puzzles are frustrating yet insanely rewarding and enjoyable. I have looked forward to this game since august and boy was I right to be. So far it has lived up to all the hype I have given it and I haven't even completed it yet. Also the devs are really nice guys ;)			"

												This game is pure genius.Well, maybe not so literally, but it's up there. It's a point and click adventure/puzzle game where you play the role of Lumi who is off to find out where her Granddad ended up. Your trek begins at the entrance to *drumroll...* Lumino City and immediately starts of with a rather tame puzzle (graph theory majors need not apply).The game sports not too difficult of a challenge puzzle wise, but just enough to keep your brain sharp. It doesn't take long to figure out how to solve most of them, but even if you get stuck, your granddad was nice enough to leave you with a 1000 page handyman's guide, (which contains a whole lot of nonsense actually), but contains hints as to how to solve each puzzle, if you can decode what page number they are on. It's simple math formulas based on the puzzle you solve, but it's still pretty ingenious. ""Going to the book"" seems very 7th Guest style to me, so that's pretty neat.The soundtrack is amazing. It's not over the top as to be annoying, just well suited for the puzzle you're solving and the area you happen to be in. Some catchy stuff here.The visuals are awesome. Remember all those little carboard houses and things you used to make as a kid or would simply dream up and wish you had them? Well, albeit physically impossible, this game has brought a sort of quaint fantasy world that melds Pleasantville with Little Big Planet and managed to keep it from being hokey. It's almost like you're playing inside of a giant dollhouse, or something built out of tinker toys. The mixture of gadgets and propaganda you'd find in the 50's adds a nice touch.The gameplay is pretty simple: you point- you go. That's pretty much it. There's no (very little) backtracking, so if you can manage to get to a new area, chances are, you found all that you need. The game limits the backtracking you have to do by making past areas inaccessible once you move on- preventing you from moving on until you have everything. It's a little linear in that regard because it's not true to the adventure games of yore, when you could legitimately break your game by forgetting something in the beginning (which is a♥♥♥♥♥♥move we all secretly loved). The puzzles are difficult, but not so difficult you just give up and resort to cheating, which is refreshing.Give this game a try, you won't regret it.			"

 A highly creative and endearing puzzle game that has some minor issues. Lumino City is basically a game built upon clever and almost realistic puzzle problems. I say almost realistic because it grounds its puzzle logic in basic arithmetic and mechanical systems but still exagerating it for fantastical effect. Think of the logic in say a Rube Goldberg Machine. And that's what I love about this game. Fun yet challenging puzzle solving. Another striking thing about the game is the stop motion aesthetic and graphics. Lumino City is set in a mixture of exagerated 1950's tech but with a nice of touch of an English countryside town. While playing this, I've felt that charm and  grabbing wit of say the film, Toy Story. Good old wholesome aesthetic that really captures the imagination of why a community would be built around such strange and wonderful machinery. However the graphics ties in nicely with my biggest gripe with the game. It runs at locked 25 fps. I guess that's because they filmed the stop motion animations at something like that. And I'm fine with my AMD R9 290 chugging a pitiful 25fps if the game kept it at that. But during level transitions, cutscenes, and ordinary scenery object movement, it constantly halves it the framerate to like 12 fps. That's bad especially when you have a few puzzle dependent on precise point n' clicking. Which brings another gripe, input seems so vague. My guess is because the game was built as a mobile game instead of your average PC adventure game. I often miss clicked points of interest just because what you click is based on a general area and not the point you clicked. Think of touch screen input and the problems with that and you'll have an idea as to my problems with input in the game. Also, there is no resolution options, audio options, or any of that stuff in the game. Just defaults to your primary displays resolution. Again, a sign that they mostly built the game around mobile devices.But after all that I still love the game. The first game they made, Lume, was charming but a fleeting experience. And this one seems to have taken the charm, wit, and fun of the first one and just amplified it for a lasting effect. Sure, my completion time says this is a short game. Hey, a lot of adventure games are short so why would you expect this to be 200 hours long like a Civilization game or DOTA2. But that's beside the point. If your a fan of the genre you'd understand why adventure games have a different pace to them compared to other games.Oh, about the story of it. There's not much plot other than say the Lumino City's story. Your not going to be having exposition long cutscenes. You do talk to characters but mostly it's a one off thing. Characters are tied to the environment and scene they're in so you mostly won't see them again. But that doesn't really bother me because I realize that the story of Lumino City itself is a lot more engaging than the individuals you meet. Though they are interesting enough to reinforce that environmental story telling the game's got going for itself. So conclusion , I love it and I hope that if you've read this review I manage to inform you as to why I think it's a great game. Oh, and the soundtracks fantastic so get that soundtrack edition if you can.It seems to have not sold well. But I hope the developers, State of Play Games, manages to make another like it. If not a sequel but something as charming as this game with a little more attention to the pc version, then yeah that'll make me happy.			"

												Lumino City is the kind of game that when you look at it at first you think ""Woah, it looks really pretty!"" with how it uses real life objects and structures to its world, then going into the game and playing it, you find out that it's a really adorable puzzle game.To come clean first, I'm not a big puzzle guy, and I only legitimately finished half of the game with it's puzzles, and the rest of it I 'finished what I can' til the end, ehm.Obviously it's main attraction is its looks, and it actually does look really nice with its real life structures, and specially seeing it moving because of the characters interaction with it. The second attraction is its puzzles, with all of the them in each level starting easy and ending exceptionally hard, and how the those puzzles are connected in some way with the environment and its story. The last attraction is its exploration, its journey, and its simple small story.What I didn't like about the game is that there is no hint system in place, or it at least it wasn't made visible if there is one, for people like me that aren't so hardcore gamers in the puzzle genre. Another issue I found is, when you start an action like climbing stairs, or walking to another area, you cannot cancel that action, which isn't a big problem but I still found it a small nuisance nonetheless.Edit: Apparently there was a hint system. The hints are and spread around in a massive book you carry, explaining the puzzles you're stuck in, so that solves that issue. Guess the book was too overwhelming at first glance to notice there was hints in it.Overall Lumino City is a great puzzle adventure game with handcrafted passion that's to be admired, with puzzles to satisfy the puzzle loving gamers, but not so much for the casual crowd, and for the price it's going for, I'd personally go for 15 dollars, but I don't think the current price is bad either for what the game is.Shameless link[www.ksalue.com] to original post.

												I have finally gotten around to finishing this game!When it comes to me and point and clicks, I find it hard to play them continually until they are finished. I have nothing against the game in-particular in this aspect, I just often get stuck on a puzzle or part of the game very easily and end up taking lengthy breaks before working myself up to having another go. That happened a few times with this game and although it’s tedious for me and my feeble little brain, I actually consider it a good quality amongst puzzle games. The puzzles were interesting, challenging and at the most part, bar a few tedious ones for me (Morse code kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥, fun. I would say in terms of the point and click games I have played this has been one of the games with the best puzzles.In terms of a hint or help system, I couldn’t really figure out if there was one (Which I guess within itself says a lot). You’re given a “handy manual” but for the life of me, I couldn’t figure it out. Luckily for me, taking breaks between getting stuck was good enough for me. That said, most point and click games centralise around story. This game doesn’t. I felt that with this game the centre was most definitely the puzzles. There is still a story, and it’s not horrifyingly bad, but it is definitely not the spotlight component.The graphics and style to this game definitely come second in terms of importance to me. A lot of work was put into building this game and every time I came back to it I was no less impressed with how well it has been put together. The style is so unique and beautiful that it’s hard to not enjoy this game if only for that. The entire setting is warm, colourful and homely. All in all, it was a great game and I’m glad that this full length game was released, which helped to make up for it’s demo-lengthed predecessor “Lume”. The devs did a great job with this one, I look forward to any future games they release.TL;DR : Puzzles are interesting, challenging and fun. The story is slightly lacking, although not terrible, but that’s only because of the focus on the puzzles. The graphics, style and work put into this game is amazing and it’s a definite must-try for fans of the point and click genre.			"

★★☆☆☆I don't write this with pleasure since the look of the game is amazing, but I do not like this game. It's style over substance. Just for the overall look of the game, the actual gamePLAY has to suffer from it. Many times I got stuck, just to find out from a guide that in some room a item was obtainable. This was fine, if there was ANY indication that I could interact, let alone ♥♥♥♥ing SEE the thing, because yes, sometimes the object is almost hidden. A simple glitter or icon (that is sometimes used btw) could have made a huge difference. I don't have the patience of a 3 year old to click all over the screen just have a chance of progress.More than I liked to, I brought up the guide for the above reason. This game punishes you for that, apparantly, by crashing everytime I press SHIFT+TAB to open the steam overlay. Unacceptable.I don't mind the 720p-only resolution, I don't even mind the sometimes obscure puzzles, but the technical issues, hidden items, the horrible fond they use for the sometimes overly-lenghty, non-sense, unfunny dialogues just breaks the enjoyment for me. I can forgive the slow pacing of the game, because I imagine some people like that. Despite that, I do not appreciate this poorly made port of a game that is obviously meant for a tablet device. Playing a game shouldn't feel like a chore.Edit: just realized that the standard price is 20 bucks. If you're really eager to play this, wait for a drop to 2 or 4 bucks.			"

												Luminocity is an adventure game with an original artistic direction. The backgrounds are made of actual papercraft. Visually, there's nothing quite like it and it's a resounding success.Unfortunately, the puzzle design is much more mundane and the game progresses at a glacial pace, because of the incessant need to go back and forth, a fact made worse by the character's leisurely stride. It's also never quite clear what you can interact with and what is just part of the background.If you want a cute adventure game with original visuals, you're better off playing Samorost and its sequels.

												9/10, takes about 4 hours to complete.Most creative art style I've ever seen in a game, and possibly the cutest stories I've ever played. The puzzels range from fairly easy to VERY complicated, but the book is always there to help in times of need. Those leaving reviews about how difficult the puzzels are must not have realized that the book can be pulled out at any time, and if you can figure out which page to look at, you can find very helpful hints.The only thing that I didn't like about the game was the character movements - you don't control the character with the arrow keys or WASD, but instead you just click on whatever you want to interact with. Most of the time, there's no indication of where you're supposed to go or what you're supposed to touch, so it leaves a lot of decision making up to you. This can get frustrating at times, but you can always figure out where to go within a short amount of time, so it's not a huge deal.Overall, this game is incredibly adorable and definitely worth playing. It's worth noting that I bought this game via Humble Bundle, so rather than paying $20 for it, I paid somewhere around $1 for it. That being said, I think that the game is definitely worth $20, even though it only lasts a few hours.			"

												Sequel to Lume (not necessary to experience in order enjoy this title), Lumino City is a gorgeous point-and-click puzzler. The puzzles are truly diverse and range from very simple, to utterly devious, entirely logical to haphazard guesswork, gardening/maths/science/music/electronics/photography, a bit of everything inspired these puzzles. It's diverse to say the least, and possibly some of the best in I've ever come across in a point-and-click.Beside the puzzles, Lumino City has a cute story but uncomplicated story of a girl searching for her grandfather. The game looks absolutely gorgeous, yet requires no graphical power from your computer, as it was produced with one massive hand-crafted diorama which has then been captured on film.I have a few nitpicks, mainly the janky and sometimes unresponsive movement through the environment. The music is fairly dull. I also came across a glitch here and there which stopped me progressing, but the game has plenty of checkpoints accessible in the main menu.Please read my full review on the Noisy Bark blog: https://noisybark.squarespace.com/orix/2015/7/23/life-is-a-ferris-wheel-a-lumino-city-review "

												This game is very atmospheric and charming. The art style is amazing and the audio/music is too. The puzzles are (sometimes convoluted but mostly) decent and have a very tactile feeling to them.However it is frustrating to have to fight to get the game to do what I wanted it to. Expect input lag. Expect to misclick and have to wait upwards of 15 seconds to be able to do anything. Expect glichy areas where it takes upwards of 40 clicks just to get her to open the damned drawer. It took me forever to figure out why sometimes I couldn't open up my inventory. It's always hard to tell where exactly to click to get something done, making navigation difficult. At one point during the victory animation of a puzzle I clicked the back button to go progress in the game, but I apparently backed out too quickly and had to DO THE PUZZLE OVER. A brilliant game but you really have to fight with it.Other complaints include the fact that all of their generated graphics (characters, speech bubbles(?)) are noticibly uglier than the rest of the game. There are also a few graphical errors (teleporting birds, boats rocking on a loop that isn't quite complete and then jerking back to the start of the animation loop). Another thing is that they say it should take about 10 hours to complete, but I'd say this number should be closer to 5. It took me just over 5 hours and that included the time it took for me to search around online to try to find a way to progress (it turned out that I just had to keep clicking the same spot over and over until the game finally decided that I had clicked the hitbox I needed to click). Other than the frustration that comes with every minute of playing this game, it is a nice game and it does have interesting puzzle mechanics and a nice atmosphere. Wouldn't really recommend for the price.			"

												I never grew up playing point and click adventures game so naturally I don't carry any nostalgia for them.  I usually don't play too many of them because I personally find them quite difficult.  Many times puzzles require you make specific associations between different items or require you to find hidden details in the picturesque backgrounds.  Lumino City does a fabulous job separating itself from the crowd as an exemplary model of how a game in the genre should feel like.  A gorgeous art style, a wonderful sense of adventure, and cleverly designed puzzles make this game wonderfully endearing experienceThe first thing that will immediately grab you're attention is the art style.  The game has a vibrant paper-craft look that just pops right out of the screen.  The world looks so real you feel like you could just reach right through the screen and touch it.  The is especially notice able during the little transitioning scenes during key parts of the story where you can see the world from different angles.  The natural abstraction of the paper-craft fits perfectly with the idea of a city built on a giant waterwheel.There is a wonderful sense of adventure as you explore Lumino City.  On a journey to recuse your Granddad you'll have to traverse the city.  Each puzzle in the game offers two of three locales to explore.  The progression as you go from one area next fells very natural and offers a wonder sense of discovery.  This city has some wild architecture and you'll meet so very interesting indiviuals along the way.  You really never know what to expect and its always exciting to see whats around the next corner.Well balanced puzzles is essential for this kind of game and Lumino City nails the balance superbly.  Yes, the puzzles can get quite difficult and many of the will really make you think.  However, patience is a virtue and the game gives you all the tools you'll need to figure out the solution.  Since you're limited a certain amount of space and resources for each puzzle you'll never feel too overwhelmed.  The variety is off the charts, every puzzle is unique and will have you thinking in a totally different way using a vast array of intellectual skills.Playing this game is just incredibly rewarding.  The puzzles are all challenging yet they are all reasonable.  Every time you find the solution and progress to the next area its there is a wonderful sense of accomplishment.  Not only that but you're just dying to see whats next in this beautifully handcrafted world.  Not everybody will have the patience for these challenges but I highly recommend giving this game a shot.			"

												I'm a fan of puzzle games but ""Lumino City"" is a total bore. The story is non-existent. The pace is too slow. The graphics are initially interesting but not to a point that makes this worth playing. The puzzles are either too easy or they're tedious. There are no satisfying challenges.""Lumino City"" is more of an interactive art exhibit and less of an entertaining gaming experience. It simply isn't fun. Don't waste your time or money on this.

												I love the look of this game. One of the prettiest games I've ever played. The papercraft world is astonishing.Unfortunately, that's the only thing going on here. Everything else is meaningless PnC-style linear gameplay with a few forgettable 'puzzles' that are mostly visual (like lining things up) or trial and error style solutions. I'd love to see a film in this style, but the game is unremarkable.			"

												Was able to marathon it in a single day (8.7 hours with some breaks/distractions). This was a great game that never got boring. Every puzzle had something new. The game itself was artistic and pleasing to the senses. I greatly enjoyed my day with this game. Very relaxing and challenging at the same time.			"

												I really wanted to like it. Cute and vibrant graphics, interesting style, and the fact that it's a point and click game was enough to have me interested. But the unique visual style isn't enough to save the game. Puzzles feel like those mediocre flash-game point and clicks -- usually dull, tedious or too obvious. Characters are one-dimentional which would be fine if there was any sort of conflict or something to move the 'plot' along. Stopped at the part where it expects you to memorize and play through an entire song on a guitar front to back (~35 notes)  without making any mistakes.			"

												I loved and enjoyed playing this game. I wish I could speak in technical terms about how great this game was but I'm just a player of games not an awesome maker of games. The second game out does the first game Lume (but yes i did enjoy the playing the first part). The design concept is beautiful to see again and seems even sharper. I loved that models seemed to be used and give a realistic affect of the materials that made up the city and objects. I loved the story line. The music is beautifully done and works great with the story. The main character and other characters that come along the story were fun and charming. I loved the way each one was designed to look. I loved that the creators made the game alot longer than the first one. The puzzles were fun to solve. They were challenging but not to the point where you want to pull your hair out and walk away from the game. I beat the game but enjoyed playing it so much that I will definitley replay it just to enjoy the look and feel of it. I would definitley be up to play  more of this if the story were to be continued. I bought this game during the holiday steam sale but I think it is worth the money even not on sale. Please say you have more in the future for this story or another along the ideas of it? I wouldn't mind having a a framed picture of the artwork of this game on my wall.			"

A+ in visuals, Unique style, and charming storyline.A few very challenging puzzles.Would highly recommend .Only issue I came across was that game crashed five to ten times during the course of approximately eight hours of gameplay.Otherwise , it was a wonderful experience and well worth more than the current Humble Bundle price point.

												Let's get the obvious good news out of the way: this game is totally gorgeous, and the setting/writing are very charming. I look forward to the creative people on this game moving on to other projects, on teams with testers.This game crashed on me multiple times, plus one soft-lock. Luckily there's auto-saves every few screens, so I never lost much progress. (There's also an auto-save that drops you back exactly where you were, but that dropped me AFTER the soft-lock, so you might occasionally need to rewind further. Since there's no walking-dead states in any of the puzzles when they're *working correctly*, I suspect this rewind feature was actually made just so people could work around such bugs...)I actually loved many of the puzzles in this game, and they're all generally good ideas in theory... but too many of the puzzles (or even just the act of traveling from one screen to the next) were hampered by really confusing layout/perspective problems... I lost track of how many times I spent entire minutes just combing the screen with clicks, until suddenly the character stepped through what had seemed to be a wall, onto what I thought was part of the background. One puzzle has MANY instances of this, and you'll be real sick of it by the end. (It doesn't seem like intentional 'trickery', I think the developers just didn't realise how unclear the visuals are...)There were also several puzzles where I understood the nature of the puzzle, but actually finding the correct *solution* required so much trial and error (with no way to narrow it down or intuit whether you were getting close) that it just took far too long to be fun.I guess these complaints sound mostly minor, and there is a LOT of charm here in between the long stretches of trying to figure out how to implement the puzzle solutions you've thought of, but in the end the problems were frustrating enough and made it drag enough in the bad parts that the only reason I didn't give up was because I was fairly sick at the time and had nothing else to do. I've certainly played far far worse games than this, but ultimately I'd just have a hard time justifying suggesting that someone set aside the time to play this, unless they're extremely eager to play a new puzzle adventure game and have long since run out of the better ones.

												If I was to only review the hint system alone.  This game would be a recommend, but the game that includes that hint system still receives extremely high marks.   While it's not perfect, it's a fun little game, and my only complaint is the price. To start with, this is yet another point and click adventure.  However what stands out in this game is the graphics.  This game isn't just beautiful, it's stylized and gorgeous.  Everything has a feeling of depth, and the papercraft style it, and that's because it was.  Literally this game was made out of cardboard and paper, and then photographed, and holy crap, this game look unbelievable. The one negative thing I could say is the player character kind of looks weak against this unbelievably gorgeous world.  I mean this game is astonishing.   It's just that good looking. The puzzles in this game though are good, but they almost don't live up to the graphics.  The graphics are a solid 10, the puzzles are 7 or 8.  They're good mind you, but they can range from almost too easy to insanely hard due to the wrong reasons.  For instance there was a puzzle I just couldn't figure out, I couldn't figure out how to make a boat rock.  I solved two other puzzles, and I was feeling damn good about myself.  Then I finally had to look up a guide, and it turned out I was missing a hatch on the boat, I spent at least 10 minutes just trying to find a way to rock the boat, and it was something that almost blended in with the screen.  A similar issue happened at another point (I missed a tool).   But these are the exception.  There's very little pixel hunting required.  Most times you need an item it's blatantly obvious what you need (or maybe I'm just that lucky), but I was stymied twice so far. However for the puzzles themselves if you get stuck the game has something special.  There's a book that you're given at the beginning of the game, and while it looks confusing at first, the table of contents actually is intended to work.  The book has over a thousand pages of random stuff, but it also contains solutions for the puzzles in the game.  To look up a solution, there's usually a question related to the puzzle, that leads to a small math problem that tells the player which page to look up.  The only flaw with this hint system is it gives a complete solution.  There's no hint, if you go to that page, you're going to see a decent (about 5 percent) of the game's puzzles' solution exposed.  It's mostly in order, so if you can avoid scanning the whole page you might be ok, but it's still VERY spoiler.  However it allows the gamer to not have to look up solutions... as long as you have all the items to get you to that solution (for instance it doesn't mention the location of the spanner I was missing.) I just love the idea of the hint book however, and I will rave about it, because it's actually quite fun to have to look up a solution, since there's very little chance you'll run across solutions for other puzzles while you find yours. Now the one thing I wasn't a huge fan of is the sound.  The game is gorgeous, and fun to play, but there's nothing special about the sound.  There's no voice acting and almost nothing going on with the sound design.  There's nice music, but that's about it.  Just songs, and silence.   A shame, because visually this game is a feast, but the sound seems to lag behind. The one big negative though for this game is length.  And that's about the only place I think this game falls short.   It's a gorgeous feast for the eyes, but only about 4-5 hours long, less if you use the hint system relentlessly.   That's ok, but at 20 bucks, this game is WELL overpriced.  However this game does go on sale often, and it would be a ""must buy"" for less, but at 20 bucks, that's a value question each gamer is going to have to decide.   I got this game through a humble bundle, so that wasn't a big issue for me, but it definitely deserves a mention as it's short for 20 bucks. Overall though, I'd recommend Lumino city if you can get at a discount.  10 dollars is probably worth it, 5 dollars is an easy purchase.  This game is just unbelievably beautiful that I can't stress it enough, the only issue is eventually the game comes to an end, and I don't think I'll be returning for a second playthrough any time soon.  But for those four or five hours, it's really incredible.			"

												Stop-motion capture? This 804MB game is really artistic. I enjoy the way the art is done. Will add more when I complete the game. This reminds me of Little Big Planet. It's so artistic and I love the way they build the story with real objects like Little Big Planet. I think I played this on Kongregate a long time ago and I still enjoy it the effort that was put into making this game.Conclusion, think of this as an artistic endeavour with strange puzzles and you will enjoy this game a lot. Completable in 4 hours. PROS1. Amazing GameThe beauty of the objects just make you marvel at the different designs.2. Artistic CraftI love the carefully crafted items.3. Interesting PuzzlesFlipping yourself from an antenna, controlling a crane with toy controls, 4. Red HerringsFish and Chips, not Fish or Chips. [edit]. It's actually a trick. You will come back to the shop later in the game.CONS1. Click LocationsYou don't know where to click. It's mostly guesswork. The locations that can be clicked are not highlighted to you.2. MovementToo slow. You could take a leaf from Deponia and allow teleportation with double clicks.3. The Pairing of SwitchesThe puzzles don't make sense. Instead of < and > symbols, you get up and down arrows instead.			"

One small minus were the animations of the character that you cannot interrupt (like climbing a stair or moving from a point to another). One big plus is the capability to run on a low performance pc. (I have the configuration from 5,6 years ago) Anyway, till now I'm fully satisfied. I will give it 9.50/10Keep it up.Cheers. "

The music is great and there must be a big effort behind the scene (there is after watching mini documentary). I played on PC and did not experience any techincal problem from start to finish. Start the game and take your time until you finish it. You might even consider giving a break between each level. Do not even think about being inspired from any walkthrough :)			"

												A beautiful game, with a unique design and wonderful soundtrack; highly recomended ❥It is a cute game with an interesting story. The initial puzzles and enigmas are captivating and stimulating, driving you to keep playing. However, some chalenges, not many, can be frustrating to complete due to either randomness or repetitiveness. Also likely to, at times, get on your nerves, is how the character is somewhat slow and the inability to cancel movement orders.Despite these small issues, the game is, as I mentioned, unique and beautiful. If you enjoy original games, intelectual challenges and fresh experiences, this game is a good choice for you. Definitely worth buying if you catch a reasonable deal.			"

												I spent some time at the diner after I finished the puzzles there. The song was so good--a bit old, yet not at all tarnished. It was so simple and warming. That was when the game totally got me. It was such an embracing moment.It was so theraputic. And that was saying the least.I found the game somewhat dragging/tedious at some point. But later I realized that it is meant to be played slow. You really need to capture the subtle things, even if they look like just as common and bland. Things like Lumi's thought after she helped out the mailman: he doesn't look much like it, but I think he's happier now.If it catches your eye, try it. Recommend it to your depressed friend. We all should be grateful that that people still make good stuff like this.			"

												Charming and sweet art and world, but gameplay is bad. Don't bother at full price.It looks cute in screenshots and video, but it feels like developers have never made games before. It's filled with bad GAME design. I just hope it's not intentional length padding and more due to inexperience of developers. Or maybe port issue as some other review mentioned. This kind of stuff should be caught in very first play test!I like small charming (indie) games and therefore this seemed super interesting. However, as much as I'd like to love this game the gameplay is so unresponsive that I'm at verge of hating it. Everything, I mean EVERYTHING is unskiplable. You cannot do anything while walking or ladder climbing animation is playing. And there are lots of ladders. You wait for every door to open, every dialog, every small panning of the camera. Combine that with the fact that you probably backtrack all the time while solving the puzzles which means you're wasting so much time just waiting for things to move. If you miss click by accident, you - again - wait for slow walk to play out. I understand that they wanted to show off the world and work they've put into it, but ♥♥♥♥ me is it bad game design. There is also no indication of what you can click so you click everything for hotspots yet the click areas are all over the place and you end up moving your character here and there unintentionally -> more waiting. Dialog is boring and story uninteresting despite charming world. I appreciate the effort for art and some puzzles are good. But overall - as a game - it's not good.			"

												In rare moments, buying something doesn't feel like giving away money but rather being privileged to come across a great find. This game was one of those experiences to me.What I loved most about this game is the relaxed simplicity. There's no overweight drama, no feeling of urgency, no unecessary tension; just a simple, calm and welcoming vibe from start to end. Its artwork really shines through and the fact that it was made of real world materials brings more applaud to the artists - it makes the experience lively, warm and homey. The level design is also ingenious and the creativity in the puzzles is well brought together. Also the handy manual is a cool trick basically saying you'll have to work your way into finding the actual answers if you're too lazy to figure them out. The story line floats seamlessly as you progress and the characters you'll meet have their own unique personalities and show little insights into their mundane struggles that adds a nice flavour to the experience. The action happens in a surreal environment but the plot feels very real and relatable to anyone who started their life, bringing up themes like friendship, family, living in a crowded area, modern energy resources and more which you can discover by yourself.The only part I didn't enjoy was the interface. For example it takes a bit of a pavlovian response to learn that hitting the Esc key (which every gamer knows as the pause menu key) will only make the game exit fullscreen. Character movement and action triggers feel a bit lacking and sometimes the puzzles refuse to behave as intended until the game is restarted, making it feel like the game was designed by artists with beautiful vision rather than strict game buffs with a knack for nerdy menu designs and that is just fine in my book. So facing a beautiful and unique experience those were very minor glitches and that won't keep me away if sequels come and I sure hope they do.A breath of fresh air, I'd definitely recommend this one to anyone that can use a mouse.

												Of similar games I have reviewed I can find a few endearing qualities in Lumino City. Defnitely not worth 15 quid. Pros:1. The artwork is pretty innovative, cut out folded card and paper people make for a pleasing effect simple and clean only spoiled by the out-of-focus backgrounds which caused me some amount of eyestrain.2. A likeable story idea and main character development kicks in right at the start, you learn how to play Lumino City in stages, however the learning gets a bit slow when all of the dialog becomes repetitive.3. Grandad drops a hand manual, and it's probably more fun browsing the diagrams in the Handymanual which is in reality useless, than to ply the game. I found the manual quite fun.4. Sound track, yep flawless, sets the mood and works, but not enough to swing it when frustration sets in.Cons:1. Every puzzle is not supplied with much of a ""what am I supposed to do"" hint at all, for example the lemons puzzle is confusing since the ""lemon-battery prongs"" are labelled + and - but the labels have no actual relevance at all.2. When a puzzle makes no sense, brute force will solve it - and brute force clicking about on the screen in order to pick up some random item which hides in plain sight was not something I found ""gameplay"" enhancement.3. When one of the quests to open a can involves going back and forth between 2 neighbours 5 times over playing messenger-person, it gets a little bit thin, they are neighbours after all. I gave up after the only 2 acceptable puzzles which involved light and seemed to make the game interresting, only to be followed by more drudgery.Sorry, but maybe for a £1.70 pricetag, this might be a keeper, but since I paid less on a bundle I'm not done out of pocket anyway. Worth playing only for the graphics.I give ""the moving city"" 3/10.			"

												Lumino’s strongest assets are its fantastic art style, puzzle variety, and hint system. Those three make this adventure game a visual treat meant to exercise your brain. However, there a couple things that make it slightly annoying to very irritating throughout the entire experience.The story of the main game is extremely simple. You’re Lumi, a granddaughter, on a quest to find her grandfather, the Handyman, who’s been kidnapped. That’s all you have for the main plot for about five hours. You’ll learn about Lumino City and its current state if you observe the environment, read some of the books, and pay attention to the people. Once you beat the game and reach the credits, that’s when a well done wordless animation plays that fills in all the blanks. It’s a great way to ensure you watch the credits, but I don’t think having most of your plot delivered in the last couple minutes of the game is a sign of good storytelling.Obviously, the game’s use of hand-made materials resulted in many wonderful environments. Each area just pops out with its bright colors and excellent lighting. My eyes ate up the visuals and enjoyed looking at every area. It’s not a common art style that I’ve encountered which makes it that much more special. What can sometimes interrupt how gorgeous everything looks is the sometimes overly gratuitous use of the Depth of Field effect. Sure, it helps you focus on the scene in front of you, but sometimes it blurs out paths that you can take or even a few objects meant for player interaction. It shouldn’t have been allowed to be implemented in a way where it can hinder the actual gameplay. I really enjoyed how the in-game help system was developed for Lumino City. I thought it was clever and a little bit of fun. I do admit to just clicking through pages though after selecting the correct general area for some of them. The solutions are in chronological order within the 900-page book. The Handy Manual has answers whose page numbers are hidden by little math problems that require some figuring out since you don’t know some of the values. Usually, it requires counting something in the environment and then applying those values correctly into the equation and solving. Voila! Your answer or explanation will be at page number 50 or whatever the result is. I really liked not needing to pull up a third party walkthrough for 98% of the game and I felt pretty good about solving for solutions. Some puzzles are complex enough that one glance at the page will not do it, resulting in some back and forth. It’s easy to pull up during many of the puzzles where it has its own screen versus being in the environment. That’s due to needing a precise click on her bag which can be difficult in situations where the camera is pulled out.The puzzles don’t have a real theme tying them together like in Portal or Oxenfree. Instead, you’ll run into a good variety of them that have you solving in different ways. Some require understanding patterns, putting gears in the right place, placing lights to reveal a code, noticing the correct answer from exploration and then replicating it on a larger scale, and manipulating a light mill to display some messages in Morse code. There were a couple puzzles I just didn’t understand which required me to refer to The Handy Manual. There was also this wiring puzzle that required me to connect abstract shapes and numbers to one of equal value. I only understood half of it and applied brute force process of elimination to the rest. I thought most of the puzzles were good, some were delightful or amusing (the light mill and the very last one), and a few of them seemed nonsensical. Only one puzzle was tedious which was playing the guitar song. It wanted you to memorize six sets of notes that you had to play correctly at one time. It’s doable and I guess I could have taken a screenshot of the Handy Manual’s page, but that one felt poorly thought out.One of the major contributors to my annoyance with this game was the movement or lack thereof. There is no actual movement in this game. You have a scene with extremely static and predetermined points that you can click on to move. That means every time you click an area and have her start moving, you cannot stop or cancel it. You have to wait for the animation to finish in order to move again. As a result, the controls could feel unresponsive at times. I grew weary of having to see the same animations play repeatedly when moving around, especially between screens. You can’t skip to the next screen; the game insists on having everything play out. Thank goodness the game was only 5+ hours or I would have turned into an angry person.The other problem came in the form of stability and clarity. I’ll start with the latter. You remember how movement works between two points? Well, the Captain scene has a puzzle hidden underneath a hatch in the boat located between two of those points. I spent a good amount of time not knowing what to do and this marked the only time I needed to watch a video. Apparently it’s also a puzzle where you want to make sure you solve the boat’s rocking part last or you’ll have a large amount of trouble clicking the boat’s deck.The stability problem hit me hard in one area in particular. It was the moment when I when clicked on the guitar so that Lumi would start playing it. I ended up crashing the game twice and thought that was it. For whatever reason, it started working on the third try, but I honestly don’t know how it might turn out for other people. Be careful?Lumino City is a good looking game that provided puzzles that I could mostly solve on my own. Its Handy Manual made me work for the answers to the ones I couldn’t figure out which I liked. It provided a pretty neat experience overall, but it comes with a not-so-insignificant amount of issues. Some people might be more willing to put up with them more than others. Hopefully I pointed out enough things for you to make a decision.Favorite screens:


I really like this shot.

												A charming little puzzle-focused point-and-click adventure that may not be everyone's cup of tea.The graphics are a delightful, masterful combination of 2D, 3D, and photographic design. Just moving through the different scenes will make you smile.Unfortunately, the gameplay can be frustrating, even annoying. Most of your challenges are puzzles of the mathematical or graphical sort, and while some are ridiculously easy, some are obtuse.The point-and-click adventuring is barely worth mentioning: your inventory will never contain more than two items, and moving back and forth between areas is slow. The controls are especially maddening: you never know quite where you're supposed to click, and clicking in the wrong place will send you -- slowly -- in the wrong direction.""Luckily"" the story is linear and you always know that you just have to complete a puzzle to take you to the next location, so if you get too frustrated you can look up a walkthrough.

												I think Lumino City is the most colorful, exquisite, and beautiful game I've ever played. This game is unique because the environments are hand made. Every time I got to the next area, I was amazed by the beauty. One of my favorites is the rotating house. Every area looks different! I can't imagine how long a game like this took to create. The puzzles you had to do were fun and ranging from oh I can do this to what am I doing I need a guide (that salt guy omg). I was also surprised by the length. Maybe I took my time, but I expected the game to be the usual ~3 hours to complete based on my experiences with similar games. I finished in around 6 hours.There is dialogue, but no voice-overs sadly. Voices would have made this game grand. The story was uh, was there even a story? You are looking for your grandfather. You learn about your grandfather a little bit during your journey to find him, but the story was really on the back burner in this game.Anyone looking for a puzzle adventure will enjoy this game. Also, there are no jump scares.			"

												I wanted to like this game, but I was ultimately let down.The art style is niceA lot of the puzzles are fun.Many of the puzzles are unclear and tedious. And that's not the ""I need to think harder"" kind of unclear. It's the ""this was a nice idea, badly designed"" kind of unclear. Often I had the answer, and clicked in the wrong area, or the answer was obvious but there wasn't hard logic behind it. It was just the only option available. In some regards, this is in line with the style of the game, but ultimately it just doesn't make sense for puzzles. I grew bored of the puzzles before finishing the short title. That says it all.

												I remember having conflicted opinions about Lume and sadly that experience was also repeated in Lumino City.On one hand the game is aesthetically very pleasing (apart from some loud audio thrown in there!) but on the other hand the gameplay, which is probably supposed to feel quite relaxing just ends up boring me. On my first try I only managed to play for 30 or so minutes before getting too sleepy to continue. On the next day I continued until the guitar part, where the game crashed when I tried to restart the puzzle after getting some paper for writing all those notes down on. At that point I didn't see any reason to restart the game as I really wasn't having much fun with this.The gameplay is too slow and the puzzles feel quite clunky. I also had some problems figuring out what exactly I was supposed to be doing even if I knew the solution in theory (for example with the crane, where I went back and forth a few times before realizing I had to individually click on the characters while sitting inside the crane). Lots of back and forth movement with such a slow/unresponsive movement just wasn't fun.Perhaps if you enjoyed Machinarium, which I personally never finished much due to the reasons already mentioned above, you might like this one. For others, I'd simply recommend watching a playtrough of the game. Perhaps at 2x speed. Got this on a bundle (for quite cheap I'd imagine) and I'm really glad I didn't pay the asking price.			"

												This game is beautiful and unique from start to finish. I almost never write reviews but I just completed the game and I loved it so much I was compelled to write one. i consider myself a casual gamer, and this game seemed to be the perfect balance of easy point-and-click gameplay mechanics and challenging puzzles required to advance. I sometimes play games just for the art but this one has so much more to offer than just that aspect. For those who are NOT casual gamers, I still highly reccomend this game, especially if you're looking for something different to try. In fact, my boyfriend fancies himself a hard core gamer and he loves Lumino City just like me. The art, gameplay, puzzles, and story are all excellent. I got it on sale, but I think the game is worth $20 regardless.			"

												Beautiful puzzler with a unique mechanic for in-game help. You can do the whole game without the in-game help or a 3rd-party walkthrough if you want, but knowing that they're both available makes it less frustrating when you are struggling with something. Stuck on where to place those cogs? Open the in-game ""HandyManual"" and turn to the Table of Contents, where you'll find a list of math problems... were there 7 rungs on the ladder and 3 windows? Multiply rungs by windows and add 37, turn to Page 58, get the clue to the cogs.The whole game is made of pictures of 2D and 3D papercraft, so it has the feel of a pop-up children's picturebook. It's beautiful. Some of the little vignettes are cute, of solving the townspeople's problems. And you get a sense there's a history to the town that you're not fully being told (stay for the credits).I played through the whole thing in <7 hours, not rushing particularly. There's not really any replayability, though I might go back and talk to some NPCs some more and look around a little. Recommended for all fans of puzzle games, as well as people who want to like puzzle games but have been burned by puzzlers with nitpicky ""do it exactly one non-intuitive way, and we won't help you"" puzzles.I'll almost certainly buy whatever this studio produces next. Lume and Lumino City were both great.			"

												To hear my full thoughts on Lumino City, listen to the review on Game Hoard Podcast[soundcloud.com]Lumino City is a point and click adventure game with a unique aesthetic. Everything in the game is a real life object that was built and filmed by the developer. The result is simply gorgeous and makes every new environment a joy to explore. It's amazing to me just how well everything is lit and animates. Combine this with a truly stellar soundtrack, and you have one of the most aesthetically pleasing games ever made.However, the gameplay doesn't quite live up to the other aspects of the game. For the most part, it's standard adventure game fair, for better or worse. Generally the puzzles are well designed and the game gives you just enough information to let you figure things out. Many of these are little cut away minigames, which really added variety to the game. Unfortunately, this is occasionally not the case and there is no clear idea of what to do next, what is interactive, or where you can go in the environment. The result is that you end up just clicking on everything you can until something happens. These sections frustrated me a lot and really took away from the fun of the game.Overall I would still recommend Lumino City. Just be aware that sometimes you will get stuck and it may be better to just look up the arbitrary solution than try to solve it yourself in order to enjoy the game.			"

												I liked the visuals of the game a lot. The game is great looking in itself from start to finish. Everything from the first logo that appears, the menu screens, cutscenes, cute in-game books and pamphlets, is a bombardment of art. You can tell the people who made this have quite impressive artistic talent. Apparently they made most of the scenes with actual miniature models with a tilt shift effect and then used some camera drives for the cutscenes. Finally overlaying the game and it's characters on top of that. I do love the way it all looks. I hope they make more games this way in the future.Especially the vintage-computer rooms near the end of the game reminded me of Lost (the TV-series), very cool! The characters are pretty simple in style but still very likeable, especially the captain and looking at the boy with the binoculars who was looking back at you. The athosphere is fun, It was like.. like a digital version of being in the boyscouts. I even made myself some paper airplanes according to the instructions from ""Glider Insider"" found in the library in the game. I Havn't had this much fun in a while and enjoyed it thoroughly.The main part of the game are the puzzles, which are very fun, and range from easy to medium difficulty. The puzzle difficulty is definately good for any younger players and also for anybody who hates getting stuck in a game like this.8 / 10 - fun little game!Lastly my two little negatives (which are inconsequential, really);- First one is for the soundscape of the game in a few places, for instance in the bar while playing the flipper puzzle the music there got a bit annoying and repetitive. For the most part the sound effects and music are good.- The second one because the game got stuck twice during a 6 and a half -hour playthrough. Once when entering the library, it just didn't load the library screen, and once when I opened the book from the inventory during the lighthouse puzzle (it was overlayed with the lights from the puzzle couldn't see a thing let alone close the book). However I don't think there are any gamestopper bugs as the game autosaves and lets you continue from the beginning of the scene, which is never very far, so that's good!			"

												TL;DR Play this game if you have any interest in artistic games. An absolutely brilliant game. The entire set is handcrafted out of paper and is beautiful to look at, the story is cute and engaging, and the puzzles are (for the most part) well laid out with a handy and well-designed book of hints for when you're really stumped. Absolutely worth the money, absolutely worth playing.PROS:* Beautiful design and artwork* Gorgeous music* Interesting and engaging story* Good puzzles with solutions that are on the right side of ""not obvious"" and ""not frustrating""* In game hint system that's neither too tempting nor too difficult to access* Female protagonist without centering around her gender...* ...who deserves and receives the respect she earns through the gameFAILINGS:* Some puzzle frustrations: lack of clear goals, difficult to see/find targets, timing puzzles with awkward handles* A few hangs and crashes, two of which were reproduceable on my system (don't open the steam overlay when working with the water tank)* No audio/visual options, couldn't adjust sound-levels in game (music was too loud in the endgame for some reason)OTHER:* Puzzle difficulty leans towards ""easy"" but I'd rather easy than frustrating* Some of the stranger puzzles can be frustrating when you don't ""see"" what needs to be done right away, but every single one of them made sense by the completion of the puzzle. None need to be solved by pure trial and errorRead negative reviews closely, and you will notice a trend - complaints that boil down to disappointment that a point and click adventure/puzzler is too simple has no action elements! Completely ridiculous. This game has almost everything going for it.			"

												The look is amazing but the puzzles are bad. Many of them are unexplained. Sometimes I'd solve one when just ""clicking around"" to feel out the puzzle - and not know how I solved it.  I rarely felt clever when I solved a puzzle, just relieved that I could move on.I gave up about two hours in. There's a Simon-Says puzzle w/ a guitar. You repeat back six five-note combinations. Not too tough. Then you're expected to string all five of them together and perform a song. If you fail, you start over at the beginning.

												As much as I want to like this game - I can't.Most of the puzzles are unintuitive and/or come down to outright trial and error unless you check our the cheat sheet.Progress in the game seems arbitrary at times, which, combined with the aforementioned types of puzzles, can lead to a lot of frustration.Additionally, the chracter controls are quite awkward. Sometimes, Lumi will not move where you want her, but instead decide to go off screen, wasting time entirely.But at least it has a nice artstyle going for it, other than that: Please don't buy this.

												Just finished the game!I love this type of puzzle games, and the puzzles weren't too difficult that I would get stuck for ages and not be able to continue.  Additionally, the hints themselves require a bit of math skills to figure out was another nice aspect (I did end up needing it a few times).Both the music and graphics were great, and the range of puzzles made it really fun as well!  I'm definitely glad I got this game (while it was on sale, so not as pricey as the full retail price is).  Now I want to get the first game and play that as well!  :D			"

												Got this game through Humble Bundles Dev Bundle and it was a great purchase. The lighting and graphic quality is fantastic; unlike any game I have ever played. This is a special type of platformer to say the least with really interesting movement and perspective given the camera angles and lighting. Great puzzles work through the course of the game! Great game, highly recommend to anyone looking for something new to play that is a little bit outside the box.			"

												Cons:Bugs--------------------------------Found graphical bug in boat area (After pouring salt into the water storage tower with the boat already rocking, click the arrow to walk to the boat and you will be stood on the rocking boat leaving you floating)-Trying to open your inventory on the roof shown below will only cause half of it to appear.-Can't access inventory in the library?-Opening steam browser and searching for a website will often make you unable to tab back into the game and even crash the whole game---------------------------Improvements----------------------------Some puzzles appear to be simple trial and error rather than any hints picked up throughout the level-Some times it is way to difficult to find what you're meant to do (one time being after you go to the library i had no idea where to go for 15m and had to look on YouTube)-Clicking where you want to go can sometimes feel like guesswork-You can't click to go anywhere like in LoL or Dota, you can only click to go to pre-assigned areas. In the Library this is noticeable as there are only 3/4 places you can move in a large room.-So annoying how slow lumi moves around when moving a large distance.-Conversations are unskippable as they have a mandatory wait period of way too long to skip each message box.Pros:-Beautiful-Way more details than needed-Lots of extra book pages with beautiful drawings for those who like to see art-Generally a fun game, would be GREAT if it wasn't for the afore mentioned, easy-to-fix issues.

												Pros: young female protagonist with brown skin, great puzzles, beautiful world and art, impactful storyCons: A couple glitches and crashesWho says you can’t receive something crafted by hand with paper and glue in a video game? State of Play expertly blends physical and digital art in their multimedia masterpiece, Lumino City. For this London indie games development team, their world-building process was literally to build a 10-foot-high model of the city out of cardboard, paper, glue, and some tiny motors and lights. The city we see in the game provides us a virtual tour through this model. It is absolutely stunning to witness the handcrafted elements bring every texture and scene to life.As a gamer who is beyond tired of the Damsel-in-Distress trope in video games, I found myself surprisingly refreshed by Lumino City’s take on the narrative. Lumi is a lovable, timid young brown girl on a journey to rescue her kidnapped grandpa. The story is simple but impactful—completely familiar but also impressively defiant. Through subtle but unmistakable details, Lumino City brings accountable storytelling to their whimsical of challenging but fair puzzles.LumeLume serves as a prequel, but it also feels like a proof of concept for Lumino City. The controls and navigation are much less intuitive than those in Lumino City (I was stuck for a long while just trying to figure out how to leave the house), and it’s a much smaller game. Though it may only contain a handful of puzzles, they are difficult and cryptic. Many of the puzzles are mirrored in Lumino City, but in a clearer and more accessible format. I would not say that playing Lume is prerequisite to enjoying Lumino City. It is only briefly referenced at the very opening of the game. If you are looking for challenging puzzles and simply more of Lumi, Lume is not a bad game by any measure. However, if you’re just looking for a single full, fun game to play, I would just recommend diving into Lumino City.The CityI still can’t get over how awesome this city is. Its construction is clever and creative, and it’s filled with characters who are not only memorable but diverse. For one, its mayor is a cat lady with pink hair, and the entire city is populated with many women, people of color, and people of all ages. Turning every corner only reveals more delight. Lumino City’s residents come with a variety of temperaments. Some of the puzzles can only be solved by first resolving disputes within the community, which become puzzles in themselves (like getting all the passive aggressive neighbors to help Lumi power the crane). Other puzzles require us to focus on healing interpersonal relationships (like an elderly couple whose anniversary isn’t going quite as planned). In almost every area, we encounter characters who are dealing with their own anger, self-doubt, delusions, and/or personal failings, and the ways they struggle to ask for help. As Lumi explores the city, she also finds subtle notes of disrepair and dysfunction. This isn’t how the city once was, and it isn’t how it should be. There’s much that is broken (and, of course, the Handyman is nowhere to be found). There are reminders of what the place once was: shining, well-oiled, and dynamic. Now much has fallen to the wayside of rust, tangled gears, and hopeless residents. Beyond the silly banter and the residual wacky spirits of the populace, Lumino City manages to place moments of small, solemn heartbreaks over this city that’s falling apart.PuzzlesThese puzzles weren’t a breeze, but they were definitely reasonable and well-designed. They were appropriately challenging and suitable for players of all skill levels. The point-and-click style of the game keeps things simple while demanding the careful attention of the player.Grandpa’s Handymanual allows players to adjust the difficulty of the puzzle (without altering the puzzle itself. This is an item that is given to Lumi at the beginning of the game. It offers hints for all of the puzzles in the game (though you have to solve a quick math problem first). You can solve all of the puzzles without using it, but it can definitely help make the game easier if you’re looking for something more casual. This built-in accessibility allows the players to decide for themselves how difficult the game will be. I love that these puzzles really are a part of the environment, and interacting with them lets you manipulate this beautiful, handcrafted world. It’s such a pleasing and rewarding experience through and through. (Though, the Spinner House was something of a headache.)Grandpa in DistressLike many puzzle games, Lumino City isn’t story centric. Most of my time was spent jumping from puzzle to puzzle. However, the light storyline is worth looking at. It follows all of the patterns of a Damsel in Distress narrative yet manages to avoid all of the trope’s toxic and misogynistic pitfalls. Grandpa is kidnapped, Lumi embarks on a journey to save him, Lumi helps him down from the high-up tower (or in this case, ladder), and Lumi is rewarded with a status increase (coronated as Handyman). This is the classic, familiar, damsel trope that gamers are all very familiar with. However, in Lumino City, the genders of the savior and the victim are switched, and the kidnapped victim’s character is humanized and relatively well-developed. The latter is accomplished largely through the subversion of the typical good vs. evil dynamic, where the focus falls on the hero and villain. Instead, Lumino City veils the antagonist until the end so that, for the rest of the game, the focus is primarily on the hero and the one she’s trying to save. These subtle but impactful changes throughout the story allow Lumino City to maintain a familiar narrative while creating a world that is fun for everyone; the story uplifts individuals while villainizing systems and institutions. ConclusionLUMINO CITY DOES SO MANY THINGS RIGHT.This game proves how beautiful mixed media can be, how clever and strong brown girls are, and how games with responsible storytelling can maintain appeal to a wide range of audiences. Although the game did run into a couple of glitches and crashes, Lumino City does so many things right, and its puzzles bring much joy, through and through. What an enjoyable and worthwhile experience. "

You will sometimes find things in drawers and cupboards that don't look like they can be opened. For instancewhen your character inconveniently stands in front of them. "

												I've only played for like 2-3 hours:On the visual side - the game is artfully crafted. Just magical.As far as gameplay goes - The puzzles are either entertaining and fun, or tedious. It's like there's no inbetween. There's one that's just frustrating and nauseaing. I don't want to spoil anything but it's just causing me nausea and I'm sure as hell not enjoying it. I don't want a headache while trying to have fun. and I think the developers should take those things into consideration.I'd day it's sure worth your time and money if not that part. Just a tedious puzzle focused on a spinning thing. And you have to focus on that spinning thing to go through it. Just...why?Ho, You can't turn off the sound at all. And you will wish you could at some point. I don't get that as well. It's like someone building a terrific car but forgetting the windows. I just don't get it. "

The game lets you open the Steam Overlay, but if you open it during a puzzle, you cant close it again and have to quit the game. Due to the terrible saving system (at the beginning of every chapter...), this is a problem. All in all - abysmal. Too bad this game is impossible to enjoy due to terrible technical flaws, it looks really nice.			"

												I just don't dig experiences/artistic games. This game has a unique likeable style, but has boring story, paperlike (sic) characters and tedious puzzles. I didn't like it. Score 4/10.Pros:- graphics and style- some puzzlesCons:- tedious and uninteresting puzzles- unreadable fonts in text baloons, lack of voice acting- boring story and characters			"

Amazing graphics, but Shi t ty storyline and lackluster gameplay.i love point and click games, its the reason i got into pc gaming, but this game completely failed in the story department and so i can't recomend this game at all.

												Warning! This game is designed for iPad and touch devices. The text is super small and difficult to read if you play on a big screen at a distance.  Additionally, it is difficult to see small details unless you are up close, for that reason, I simply cannot play this on my setup. Maybe I will try this on iPad, but on a living room media PC, it just doesn't work.			"

												Its charming no doubt.  The style is lovely but the puzzles are nasty.  There are numerous and varied.  There isn't enough to assist you and little to base your instincts on.  I found the puzzles too tricky.  I want to explore the neat little world but can't progress.  4.5/10			"

												I was a bit skeptical about buying Lumino City as Lume was so short and I agree with some of the other reviews that the full price is a little steep for what it is.  That said, the artwork is lovely and it is clear a lot of effort and love has gone into making it.  The puzzles I think are interesting rather than challenging in what I would consider a 'Mensa style' (shapes, colours, logic etc.) and no challenge is particularly harder than any other.I found the ending to be the most disappointing / frustrating thing about this game and in my opinion, it's a real anti-climax.  However, the journey through the game more than made up for it. "

												I LOVE THIS GAME.For anyone who digs puzzle/adventure game like I do, Lumino City is a must-buy. The art style is such a candy to the eye. The soothing music immediately draws you in. The fun puzzles provide enough challenges for your brain and some of them are so creative that they make you wanna beg for more. Also the handy manual is so cool and I actually would like to own a real book like that. Wait, did I mention they actually build the whole Lumino City with paper? Yeah they did. Freaking awesome.

												Lumino City is a great puzzle game.It provides a fairly expansive environment to explore, with a wealth of puzzles to solve, and the great thing is: They're actually puzzles. This isn't just some ""run around until you can find the item that you need to progress, then combine them in just the right way"" type of game. The tools you need are provided in each scene of the game, and you are left with a puzzle that you need to solve in order to progress.The puzzles themselves range from fairly easy, fitting cogs onto a board in the right way, to fairly tricky puzzles requiring  logic. All of them (bar one, in my case) were solvable without resorting to trial and error until the solution was found, which is a good thing in a puzzle game like this. There is also an in-game help book that can give you hints if you're stuck, without giving too much of the solution away.A big strength of this game is the art. The visuals were actually created in real life, then photographed into the game, which gives it a really unique look that I haven't seen much of elsewhere. This coupled with the great sound and music design make for a very nice play through experience. The writing of the story is also very good, with a lot of humorous elements combined with some more sincere ones, it adds a lot to the characters of the City.My one (and only) major gripe with the game is that there are parts of the game where you can solve a 'scene' in different orders. Say there are 3 puzzles. If you solve it in the order with the third last everything is fine. But there are cases where, if you solve the third puzzle first, the game either refuses to let you progress or it simply crashes on you. You then have to resort to the forums to see what exactly the 'correct' solution is.Aside from that, this is a very good game if you like actual puzzles without all of the running around aimlessly looking for the solution, and it just looks and feels great.

												Extremely beautiful game, great design, some cute fun story telling and some interesting puzzles. I'd probably say that about 50% of them you can figure out on your own, and the other 50% need minor to complete assitance from the Handyman's Manual (you get it at the start of the game, keep flipping pages and almost every game mechanic is in there). You don't have to consult it though.			"

												Very cute game that was obviously worked hard on but in some aspects, poorly executed. Lumino City looks beautiful, the OST is great to listen to, the puzzles are fun, but oftentimes I was getting tired of some long, slow animations and bugs more than I was having fun playing the game. Still would recommend - I got it for less than a dollar in the humble bundle, so it was worth that.			"

												This game was very well done. It's a very unique style of game ; different from most games today. The graphics is what really intrigued me. I had no idea what the game was about when I purchased it. I jumped into it blind. I suddenly came to realize that it was a puzzle game which tested me.  Normally, puzzle games are not my cup of tea, I'm more into fast paced FPS types but I was easily hooked to this. Not only did this game hook me, it also hooked my girlfriend whos' attention was grabbed by the beautiful soundtrack. This game really keeps your mind at work and really tests you and what you can remember from highschool. I can easily recommend this game to others.			"

												Lumino City is a great, clever little game.  It's a real treat for the eyes, too.  My wife and I took our time with it and finished in about 8 hours.  It could be completed much faster, but if you do that, you're missing the chance to really appreciate the little details.The puzzles that can be repeated until you figure them out (no game overs) and short episodes make it a relaxing casual game.  Some people experience glitches getting through one puzzle about 1/2 or 2/3 of the way through (we were stopped in our tracks) but emailing the developer via their website solved our problem.I saw a few people make negative comments about the end of the game (conclusion of the story).  I think they must not have paid attention to the animation happening during the story credits; it explains (nonverbally) the game's big mystery and what will happen next.I recommend this game, and I will happily buy other games from this developer.

												An amazing point & click puzzle game, challenging to the right point and even great in graphics!I love how the whole paper-built set looks like while playing, and I've loved at all the puzzles through the whole game; some of them where quite easy to solve, some others really challenged me, and that's what I'm looking for when I buy a game. I can't find but pros, the puzzles are always different, there are no repeated pattern and if you don't get through them at all you can always try to get through the manual you're given... If you get to understand the tricky index! ;) Also the animation goes on smoothly and without any lags/bugs/issues and the artwork is just so colorful and amazing that it drives the player to go on and on to discover even more. Totally worth the money!			"

												Today I achieved playing and finishing Lumino City. It was a lot more linear than I expected - none of the classic back and forth of classic point-and-clicks - but it was charming, gorgeous (it's all handmade, mostly from paper) and surprisingly challenging at times. Was also surprised by the darkness and depth of the story.Took about five hours all up so $20 is a bit steep, although it's currently 25% off in the Steam sale. Even if you hold off buying, definitely add it to your Wishlist.			"

What a delightful game!Interesting puzzles, not so difficult you give up but enough to make you think - and there is help available if you need it.The animatons of 'Lumi' are superb, the music and sound effects totally appropriate, and the model makers should be congratulated. The game is just the right length and the reward for successfully completing it is a delightful little animated story in its own right.It's not often I would write a review like this for a game but I truly hope the creators make enough out of this to continue the genre.Well worth the money, and right up my street.  Sign me up for the next one. "

			Subscribe for more: https://goo.gl/XYkCSv Watch the last Review: https://youtu.be/idkUotTquA0 Today we review Lumino City. A fun puzzle game that is more than just beautiful to look at.		

I found myself in the situation of looking through my Steam recommendations and found Lumino City, which directly got my interest.Lumino City is a puzzle game which was build in the real world and digitalized in videos and pictures for the game. The people that live in this tower got animated and added to the scenes and deliver a really heart touching mini story and harmony between these.What is the game about? We play the young woman Lumi who is trying to find her grandfather the handyman. He taught her everything about fixing things, solving problems and using different machines. This leads us to a great variety of puzzles and problems that we will solve in several hours, of course depending on how fast you can progress though these.The graphics style is amazing and though the fps are capped to 25fps, it is fitting to the game and look. As I said, the tower was actually built and then captured in pictures and videos, then the people living in that tower got animated and added to the scenery. This is a great style to bring this game to live and the people have some really funny and heart touching interactions with each other and you too.A fitting soundtrack supports the game and gives a great atmosphere for solving the puzzles. You will love the soundtrack!I had no problems with the game in terms of bugs, but with the final chapter I was not able to progress on a ladder, if I don’t click immediatly on the next step. Restarting and clicking directly let me progress and see the end.A truly memoriable game which you can purchase for 20€ on steam. I think the price is justified because of the great artstyle and the wide range of puzzles and problems to solve. It will be one of your special games to remember.			"

												I got this game for a buck in a Humble Bundle and I regret... only paying a buck for it. It's a beautiful adventure game, with an awesome built-in help system. The only complaint I have against it is the way the help system is integrated into the game. You find a ""handymanual"" at the start, and it seems like you're required to consult it in order to solve the puzzles. But, in actuality, using the handymanual is completely optional, and using it will give you the exact solutions to the puzzles you're facing. This makes the game feel like it's too easy, as if you're just being hand-holded through the entire experience. Resist the temptation to consult the handymanual, however, and Lumino City is a delightful adventure with some challengingly rewarding brain teasers, and well worth purchasing at full price.			"

												Cute and adorable little adventure, the constructed and filmed backgrounds add a lot to the whole. The reference manual with hints the puzzles, hidden behind another small riddle/equation, is a nice touch.A couple of the puzzles were a bit meh but that's normal in any game - I rarely love them all. What bugged me a bit more is the 'story', which for me didn't pay out at the end. It just fell flat. It is not strictly needed, but it would have made it so much better.So: thumbs up, buy this if you like puzzle games.Watch my whole playthrough on YouTube "

												Clever puzzle game, great art and music. Puzzles are a tad on the easier side, but they are fun and satisfying to complete. The trailer gives a pretty good concept of what you'll be running into- tape mechanisms, gear machines, etc. They're very fun to put together, and the puzzles don't give themselves away when you're ""right"". What I mean is often in puzzle games you place a piece and if it's right it ""clicks"" in and starts doing something- all of the pieces click in and may move but won't complete your objective, which makes a much more cerebral puzzle.The book the game gives you is fantastic and well detailed and quite clever.Certainly worth checking out if you're intrigued by the trailer.

The puzzles were a little strange at times, and most of them made logical sense, although some were a little strange.  I found it a little too convenient that the answers were in chronological order in the book; there should be some kind of randomness to it so that the table of contents page is actually put to good use!!  Overall, it was a easy casual game to spend a short amount of time on!			"

												I thought the ""cheat book"" was a very nice idea. Some puzzles are a bit abstract, and some parts are easily missed, I had to resort to online guides once after being stuck for 30 minutes. Otherwise I really love the stylistic choices, the look of this game is amazing, even though the camera is locked off most of the time, like any classic point-and-click.If you like the look of the screenshots and enjoy puzzles/point-and-clicks I would recommend this game for you.

												It's good but not great. This game is not worth the asking price for such a sort puzzler, I would recommend getting it on sale, like -75% off sale.This is a great game with some minor flaws but others great point and click adventure.Out of 10:8/10 Graphics; The graphics are great except for an overuse of distance blur to give the levels clearer perspctive but I found it too much for some levels. Other than that the animation and backgrounds were amazing!5/10 Gameplay; It's hard to screw up a point and click game and Lumino City does well, for the most part. The speech bubbles are too quick to read for me which does not matter too much as most of the text does is just extra banter and you can click on the object again to re-read it. I feel as if some puzzles were fun and required a little fiddling to get the right sequence while others were random guessing or looking at the full answer from the book to understand the puzzle, hints would have been great as an inbetween. The levels were mostly good but some levels required random clicking to find the 'right' spot you could go to, it could have been more polished but all in all the gameplay is fun and relaxing.6/10 Story; It's a simple story and not much happens inbetween, the dialog between the residents and yourself do not add much if anything to the story, the reason story scores a six in the ending level and credits screen where the whole story is depicted, not the most intresting but enough for a game like this.TOTAL6.5/10			"

												8/10 objective rating PROS:- Visually rich; unique art style, vibrant colour, and fantastic texture- Puzzles are varied and challenging enough to remain fun throughout- Soundtrack is very pleasant to listen to and fits the theme of the game wellCONS:- Sometimes where you click triggers something that isn't at all close to where you clicked. There are some puzzles where this becomes really annoying since these collision mistakes take several seconds to correct.- The perspective on the game makes it hard to see what is accessible to the protagonist at times. You end up needing to click the screen a lot to be sure you're not missing things- The storyline, while cute, is nothing super special. It lacks a little depth and character development- Game glitched once and crashed twice (on a 7700 CPU & 1060 GPU w/ 16gb RAM)-----------------------------------------------------------------------Lumino City was a pleasant surprise. My husband picked it up in a humble bundle and after deciding it wasn't for him, and I redeemed the code. It sat in my inventory for over a year until one day I decided to stream it on Twitch. My viewers enjoyed helping me solve the puzzles and enjoyed the music/visuals.If you are a seasoned puzzle solver, I'm sure these would seem on the easier end of the spectrum (except for one or two potentially) They are, however, varied and provide a vast array of things to do as you continue your journey. You are given a book to help you solve the puzzles at the beginning but I couldn't figure out how to use the clues to help me, so I didn't open it the entire time.Some control issues occured with certain puzzles where I triggered events accidentally because the hit box for that actuion was so big (I would click 1 to 2 inches away from the trigger and it would trigger it just the same) The game crashed twice and glitched (everthing turned black except the things onn the same ""layer"" as the main character. In all cases, I had to restart the game to continue playing.The story is simple - no real character development happens, but it's a great way to spend a few hours. The handmade aesthetic is absolutely GORGEOUS - and had me saying it often throughotu the course of the 4 hours I spent in this world. The colouyrs are bright, the patterns are bold, and the music is all at once soothing and energizing. The sound design is excellent as well and overall adds to the immersion you get from playing this game. "

												While I love the art and the style of this game I can't actually enjoy it all that much. The game may be to complicated for me but I had to use help in the form of the Internet to solve MANY of these puzzles. The Handy manual was no help for me. I couldn't get any tip or idea from looking in the book. All in all I played the game and won't return for more sadly. Sadly enough the story and the game feels done, there is no replay value for me. I would suggest you get this game if you are either a lover of hard, complex and sometimes impossible puzzles.			"

												Pros:The game looks beautiful. The fact that it was made by filming real paper construction gives it a distinctive look, and makes it look more real than a lot of CGI.The puzzles are fair. If you have to resort to a walkthrough, you won't be shaking your head, wondering how you were supposed to figure that out.Cons:I said above that the puzzles are fair. But some of them are tough. At least, harder than I enjoyed.The in-game help system uses simple equations to give a page number in the manual that Lumi carries with her. For instance, ""Number of cogs x 100""; if there are three cogs in the puzzle that this refers to, the solution would be on page 300. But some of these clues are ambiguous: are you supposed to count the cogs that were already placed for you? Or just the ones you need to place yourself? And maybe it's not clear what constitutes a cog.Bottom line:A fun puzzler with beautiful visuals.			"

												This is such an enjoyable puzzle game. Even finding the clues in the handy book require just enough math to engage you, but without being difficult. The way the models were built is very beautiful and makes for a truly unique experience. The feel of the game is very nostalgic. It feels like a bygone era where everyone's problems were simple, nobody really needed much more than the simple conmforts of their own home, and people were satisfied with what they had.My only wish is that since I use a 65"" 4K TV as my monitor, I would like to have a higher resolution option. That would make the game sparkle when showing it off to friends and family.Made it harder to read text and things were pixely.			"

												Lumino City was so good I played through the entire game in one sitting (about 6 hours).  The scenery is real with the characters superimposed digital models.  That might sound hokey but the execution is nearly flawless.  at times I felt like a make-believe paper city had sprung to life in my imagination.  I thought the puzzles were very well designed and logical, challenging yet not frustrating.  Overall this was one of the best puzzle games I've played in a long time.			"

												Cute, short game. Lumino City is a point and click adventure with about 15 areas with about 30 puzzles. You can finish the game in about 5 to 10 hours.Pro: The game is a work of art, in the literal sense: the world in which the adventure takes place, Lumino City, is hand-crafted from card board. It was filmed with motion control camera, and the main character was digitally added in the scenes. The world feels engaging and environment rich (many books in shelves can be examined and have actual content).Pro: I enjoyed the puzzles, they were fun, and reasonably simple. I did use the Handyman book a few times, and the level of hints was good. The interface is intuitive and minimalistic, which works well for this game.Con: As with most adventure games, the ending is pretty abrupt and slightly disappointing -- it's the journey that counts, and that's where Lumino City delivers. The linear storyline seems secondary to the puzzles.I would recommend this game for it's engaging story, and well-executed puzzles. A few puzzles where too simple for me, some a bit frustrating, but the handybook proved helpful in those cases. Given the lenght of this game, I would expect a price point of about €10. I would recommend picking it up in a bundle or on sale.			"

												This is a pretty great game. It's beautifully shot and the animation is charming. Also much better than the previous game. I found it difficult at times for little things like perspective (where I was stuck only because I couldn't see open doorways etc.) and where the focus was. Sometimes I wouldn't see the red arrows that direct you to different areas because of their fuzziness. I also did not realize until very late in the game the Handy Manual's use for hints. It's not that obvious unless you flip page by page, but even then, you have to flip through several pages before you notice it contains puzzle hints: made somewhat daunting by the fact the book is hundreds of pages long. Other than those things, a good game that can keep you occupied for hours.			"

												Clever puzzle game, great art and music. Puzzles are a tad on the easier side, but they are fun and satisfying to complete. The trailer gives a pretty good concept of what you'll be running into- tape mechanisms, gear machines, etc. They're very fun to put together, and the puzzles don't give themselves away when you're ""right"". What I mean is often in puzzle games you place a piece and if it's right it ""clicks"" in and starts doing something- all of the pieces click in and may move but won't complete your objective, which makes a much more cerebral puzzle.The book the game gives you is fantastic and well detailed and quite clever.Certainly worth checking out if you're intrigued by the trailer.

												I got this game for a buck in a Humble Bundle and I regret... only paying a buck for it. It's a beautiful adventure game, with an awesome built-in help system. The only complaint I have against it is the way the help system is integrated into the game. You find a ""handymanual"" at the start, and it seems like you're required to consult it in order to solve the puzzles. But, in actuality, using the handymanual is completely optional, and using it will give you the exact solutions to the puzzles you're facing. This makes the game feel like it's too easy, as if you're just being hand-holded through the entire experience. Resist the temptation to consult the handymanual, however, and Lumino City is a delightful adventure with some challengingly rewarding brain teasers, and well worth purchasing at full price.			"

												It is a point and click adventure game with nice art styles. The play time is around 5 hours. The puzzles are generally good. Total number of puzzles are around 25. I didn't understand a few of them and had to lookup on the Internet, because the in game solution book is a little hard to navigate. The game does have a few glitches during play and crash approximately 4 times. It isn't too bad. There is no resolution or graphics adjustment option, but the game's graphics isn't too demanding either.I would recommend this game when it is on sale for a few dollars.

												Personally, I feel a bit on the fence about this one.  The visual design is quite intriguing and I like the way the areas are connected to one another.  I also really like the way the hint system is incorporated (not that it's ever really needed).  I sometimes would look at the hint for a puzzle after I solved the puzzle itself to see what that page of the hint book looked liked.What I don't care for is that there's really nothing going on in the story, and there's too much dialogue when there should really be next to none.  The game is about showing us the world not listening to a woman complain about her husband using too much salt on his hamburgers.  That stuff does nothing for me.  Also the more traditional inventory style puzzle you must complete to get to the combination/slider block/what have you sorts of puzzles are a bit annoying.  Running back and forth over the screen to give this item to that person is tedious when you have to go up and down ladders and wait for the world to rotate.  That's all quite fun the first time on each new area, after that I'd rather she somehow just warp, I guess, or even better, just have everything you need to unlock the next puzzle on the same screen.It's beautiful, but shallow I suppose.  Buy it if you want something to look at, not if you want to crack your brain on some hard puzzles or laugh at witty dialogue.			"

												An amazing point & click puzzle game, challenging to the right point and even great in graphics!I love how the whole paper-built set looks like while playing, and I've loved at all the puzzles through the whole game; some of them where quite easy to solve, some others really challenged me, and that's what I'm looking for when I buy a game. I can't find but pros, the puzzles are always different, there are no repeated pattern and if you don't get through them at all you can always try to get through the manual you're given... If you get to understand the tricky index! ;) Also the animation goes on smoothly and without any lags/bugs/issues and the artwork is just so colorful and amazing that it drives the player to go on and on to discover even more. Totally worth the money!			"

												This game was a very enjoyable experience. I am not too great at puzzle games, but this felt like it was a tad on the easier side, but the puzzles were very fun to solve. The artwork in this handmade game is gorgeous and definitely caused me to stop a few times and admire the scenery. 100% recommended for anybody looking for an enjoyable puzzle game.			"

												First off, the 22 hours was because I left it running. I think the total time was around 5 hours of play.I really enjoyed this game. I'm a big fan of point and click adventure games that tell a great story. I did find the story a little lacking as it was more of go figure out how to get to the end to learn more. But overall, the puzzles and the complexity of them was just a perfect balance. Not too difficult, but almost all required you to think.I did pick this up on sale. If it wasn't for that, I probably wouldn't have played it as I feel the current price is too high for an older game of this style. But if you can get it on sale, certainly pick it up, well worth the play through.			"

												Love the artwork but the puzzles are not as hard as the 'Where can I find the tool for this next spot because I'm obviously missing something'. I overlooked a spanner and it set me back for a while trying to figure out how to turn off water when I knew what to do just not how to go about it. Some of the puzzles tend to be more tedious and if you don't click in the right spot at the right time you have to wait through some animations without ability to cancel.Had a major issue in the boat scene - had the main character standing/floating in air while the boat was moving and I couldn't see where I was. Even after reloading the save file the main character would be standing still cut/pasted on top of things while the boat was rockin' wild. The rocking animation would also skip instead of being smooth for it's loop and I can't understand how that could be missed in playtesting.The game shines with the camera angles and artwork. They did put a lot into the style and I'll still keep an eye out for other releases. If you do pick this up, try the first game to see what you think of it. Due to the major pixel hunting or clicking luck needed in some areas (drawers that won't seem to open even if you do click them) for advancement items I can't recommend this game.			"

												Lumino City is STUNNING to look at. The fact it was hand crafted and not made on a computer makes it really, really special. Every scene is imaginative and full of surprises. Such a beautiful, unique game.Gameplay-wise, it's a simple adventure/escape the room game filled with puzzles. They require a bit of thinking, but are not very hard, which, for me, was a plus. You don't want to feel frustrated in a game like this, it was meant to be a chilling, pleasurable experience. And it really is.The only criticism I have is that there's one puzzle which doesn't work on some computers and it hasn't been fixed since the release. There is a way to get to another scene, I found it on the internet, but it felt like cheating and I missed an important cutscene. Shame it's not fixed!			"

												Incredibly pretty game in which you attempt to find your grandfather.Some of the puzzles are really nice and there's very minimal hand holding. It's definitely worth clicking around and exploring everything. Right at the beginning you are provided with a book that actually contains the solutions to all the puzzles in the game. I actually found this a really interesting way to do a hint system, although less hint-y than outright solve-y. Nevertheless it is an 800+ page book filled with vast quantities of stuff. Despite this it is still reasonably easy to find the puzzles you are looking for if you get stuck (or just don't fancy faffing around with a bunch of gears again) whilst at the same time solutions to puzzles you haven't reached yet don't really stand out and spoiler themselves due to all the other info in there.There are some points where your character will move from one place to another in sequences that are beautiful to watch the first time and then just rather annoying when you misclick and have to watch them wander back and fourth just to return you to where you already were. There are also a few times where clicking the exact right spot to get  your character to move/interact with something feels a little sticky and fair warning I did experience one crash however the game's save system meant I didn't lose any progress.Overall though, the puzzles are beautifully done and mostly have some lovely ideas behind them, the story is charming and the art style is just incredible. It is relatively short (4-5 hours), which I think puts the price point rather high - I know I would have missed out on this had it not come up in a bundle and that would have been a shame. Although I normally have no problem saying a game is not worth picking up at full price, there is something about this one that makes me think that for a lot of people it probably will be.			"

												I had played Lume a couple of years ago and while I really liked the visuals, I found the story childish and the puzzles non original and kinda easy. But Lume was like a promo of what the creators really had in mind doing for a full length game, hence Lumino City. While I do recommned Lumino City, I'm sorry to say that it just felt like a full length Lume, which is to say more beautiful scenes and visuals but also, an even more childish story and many many non original (and some stupid) puzzles.

												A really well thought out and executed game. I really appreciated the fact that the entire game was set in a physical location that was filmed. It was really different and visually interesting. The puzzles weren't too impossible but they weren't so simple that I wasn't having fun - it seemed to strike the right balance. I also really liked that that game included a hints guide, but that you had to do some math to actually access it.I played this through in nearly one sitting, and only stopped mid-way so I could sleep. After the first ten minutes, I knew this game was something special and began telling friends they had to buy it. The only downside to this is that I don't think there's much replayability, at least in the short-term. I may revisit this again in a few years once my brain has forgotten the finer points of the plot.			"

												Pros:The game looks beautiful. The fact that it was made by filming real paper construction gives it a distinctive look, and makes it look more real than a lot of CGI.The puzzles are fair. If you have to resort to a walkthrough, you won't be shaking your head, wondering how you were supposed to figure that out.Cons:I said above that the puzzles are fair. But some of them are tough. At least, harder than I enjoyed.The in-game help system uses simple equations to give a page number in the manual that Lumi carries with her. For instance, ""Number of cogs x 100""; if there are three cogs in the puzzle that this refers to, the solution would be on page 300. But some of these clues are ambiguous: are you supposed to count the cogs that were already placed for you? Or just the ones you need to place yourself? And maybe it's not clear what constitutes a cog.Bottom line:A fun puzzler with beautiful visuals.			"

												If there was an ""eh"" option for ""do you recommen this game?"" thats what I would pick. It's very cute, and the puzzles are good, but sometimes it's hard to tell what you need to do next, and it was frustrating that the character Lumi could only stand in certain spots (though maybe that is just a matter of personal preference. I like to wander). The table of contents for the Handy Manual (what works essentially as a key to all the puzzles and the city as a whole) was often really hard to understand and use. As a whole, it felt like more effort was put into the scenery and the math problems of the table of contents then anything else... which might not be bad, depending on what you want from a game...

The way the models were built is very beautiful and makes for a truly unique experience. The feel of the game is very nostalgic. It feels like a bygone era where everyone's problems were simple, nobody really needed much more than the simple conmforts of their own home, and people were satisfied with what they had.My only wish is that since I use a 65"" 4K TV as my monitor, I would like to have a higher resolution option. That would make the game sparkle when showing it off to friends and family.Made it harder to read text and things were pixely.			"

												Great little adventure/p&c click indie gem. Good puzzles, unique and amazing artstyle, fitting and relaxing music.I'm a point & click veteran and I can't praise this game enough. It had everything it needed plus more.Let's start with the puzzles (most important part imo): They are logical (you don't have to jump through idiotic hoops to solve them), they are not too easy but also not too hard. Overall you get the same difficulty level throughout the game.The art is amazing. It's some mixture of props and computer animation. While I've seen this before, I have to say it's done extremly well in Lumino City, while also fitting it's world. The lovely atmosphere is underlined by the relaxing music.The plus(ses): Contrary to most puzzle/adventure games this game runs without a direct hint/help system. At the beginning you find a book that includes solutions/hints for the main puzzles. The crux of the matter is that you can only access them by solving another puzzle/math problem. The restricted accessibility encourages you to give it another try while it doesn't destroy the mood by giving solutions too willingly. Imo a great trade-off, done superiorly to any game I've seen before.Great gaming experience. Hard to explain, but the game comes with a lovely atmosphere and great puzzles that never pull you out of the fluid/smooth experience. The only time I came across something similar was in Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons.Ending thoughts: This game is mostly about it's puzzles, so you shouldn't expect too much character/story wise. Little girl solves puzzles to find her grandpa, that's mostly it (you also run into characters with side stories but nothing too big). There are end credits that also give you more of a background. Overall the game ran pretty well on my system (win7 64bit) and I ran into no bugs or crashes (feb '16).  Only thing I've noticed was the (partly) juddery end credits.			"

												8/10 objective rating PROS:- Visually rich; unique art style, vibrant colour, and fantastic texture- Puzzles are varied and challenging enough to remain fun throughout- Soundtrack is very pleasant to listen to and fits the theme of the game wellCONS:- Sometimes where you click triggers something that isn't at all close to where you clicked. There are some puzzles where this becomes really annoying since these collision mistakes take several seconds to correct.- The perspective on the game makes it hard to see what is accessible to the protagonist at times. You end up needing to click the screen a lot to be sure you're not missing things- The storyline, while cute, is nothing super special. It lacks a little depth and character development- Game glitched once and crashed twice (on a 7700 CPU & 1060 GPU w/ 16gb RAM)-----------------------------------------------------------------------Lumino City was a pleasant surprise. My husband picked it up in a humble bundle and after deciding it wasn't for him, and I redeemed the code. It sat in my inventory for over a year until one day I decided to stream it on Twitch. My viewers enjoyed helping me solve the puzzles and enjoyed the music/visuals.If you are a seasoned puzzle solver, I'm sure these would seem on the easier end of the spectrum (except for one or two potentially) They are, however, varied and provide a vast array of things to do as you continue your journey. You are given a book to help you solve the puzzles at the beginning but I couldn't figure out how to use the clues to help me, so I didn't open it the entire time.Some control issues occured with certain puzzles where I triggered events accidentally because the hit box for that actuion was so big (I would click 1 to 2 inches away from the trigger and it would trigger it just the same) The game crashed twice and glitched (everthing turned black except the things onn the same ""layer"" as the main character. In all cases, I had to restart the game to continue playing.The story is simple - no real character development happens, but it's a great way to spend a few hours. The handmade aesthetic is absolutely GORGEOUS - and had me saying it often throughotu the course of the 4 hours I spent in this world. The colouyrs are bright, the patterns are bold, and the music is all at once soothing and energizing. The sound design is excellent as well and overall adds to the immersion you get from playing this game. "

It has a low replayability, but the story is amazing, and the game will take you around 5-10 hours to complete depending on how patient you are. The hint system makes you bust out a calculator in order to get your hint, and the characters are amazingly made.  The music as well is calming, and beautiful. 9/10			"

But we did have occasional frustrations; we had to resort to a walkthrough a few times because it wasn't obvious which part of this beautiful little world we needed to click on to make things happen.Still, Lumino City is a delight to spend time in, and the pleasure of exploring it far outweighed the few snags. Most puzzles are clever and interesting, and everything looks amazing.

												The most gorgeous point and click adventure ever. The puzzles were all cleverly designed and fun, even though sometimes it's not entirely clear which parts of the environment are interactable, I guess that's the trade off they had to make to get the style entirely ""analogue"" and coherent. I never found the solution to be far fetched or non-sensical, quite the opposite, the game stays away from exotic item combination and I was able to solve all of the puzzles after some thinking or experimentation, but if you ever encounter problems, the game provides an elegant help in form of a guide. Meanwhile you get to enjoy the relaxing and beautiful ambient soundtrack.Got it for 5€ during a sale, for that price it's a no brainer. I completed it in around 7 hours, but the experience and supporting the devs would have easily been worth the full price.			"

It feels like a bygone era where everyone's problems were simple, nobody really needed much more than the simple conmforts of their own home, and people were satisfied with what they had.My only wish is that since I use a 65"" 4K TV as my monitor, I would like to have a higher resolution option. That would make the game sparkle when showing it off to friends and family.Made it harder to read text and things were pixely.			"

												Very beautiful and lovely game. Soothing music and simple geometric graphics, I can see the art of handicraft popping out of the screen. The handmade nature of this game really made it stand out, making it a unique experience for me.As for the puzzles, some are not so intuitive; there are some moments I just don't know where to click. Some of the puzzles are less challenging than the others. I think this is a game that is made to be finished in one sitting, so despite it simplicity, you can get the full story in a nice sunday afternoon.I have experienced a few crashes with this game. That would not stop me from recommending this game to others. I see it as an inspiration, a new angle to look at the flooding game markets today. I look forward to see more works that break the rules and deliver the unprecedented.			"

												A hard game to review.In my opinion, you'll play this game to experience its art. The graphics are photos and videos of an amazing little model city. It's gorgeous. All other graphic elements are amazing as well.Most other elements of the game, however, are mediocre. The game world, while incredibly beautiful, feels a bit empty and dead.The music is pretty boring in my opinion, soft chill tunes that melt into the background but aren't very memorable. The music gives, imho, the game a slightly melancholic feel, and combined with the game world feeling somewhat empty, it gets slightly depressing.The puzzles are unfortunately not very good in my opinion. They are very disassociated from the story, you know, like rather than designing puzzles that make sense from a story perspective, it's like a separate designer made some puzzles, gave them to the main game designer and said, ""force these into the story"". Also, they aren't that engaging on their own. Some are a bit entertaining, some are frustrating. The game never gets very difficult though and that's a good thing, since I just wanted to experience it visually.My conclusion is that this is an artistic game that isn't a lot of fun, but worth buying. Maybe not for its full price though. Depends on what you value in a game I guess.			"

												Lumino City is a hard game to consider.  On the one hand, I mostly enjoyed playing it; I certainly don't regret buying it.  On the other hand, it's worth asking why that is.  The gameplay features puzzles that can at times make little sense, and at times be frustrating.  But even if you can't solve them by clicking on everything, you're actually given an item that contains all the solutions, so there's not a huge amount of challenge.The story is largely told in the end credits, and is not that compelling anyway.  During the game itself, you're mostly just moving from one region to another with little in mind beyond the fact that you have nowhere else to go.  Since you (almost) never return to a region, you don't get to see what effect your actions have on the game world either.The setting is somewhere between inventive and inconsistent.  It's not quite clear to me what sort of scale everything is supposed to be; are the characters supposed to be real humans, and if so, how did everything get built?  How do things work?  I guess you could say the end credits give you an answer, but I think there's still a lot missing there.Where this game really stands out is the set.  The fact that the world was physically built and photographed gives everything a unique and beautiful look.  The animations of the backgrounds are based on physical things moving, and gives it sense of weight and realism.  It does mean you're usually stuck with a fixed camera, but I never found that a problem here.So in the end, I've decided I can recommend this game ... but not at full price.  This is definitely something you can wait till it goes on sale to pick up.  At the least, you'll get a couple of hours of unusually pretty things to look at.			"

												This is a pretty great game. It's beautifully shot and the animation is charming. Also much better than the previous game. I found it difficult at times for little things like perspective (where I was stuck only because I couldn't see open doorways etc.) and where the focus was. Sometimes I wouldn't see the red arrows that direct you to different areas because of their fuzziness. I also did not realize until very late in the game the Handy Manual's use for hints. It's not that obvious unless you flip page by page, but even then, you have to flip through several pages before you notice it contains puzzle hints: made somewhat daunting by the fact the book is hundreds of pages long. Other than those things, a good game that can keep you occupied for hours.			"

												Lumino City is primarily a puzzle game with some point-and-click adventure elements. The game relies heavily on its visual appeal and indeed, the hand-made sets look delightfully colorful, and overall the game has a charming atmosphere.There is a coherent backstory, too, but it doesn't get in the way of the gameplay. Instead, little clues are spread throughout the world, and all the pieces are tied together during the ending credits. Be sure to stick around for that! The gameplay is fairly simple. You play as Lumi, who explores the City in search of her grandfather. In practice that means figuring out how to move from one screen to the next, which often requires talking to some people, finding a key to open a lock, and so on. However, this part of the game is fairly simple, and the main challenge of the game is solving its 34 puzzles.The puzzles are a mix of visual and logic puzzles, and are generally entertaining, though not all of them are very inspired. Some concepts get recycled a few times, while in other cases the puzzle is more easily solved by trial-and-error than by logical thinking. There is one puzzle which relies heavily on memorization, others require diligent application of look-up tables. If you get stuck, there is an in-game manual where you can look up their solutions. I didn't need it on my playthrough, but I peeked in after the fact, and was disappointed to see that the manual immediately spoils the complete solution instead of providing hints. That seems like a wasted opportunity.At $20, the price is a little high for a game that should take around 6 hours to finish, especially since it has little replay value. Those who are on a budget should wait for a sale. That being said, the game itself is well worth your time.			"

												TL;DR: Lumino City is a good game, but not a 22 dollar game, I've seen games that offer similar play value for far less and triple A game end up about the same price when it's on sale. Long story short, get this only if it's 15 dollar or less (I got mine during sale for about 14 dollars).Video game have come a long way since it's early days; it has evolved, from a pubble of primodial ooze that is known as pong to the space faring VR era that's is taking mankind to infinity and beyond. In comparison, Lumino City is like something back from the bronze era, and it's hard to imagine something that archaic could be relevant in this day and age. However, even I wouldn't consider Lumino City relevant to the main stream video game, it is still a nicely done point and click adventure game nonetheless. The art style is particularly enjoyable. The soundtrack is fairly mild and forgettable but works well with the game in that it doesn't distract you from the game. The puzzle in the game is very interesting in combination with the artwork; despite the lack of challenge for most puzzle, I still enjoy it a lot.			"

												The aesthetic of the models, designs and typography are beautiful.I've replayed this twice now and the opening scene always resonates with me.Animated typography at its finest. (So, of course, I've suggested this game to a fellow graphic design friend. We both really love it for the designs alone.)If you're fond of puzzles and whimsy, this is the game for you.Prepare for a chill and calming experience all the way through.That being said, the game is very short. That is not to say the puzzles are not interesting and you won't get stumped at times, but the story is unfortunately very short. The story itself reads like a children's book overall, and there is nothing really complex going on from the start. Should definitely get it when it is on sale. Though there no doubt they put a lot of work into development, considering how short the game is, I would not say it is worth getting at full price.			"

												This game was incredible, the production team did a great job making these models in real life and this helps the game to be very human and touching. The riddles are sometimes complicated and somtimes simple, making the game intresting and rewarding from the fact that you can actually get some points where you get stuck and some others where you solve the puzzle in 1 minute and feel clever about it.The story is simple and not very developped however, and the whole game is mostly about going from a place to another and discovering some unique landscapes but it does not bothered me at all since the environements and the dialogs are quite enought to entertain you during the searchng parts.To conclude I must say this games was a real source of enjoyements and the idea and concepts behind it are incredible !Go for it, now !

Product received for free
												Out of all the giveaways that I received this season, this is what I get back to play the most. Not only because of the charm but because of the challenging puzzles. There are puzzles that make you want to cheat and read the handy manual, and you know what? That's okay. You can't be a genius all the time.One of the biggest gripes I had (just like the others) is Lumi's pathfinding on the levels. Sometimes she goes somewhere you don't want her to, probably because of the lack of hints on the level on which part she can walk/slide/climb/stand on. Sometimes she gives you clues about it, but most of the time you would look like a dumbass not knowing where to go.I also found it pretty frustrating to have a habit of looking at the puzzle, and as you progress, you look back at the puzzle guide and accidentally fully exit the puzzle to start all over again (some puzzles save your progress, some puzzles don't). But holy♥♥♥♥♥♥aren't the puzzles fun to interact with. I can't wait to build a beautiful aquaponics system sometime.Overall, if you love brain squeezing platforming games and like to be charmed by its amazing world, this game is for you.			"

												Lumino City is STUNNING to look at. The fact it was hand crafted and not made on a computer makes it really, really special. Every scene is imaginative and full of surprises. Such a beautiful, unique game.Gameplay-wise, it's a simple adventure/escape the room game filled with puzzles. They require a bit of thinking, but are not very hard, which, for me, was a plus. You don't want to feel frustrated in a game like this, it was meant to be a chilling, pleasurable experience. And it really is.The only criticism I have is that there's one puzzle which doesn't work on some computers and it hasn't been fixed since the release. There is a way to get to another scene, I found it on the internet, but it felt like cheating and I missed an important cutscene. Shame it's not fixed!			"

												It's good but not great. This game is not worth the asking price for such a sort puzzler, I would recommend getting it on sale, like -75% off sale.This is a great game with some minor flaws but others great point and click adventure.Out of 10:8/10 Graphics; The graphics are great except for an overuse of distance blur to give the levels clearer perspctive but I found it too much for some levels. Other than that the animation and backgrounds were amazing!5/10 Gameplay; It's hard to screw up a point and click game and Lumino City does well, for the most part.

												Lumino City is primarily a puzzle game with some point-and-click adventure elements. The game relies heavily on its visual appeal and indeed, the hand-made sets look delightfully colorful, and overall the game has a charming atmosphere.There is a coherent backstory, too, but it doesn't get in the way of the gameplay. Instead, little clues are spread throughout the world, and all the pieces are tied together during the ending credits. Be sure to stick around for that! The gameplay is fairly simple. You play as Lumi, who explores the City in search of her grandfather. In practice that means figuring out how to move from one screen to the next, which often requires talking to some people, finding a key to open a lock, and so on. However, this part of the game is fairly simple, and the main challenge of the game is solving its 34 puzzles.The puzzles are a mix of visual and logic puzzles, and are generally entertaining, though not all of them are very inspired. Some concepts get recycled a few times, while in other cases the puzzle is more easily solved by trial-and-error than by logical thinking. There is one puzzle which relies heavily on memorization, others require diligent application of look-up tables. If you get stuck, there is an in-game manual where you can look up their solutions. I didn't need it on my playthrough, but I peeked in after the fact, and was disappointed to see that the manual immediately spoils the complete solution instead of providing hints. That seems like a wasted opportunity.At $20, the price is a little high for a game that should take around 6 hours to finish, especially since it has little replay value. Those who are on a budget should wait for a sale. That being said, the game itself is well worth your time.			"

												Gorgeous. A good mix of puzzles -- some easier to figure out, others a bit harder, one or two where you have to click on juuust the right place. Loved the story. I was sad it was over. I may have to go back and reply this one just for the atmosphere.			"

												TL;DR: Lumino City is a good game, but not a 22 dollar game, I've seen games that offer similar play value for far less and triple A game end up about the same price when it's on sale. Long story short, get this only if it's 15 dollar or less (I got mine during sale for about 14 dollars).Video game have come a long way since it's early days; it has evolved, from a pubble of primodial ooze that is known as pong to the space faring VR era that's is taking mankind to infinity and beyond. In comparison, Lumino City is like something back from the bronze era, and it's hard to imagine something that archaic could be relevant in this day and age. However, even I wouldn't consider Lumino City relevant to the main stream video game, it is still a nicely done point and click adventure game nonetheless. The art style is particularly enjoyable. The soundtrack is fairly mild and forgettable but works well with the game in that it doesn't distract you from the game. The puzzle in the game is very interesting in combination with the artwork; despite the lack of challenge for most puzzle, I still enjoy it a lot.			"

Product received for free
												Out of all the giveaways that I received this season, this is what I get back to play the most. Not only because of the charm but because of the challenging puzzles. There are puzzles that make you want to cheat and read the handy manual, and you know what? That's okay. You can't be a genius all the time.One of the biggest gripes I had (just like the others) is Lumi's pathfinding on the levels. Sometimes she goes somewhere you don't want her to, probably because of the lack of hints on the level on which part she can walk/slide/climb/stand on. Sometimes she gives you clues about it, but most of the time you would look like a dumbass not knowing where to go.I also found it pretty frustrating to have a habit of looking at the puzzle, and as you progress, you look back at the puzzle guide and accidentally fully exit the puzzle to start all over again (some puzzles save your progress, some puzzles don't). But holy♥♥♥♥♥♥aren't the puzzles fun to interact with. I can't wait to build a beautiful aquaponics system sometime.Overall, if you love brain squeezing platforming games and like to be charmed by its amazing world, this game is for you.			"

												Love the artwork but the puzzles are not as hard as the 'Where can I find the tool for this next spot because I'm obviously missing something'. I overlooked a spanner and it set me back for a while trying to figure out how to turn off water when I knew what to do just not how to go about it. Some of the puzzles tend to be more tedious and if you don't click in the right spot at the right time you have to wait through some animations without ability to cancel.Had a major issue in the boat scene - had the main character standing/floating in air while the boat was moving and I couldn't see where I was. Even after reloading the save file the main character would be standing still cut/pasted on top of things while the boat was rockin' wild. The rocking animation would also skip instead of being smooth for it's loop and I can't understand how that could be missed in playtesting.The game shines with the camera angles and artwork. They did put a lot into the style and I'll still keep an eye out for other releases. If you do pick this up, try the first game to see what you think of it. Due to the major pixel hunting or clicking luck needed in some areas (drawers that won't seem to open even if you do click them) for advancement items I can't recommend this game.			"

												I bought this game a while back and forgot about it, but today I finally opened it up and I gotta say, I was immediately astounded by the sense of style and design of this game. The typography-focused intro and the diorama-esque levels of the game are equally cool and visually appealing.As far as the puzzles go, so far they seem sometimes-tricky but doable, but I don't know how that goes later into the game. I like it, though.			"

												It is immediately apparent that a great deal of love and care went into this game. The handmade sets, photographed and rendered into the game, look beautiful. The quirky world and the characters who inhabit it are funny and interesting. The music is excellent. And the puzzles themselves I personally found to be pitched perfectly - hard enough to be satisfying when you cracked them, but never so much that you'd get stuck forever and have to resort to finding out the answer online. The net result of these elements is that first and foremost, this is a fun game to play. Overall, I hugely enjoyed the time I spent exploring Lumino City, meeting its inhabitants, and solving its puzzles.			"

												The major issue me and my GF had with this game was lack of option to skip trough very time consuming and tedious animations. Sometimes you just click around hoping to find an item and instead your character keeps walking between scripted parts of the map achieving nothing. Being able to press ""space"" to make all this faster would significantly make the whole experiance much more interesting (although shorter).Amazing music, amazing graphics, unique style. But 20 Euro for 4-5 hours of gameplay is pretty weird - I got it from a bundle and I recommend buying this game only during sale time.			"

I'm a big fan of point and click adventure games that tell a great story. I did find the story a little lacking as it was more of go figure out how to get to the end to learn more. But overall, the puzzles and the complexity of them was just a perfect balance. Not too difficult, but almost all required you to think.I did pick this up on sale. If it wasn't for that, I probably wouldn't have played it as I feel the current price is too high for an older game of this style. But if you can get it on sale, certainly pick it up, well worth the play through.			"

												Lumino City is STUNNING to look at. The fact it was hand crafted and not made on a computer makes it really, really special. Every scene is imaginative and full of surprises. Such a beautiful, unique game.Gameplay-wise, it's a simple adventure/escape the room game filled with puzzles. They require a bit of thinking, but are not very hard, which, for me, was a plus. You don't want to feel frustrated in a game like this, it was meant to be a chilling, pleasurable experience. And it really is.The only criticism I have is that there's one puzzle which doesn't work on some computers and it hasn't been fixed since the release. There is a way to get to another scene, I found it on the internet, but it felt like cheating and I missed an important cutscene. Shame it's not fixed!			"

												Pros:The game looks beautiful. The fact that it was made by filming real paper construction gives it a distinctive look, and makes it look more real than a lot of CGI.The puzzles are fair. If you have to resort to a walkthrough, you won't be shaking your head, wondering how you were supposed to figure that out.Cons:I said above that the puzzles are fair. But some of them are tough. At least, harder than I enjoyed.The in-game help system uses simple equations to give a page number in the manual that Lumi carries with her. For instance, ""Number of cogs x 100""; if there are three cogs in the puzzle that this refers to, the solution would be on page 300. But some of these clues are ambiguous: are you supposed to count the cogs that were already placed for you? Or just the ones you need to place yourself? And maybe it's not clear what constitutes a cog.Bottom line:A fun puzzler with beautiful visuals.			"

												This is such an enjoyable puzzle game. Even finding the clues in the handy book require just enough math to engage you, but without being difficult. The way the models were built is very beautiful and makes for a truly unique experience. The feel of the game is very nostalgic. It feels like a bygone era where everyone's problems were simple, nobody really needed much more than the simple conmforts of their own home, and people were satisfied with what they had.My only wish is that since I use a 65"" 4K TV as my monitor, I would like to have a higher resolution option. That would make the game sparkle when showing it off to friends and family.Made it harder to read text and things were pixely.			"

												Lumino City is a great, clever little game.  It's a real treat for the eyes, too.  My wife and I took our time with it and finished in about 8 hours.  It could be completed much faster, but if you do that, you're missing the chance to really appreciate the little details.The puzzles that can be repeated until you figure them out (no game overs) and short episodes make it a relaxing casual game.  Some people experience glitches getting through one puzzle about 1/2 or 2/3 of the way through (we were stopped in our tracks) but emailing the developer via their website solved our problem.I saw a few people make negative comments about the end of the game (conclusion of the story).  I think they must not have paid attention to the animation happening during the story credits; it explains (nonverbally) the game's big mystery and what will happen next.I recommend this game, and I will happily buy other games from this developer.

After getting past that last crash bug, I hit a story event where a necessary trigger didn't fire and my character was stuck with no way to progressI'll revisit the review if the game is ever fixed, but currently it's only playable if you're willing to replay bugged sections, which I am not.

												I got the game during a Humble Bundle (for 1$)... I saw the video and I liked the graphics; they were pretty interesting for an indie game. I played it and then I LOVED it! Apart from the cute graphics, the game offers some exceptional puzzles, an intriguing story, its fair dose of suspense and a quite easy gameplay. It is the perfect game for those who never get bored thinking. Everything in it makes you work for your progress, from the puzzles to even the hint/solution book. Nothing is given away to you; you have to earn everything... That being said, I think that 20€ is a lot for an indie game. I would pay 5€, or in this case maybe even 10€, because of the great work put into it.			"

												I had fun with it, so I'll recommend it.The art is beautiful. That they've built the whole set as a physical object makes even more impressive.Once the facade is stripped away, what's left is a an okay puzzle game. Most of the puzzles have some rooting in physics and mechanics, which made them enjoyable to me.One nice addition is the Handy Manual. Once I get fed up, trying to solve some puzzle, I will usually just look it up on the interwebs. Here you can just look up the solution in-game. Feels a bit less like cheating that way.The story is the weakest part unfortunately. You are a little girl of undefined age visiting her grandpa. You leave gramps alone for a second and he immediately gets damsel-in-distressed (Yes, that is a verb now, You are very welcome). So you go off to find and save him. Yeaaaah....laziest video game trope ever, but gender-switched. Unfortunately it doesn't get any better further into the game.The justification for all the puzzles is that a bunch of people decided to live on a giant wheel, On top of that they've built everything in the most impractical way they could come up with. Also everything is broken.In conclusion: Looks nice Puzzles are good Barely any excuse for a story. "

I'm loving the characters and random little dialogue.The puzzles aren't insane (or I haven't gotten there yet) and make for a relaxing game. If you get stuck, you can look in the handyman's book and get help.			"

There are some really fun and good riddles which I never saw before in any other puzzle game.But:-Clunky controls-Slow movement-Uninterruptable actions-Boring main charakter-Walls of Text-Terrible Endingmake it really hard to like the game.

												The power is out, your granddad has gone missing, and you must save the city--one puzzle at a time! That's basically the story (and 90% of the character development is in the end credits, so stick around for that). But this is a fun puzzle game on par with Machinarium and other point-and-click puzzlers. There are the classic use-something-from-your inventory puzzles, as well as more traditional ones like ""push buttons to get all the lights to go out"" or ""connect these differently sized gears"" or ""decipher this code"" or ""do math to unlock this thing."" The puzzles are great, and there's a built-in hint system in the form of a manual you carry around with you, which is just a genius idea. The book is filled with diagrams (hundreds of pages, actually), and the hints are hidden within them. You have a list of hints at the front that take a little math to reveal the page number the related hint is on, or you can literally flip through every page to find them (they're generally in order, about one hint every 10-20 pages, and they're pretty easy to spot). Unfortunately, the hint book is incomplete, and I had to refer to the internet on a couple of puzzles simply because I was missing a tool that I couldn't see because of the art or I couldn't seem to access an area because of the UI. But all in all, great puzzles.Like Machinarium, it's main draw is also its main drawback: the art. The art is GREAT, a kind of craft meets photorealism. However, this makes it really difficult to distinguish what you can actually interact with in the game. The depth of field your character is currently in is sharp and crisp, with either the foreground or backround surrounding them with a kind of lens blur that adds a depth and photorealism to the world. Unfortunately, this means areas you can actually enter appear to be unimportant or inaccessible due to this blur. To add insult to injury, there is no way (to my knowledge) to highlight key hotspots. Your character can only walk to certain areas, and if you don't click those areas from certain other areas, your character won't move there, but since you can't find the hotspots sometimes except for random clicking, you just stand there clicking like an idiot until something happens. There was one puzzle where I was on a middle level, and in order for your character to understand the command to go to the bottom level, you had to go UP a level before the hotspot to the bottom level was even accessible. Your character wouldn't attempt to take the path of least resistance to a place you located unless you scouted the way for them. Every. Time. Frustrating. There are also a few, infrequent puzzles that require timing that were particularly finicky when it came to clicking on them because the hotspot was small and/or moving.The font of the dialogue bubbles is also really small, and obscured by a textured background. I was playing this on a widescreen monitor and I had to sit up close to the screen to read them. Also, you could click to advance (most) of the dialogue to get through faster, but it would automatically cycle through after a certain time. Don't look away from your screen without pausing first or you might miss a clue.So, overall, it's a good game (despite my main complaints, which 95% of them would have been solved with a hotspot highlighter function). But if you want a clever puzzler with great art and a clear aesthetic, you've found it. If you like puzzly point-and-clicks, you found it. It's got some rough edges, but it's worth a buy. I got mine in a Humble Bundle that I was buying for an entirely different game, so it was 100% worth it for what I got.7.5/10 for UI issues, but good puzzles.			"

												Lumino City is STUNNING to look at. The fact it was hand crafted and not made on a computer makes it really, really special. Every scene is imaginative and full of surprises. Such a beautiful, unique game.Gameplay-wise, it's a simple adventure/escape the room game filled with puzzles. They require a bit of thinking, but are not very hard, which, for me, was a plus. You don't want to feel frustrated in a game like this, it was meant to be a chilling, pleasurable experience. And it really is.The only criticism I have is that there's one puzzle which doesn't work on some computers and it hasn't been fixed since the release. There is a way to get to another scene, I found it on the internet, but it felt like cheating and I missed an important cutscene. Shame it's not fixed!			"

												Incredibly pretty game in which you attempt to find your grandfather.Some of the puzzles are really nice and there's very minimal hand holding. It's definitely worth clicking around and exploring everything. Right at the beginning you are provided with a book that actually contains the solutions to all the puzzles in the game. I actually found this a really interesting way to do a hint system, although less hint-y than outright solve-y. Nevertheless it is an 800+ page book filled with vast quantities of stuff. Despite this it is still reasonably easy to find the puzzles you are looking for if you get stuck (or just don't fancy faffing around with a bunch of gears again) whilst at the same time solutions to puzzles you haven't reached yet don't really stand out and spoiler themselves due to all the other info in there.There are some points where your character will move from one place to another in sequences that are beautiful to watch the first time and then just rather annoying when you misclick and have to watch them wander back and fourth just to return you to where you already were. There are also a few times where clicking the exact right spot to get  your character to move/interact with something feels a little sticky and fair warning I did experience one crash however the game's save system meant I didn't lose any progress.Overall though, the puzzles are beautifully done and mostly have some lovely ideas behind them, the story is charming and the art style is just incredible. It is relatively short (4-5 hours), which I think puts the price point rather high - I know I would have missed out on this had it not come up in a bundle and that would have been a shame. Although I normally have no problem saying a game is not worth picking up at full price, there is something about this one that makes me think that for a lot of people it probably will be.			"

												The major issue me and my GF had with this game was lack of option to skip trough very time consuming and tedious animations. Sometimes you just click around hoping to find an item and instead your character keeps walking between scripted parts of the map achieving nothing. Being able to press ""space"" to make all this faster would significantly make the whole experiance much more interesting (although shorter).Amazing music, amazing graphics, unique style. But 20 Euro for 4-5 hours of gameplay is pretty weird - I got it from a bundle and I recommend buying this game only during sale time.			"

One of the best parts was that there is no backtracking in this game which is rare for a point and click, i loved the fact your always moving forward even if it was a shame to leave some of the memorable characters or scenes behind. The game had a nice dry humour about it too.Some of the detail in the game is beyond belief the sheer quantity of work, mindblowing for a small indie studio. Even with its sometimes awkward player movement and occasional crash, its a unique experience and one worth checking out. Took 7.5 hours to finish.			"

												This game is fantastic. It's beautiful, sounds great, and is a decent puzzle challenge. I grew up playing games like Myst and the puzzles in Lumino City are artful, clever, and sometimes ridiculously difficult. The hint system can make things overly easy once you figure it out, but at least it in itself is a puzzle and takes a twist on traditional hints.The most amazing thing about this game is the art. The entire city is hand-crafted from paper by the artists - it's a real 3D model that they shot around and animated. The music and story are pretty cute and overall it's just a great indie game.Doesn't take long to complete, but is worth a replay every now and then, especially if you're prone to forgetting puzzles and details.

												Is this Lumino City or Lumosity?I played this game in short intervals because it stops being fun after playing for a short amount of time. The problems are the puzzles and controls. Too many puzzles feel more like brain training chores. Too many puzzles involve connecting A to B (with gears, lines, whatever) or flipping switches (but switch 1 also flips switch 4 and 5, etc). Too many puzzles have an easy solution but a tedious method of inputting said solution.As for the controls, sometimes the hotspots to click are unclear,  and movement can be frustrating since you can't interrupt a movement click. The game is beautiful to look at but a chore to play.			"

While the game was short, it had a good mix of environmental and static puzzles that all really felt like they made sense in the wonderful city the game had built. What made go from somewhat enjoying the game to really liking it was the enivornment.  The game is very relaxing, with a calming music and an interesting visual style.  The story is simple yet charming and is set in an environment that feels alive, but looking back was very small and linear in a good way.Gets a recommendation from me if you enjoy winding down with a simple relaxing game.

												Amazing environments, kudos to the team that created every building and structure. The soundtrack is amazing as well, and the whole game had a bit of a vintage feel to it. The puzzles are a bit tricky sometimes, but that's great! Really makes you think, especially since most of the clues are more intuitive. There's lots of places to explore and the game makes it very exciting to do so, the camera angles and lighting in this game are phenomenal. The story is very cute and the interactions with all of the citizens is very adorable. Every character really comes to life because of how they address their problems in different ways. The few downsides I would say are when a puzzle takes a bit too long and you lose focus or interest, so I would say this is a game meant for people whoe like to take their time to solve a puzzle and not just give up.  Also, if you've been going at a puzzle for 30 minutes or so, the fact that you can't cancel your actions gets tedious. If you click the wrong arrow, you have to wait until Lumi loads in that place before going back to go the right way.Pros:+ Beautiful environments+ Lovely camera angles+ Lovely soundtrack+ Variety of unique puzzles+ Very cute game+ Aesthetically pleasingCons:- Puzzles can become too difficult- Lack of cancelling animationtl;dr I reccommend this game for anyone who wants to look at an extremely wonderful environment while they're solving puzzles for a few hours and don't mind going back and forth and hearing the same sound effects for prolonged periods of time.

												Lumino City is as compelling as it is charming ! It's an absolute joy from the opening sequence, and the stunning animation / art style had me smiling with every new stage.It's unlike other point & click games, not only in its visual design, but also in its gameplay. Where most point & click adventures center around item hunting, Lumino City focuses almost exclusively on traditional puzzles and brainteasers. The puzzles are varied, and satisfying. It also comes with a built-in strategy guide at the intro to prevent players from bashing their heads against the wall at any given moment !Personally, I couldn't put it down until I beat it. Now that I have, I wish I had more of this strange, delighful, funny, clever world to explore. PROS: Visually, this game is a masterpiece. The blend of animation with real objects works flawlessly.  Its characters, and its world as a whole, are lovable, and memorable.  The puzzles are varied, from jigsaw to logic games to password-hacking. The in-game strategy guide/cheat sheet helps, too. CONS: The price, for the length. I did not buy this game for full price, or anything close. This game is art, without a doubt, but bear in mind a single playthrough is only about 6 hours.  The game lost a touch of its polish in the final chapters. Minor typos started to appear in characters' dialogues. Moreover, by the end, the puzzles seem to appear back-to-back without much personality in-between. That said, the ending is totally worth it. I also glitched out once (Lumi got stuck on the clothes-rack-ferris-wheel), but closing to the main menu and resuming let me continue without any lost progress. If steam achievements get added, I would absolutely play through the game again.9/10 do play.			"

												The art in this game is phenomenal, and it's clear that a ton of work went into making this game a reality. Sadly, the mechanics of the game don't live up to its aesthetics. Many of the puzzles just come down to trial and error, or have a simple solution but take a long time to enact.			"

												The art design in this game is beautiful and the story and characters are charming. They actually built real models for the city and photographed them. I enjoyed playing this short game but unfortunately some of the puzzles are frustrating and Illogical. The worst case being a morse code puzzle which I think is glitched. The puzzle randomly decides when to stop as you are inputting the dots and dashes. The developers offer a work around in the forums which involves skipping that chapter. The art is full of love but this game still needs some work.			"

												Beautifully crafted puzzle game with a wide variety of puzzle mechanics all using handmade sets and backdrops. Cute story, comfy music and amazing attention to detail in every section show how much the developers put into this game. Definitely pick it up if you enjoy puzzle games.			"

												You can play this game in a hit and miss style or you think before you act. If you take your time and connect all the dots this game is quite rewarding. If you play it ""trial and error""-like - it will take longer - but also you will have the time to enjoy the graphic design and  music even longer. So you win in both cases.			"

												Such a shame.I really wanted to like this game. I mean, I bought it & downloaded it & played it for a bit.You just don't understand what you got to do! You click everything hoping for something to happen. Such a frsutration.Nonetheless, unique animation & good music despite the subpar gameplay.			"
