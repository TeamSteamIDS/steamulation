												Deceptively simple but great fun to play and addictive as hell. My only real issue is that it's over a little too quickly, between 6-10 hours depending on how much you explore. It's got pretty good replay value too and I don't think you'll find too many other games as good as this in this price range. Definitely worth picking up!			"

												Steamworld Dig is a bit like a cross between Motherlode, Spelunky and a metroidvania. Motherlode because the game owes a lot to the concept of digging down into the earth, mining minerals and then selling them on the surface for gold to buy upgrades, which then enable you to dig deeper, take on more enemies etc. Spelunky because the main levels are procedurally generated, and the general feel of your character is quite similar to Spelunky (so much so that playing one after the other causes quite a bit of confusing pressing the wrong buttons!). Metroidvania because there are various caves that are set puzzles scattered throughout the main mine shafts, and completing them gives you upgrades that allow access to previously inaccessible areas. It's a compelling formula polished to a fine sheen here. There's a lot more depth (ho ho) to this game than first appears. I definitely dug it. In fact I'd say it's oresome. Ok, ok, I'll stop.			"

												At first, I didn't expect the game to be this fun; I was wrong.My first impression of the game was the art style, quite unique on its own. And after I decided to buy it and played through, it was getting more and more addictive. You will dig, dig, dig and find many precious things, then you will turn them into money, now you will take your money to buy stuff so you can dig, dig, dig better and faster.The adaptation of your playthrough, where you try to upgrade yourself (level-up and upgrade weapon/armor), is very well done. The gameplay's design is architechtural well built. The monsters get smarter and harder to kill, while you get stronger along the way. And it's all up to how you improve your character.It's that simple, but so much fun.			"

												Steamworld Dig is a delightful little action/platforming/mining game with solid controls, good pacing, and a charming art style. Dig for ores, avoid (or destroy) obstacles, upgrade your tools and abilities, and discover what's waiting at the bottom of the world. It starts off simply, but as you become stronger and better equipped, you'll find the environment and enemies ready to keep you on your toes. It never becomes overly challenging, though, nor does it wear out its welcome. I felt the 9 hours it took me to complete was just right, and I can definitely see playing through again some day to try to earn the achievements that I missed.In the meantime... bring on Steamworld Heist!

												Moving into Steamworld Dig, I knew two things. The first being that a tasty art style is not a good indicator of a game's quality, and two, that this was originally a handheld title. With these things in mind, I begin my journey into the depths of what turns out to be a charming and far more than competent Dig-Dug style, upgrade laden adventure.When you first enter the only town in the game - which acts as the hub for your adventure - you're limited by the only tool you possess: your trusty pickaxe. In this beginning portion of the game, where your only moves are to jump and slowly break away the dirt beside and beneath your feet, this game's handheld roots seem to become apparent, as there doesn't appear to be any sort of depth to what your doing nor any real goal other than to find your long lost uncle Rusty. I was almost tempted to quit and write it off here as nothing more than a simple throwaway time waster. Luckily I didn't, as the game's (limited) depth soon bubbles it's way to the surface.Your journey to find your uncle consists of digging deep and hard for minerals of varying value, which can be traded for currency, which in turn increases your ""level"" and the sorts of things that you can purchase. Finding these minerals is your primary goal in the game, as the ground gets harder the deeper you go, and your simple pickaxe won't always cut it. This is what drives the game, and caused me to play it for hours at a time: Upgrades! That feeling you get when you finally earn enough for that powerful new pickaxe or higher defense against the creepy crawlies that inhabit the underground persists throughout the duration of the game, and you'll have to do a lot of mining to earn enough for all of them. But you won't be able to stay down for hours, hoarding all of the loot you snag. You can only hold a finite amount of minerals, among other, upgradeable necessities, such as light and water, that you will need to replenish by returning to the surface. And that loot pouch fills up quickly, limiting how long you can explore at a time, and you will need upgrade it's capacity if you want to stay deeper for longer.As you progress, you will find brand new abilities that you will constantly have to utilize if you want to survive and loot the entirety of the world beneath the surface, like a powerful drill arm and the ability to leap larger distances. You will have to use every move you earn if you want to make it to the bottom; there are no useless abilities here.The world isn't limited to the drab and ordinary beneath that you start your journey, and soon opens up to several varying areas with far more dangerous traps and enemies, as well as more valuable loot. This is the sort of game that you need to stick with past the first hour, as prior to this point, it can seem like a boring and shallow experience. And in many ways, it is very limited by it's handheld origins. A full PC/Console sequel could very easily rectify any complaints I have, the greatest being the limited use of the minerals you find. For a game whose loot can so easily be associated with that of games like Terraria, Starbound or Minecraft, it feels like a massive waste of an opportunity to not utilize the minerals you find in the same way. Finding that last piece raritanium needed to craft the Quantum Drill Head is infinitely more exciting than just finding a gem that sells for the last few coins that you needed to just buy the thing. Especially given that the characters are all robots, it's a shame that there isn't any sort of customizable upgrade system in place, augmented by rare materials you can seek out.As simple as the experience is, it never gets boring. As you progress downwards, there is always a new ability to be discovered, hidden gem caches to dig up, and upgrades to buy. The game scratches that very special itch to find every last hidden object, and can make playtime range anywhere from 3-10 hours, depending on just how much you really need that final upgrade. As it is, Steamworld Dig is a fantastic time waster for the loot junkie needing a break from their poison of choice, even if the game does little more than scratch that itch for several hours. The potential for something far greater is there, and I truly do hope for a sequel that capitalizes on crafting systems already implemented in other similar titles. As a solid first entry, with a very real opportunity to make a fantastic sequel, I can only hope that the developers are already hard at work designing the next entry in the Steamworld series.			"

												Do you like mines? Do you like weird, steampunk robots? Do you enjoy Metroidvania style action platformers where you get a lot of upgrades and upgrade a lot of equipment?SteamWorld Dig may be right for you, as long as you don't mind the game's short, short length (I clocked in at 3 hours and 15 minutes), very slightly repetitive digging, and overall sort-of-Flash-game feel. The core gameplay loop is simple; dig through rocks to find gems and orbs, then make it back to town safely to upgrade your digging tool, water tank, health, or lantern, then rinse and repeat. It's fun, luckily, which stops it from feeling like a chore, but those of you looking for constantly changing ideas and gameplay should look elsewhere. The theme is interesting; a dusty desert, a dangerous and ramshackle mine, filled with all sorts of dangers, and a town with a couple robots like yourself, along with some robots who make their way to town as you progress through the game. The sound design is fun; lots of tinky tinks as you hit things with your pickaxe, and loud booms as dynamite goes off deep inside of a mineshaft. The story is essentially non-existent; you're told of your predecessor and handed the tools to complete what he'd started, and only at the end is there really another story beat. It's not a bad choice, per se, but if you were hoping for meaty lore and plot-heavy digging, you'll be disappointed.I liked SteamWorld Dig a lot, and had no problems with the short length. I wouldn't have minded more, and I felt like some of the tool upgrades and new gadgets were ultimately pointless, but I was satisfied with what I got. I'll happily keep an eye out for Image&Form's next game, wherever and whatever it may be.Overall rating: 7.5/10			"

												The biggest negative I'd levy against the game is a distinct lack of difficulty. Dying is definitely a risk, but taking damage feels somewhat arbitrary. After I became accustomed to the controls and mechanics, which was relatively quick, I rarely felt especially challenged.That said, it's a delight to play. The aesthetic is clean and beautiful, the sound (and music) is wonderful. In the roughly five hours it took me to complete, I never really had a dull moment. The sense of momentum is palpable. Very fun and definitely worth the low price.			"

												I like platformers. I especially love Spelunky and Super Meat Boy. I also enjoy games like Guacamelee and Raymond. So if you like them too you'll probably not like this game. I also like sandbox games like terraria and starbound. So this review might be helpful for people with the same taste. Don't expect from this game too much. It'll take 2-3 evenings. But before I count things I don't like I'd prefer to show positive side of deal:+ there is a plot+ funny NPC characters, their phrases+ beautiful simple pictureThat's all. It's ok for $4 game (I bought it during sale), but anyway I regret that I spent time and money for it. Now check things I don't like about this game:- It's really short. It took less than 5 hours to pass it completely including all ""puzzle"" caves. According to the game plot It has a claim to be continued, but it will be another game or DLC. It's better to be free patch/DLC. Otherwise, it'll not be worth.- Simple. No challenges at all. It's like walking in the park. Game process is slow and smooth. I didn't feel my self in dangerous until I met a boss. There is only one boss at the end of the game. Regular monsters are dump and predictable. They are easy to avoid or kill. Few ""puzzle"" caves require 2-5 minutes to pass because of they are obvious. And it's not big deal to die as you will be resurrected.- Routine. Yep, it's all about digging. Get deeper to get more resources to sell it to get more money to upgrade your ammunition to be able to get deeper... you got it. Defeat final boss. - Replayability. There is no replayability. No score table to compare your and another players progress, crack a records. No difficult levels. - More fun with company? No, thank you. I've got used to play with my wife together or with friend of mine. Games like Spelunky, Guacamelee allow me to enjoy company and a game at the same time. Regarding to SteamWorld Dig there is no multiplayer or hot seat. It's obvious from the game description but it's pity anyway.It's not an ideal game or a masterpiece. Just be ready if you're going to play. On the other hand, it was disposable fun you can enjoy yourself anyway and may be like it. Frankly, I can't recommend this game. I hope my review was helpful for you.			"

												Absolutely loved this game. It's a completely unique and original exploration-based platformer that brings back memories of Dig Dug, Terraria, and the classic ""Metroidvaina"" formula. Mixing a very plesant presentation, a well-implemented upgrade system, and most of all, an incredibly addictive risk/reward element that permeates through the entire gameplay experience, Steamworld Dig is a winner all around. I only wish it had been a bit longer, as I wanted the game to go on and on, but in the end, what better sign of a resonant game is there? Highly recommend this one!			"

												So, on the Surface, this game seems like a Dig Dug clone (modernized of course), but when you Dig a bit further, you realize the game has a lot of Depth to it. :)Seriously though, the developers obviously loved Dig Dug, but had the tools, resources, and drive to make an excellent modern game with RPG elements via equipment upgrades, a bit of a story which is somewhat resolved at the end (but still leaves room for a sequel that I understand is in the works), great looking setting, cool as heck music (kind of spaghetti western, Borderlands-ish), a nifty protagonist, and a lot of addictive gameplay.As simple as the game is, it really does offer a lot of depth. I wandered quite a bit and played for a bit more than 10 hours before encountering and defeating the main boss (actually the only boss fight really).This game was easily worth the price of admission. I highly recommend it. A great break from the uber serious titles out there. Good, light hearted fun.			"

												For those who spent hours playing Motherload on Miniclip during their childhood this is the perfect game. The game is based on the same prinicple (dig as deep as you can) but Steamworld Dig is way more diverse. Fight enemies, solve puzzles, all just so you can get that one ♥♥♥♥ing diamond for which you have to spend 20 minutes dying to get it, only to immediately sell it as soon as you reach the surface. Then you can spend your hard earned money on an upgrade which will be only good for the first 5 minutes you're underground and then you repeat the process of dying and upgrading.10/10 did not ruin childhood love for digging games			"

												When I first stumbled upon Steam World Dig on a daily deal, I didn’t expect too much.  It was cheap, it looked decent from the videos.  It promised platforming action, the oh so popular buzzword “Metroidvania” and more.  Once I got into it, I found that this game is a solid mix of all of those elements, all without trying too hard or being taking itself too serious.   That is to say, you’re not going to find yourself faced with any near impossible puzzles or jumps; just lots of exploring, discovering things and some light hearted puzzles. Don’t go in expecting Spelunky.  Don’t go in expecting Terraria, Mario or any other number of games that “Metroidvania” makes you think of.   Go in expecting a good way to blow twenty minutes at time, driven on with that carrot of digging your way to the next ‘level’.   Steam World Dig does a good job of blending all of these game elements together to give you a game that feels familiar without being a carbon copy of those that came before it.   Go in expecting that, you’ll have a good time. The game’s got a good sense of humor too, which is nice.   While something such as Spelunky or Battleblock Theater is great for short bursts of game play in between the interruptions of your real world life, Steam World will fill that gap nicely without the stress and anxiety!  Just relax, it’ll be okay! "

												caveat: Judging by achievements I'm about halfway into this, so maybe my opinion will change, but I'm also quickly reaching the point of ""do I even want to keep playing?"" (edit: After beating it - one thing may be a bug, I never saw one shopkeeper appear, but aside from that, no, the rest of this still stands)SWD is a game that tries to meld two cool concepts: the digging and exploration of a Terraria, and the 'levelling' and ability gain of a Metroidvania. The problem is that it drops the ball on both. The early game involves a LOT of back-and-forth between going into the mines, filling your pouch, and then returning to the surface. Do this a few times and you'll have sold back enough materials to level up the town's shopkeeper, and buy a new pick, and... okay, can you see where this is already starting to become an issue?As you dig down, there will be the occasional chamber to explore (basically a side-room to the large vertical shaft you continue down). This is basically where the Metroid influence comes in: single room puzzles that lead to one of the more limited currencies (did I mention there's more than just gold? there are also ORBS to upgrade things) or your actual upgrades. These rooms are fun! But you basically have to realize that they're few and far between, and it's like if you were playing, to keep this metaphor going, a version of Metroid where between every interesting room, there were about 10 of those vertical shaft levels and you needed to BATTLE YOUR WAY DOWN. With fall damage.To top it off, eventually the stuff you're digging down through becomes too hard for a pick to work on, so you need to find a drill... but because the game has the word ""Steam"" in the title, a lot of your abilities or items rely on your stored water as you go on. Water becomes really quite scarce, and at where I am now(? god I hope this changes), I can't refill that in town like everything else (I would have assumed the saloon lets me do this but nope). Everything but your basic pick and your run move is a limited-inventory item or requires water. EVERYTHING. HIGH-JUMPING requires steam power. Given that the basic pick straight up WILL NOT WORK to break things past a certain ore, this is easily the worst aspect of the game.Other small gripes: Combat bites, you need to be on top of enemies to hit them and you DO take contact damage, so that's risky as heck. (I just got a ranged weapon but IT NEEDS STEAM TO USE so that becomes another 'fun' tradeoff between ""can I dig or do I hit this dude from two squares away""). The grind is seriously irritating, if I try and beeline between the good rooms, I'm suddenly underleveled and can't buy the item that'll upgrade my drill and let me keep digging, so I've gotta go farm things in a dimly lit mining stage for ten minutes at a time.If this were tightened up a little, this could be a really cool game, but it's trying to do way too many things unsuccessfully to really make it above ""competent"".

												I have to admit, I am not a huge fan of platformers. SteamWorld Dig however convinced me. It's a very good game if you are ready to dig into it. Now if you wonder, why does a guy who does not like platformers buy a platformer, that's because the game was part of a bundle and I decided  to give it a shot. I didn't regret it.In SteamWorld Dig your uncle dies which makes you the new owner of a mine. Equipped with a pickaxe you start exploring the mine and it's secrets. You can find all kind or ore and minerals that you can sell to upgrade your equipment. During the course of the game you will upgrade your health, your armour, get better pickaxes, find drills and something like a jack-hammer, bigger bags, etc. A number of unfriendly creatures will cross your way and you will discover caves holding secrets left by your uncle. The underworld is divided into three major areas and the whole experience is wrapped in an interesting, simple story.The game starts a little boring during the first two hours but gets better and better the longer you play. So you need a little patience. After finishing the game I wanted to repeat it right away.Pros:- nice graphics- fantastic title melody, I even started whistling it at work- good controller support- very good overall game concept, the story, secrets, gadgets, it all makes perfect sense- becomes addictive the longer you play- it's fun- well balanced level of difficultyCons:- one achievement seemed bugged, I did not get it the first time (but the second time)			"

												From the discription, you might expect something like Terraria, but SteamWorld Dig isn't really like Terraria at all. The digging and mining is really just an exploration and optional upgrade mechanic, and there's no crafting. You just sell your ore and buy upgrades from shopkeepers. The game isn't a random sandbox either, it's very much an puzzle oriented exploration/adventure metroidvania game with preset, themed areas. As you explore you end up deeper and finding more and more caves, as well as new areas. The caves are puzzly setpieces, and the main caves give you a new free upgrade, which are usually required to access new areas. The side caves just have some ore (money, an optional upgrade resource) or orbs (the other optional upgrade resource). I enjoyed the puzzles and exploration. Fighting enemies isn't very interesting because you can't attack and move at the same time. That's good for puzzles, but makes fighting a matter of dodging, then standing still and timing your swings.Overall I really like game, but it's somewhat short. Five hours for the whole game, and only 3 areas plus one boss battle at the very end. I'm not complaining. It's long enough, but it's also a good game, so I'd like it to be longer.			"

The upgrade system added more depth to the gameplay while keeping things simple, if anything I would’ve liked additional content after clearing the game.  Español:  Corto pero entretenido, me tomo unas siete horas completarlo y eso que explore cada hueco y esquina, me atrevería a decir que pasar el juego sin desvíos tomaría alrededor de tres o cuatro horas.

												A surprisingly satisfying game about being a robot that digs in a mine inherited from his robot uncle, SteamWorld Dig isn't complicated, but it keeps you wanting to dig further as much to explore as to gather as many resources as you can. It's even pulled along with just enough story that it's a pretty well rounded game for something so simple. Striking a balance like that has the makings of a classic game.Works well with an Xbox 360 controller.8 out of 10, glad this game is mine (haha).			"

												This game's all parts are nice. I mean to know it isn't the game of the year but, I had that fun what I expected. Before I bought this game, I'm worrying to the game is too simple and too hard achievements. But not!  The story is not a big deal but, there are enough tales about the past and mystery for I enjoyed the game.  The game mechanism seems like simple but, THIS WAS NOT boring simple.  I don't know why but, I really like the Bots' (characters') voices. That sounds are really like as talking but, rather robotic or computer communications. I respect that developer who's made that sounds. Really good work, I think.  The designs are really awesome! All background of worlds match their stories and either of all worlds music! And one more thing about the musics that I didn't bore hearing all the time. So, another respect that developer who created those musics!  Good things: -Really good voice and sound effects. -Awesome designs and background stories. -I enough enjoy the game-play and musics. The musics are awesome! -To the achievement hunters: The achievements are not so hard, maybe except one, the [Master Prospector]. But, I guess to not impossible hard, I could obtain that the by my second play-through, although I used the [ALT+F4] trick.  Bad thing: -Just a few times frozen the game soon as I launched so, I didn't last much things. -Spoiler Alert! But I'm not sure about that. At the end I was a little bit sadly but, I dont know why, Rusty (main character) didn't come back of the underground and don't know why. I guess it is not exactly happy-end. So, I couldn't decided whether dramatic or other else end.  I recommend this game those who like nice sci-fi stories, mysteries and the simple (but do not boring simple) game-play.			"

												SteamWorld Dig is a fairly casual game. It is a good way to waste an hour here or there. You play Rusty, a steam powered robot who comes back to his hometown (population 3) to find out what happened to his father. Rusty's father was a miner and so down, down, down you go. Along the way you defeat critters (yes, there are dynamite totin' zombies, along with brutes who throw bottles of booze at you called ""Boozers"" instead of Bruisers) and dig up minerals to sell. With the gold you acquire you can upgrade your equipment. Essentially, you must upgrade your equipment because the deeper you go, the more damage you must do to the rocks to bust them up.There are three levels to the mine, and in each of the three levels there are three special caves you must enter in order to get equipment to survive the next section of the mine. There are also some bonus caves that are more ""puzzley"" containing high value minerals or orbs (needed along with gold for some upgrades).As I said, this is a casual game. It isn't too difficult. If you die, you loose 50% of your gold and get repaired in town. Although there are a couple of achievements you can get if you finish the entire game without dieing. The game looks nice. The three environments are distinct and have their own character. It reminds me of an app called Gem Miner, but with more polish. The game seems like it would be repetitive - bust rocks for a path, grab minerals, sell them and repeat - it is but still holds your attention.			"

												Steam World Dig reminds me of this old Xbox Live Indie game called Miner Dig Deep. They both have the same basic idea. Dig for valuable minerals, return to the surface to sell off your gains, buy new equipment & supplies, repeat. It's a simple concept but it's addictive and entertaining. Steamworld Dig adds to this concept and creates a very nice game.The goal of the game is to make your way to the bottom of an ancient underground labyrinth. Mostly you'll be digging your way through, however you'll make occasional detours to collect special upgrades. These upgrades include the ability to dig through rocks, fire projectiles, and eventually even double-jump. It's kinda comparable to Metroid, since you can use the upgrades to find better stuff in previous areas. There are also various creatures to deal with. There are a handful of ways to deal with them aside from just using your pickax. This game is really combat-oriented though, just consider it another obstacle in the way of your loot.Steamworld Dig is a very well-paced game. Aside from monsters, there are also traps and other issues that crop as your scour the depths. There might even be times where you can't find a way back up. Unless you can find a teleporter(or brought one with you), the only alternative will be very costly repairs. Getting crushed by rocks is also a thing that can happen. Really though, this is an easy game. It's very much something that you put in to relax for a bit.Not to say that this game doesn't have any challenge. There are end-game rankings as well as a variety of ways for you to challenge yourself. Maybe on your next play-through you can skimp on the health upgrades, or devise that perfect route to get through the game as fast as possible. For some one trip through the labyrinth is enough, but Steamworld Dig does offer more, and the good controls and playablity make for welcome return trips.			"

												This game reminds me of a lot of random things but that's just because it was like a straight up 1st impression which leads to this conclusion. 1st time i booted the game it reminded me right away of the animated movie ""Rango""[en.wikipedia.org] but a robot that came in town to dig underground in search for fortune. As i dig deeper with my not-so-strong pickaxe i was humming along ""Heigh-Ho"" from another animated movie Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs[en.wikipedia.org]. Random so far right!? So that's the presentation that gave me at 1st glance but its nothing negative. As i dug deeper i earn more money from the gems i found to buy tools and upgrades back in town and also discover new abilities in which will help me reach to obstacles  where i used to find it hard to reach at first. So this game is about exploration, discovery & creative puzzle solving. I like it, never knew that the game can get addicting overtime so: Pros:Colorful graphicsCharming presentation and setting (yeah there's a reason why you're a robot because of the abilities which is great!)Creative tools and abilitiesDigging can be addictingCons:The controls is a little bit lose and that usually got me digging the wrong dirt most of the time which made me miss the chance of getting that dirt full of gems onI recommend this game to those who like metroid, digdug, 2D puzzle adventure games.

												Strongely recommended. I loved it, have great level design and its addictive, but in a good way. At first I thought it was another sandbox, but turned out its an amazing adventure game. You dig your way to other caves, a simple but good story and there's no craft system: all ores are converted in money so you can buy upgrades. Simple, I loved it. Most games those days insist in add super complex crafting/equipment system, while many players (like myself) just want to enjoy an adventure. Its an easy game, no hard challenges, but fair ones. Patience is rewarded. There are few achievements but all really fair, makes me feel challenged to try them all. Nice replay. I just think the ending could add a little more, but it was fun anyway.

												SteamWorld Dig has been described as a Metroidvania exploratory platformer crossed with Terraria, but the only thing it really has in common with the latter is that your main action throughout the game is digging, so if you buy this expecting a sandbox game you may be disappointed.However what SteamWorld Dig does, and does quite well is offer a charming and quite addictive, if brief exploratory platforming experience that plays directly on the popularity of collecting loot, by quite literally having you spend a lot of the time mining for it!The 2D hand-drawn graphical style of the game is simple, but attractive, with a clear definition between different types of rocks which means you are left in no confusion as to what you need to do to advance, and the robot characters, somewhat reminiscent of the movie 'Robots' all have their distinct styles and personalities.Sound is also fairly understated, but again, it is used to good effect, with rumbles warning you of an impending rock fall or a metallic chink to let you know you can't break through a particular type of rock. Throughout the game you will regularly find upgrades that allow you to jump higher, run faster, break through new types of block etc, but unusually for this type of game, many of these are not really necessary for completing the game, and you could even skip unless you want to try and get all the achievements.Similarly, many of the upgrades you can buy from the vendors back in town are completely uneccessary, for instance you can buy maybe 6 or 7 different qualities of pickaxe, but once you've unlocked the mining drill fairly early in the game, the pickaxe becomes fairly redundant. That being said, it is still nice to have options, and returning to previous 'puzzle caves' with a new ability that allows you to reach a previously unattainable cache of ore is a nice touch, it's just a shame that it wasn't expanded upon more.The game also offers a basic level of resource management, with water to power your tool needing to be refilled by standing in pools, or the light that powers your vision underground needing to be recharged by returning to the surface, but rather than add something to the game, it actually detracts from the experience as you may on occasion find yourself quite literally stumbling around in the dark forced to spend ages trying to break through rocks with your pickaxe as you've run out of light and water. Annoyingly you have to return to the surface to refill your light gauge, but can not refill your water gauge there, so it can sometimes mean a lot of uncessesary backtracking, and feels like a tool to artificially extend the playing time of the game.In addition, the game  offers little in the way of real challenge, either in the sparse combat or the handful of puzzle based rooms dotted about the three distinct levels of the game, so any semi competent gamer will find it a breeze to complete in a few hours. To properly explore every nook and cranny will take a little longer, but there isn't really a great deal of incentive to do so.Despite the negatives though, I enjoyed playing through SteamWorld Dig, and feel that if the planned sequel is longer, with more advantage taken of the skills you earn while playing, then it would be a worthy purchase. As it stands, this game does feel like a missed opportunity, but the potential is definitely there, and I would recommend it to players who want a light-hearted and stress-free gaming experience, or to younger players.7/10			"

												I really wanted to like this game. After all, everyone else seemed to. I have A LOT of steam games and have trouble passing up a promising game when it goes on sale. This was the case with SteamWorld Dig. I read the reviews, looked at the screen shots, checked out the forums, etc. and this definitely sounded like a game that I would enjoy. It looks like bastion and looked like it would play like Terraria's awkward little brother. With that said, I was pretty disappointed when I realized that this game is essentially all of the mining components of Terraria without any of the depth of either of the aforementioned games. This game is great for killing some time, but that's about all it is: a time killer. I didn't laugh at all, and found it to be more or less a grind without any of the payout. It's linear - literally. You have a map that clearly shows that you cannot go right or left anymore, and you just keep digging down. Your pickaxe is your weapon and you can upgrade it, but there's no reward for exploration beyond getting a few more orbs or precious stones that you don't really need in the end. All in all, I beat this game because I paid for it. Had it been a mobile app I would have been a lot less critical, but it's not. I bought it because people were comparing it to games that I love (Terraria, Starbound, Bastion, etc) that are all surprisingly well polished (Starbound is still in the works, but a lot of fun to play) and much deeper than SteamWorld Dig can possibly hope to get. It's a very two dimensional game with a very two dimensional storyline. I kept hoping that it would get better and gain a bit more depth, but that only led to disappointment. If you like mind numbingly simple games than this might be a good pick for you, but I would suggest spending your money elsewhere if you don't enjoy grinding for hours on end.			"

												I just beat Steamworld Dig, with a little over 10 hours of gameplay.  I got it from a Humble Bundle, and it just kinda sat there in my library. I decided to give it a try.This game can easily be beaten in 2 hours, but I am a completionist and got a lot out of it. It's a nice game, but I wouldn't buy it for the $11 asking price (I'm a cheapass). If I wasn't broke, I'd surely pay $20 for this game. This is the developers first PC title, and it's impressive. It's a nice indie game, and definitely worth your time.For what it is, I give it a full 10/10.			"

												Super fun, potentially obsessive, and well-crafted. I enjoyed it so much that I played the entire game twice (first on 3DS, now on Steam). It's fun to watch friends play because everyone has a different digging style: some careful and slow, others curious and collecting every single gem, and the rest trying to reach the bottom as fast as possible.Several reviews reference Dig Dug, but I found the core mechanic more reminiscient Mr. Driller. Highly recommended.			"

												SteamWorld Dig is a very charming game about a robot digging for treasures in a Wild West scenario. The gameplay is an interesting mix of digging, platforming, some light puzzling and uncovering secrets while fighting some enemies here and there. One thing this game does really well is offering new gameplay elements at exactly the right times, keeping itself from getting stale. Over time you can unlock new abilities, which you can also upgrade that make the digging, traversing through the tunnels and fighting easier and more fun. The level design for some areas differs considerably from the rest, which results in quite a few surprises along the way. My first playthrough took me about 10 hours, but the game can apparently be completed in less than 2 ½ hours according to one of the achievements, but that requires some serious rushing, which I'm personally not a fan of.In conclusion: I had a great time with this game and highly recommend it!

												Rating: 8.5/10Overview: 2D PlatformerThe Good:+Good Art style with bright colorful visuals+The main premise of the game is that you dig further and further in the mine with a variety of tools, along the way you will collect minerals that have to be taken back to town to convert to cash which you then use to purchase upgrades that will make you dig faster and/or make you stronger.  In addition to your health you also have water and light. Water is used to power up some of your tools which can be refilled by finding water pools or killing enemies. Light is used to see which blocks contain minerals. Once your light goes out it becomes much harder to dig effectively although not impossible.   The farther you go into the mine the harder enemies become in addition to a variety of traps you have to watch out for. + Cute Simple storyline that fits the game+Addicting  gameplayThe AverageA fairly short game which can be beaten in roughly 3-4 hours. There are times when you can get 'stuck' and can't return back to town which can be frustrating but also a reminder to manage your resources better. Easy last bossConclusionSteamworld Dig is a simple game yet executed wonderfully.  Its a casual game that finds the sweet spot in terms of difficulty and fun.   "

												I will base this review off the ask:10$ for a 4-5hour game on a platform where similar, mining/adventuring games exist.Let me start that, having completed the game (within 4h), Steamworld Dig isn't a bad game. I just wouldn't recommend it because it lacks the stuff to be a good one.The first 1h is REALLY boring. You can barely jump/mine and all enemies are EXACTLY alike.If you're able to suffer through it, underneath it all, you'll *start* to have fun after you find a first few upgrades (drill, jump, etc.).But that's the problem with this game: it all ends as soon as it gets started.Within 3hours, you've found all the upgrades and FINALLY you can start to enjoy the game, right?Not really, because the game ends as soon as you find the good stuff (double jump, etc.).Conclusion:The developper abandonned his creation just as it got started.Let's compare alternativesTerraria/Starbound vs Steamworld DigPlenty of enemy AIs vs only 2/level (3levels)!10+ bossesvs 1Perfect controlsvs weird floaty controlsUseful and divers power-upsvs Useless Powerups (game ends as soon as you get them, so you can't use them)Clearly : get Terraria, then Starbound... then if you're REALLY BORED out of these 2, get this.

												Take the mining aspect of Terraria and some light Metriodvania aspects, mix it with a little Spelunky tunneling and you've got SteamWorld Dig. The game is as short as it needs to be as it keeps up the pace well except for the beginning. You will probably find that the first hour (without major upgrades) of the game is an exercise in tedium. The best part of the game comes when you are fully upgraded and you have a little more freedom to move around but that's only right at the end.The rate at which your resources run out (light, water, carrying capacity) serve as a way to keep you moving but sometimes mean a little bit of frustration as you have to keep returning to the surface before you're ready. The way the underground world is set up does provide quick puzzles as you attempt not to get stuck and gives you a constant challange but only once you start reaching the Old World where you start getting more obstacles.All in all, it was fun and I'm sure there are plenty of people out there that will love this. I just found it a little awkward at times but nothing that stops me from saying that it's well made, plenty polished and provided me 5 hours of entertainment (not rushed through but didn't get all the purchasables either).

												Now THIS is how you mix different game types together. Steamworld Dig blends together Metroid, Spelunky, and Terraria flawlessly. You play as Rusty, a robot that receives a mine from his uncle. From that sentence, you know plot doesn't matter here. The object is to dig deeper & deeper into your mine, gathering ores to sell so you can buy upgrades for the various tools you find while exploring. The game starts off a bit slow, but stick with it and you'll find a very nice risk & reward system. There's treasure everywhere, but there are also traps and enemies to fight. The graphics in Steamworld Dig look fantastic. Hand-drawn 2D sprites and excellent animation. Each playthrough is randomized, so you also have replay value. I only have a couple negatives for Steamworld. The music for me was somewhat forgettable, but that's a small complaint for a game of this quality. Also, I wish the game were a bit more challenging, but that's another small complaint.			"

												Unexpectedly good little game. Not overly long, but pretty fun. Don't be fooled by the store description, it really isn't much like Terraria. It's really more of a platformer with mining that rewards careful play rather than twitchy play. As a port from the Nintendo 3DS it is exceptional, though you I wish you could remap the keys.You can rush to finish the game fast, but you can also take your time exploring everything. Since the levels are randomly generated it does have some replay value though the ""special"" rooms you find are always the same.			"

												SteamWorld Dig is quite a fun mining game where you mine as deep as you can to earn ores and money to upgrade your tools and town. The achievements are interesting and I like some of the hidden easter eggs. The graphics are nice and the upgrades are hard to obtain in the beggining as well as the expendable items. Controls are wonky but it can all pass.>I'd give it around 8.5/10>Pros: Graphics, Achievements and Cards, you've got to be careful as to what you're doing until you get more items, death is punishing, upgrades are pretty cool, as you progress you unlock your town entirely.>Cons: Not that many different enemies, death can be too punishing, expensive expendables, wonky controls, controls make you lose some items by accidentaly pressing them, no way to get rid of the placed items/cannot be retrieved, some parts are very annoying.

												When I heard about this game, it sounded like a dream come true. Spelunky mixed with metroid and other classic platformers. When I actually played the game, it mostly held up to what I expected. It's very fun, and extremely tight in it's mechanics and controls. The game is really fun to play, and it's not too long and not too short.The only bad things I can say about it is that the game basically requires a controller. The WASD style controls are awful and I'm not sure you could realistically beat the game with them.The ending is very abrupt and somewhat depressing, too.Otherwise, I really reccomend this to anyone who enjoys exploration games, platformers, or like the old western theme. Definitely worth playing!			"

												SteamWorld Dig is one of the later, but more polished games to come out featuring an overworld hub and digging to the bottom in search of incrementally better gear and loot...I guess you could call the genre ""Mini-Minecraft"". From the looks of it, this one is not procedurally generated...or if it is, it's kept at a bare minimum. (screenshots of the first area in two separate save slots only differ in parallax positioning) It runs similar to some of the ones you might have seen on XBL Indie in the early 2010s: You have an overworld hub which grows as your quest progresses, you go down different sub-strata (which are marked on the minimap) and eventually you reach two different areas. There's also a number of challenge rooms where you can find upgrades and rare minerals, but most inventory items are disabled.Gameplay is decent, but keep in mind that it's slower paced than most games in the genre. Dirt and rocks take longer to destroy when you cross into the lower substrata and levels, even though their appearance doesn't change much throughout the game. To put it into context, dirt at the bottom of the last level takes 4 hits to destroy with the most powerful pickaxe. I get that it's meant to be one of those low-stress zen games, but it might be a little repetitive for some peoples' tastes. There's also a lot of backtracking caused by your tiny inventory -- at most you can only carry up to 16 small minerals, assuming they match perfectly in stacks of 4. I found this to be a poor design choice as a 5 hour playthrough can easily contain close to an hour of backtracking. You can by upgrades, but these upgrades come a bit slowly and detract from pickaxe upgrades which are also desperately needed. Teleporters also help alleviate this, but they cost 3 of a rare currency -- another questionable decision because both rare and common currency are finite. There's no technical reason to make an item that increases the game's enjoyability so hard to get.In spite of these complaints, the positives outweigh the negatives.Controls are solid, though you start out pretty weak...even by the standards of the genre. One tile high jump, slow movement speed, and fall damage that doesn't really befit a robot protagonist. This is one of those games where it's not until halfway that the controls on their own become fun to mess around with. My only complaint here is they took too long to give us the good stuff.The graphics are definitely its strongest point. The animations are solid, the characters are unique and detailed, while the backgrounds and enemy models really tell a story on their own. They tell you more about the world's history than the characters do. All graphics are at least 1080p.The sound is nice, but the music gets repetitive. The loops are fairly short and each level has only one tune. I think it's a total of 6 tunes: Intro, overworld, levels 1-3, and the final boss -- all quality pieces, just not really enough to carry a 3-5 hour game.All in all, a decent entry for the genre.			"

												While I was rather sceptical at first, Steamworld Dig proved to become a marvellous journey I repeated several times. The controls are spot on and very accurate, mechanics feel right and the game lets you get into a flow of making your way through your own dug tunnels after a while. At no point does the game feel dragged out, new worlds open exactly at the time you get used to the last one. Progression is quick without the game being short, it's easy to learn and fun to master and this has practically become my currently favourite platformer over night. "

												A great little gem, I highly recommend Steamworld Dig to anyone that enjoys platformers.The game feels familiar enough that there is not really anything new brought to the table, but still a solid game. The new moves are earned at a decent rate, and the upgrades are available for purchase about as fast as you can make the money to get them. I rarely felt I was waiting on a needed upgrade to progress.My only complaint, albeit a minor one, is that the game was rather short. Taking my time, the game took me 9.8 hours for a 100% complete run. The game can be done in under 2.5 hours from start to finish, according to the achievements.			"

												This is a really great, chill game that you can just zone out with. The loop of digging for more treasure, returning to the surface to sell off what you've found, upgrade your gear, and dive back in to dig for more treasure (but now faster and better) is actually incredibly relaxing. The moody post-apocalypse/wild west setting helps with this a great deal, as you have a great sense of atmosphere and it's utilized pretty well.The game introduces new ability upgrades at a pretty steady pace, and they usually serve a dual purpose: though there are often specific rooms built around solving puzzles using these upgrades, most of them also just help traverse the mines you've dug out. It's sort of like Metroid, but also not really.The game's a bit on the easy side, but that's not necessarily a complaint. That being said, some kind of ""New Game+"" that remixes the world a little more would be a welcome addition. But still. It's a heck of a nice game. I own it on multiple platforms now, and I've finished the game at least three times across everything I have it on. If that's not a ringing endorsement, I don't know what is.			"

												Steamworld Dig is an impressive little game. It reminded me a bit of Mr. Driller, but with deeper gameplay and without the timer. As the new mining bot in town it's your job to dig your way down the old mines and find as many minerals as you can while uncovering the story. Sell the minerals to the locals to gather money and buy upgrades. Upgrades you desperately need later on in the game, when enemies become tougher to kill and it literally takes seconds to destroy blocks.I guess you'll die several times during the game, which is totally fine. Even when I died I wanted to collect my dropped loot and go to that next mine. It evokes that 'one more time' feeling with every death.But like I said, it's a little game. And it can be finished in 3+ hours, depending on if you want to collect the achievements or not.The graphics are colorful, sharp and charming and look great on higher resolutions. The sounds consist of nothing but sound bites and background music, but they fit the game and get the job done. It doesn't even matter, the end result is awesome. Steamworld Dig is a great game and should be played by anyone who loves games.[Rating: 86/100]			"

												SteamWorld Dig was, on the whole, a fun experience. While it only clocked about 4-5 hours, I had fun the entire time, and had difficulty putting it down. That in and of itself is worth a recommendation, as my gaming attention span is difficult to hold. But I digress. The gameplay boils down to, well, digging and exploration. If you don't particularly value exploration and collection, I don't think this game is right for you. Digging to new depths, collecting Ore to sell, and gaining valueable upgrades is most of what you'll be doing. The graphics are very pleasant; it has a distinct, vibrant aesthetic that I very much enjoyed.However...- Feels short (~4 hours). Left me longing for more game.- Combat was somewhat frustrating. Thankfully, it's not to frequent.- Gameplay is somewhat tedious, with digging and returning to town to replenish light / looking to replenish resources.Still, overall I enjoyed the game, especially considering I got it in a $1 Humble Bundle. The recommendation is contingent if you enjoy these types of games, however. I think I'd rate it as a 7.5/10.			"

												I spent about 10 hours to 100% the game (complete all bonus caves, find all secrets, fully upgraded, beat the boss, dig out all minerals) and I won't play it any more. Frankly it is not a bad game but a game that doesn't reach my expectation. I hope this negative review can be a reference to those like me who only check negative reviews before buying any games.PROS:+ Nice graphic+ Do have a plot+ No bugs found+ Replayability (for those who found this game interesting)CONS:- Monotone gameplayAt the first few minutes I was expecting some tasks like finding someone trapped in the cave or some interactions like item crafting. Unfortunately the answer is no. The entire gameplay is repeating the cycle: dig - back to town - sell minerals - buy upgrades - go down - dig again. The NPCs do nothing other than basic trading and story telling.= Tiresome to get back to the town (main negative)There are many reasons that can force you to go back: low health, no lighting oil, no water, or your bag is full. It is not a problem unless it is time-consuming and boring. There are handful free portals in the cave. When your portal is at 400m and you digged 100m downward from the portal, you need to climb up 100m to your portal to go back to the town. If you want to dig deeper, you need to go down the 100m first. Supposing you've digged another 100m this time, you need to climb up 200m to go back, What bothers me a lot is that you need to detour to find a way up. So each time you want to go back, you might need to walk and jump for a long time, and you might have gone through this path for over 10 times. Of course you can buy a self-placed portal, but the price will double each time you buy it, and it cost the shiny blue balls (can't remember its name), which is a rare resource.- Plain fighting systemThe attack type and enemy variety are not rich. During the fight, there is no knockback effect, no HP bar for enemies and no dmg indicator jumping out. Don't expect too much on fighting. - Easy boss fightThe boss is not challenging at all. You just need to  use your mouse and keyboard .- Ordinary SoundtrackYou could get bored after listening to it over and over again. Personally it is also not my style and it makes me feel unconfortable rather than enjoyable.- MiscYou can't mine while jumping. You can't dig through the boundary (not an open world).CONCLUSION:You can get bored easily.			"

												If you can pick this game up for $5 or less, then do.  Sharp graphics, good upgrades, and not so challeging you'll want to pull your hair  out.  I beat it in the time on my record.  So the premis is, you got a guy, you dig down collecting gems for upgrades while avoiding and dipatching enemies.  Getting back and forth to town was easy, the upgrades were fun, and I never got too frustrated with this game.  I did have an issue where it crashed shortly after starting and I had to uninstall and re-install, but after that it was rock solid playing in windowed mode.  It doesn't take to long to beat, and not a lot of replay value, but I recomend picking it up if you find a good sale.			"

												SteamWorld Dig is an Arnold Palmer of Dig Dug and good old Metroidvania. The gameplay is solid if not a bit too straightforward: you dig. You will dig for gold to buy upgrades that will allow you to dig more efficiently, and so the vicious cycle will continue. There is some light combat, exploration, and platforming involved and it all plays out rather nicely. I really only tend to complain when games drag out, but SteamWorld seemed to just rush through itself. I almost feel like SteamWorld invited me over to play Legos, but then at the last second got insecure and just decided to rush through all the fun stuff rather than just enjoy a decent amount of time together. It’s really hardly a complaint, it is more of a backhanded encouragement: you were a nice little gem, I just wish there was more of you.  For the time that SteamWorld does stick around it is strangely enjoyable. I think I may actually have some fun with a digging simulator as this game managed to convince me that digging could be fun and wasn’t just for mining nerds. There is definitely some combat and exploration, and I do remember a bit of a challenge here or there.This is not a life changing game, but it is well oiled and worth a bit of your time. I can recommend it on sale for those don’t expect Guacamelee. "

												It's a fun little game. It's a metroidvania centered around mining. You go deeper and deeper, find ores, and can sell them on the surface. With the money you can buy upgrades like more health, faster mining and so on. In the mines you find little dungeons where you unlock new items like double jump, a drill, sprint, and other things like that. It's a short game. I beat it in 4ish hours. I feel like thats the perfect length for the game. At that point the mechanics are getting a little old, so it's a good time to end without dragging on.			"

												I've been meaning to play this for a while, and I finally got around to it. It's really good, as I'd heard.The formula is nothing particularly inovative: you dig for minerals, which you use to buy upgrades to dig better. But where this game really shines is that you have to think carefully about how you dig, so as not to render minerals inaccessable. Also, in addition to the main map, there are portals to puzzle levels, which give you an opportunity to find extra loot, as well as upgrades nessessary for progress.The final boss was a little annoying, but it only took me a couple of attempts. The story seems to be set up for a sequel—I'd be interested to see how they expand on the formula.			"

												An awesome, highly-polished game with great progression and fun gameplay mechanics.  Plays very smoothly w/ Xbox360 controller.  Sound design and direction in general are dramatically better than in most indie/budget games.  The billing of ""hybrid of Super Metroid and Terria"" is fair and accurate, though it lacks the vastness and complexity of those titles.  Not that it matters, in my opinion, as what IS here is handled exceptionally well and captivates throughout.The only knock against this game, in my book, is the length.  Exploring the vast majority of nooks and crannies, as well as backtracking regulary (more on this after the review) put me at 6h11m for completion.  Others are reporting clear times of around 3 hours, and knowing what I know now, I would assume that those people are enjoying the game even more than I did (and are probably even more upset about the game's brevity).  Overall I'd give this game an 8/10.  If the game were dramatically longer or lower-priced, I'd probably be calling it 9/10.  On a day when I had nothing important to do, and was really dying for a timekiller, this absolutely hit the spot and was worth the money.(spoilers ahead, read at own risk)I hate spoilers and I hate spoiling things for people, but there is one thing I reallllllly wish I knew before starting the game:Relatively early-on, you'll get a chance to buy a consumable item that allows faster travel to/from town.  Because the currency required for this item is very rare in the beginning, I was hesitant to use them.  In retrospect, I regret the additional time spent backtracking in lieu using these items.  If you're fairly thorough in your search, you'll find enough currency to buy at least a dozen of these items and still have enough left-over to buy all of the upgrades.  This will obviously cut your playtime down a bit, likely to the range of 3-5 hours, but you'll probably get a bit more enjoyment out of the game than I did!			"

												Skipped the 3DS eShop release, then I found out that this HD re-release hit Steam, so I got this version and went in to the experience blind.Honestly, this is one of the bigger pleasent surprises of 2013. At first the game feels like it shares a lot in common with Terraria, but as you advance further in it also shares a flavor of Metroid, with encouraged exploration and a gradual progression of upgrades, both purchased through exchanged loot or at key juncutres in the game.The goal of the game is to dig as far down as you possibly can, frequently re-emerging at the top to purchase supplies and gear before venturing even further. It sounds tedious, but surprisingly hooks you in and gives you that sense of real progress as you dig down mile upon mile, environment changing and hazards growing more deadly.What sets this game apart from the likes of Terraria, and what I find the most appealing about the game, is that the whole time you are working toward directed goals, instead of being left to your own devices. You can explore the caverns and go slightly off the beaten bath in search for treasure and loot, but the whole time you're inching toward the end of the inevitable pathway you carve out.It took me 6 hours to beat on my first playthrough, but the game itself features randomly-generated mines with each new save slot, giving you incentive to revisit the game and try it again with an unfamiliar layout. Highly recommended.			"

IntroductionDeveloped and published by Image & Form, SteamWorld Dig is a steampunk, mining adventure with a interesting story to keep you playing the game the whole way through. The game seems to be taking a sharp turn when it comes to the price of the game, but it would really depend on how many playthroughs you would want to go through on this game.GameplaySteamWorld Dig is thought to be basically a big mining adventure, whereby you explore the vast underground collecting ores for money and upgrading your equipment. Throughout the game you are given certain objectives to full-fill, most of the time you will need to dig underground to find a new area and collect new equipment that will help you on your journey. With the ores that you find underground you will be able to exchange them for money and level up as well. Leveling up will unlock upgrades for you to purchase in the small town that is your sanctuary for the game.Most of the time in games I personally don't really bother with the story line, it takes a large portion of the time I could be playing the game to reading or watching cut scenes to the story of the game. This game however was a exception and one of the few games that got my attention straight away with the story. It's a rather basic story line, not really going into much description but that just means less time reading and more time playing the game itself.The upgrades for your character are rather linear and not really as creative as I thought it would be. The basic upgrades are for your weapons/tools are basically the amount of damage it does or how effective it is for digging. You can also buy upgrades that increase your health, water storage size, your armour and other general elements to make the game a bit easier for you.I feel like the game itself could've been strung out a bit more than it did, I played the game for about 8 hours (played offline for a bit hence why it doesn't say 8 hours on steam) and was rather surprised when the game ended. I was hoping for some sort of new game+ or maybe a different kind of character to be, unfortunately there was none of that. This for me really made the game fall a bit further into the mine, seeing as I wouldn't really want to play the game a second time without something different in the game itself.This now leads me onto the price of the game, at full price you will be paying £6.99 (or your regional equivalent) and get at least 7-10 hours of gameplay. Now whether you feel the need to play the game a second time, or collect all the achievements would really depend if you buy the game for the full price. Luckily for myself, I bought it cheap for £1.74 and getting 8 hours of gameplay out of that is rather good.The graphics of the game are really fitting with the sort of steampunk aesthetic that the game is set in. The main character in town all look different from one another and have their own personalities when you talk to them so they don't just seem all the same. As for the enemies, I feel like there could've been more of them on each area. Some of them did seem kind of cheap and re skinned to look different but I feel like the games visuals overall really cover that fact and make the game look really nice. As well as the graphics of the game, the music was rather surprising to say the least. Throughout the game you will explore different ares underground, each different type of area will have it's own soundtrack and I feel like all of them really fit well with the surroundings of the game itself.Pros- Easy to pick up and play- Fun and addictive gameplay- Short and interesting story line- Characters have their own personalities- Visual aesthetic look really good with the steampunk vibe throughout the game- Great music throughout the gameCons- Upgrades feel rather linear and uncreative- Might want to hold off until the game goes on sale since the game is only 7-10 hours worth on a single playthrough, you might feel compelled to play the game multiple times, but I personally didn't- No new game+ or anything different if I played the game again after completing itResult / Final ThoughtsI personally feel like this is a gem of a game with a short but sweet story along with it. The game still however has room for improvement and I also feel like the game is a bit too short for the full asking price of the game. I would highly recommended waiting for a sale and then picking it up since you may or may not be playing through this game multiple times.Rating: 6.7/10For more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Lot's O Giveaway's curator group here.

												Repetitive. Very repetitive. Sure, you can purchase upgrades, but they're just stronger versions of your original equipment. Sure, you get new places and meet new enemies, but they're just stronger versions of the enemies in the first zone. This could have been a fun, procedural-world, exploration game, but the terrible lack of variety in items/moves/gameplay makes it a dud.			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed SteamWorld Dig! I definitely see the Metroidvanian influences, and I appreciated SWD's unique spin on them. The storyline kept me interested, along with a heavy dose of ""let's see what's even deeper down the rabbit hole"" curiosity. All in all, I'd definitely recommend SWD to others, especially if you're looking for a new game that's enjoyable while not being super intense and involved (e.g. I finished my first runthrough in just under 6h, and I was being pretty meticulous going through the first stages of the game). Well done, SWD!			"

												SteamWorld Dig is a heck of a lot of fun, although it's not a very big game.  It finds a very nice sweet spot between Metroidvania style platforming and Terraria-like endless crafting.  There is a dash of roguelike dungeon creation, but no crafting, and a very straightforward set of upgrades that progressively increase your range of abilities and add to the fun.  The game has a pleasing sense of style, with sharp graphics and a goofy Steampunk/Wild West setting. Like I said, it's not very long, with about 5-10 hours to complete the campaign.  I beat it in 7.5hrs (it tells you how long it took you to win) without trying to speedrun or uncover every secret. There is some replayability if you want to max out your performance by finding everything, not dying through an entire playthrough, etc. Definitely a solid little game though.			"

												This game is really fun, but I think that some people who don't like pure collecting might be turned off by the somewhat slow pace at the beginning of the game. It doesn't take long before it gets really interesting. It's a mix of platforming, exploration, strategy, and collecting items to upgrade your abilities. Later parts of the game are really exciting because of the increased amount of enemies and traps present. I really enjoyed playing it and collecting the upgrades, and I found the game to be really unique. Definitely something to try if you're into platforming games.			"

												It's a mashup of Dig Dug, action platformers, with a unique aesthetic and a charming feel to it. The art is clear, and there's no way to get too mixed up. The controls are tight--though I did have a little trouble with midair control--due to a certain level of inertia. It took me a few hours to beat, and there's an achievement for doing it around two and a half. So it's a bit of a bite size game, but overall, worth a few dollars.tl;dr Charming and fun and certainly worth having a few dollars thrown at.			"

												Heard a lot of great things about the 3DS version, so I was excited to see this show up on Steam. It's a cool miner/platforming game with bits of Metroid and Mr. Driller. Platforming control is really solid, especially the Mega Man X walljump. After the slow opening 15 minutes, the game really speeds up the sense of progression -- you're constantly upgrading your gear in meaningful ways, and the pace that you get new abilities never slows down. The cartoony steampunk/western aesthetic is great, too. The music isn't super catchy, but it does add to the tension as you dig deeper and deeper into the mine. Really neat stuff. Recommended.			"

												IntroductionSteamWorld Dig is a highly polished little gem that developer Image & Form have thankfully blessed PC gamers with the opportunity of playing. Originally released on the 3DS, the new version was beefed up for a proper PC release with HD visuals and a full suite of Steam features like achievements, trading cards, and cloud saves. It must be noted that this actually Image & Form’s first PC release as well, so congratulations to them on putting out a solid PC version.The game has you playing as a steam-powered Robot named Rusty who arrives to take over his Uncle’s mine, only to find out the poor bot has kicked the bucket. Naturally, Rusty takes his mining pick and follows in his Uncle’s footsteps by being the local miner for a town that is in great need of a replacement.GameplayThe gameplay of SteamWorld Dig is very simple, yet very hooking. It’s like a few parts Metroid and a little bit of Terraria with some DigDug sprinkled on top.As the new local miner, the townsfolk need you to start gathering precious metals and gems for them. Almost right away, you start heading down into the mine digging away with your new pickaxe looking for ore nodes. The underground is tile-based similar to terraria, so you’ll be breaking away large squares of dirt, rocks, and ore. When you’ve filled up your limited inventory, you can head back to the surface to sell your goodies in town. If you’ve gone too deep underground you may want to bring a teleporter with you to head back up, although there are pre-built ones in the mine at various locations.The money you earn in the game can be spent at one of many shops, which you will unlock more of as you progress through the game. These shops are run by quirky characters that sell numerous upgrades and consumable items to help you out such as lanterns and ladders. I loved how many upgrades there are in the game as it gives players an option to pick what sounds coolest to them in each playthrough.The shops are not the only place Rusty can get upgrades though. Similar to the Metroid series, you will find special platforms while exploring underground that give Rusty a new technology ability. These new abilities typically allow you to access a spot your weren’t able to before. Examples of these abilities include sprinting, a steam-powered drill, and the ever-so popular videogame skill, the double-jump. You never have to wait too long to find the next upgrade too, as the game provides them to you at a nice pace.On your way down the mine you will go through three distinct looking areas. I don’t want to spoil these, but if you watched any of my videos you may have seen them. Each area is truly unique, offering new gameplay elements and enemies. These areas are actually randomized in each playthrough as well, so it definitely encourages multiple playthroughs.While exploring these three underground areas, you will come across underground caves. Unlike the base underground, these caves are pre-built puzzle locations for Rusty to solve. A lot of these had some clever puzzle designs and I really enjoyed completing them. It’s within these caves that you can find new Technology upgrades and other goodies.The difficulty I felt was about the right level. A lot of the time it felt perhaps a bit too easy, but I did have my fair share of sudden deaths from huge explosions and falling rocks. The penalty of death is losing 50 percent of your gold and dropping all your precious ore in a bag on the ground. If you manage to head back down to that spot you can actually grab it.I have to note that the platforming controls are pretty much perfect in my opinion. The jumping and movement controls feel spot on. In some platforming games these controls can feel even a little off and it really hampers the overall experience. Props to Image & Form for joining the ranks of Nintendo when it comes to platforming controls.Before I knew it, I reached the end of the game. You can expect a playthrough to last anywhere between three to five hours depending on your speed, although completionists could definitely spend a few more hours beyond this.Unfortunately there is only one boss in the game, which you will fight at the game’s conclusion. This boss fight however was quite unique and fun to fight. It would have been cool to see a boss themed after the other two areas as well, and maybe we can expect more awesome bosses in SteamWorld Dig 2.GraphicsThe game looks absolultely stunning in HD. Not only that, but the framerate is a silky smooth 60 frames-per-second. It’s hard to imagine that this game was originally on the much smaller screened, less powerful 3DS. They did a tremendous job fancying it up for the PC release.Sound DesignI really “dug” the soundtrack as it had a Western sound to it that went well with the game’s overall theme. The sound effects were great too as you actually sounded like the hunk of metal you are when hitting the ground. The clank of your mining pick and grinding sound of the drill were satisfyingly spot on too.Wrapping It UpI can easily recommend purchasing SteamWorld Dig to just about any gamer, and especially those who love Metroidvania and/or mining games. From a design standpoint it is polished up to near perfection, although some gamers just might be left wanting more in terms of content. While the game is quite short, it can warrant multiple playthroughs and extra gameplay time spent finding all the hidden collectables and secrets. It must be remembered this is only the first venture into Rusty’s world though and perhaps SteamWorld Dig 2 will resolve any complaints some may have about his first game.My Full Review Post With Video Review: http://www.thegamecavern.com/steamworld-dig-review/ "

												This was and still is one of the greatest 3DS games I have played. Even if it was originally handheld (not mobile, actual handheld) game the dev has put amazing effort when porting it to PC. Not only there's every PC related setting you could wish for 2D game but game also looks amazing. Opposite of ongoing trend game isn't actually randomly generated but instead hand made single player experience, this is for those who though they would be bying Terraria and complain they didn't get one. I personally don't have any problems with that and that only means that all the maps are actually designed instead of brainless computer generated ones. That also means game there's not re-playability even if they have tried to make few actually challenging achievements. Personally I don't see problem here either as game's already cheaper that most mobile ports and is paced so you generally don't have feeling like you are doing same thing over and over. Basically if you have any interest in great looking metroid vania style platformer then keep this game in mind.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Tämä oli yksi ja on edelleen yksi parhaimpia 3DS pelejä mitä olen pelannut. Vaikka kyseessä onkin alunperin käsikonsolipeli, on kehittäjä tehnyt aivan mahtavaa työtä kääntäessä sitä tietokoneelle, ei pelkästään se että siitä löytyy aivan kaikki jutut mitä PC porttaukselta kaipaa, mutta peli myös näyttää upealta. Nykyisestä trendistä poiketen peli ei siis ole randomisti generoitu, vaan käsin tehty yksinpelikokemus, tämä siis niille jotka eivät sitten pety kun eivät saakaan Terrariaa. Itselläni ei todellakaan ollut ongelmaa tämän kanssa ja se vain tarkoittaa sitä että saat oikeasti suunniteltuja karttoja aivottomien tietokoneen tekemien sijaan. Se tosin myös tarkoittaa että peli tosiaan jää siihen 1-2 pelikertaan, vaikka ovatkin yrittäneet asiaa korjata oikeasti haastavilla saavutuksilla. Tässäkään en tosin myöskään näe ongelmaa kun peli on alunperinkin halvempi kuin suurin osa mobiiliporteista ja peli on ajoitettu niin että harvoin tulee fiilistä että tekee samaa asiaa liian moneen kertaan. Oikeastaan jos on yhtään kiinnostusta metroid vania tyyliseen tasohyppelyyn niin kannattaa pitää tämä peli mielessä. Tein pelille myös suomenkielisen käännöksen:

												Steamworld Dig is a game about digging down, collecting jewels, and seeing how far the mine you're in goes. This would normally make for an incredibly tedious experience, but a Metroid-style upgrade system that constantly makes the process of mining, and getting around in your mine, easier turns it into a highly enjoyable game that rewards you for taking the time to fully upgrade your character. One of the things Steamworld dig does best is that it remembers why movement upgrades were some of the most important upgrades in Metroid, and places an emphasis on making it easier to get around rather than simply giving you bigger and better tools.

												This is the first time I've purchased a game where you explore a randomly generated stage. My trepidation was quickly replaced with delight and addiction ! This game is awesome !1. You explore a mine / cave and get to constantly upgrade your items and skill.2. The creeps / bad guys come in a variety of forms. They keep you interested.3. Hazards within the stage vary at each turn.4. The in-game characters move the story along (not a very deep one but I enjoyed it anyway).5. The art work is very pleasing.6. The design of the game is very well thought of. You're given upgrades such as ladders / teleports to make sure the holes you leave on your foot when you shoot them is minimal.I managed to get to the final boss in one sitting. While the time spent playing the game was short, I would definitely recommend it.			"

												You might think a procedural Metroidvania can't work, and you'd normally be right... except Steamworld dig makes it work. It pulls a few tricks to make it all hang together (non-procedural bits that are designed around your abilities, abilities that don't so much gate progress as make it more possible to deal with situations that happen while you dig, etc), and it all comes together in a fun, cohesive whole.I beat it in about 5 hours, and had fun the entire time. It kind of pulls the rug out from under you for the last hour, and finishes with decently challenging and satisfying final area. Has a bunch of completionist things to do as well, if you're the sort that digs that stuff.Basically: Highly recommended to Metroidvania fans and platformer fans.			"

												Short (3-5 hours) game that scratches the itch to dig deep and find treasure. You get upgrades and can backtrack to get all the secrets but secret areas aren't very special other than the game telling you that you've found one. A slightly weak ending and I could see some less conservative players getting upset about the amount of backtracking you have to do. Still, it was a lot of fun and I enjoyed it, so for a few bucks I'd say it's worth it.			"

I've leveled out to max and bought almost all upgrades & completed the game in 10 hours. TO DEVELOPERS: would totally buy any DLC or a second part of this masterpiece!			"

												SteamPunk - YesCreativity Tool - YesFun - YesUnique - SomewhatSteamWorld Dig is Unique but not unique. It has many artistic aspects I'd call unique and a couple game mechanics I'd call unique to it but for the most part it's nothing we haven't seen before. The easiest game I can say it's similar to is Terraria even if it's missing many wonderful traits that made Terraria the game it is. It's 2D and requires you to dig for gems which you can trade for upgrades and money - That being it's barebones you can tell it's not very original. But it's when you move on into the story of this game and the artstyle that it chose is where you begin to find a bigger game that seems less bland and over done.I won't spoil the story or go in depth about what happens in this game so I'll leave it at that.Some of the things I'd like to see improved on or added is the ability to jump and break blocks at the same time. It feels like a major mechanic of a 2D game that got forgotten at home while the rest of the family of game mechanics went on vacation. #HomeAloneReferenceMore water deposites around the map. Water is essential to this game and according to other players they say water should be present more frequently in the level.A quick restart button of some form as if you mess up on a puzzle you have no real choice but to return to the surface or exit the area you've entered, refuel and try again.When you break a block beneath a lamp and that lamp breaks, that the lamp break into and item and return toyour inventory. (This may or may not be a mechanic already, I haven't noticed it being one)Would I recommend this game in the end? Yes, I would. I clocked 9 hours in 2 days. It's addictive regardless of it's abuntant basket of missing game mechanics that should be present.			"

												Great aesthetic and animations with simple but well-made and addictive gameplay. While the similarities to things like Terraria and Starbound are largely superficial (there is mining but no crafting or block placement), anyone who enjoys those, Metroidvania style platforming and puzzles, and even games like Rogue Legacy should definitely give this a shot.

												Simple mining game but with robots! You are cool steam robot and you get to dig yourself in to deeper and deeper when searching for metals and the deeper you go the more dangerous everything gets. To get back up you need to jump on walls and I found myself many times trapped because it was impossible to jump back but maybe that is just me being not good and not game's fault. All robot designs are cool and I like that the robots don't talk like humans but sound like robots. Very nice game and not too long or short, I liked it!			"

												If you like Metroidvania styled games, there's a good chance you'll enjoy this. It's also on the 3DS eshop if you prefer to have it on a handheld. Putting that aside, it's kinda on the short side. You can still go back and do more exploring once you beat the final boss but unless you're going for achievements, not much to do otherwise.			"

												Steamworld dig is a very fun metroidvania game. Graphics are nice to look, the ambienal music it's great, albeit somwhat repetitive. The game is quite short though, and in general, it's not very challenging, but you can easily got stuck.The mechanics are quite simple, you dig, get gems, you change them for money (and get xp), then you can buy different artifacts and improvements to your character.The price is fair, so, I won't doubt to recommend it if you find it on sale.Besides being a bit short, I didn't find too much replay value on the game, so I would say that's the only drawback. Anyway, a very fun game that I totally recommend! :)			"

												I really love this game. It's hard for me to explain why I like it so much you are just digging for ore and buying upgrades but its really fun. At first it was just relaxing gathering ore and building up my character,  then it gets scarey and exciting because it charges you your hard earned cash if you die and you lose the ores you are carrying. The mobs get progressively harder and the terrain harder to navigate.There is a little story line and caves to explore which are fun and different depth to dig down to.It is a very good game one of the better ones I have played recently and very addictive.I have read it is a short game but obviously haven't got that far yet.

												Terraria without all the building. It's a fairly quick, nice game to run through if you really feel like playing some Metroidvania. Reminded me of Rogue Legacy without all the difficulty. You'll dig, buy upgrades, dig, buy more upgrades, dig, solve puzzles, dig, die to a sideways falling rock, dig, buy more upgrades, keep digging and then beat the game. Definitely worth the humble bundle or sale price, probably not the full $10.Overall, a quality game that I couldn't stop playing, and that doesn't happen too often.			"

Digging deep, getting rich and discovering mysteries.7/10Worth the price?:For what the game is and having some similar free games online, buy on sale. PROS:-Smooth controls makes platforming easy-Clean graphics-Enjoyable puzzle rooms that are a good break from just digging straight down-Tons of upgrades to unlock and buyCONS:-Layers can get very repetitive of just digging, return to surface to sell, repeat-The end area was far to overwhelming and crowded-Forgetting to buy a portal and having to backtrack a HUGE distance-Upgrades don't change the player visuallyFor a mining game this is a very good one, lots of things to mine and lots of things to upgrade. This game is not randomly generated like most would think for a mining game, giving it no replay value. SteamWorld Dig has an interesting plot that is really the only motivation to keep digging after a while, I found myself trying to rush through sections near the end simply to carry on with the story cause I was very bored of digging. Overall was a great little game and worth trying if it is on sale. Happy digging!			"

												This game is surprisingly entertaining. It's a loop of digging (exploration) and upgrades. It provides a quite relaxing experience, while at some points including some platforming that can provide a bit of a challenge to solve. The music fits and the graphics are decent, with many of the characters having a nice hand-drawn feel to them. It keeps throwing new things at you at a steady enough pace for the game to always have something fresh. The story is decent enough, though it certainly takes a bit of a backseat to the mechanics.An enjoyable game, which I recommend you pick up if you want some relxaing gameplay.			"

												A gem.I picked this up for 3 bucks on sale and wish I could leave a tip.Control is great.  Design is great.  Art is great.  Pacing is great.  Difficulty is perfectly paced.  Story is...I don't care.The game is split into essentially three acts.  As you dig deeper, you learn more skills, which basic makes things easier as you go along.  Like any RPG.My favorite bit was the beginning-middle of the game when you are incredibly vulnerable and really have to consider your resources, and really consider how you dig.  If you dig straight down without consideration on how you'll get back to the surface, well, good luck.Later in the game...it kind of just gives you hand-outs that make mobility not an issue.Regardless - worth it.

												Very pleasant digging/platformer game.Indie game with nice art, nice music, nice story, and nice (though traditional) gameplay. It's a weird mix between Megaman and Spelunky, only for one player, and with a simple objective : reach the end.The system: you dig, you get gems for money, you get upgrades - repeat.You happen to kill enemies and avoid traps along the way, you climb walls and jump, and always go back to the main hub.So, yeah, it's very nice, BUT!- The game is very short, I took my time and finished it in 6 game-hours.- There are only 3 levels/worlds...- and only 1 boss !- The story ends really short with much too few answers! Feels like a Part 1, and there does not seem to be any Part 2 planned.So, it could have been a GREAT indie game, like really deep (for a mining game!), but as it is, it is just a nice indie game which had its potential sadly restricted. I still recommend it for what it is (I would praise its name for what it COULD have been!)			"

												SteamWorld Dig is an interesting game, but with a number of missed opportunities.The look and feel of the game is really great, especially the artwork. Gameplay consists of (1) digging (2) acquiring ore (3) selling ore (4) beating set levels. The main maps are randomly generated, but the set levels are fixed. I really enjoyed the set levels, and appreciated the care put into the puzzles. Though not particularly difficult, they were interesting. The randomly generated maps are frustrating after a time. The biggest missed opportunity in this game is to do more with the very brief set levels. The other missed opportunity is that it doesn't make much difference which ores you are digging, the only distinguishing feature is how high a price they fetch from the vendor. When you're mining, there's no obvious way of telling which ore you're digging up, which does matter for bagspace, especially if you find a valuable gem. It also feels like there might have been more benefit from being able to craft some items from certain ores.The end of the game was surprisingly frustrating, and I felt a bit annoyed at being forced to backtrack through the levels.In all, it was fun, and worth it for the sale price. I hope that there will be a sequel with some added improvements.			"

												One of the most satisfying gaming experiences I've had in a awhile.  Xbox 360 gamers may have played the indie game Miner Dig Deep, and this game is very much like that, only with somewhat more focused gameplay and a faster pace.  This isn't a minecraft style game or anything like that, but rather a simple, straightforward sort of action game where you dig for ore, sell it, get better equipment, and just keep going deeper.  Eventually the game gets harder and slightly more complex in that getting around and getting all of the ore and Orbs (a special currency) begins to take a bit of smarter planning to get.  While there are straightforward goals (keep digging until you reach a room that has your next major upgrade), the levels also have randomly placed ""puzzle rooms"" where you have to use your abilities to survive or figure out a challenge to gain access to some Orbs and valuable ore.  Extremely well crafted and paced just right so that it feels like every time you think you've mastered a particular part of a level, as you go deeper it throws more difficulty curves at you.  I can't recommend it enough.I should point out my whole game time was just over 7 hours to find all the ore, orbs, completing every room and buying every upgrade.			"

												Fun game my first took about 4 hours to beat the game.  There is an achievement to beat the game in under 2 and a half hours so that will be a challenge.  It plays like a metroid game where you will gain new powers the deeper you go.  There are 3 mines, only a few enemies, alot of upgrades for your weapons and skills that you purchase with the gems you collect.  It is not a difficult game and new game has random generated mines so it is always different while exploring.$8 is a fair price for the game - hopefully DLC comes out to expand the game a little more			"

												I bought this on a whim during the Holiday 2013 sales. I am so incredibly glad I did. I had heard of this title by name only but I really knew nothing about it. It had a nice enough aesthetic from the trailer/screens but it wasn't until I played it that it all made sense and the whole package took me along for the ride.There isn't a deep story but there is a deep mine. You dig, dig, and dig some more; every action a permanent one. I heard that the mines are actually randomly generated (at least the non-challenge room parts) and that's exciting to know I wont find myself making similar paths next time. I have heard this game described as Dig Dug meets Super Metroid. Honestly, while I have never really played Dig Dug, I can assure you this is loaded with Metroid-style upgrades. You earn them by collecting gold via gems.I loved the experience of hunting for every possible gem. I think I found them all too. I completed the game with over $23,000 gold and 193 orbs. This earned me the Steam achievements related to it but also shows just how much there is to grab. Once you start excavating you'll understand how large those numbers are. Each upgrade to the character made sense and I really enjoyed discovering them.I could keep on talking I suppose but I think it's better for people to just experience it.If you enjoy collecting items in Banjo-Kazooie... but with a more methodological approach like a puzzle game... and utilizing a progression/upgrade system similar to the Metroid series... as well as classic and easy to handle platforming... then you'll enjoy this game. I completed it in just under nine hours according to the game clock.I highly recommend it. Highly. Yay for it being on Mac too! I absolutely hope there's a sequel that is both on 3DS and the Mac. I might buy it on both platforms.			"

I actually wound up deciding to start over because I made so many mistakes the first time around, but really I don't think there's much of a reason to do that (other than wanting to be a perfectionist).  It reminds me of some old games from the 80's like Boulder Dash, or Spelunker (no, not spelunky).  You sorta platform your way through a mine while creating new paths to go through to get the ore, and you work to upgrade your stuff so you can do more mining more efficiently.Very fun.			"

												This game is one of the most highly rated, best-selling indie games on the Nintendo 3DS eShop, and now you can play it on PC in glorious HD. The game is very addicting and the upgrades are all very well-paced, with the player constantly gaining new abilities, keeping the game fresh and fun right until the very end. The visuals have translated beautifully onto the PC version, and the soundtrack fits the environments in the game perfectly. The game isn't very long (I finished it in around 6 hours total) but if you actually try to 100% it it will easily last you at least 8 hours. Steamworld Dig is definitely worth checking out, especially if you've enjoyed 2D Metroid games and Terraria.			"

												SteamWorld Dig is an interesting game, but with a number of missed opportunities.The look and feel of the game is really great, especially the artwork. Gameplay consists of (1) digging (2) acquiring ore (3) selling ore (4) beating set levels. The main maps are randomly generated, but the set levels are fixed. I really enjoyed the set levels, and appreciated the care put into the puzzles. Though not particularly difficult, they were interesting. The randomly generated maps are frustrating after a time. The biggest missed opportunity in this game is to do more with the very brief set levels. The other missed opportunity is that it doesn't make much difference which ores you are digging, the only distinguishing feature is how high a price they fetch from the vendor. When you're mining, there's no obvious way of telling which ore you're digging up, which does matter for bagspace, especially if you find a valuable gem. It also feels like there might have been more benefit from being able to craft some items from certain ores.The end of the game was surprisingly frustrating, and I felt a bit annoyed at being forced to backtrack through the levels.In all, it was fun, and worth it for the sale price. I hope that there will be a sequel with some added improvements.			"

												Just finished playing this game. It kept me entertained for four and a half hours. It's a basic yet enjoyable little platformer. Three areas and a boss fight at the end will be fun, but not challenging. This is not Spelunky and it doesn't want to be. The biggest pros are the art style and the price, which for me was 2 euros. It's not worth more than that. No co-op and no replay value are the biggest cons.If it's on sale at 80% off I'd recommend it to anyone. It's not worth it at full price.			"

												This game is truly worth buying. It's some relief from everyday duties. You play a digger. But that digger is now living in the world. It upgrades. It finds new things. And it's just beautifully drawn. Game can be played in different styles - slowly crawling dungeons discovering all the secrets or running through it to the end of the game. It's not so long - as many have mentioned before. But still there's no rush. You can do whatever you want. It's open-world. But... with direction. Direction - down. When you are tired of open-world, you just dig down and discover new things that alter you game experience.			"

												Steamworld Dig is a very addictive experience that unfortunately falls somewhat short of being a great game. I have rarely been so conflicted while writing a review. On one hand, the great aesthetics, entertaining exploration and gratifying upgrades kept me coming back for more. On the other, the game rarely presents much of a challenge, rarely testing your/Rusty's abilities. The graphics are charming, the environments and NPCs memorable, and the sense of exploration is great...and then you realize it's all over with little sense of real accomplishment (well, as much accomplishment as one can glean from playing a video-game). It's definitely a short and sweet experience, and you will likely find yourself addicted for the 5-9 hours or so it will take to complete the game, but unfortunately the limited depth and replayability means few will be coming back to this one. I would love to see this world fleshed out in a more in-depth sequel with more to explore, more/more intelligent enemies, and more combat abilities/general abilities in your arsenal.7/10			"

With treasure you buy upgrades which allow you to go down faster/safer. You have a lot of tools and ways to deal with different situations, which makes exploration really fun.Enviroments are very pretty and varied, and you have a lot of enemies types, which add difficulty to the task.One thing to keep in mind is that this is not a hardcore game.

One nice thing about this game is that you will likely complete the story/game before you start to get sick of it (for being too lengthy).Highly recommeded for it's price tag.			"

												Really enjoyable little game. A fresh, robo-western, high-res 2D art style, with a mash up of Dig Dug-esque gameplay and the tried and true progression of a Metroid or Zelda, all on a smaller, brisker scale. And it ties itself up at just the right time for a tired old gamer like me.  Highly recommended; one of my favorite indie titles on the store.			"

												After the nuclear halocaust events of Dig-dug now robots dig the mines of man. SteamWorld is essientally en exploration game where you dig ever downwards through a large mine. Picking up resources along the way to upgrade your arsenal and your personal stats. You'll spend most of the game just digging through rocks but it is highly addictive. My only complaint is that there is not enough content to keep me entertained for too long. I clocked in just over 9 hours while getting every nook and cranny and all upgrades. I usually go through a game again to grab all the achieves but the dull gameplay couldn't keep mne entertained enough to do so.Overall a very good game and well worth the price.8/10			"

												A pretty short and grindy mining exploration game. Does not get boring really, but you start off pretty limited in movement and abilities, which is a bummer. Then when you finally get upgraded and move around like a madman you're already nearing the end of the game. Just saying the game could use a last area (after the story) that's very hard just to use all the mechanics you unlocked not too long ago. Also the bossfight is very easy and kinda long.Still recommended by me, but it definitely shows room for improvement. I got this at the HumbleBundle so I can't complain, but I wouldn't buy it for the 9 euros it is priced at right now.			"

												SteamWorld Dig is a game in which you dig, mostly in the downward direction. ""Why is that fun?"" you may ask. The answer is that while there is not a great deal of story, the story is does have is well written. It is a very casual game with lots of monotomy. You go down, get gems and kill enemies, run out of light, go up and sell gems, repeat x times. Every now and then you hit a cave to explore or the next bit of story, but that's about it. If you want a hardcore action game, this is not the game for you. But, if you are just looking for a nice casual sit down and play when you have time, this game is perfect. One con of this game though is the ending, while I liked it, it did not fit with the rest of the game. The story part of it was great, but the game went from being a casual game to having a final boss which required platforming that most casual gamers don't usually do.			"

All set in an old-west world populated by steampunk robots. This is one of those rare games where I started to play it a bit, then suddenly noticed that most of the day had gone by and I was fighting the end boss.

												Just finished playing this game. It kept me entertained for four and a half hours. It's a basic yet enjoyable little platformer. Three areas and a boss fight at the end will be fun, but not challenging. This is not Spelunky and it doesn't want to be. The biggest pros are the art style and the price, which for me was 2 euros. It's not worth more than that. No co-op and no replay value are the biggest cons.If it's on sale at 80% off I'd recommend it to anyone. It's not worth it at full price.			"

												SteamWorld Dig is a wonderful indie-game from the swedish dev Image & Form that debuted and succeded on Nintendo 3DS. After beating it there I decided to buy it again on PC and I don't regret it because it was worth it. The HD visuals may not be the most beautiful thing you'll see, but it still has a nice design and artstyle. The music is great. It is nice to listen to and doesn't stress the player. It is somewhat enhanced in the PC-version. The sounds are basic but good enough.In the game you play as Rusty, a steambot who came to Tumbleton to claim his uncle's mine. As you start to dig deeper you discover new upgrades for Rusty and dig even deeper into the unknown depths below. In the mines you can dig up minerals that you can sell to get cash and level up Tumbleton which unlocks new upgrades. The whole game takes 2-7 hours to beat but it has a good replay value.I recommend it strongly, it a very good game.In classic rating: 9/10			"

												A good description of this game might be 'Spelunky Lite'.  It has a lot of the same feel (platformer with mining and combat), but is a directed experience, and a lot less challenging.  If you're a hardcore Spelunky player, this game is probably not going to be a challenge at all--if you're like me, on the other hand, you'll die a few times on the way to the end, but not enough to get you too discouraged--and you'll have a blast playing it.

												Put in a blender Terraria, Mr Driller, Metroid and Megaman X, mix them and Steamworld Dig appears. Previously released on the Nintendo 3DS, the PC version enhances the audio-visual features of a game that was already quite remarkable.PROS:- Addictive (The digging and find resources and skills to level up mechanic will keep you playing non-stop until the end of the adventure)- Acquisition of skills that make the adventure more fun as you progress (some of them quite ingenious and useful).- Accurate and very responsive controls (calling out all those titles at the beginning of the review, you couldn't expect less).- Charming characters and enemies design.- The story is simple but engaging (the interest to know the mystery hidden underground is maintained at all times).- If you are an achivement hunter, these would ensure you a second playthrough to get them all.CONS:- No real replayability (It lacks an New Game+ mode or something similar)- The music can get repetitive at times.- No quick save, you must return to the surface to generate a checkpoint-save.If you like Metroid-Vania style games with a twist of western and a disappearing blocks mechanic (through digging) this game will grant you a good 6-12 hours of play (in my case it was 18). Addiction guaranteed.My score: 8/10Note: Played it on GNU / Linux (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS - 32 bits)			"

												This is one little special mining game. I actually have played quite a few games like this, but none of them were as amazing as this one. The style is already rather appealing, there is even a bit of story (a bit) and even at least one easter egg!In this game you're exactly 100cm tall robot who explores the mines of your uncle (don't ask me how robots can have relatives). In the mine you'll of course get resources but there are also a bunch of ""rooms"" with small challenges, mostly rewarding you with those blue orbs. During your mininc carreer you'll also find some new technology left behind by your uncle and those allow you to mine deeper. The deeper you go, the more challenging the mining gets. And it doesn't stop being fun!Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

Those get more valuable as you get deeper, which is a good thing since the upgrades you will need to continue digging won't get cheaper.It is a relatively short game, it took me about 6 hours to complete without particularly rushing it. My second (really really rushed) game took about 1 hour, and a couple more to get some bonus achievements.			"

												Beautiful surprise.  Everything you could love from a dig-type game.  Very addictive! Good optional puzzle quest too.  From a slow player like me, took 7 hours to finish the story line while getting everything in all levels.  Too short but hey, what do you expect when a game is so addictive? :)			"

												Steamworld Dig is a cross between a Metroid-vania and a Dungeon Crawler. Its focus, however, is the mining experience, rather than the combat. And it's works surprisingly well! You use your collected resources to upgrade your equipment, which makes traversing the map easier, as well as being able to mine deeper and deeper.  I'll say that I have not played the 3DS version, but I wouldn't have noticed that this was a mobile port. Everything is very fluid and it just works perfectly overall, unlike many mobile ports we see on Steam. Presentation   It's a very good and clean looking game, in my opinion. Everything looks polished, is what I'd say. It gives off a good Steampunk vibe, and the character designs have a unique cartoon style as well.   It has solid lighting effects as well, that look nice and also provide a good mechanic for you to know when it's needed to go back to the surface.   There isn't much else to say, really. It looks great! And it's functional, as I've never had a problem with the backgrounds, or anything at all...   The music was a pleasant surprise too! The soundtrack is only 15 minutes long, but its purpose was achieved: atmosphere, rather than getting a melody stuck in your head. And I have absolutely no problem with that.   It uses a Blues-like vibe, with a more metallic texture, if you will, with a few Western whistles... you get the drill (eh). I actually reminded me of Torchlight or Diablo's music! Especially Tristram Village, only less dark. I really enjoyed the music.   One complaint I have is with the voices... Speaking gibberish isn't a problem for me, but it got really annoying at times, with some vendors. When you're speaking to the shopkeepers, they describe the item you're looking at every time... Since they're not really saying anything very useful, it seems like a cacophony of sounds... But that only happens when you're upgrading in the town, so it's not too bad.   So, onto the game's Structure, then.   You do virtually the same thing 3 times. And while I don't quite understand how it does it, it works! The game has 3 main sections. Each section has a certain visual theme (and some new enemies), and features 3 optional and 3 mandatory ""dungeons"" (perhaps it's the wrong word, as they're mostly just a room).    The optional dungeons were quite interesting, actually: you simply go there to get more minerals/orbs (more on that later), but they function as puzzle rooms. They have certain blocks and enemies set in a specific way. And to overcome them, you will often have to think of a method that you hadn't previously thought of. The best thing is that these methods will help you on the outer mines, so it ends up being almost a tutorial, but one that is well done and almost seemless!   The mandatory dungeons were generally larger, but they always provide you with a new upgrade. These can be an actual ability (like a Drill, a Double Jump, etc.), or just a useful passive (No fall damage, minerals show up on the map, etc.). Whenever you got an active ability, you then had to use it to leave the dungeon (or go over a specific obstacle) so, again, good teaching.   Each area gets harder as you go through, but they're very similar, all things considered. They usually have the previous enemies reskinned, and then one or two other types added. Combat is NOT the focus of this game, but it proves a good break of pace to attack/avoid enemies. Otherwise, it would simply be mindless digging, and that would be too monotonous. Some enemies are trickier than others, but there are usually ways to defeat them more easily.   Your main object is simply to go in and collect minerals, and then go back to the surface and sell them. With the gold you make, you can upgrade your various abilities, or buy utility items (such as Teleporters, Lanterns, Ladders, Dynamite,  etc.). Of the utility items, I've only used Dynamite and Teleporters. But there are options, if you want them!   The whole game is basically just getting in and out of the mines. Thrice!   I'm not sure why it works (since the upgrades are usually not that radical), but I've had fun during the whole game, so they've done something right! The game's fluidity in going through the mines probably helps and lot. It's actually fun to jump around the various tunnels, clearing minerals on the way. And the rest is in the hands of OCD and Compulsive Buying Disorder. One simply must mine every shiny things, and then clear out the shops... Maybe this sounds really bad (haha!) but it was fun. And the atmosphere also adds to the enjoyment of the actions.    The way the mining actually works is that you your character has: Health, Water (mana), and Light.    Light depletes as you stay underground for a certain time. It's a gradual loss, giving you time to decide when to go back. The only downside to staying down there is that you won't be able to see the minerals (and barely anything else as well), but there's no actual danger of dying. To help with this, you can buy ""Lamps"". However, this are just static, and I don't really see the point. They're not expensive, but don't iluminate much either. The only reason why they COULD be useful, is if they could mark a spot on your map.   This is a metroid-vania afterall, so the player expects some backtracking (specially for hard to reach minerals). So if he saw something unreachable, he could mark the stop with a Lamp, and then go there later on, without forgetting everything about it. But those are my 2 cents on it. It's not really a problem here, just a minor suggestion.   Water works when you need to use special abilities, or you Drill. Most of the blocks can be destroyed with your Pickaxe. Rock, however, requires a Drill. This drill is more powerful than the pickaxe, but it requires water to work. If you run out of water, you'll have to find a pool underground to restore it.   That basically it. As you get deeper and deeper, the blocks will become slower and slower to mine, which is a side that you'll have to upgrade your mining material.   So yeah, you go down and mine. Then you go up a sell it to upgrade and mine even deeper. There's no complex crafting system (of say, Terraria), it's just mining and upgrading to mine deeper and more expensive. It's a weird concept to me, but I've enjoyed it more than I expected!   You can upgrade everything from your Health to your Water capacity, Water usage, Light duration, mining power, etc. etc. etc. You can just buy the upgrades as you see fit, conforming to your needs. The game sort of balances itself out, this way.   When you die, you simply go back to the village. All of your minerals are dropped to the floor (and you need to get back there to pick them up -- like DemonSouls), and you also lose half of your gold.   I don't think there's much else to say about it. The story wasn't particularly striking to me. There's a Boss fight in the end (not too hard), and there are also some achievements for completionists. I'll commend these for having some pretty tough tasks that would actually be an achievement (like completing the whole game without dying). Others are just there to incentivise you to explore.   These last 3 weeks for me have been mostly marked by not very good games. They were interesting, sure, but execution was lacking. As such, Steamworld Dig came as a nice surprise! I wasn't expecting much out of a game that's based around mining (and looking back, it doesn't do anything really stunning, it's a very simple and by the book game), but I enjoyed the whole time I played it.   I've finished it in about 6/7 hours, with every secret found, and every mineral mined. After this, all there is left to replayability is trying out to finish the game as efficiently as possible. That's not for me, but if you're into that stuff, you can take more out of it.   Good one!			"

												Just finished this game in two days, I found it incredibly addictive, the atmosphere worked well and the difficulty could be fairly tough at times, especially getting some of the achievements. While dying isn't really *that* much of a penalty, it will happen a lot. It is a short game designed to have fairly simple gameplay, not really a criticism, that's just the intended style of game. It helps that I enjoy most mining-related games and stories with robots in them. I liked being able to customise my character by selling ore but would rather have been able to craft items myself, and for different ores to make different items.			"

												When I was growing up I was in love with xgenstudio's ""motherload"". Most of my friends were. It was the perfect mix of skinner-box grind, story and challenge. Its remake early this year fell a little short, but was still a fun nostalgia trip with enhanced gameplay.Steamworld Dig is Everything I wished Motherload was, but wasn't. Multiple weapons, likable characters, Puzzle aspects, hidden areas, running out of fuel doesnt cripple you, there are actually enemies to fight, you can dig up (to an extent), you have spells and abilities, necessary tech doesnt require grind, you can buy permenant checkpoints that teleport you to the surface. I havent played this game to completion yet, but so far it's in good standings to sire my children.The one thing Motherload has Steamworld beat on is its rogue-like elements. Steamworld's puzzle rooms are static (obviously) and don't change from playthrough to playthrough, and it's downwards path is pretty linear. If you're okay with this, pick this game up.11/10 best mining simulator since the program I used at the minesite while working as an engineer for Rio Tinto.			"

												This game is a real gem. I love the cartoony, whimsical graphics with the steampunk, Old West robots in a post-apocalyptic world theme. The atmospheric soundtrack really compliments the visual design. Being a 2-D platform game about mining, this game feels a little like Dig Dug or Lode Runner, but with upgrades. The game progresses well, and it is satisfying to use the money from the ores you excavate to upgrade your robot's tools and abilities. All of this will aid you as you dig deeper, facing newer challenges, and discovering that there's a lot more going on beneath the surface than you originally thought.			"

However, if you have a Nintendo 3DS, I'd recommend buying on there, its only about 4 hours long.			"

												SteamWorld Dig is a fun mix of digging and platforming.  ""2d minecraft"", as has been said before, it is somewhat, but not quite; it has a very finite world and a finite number of minerals, so much so that if you die very often you will not be able to purchase all the upgrades.  Luckily, most the upgrades are mundane enough (+2 digging power, +1 health bar, over and over basically) you can deal with such a thing, and even more luckily it's not that hard to die.  But basically, it's no big deal either way.  The game's small and not that difficult at all -- 90% of my deaths I could attribute to stupid falling rocks everywhere and me scrambling back and forth indecisively under them like an idiotic cartoon character under an anvil.So yeah -- small, simplistic, and less infinite than these types of games tend to be for good reason.  And let's throw in mostly mediocre music (except for the second area's theme which gives strong oldschool Diablo vibes), and an incredibly boring and predictable story.   Oh, and weirdly superfluous NPCs-- more of them means more personality in the small home town at least, but really there could have just been one shopkeeper you could dump your haul on and buy stuff from to achieve the same effect. So what's the good news?  Well, it's got nice, smooth graphics, fine sound, and... most importantly, it's REALLY FUN.  I started playing it yesterday morning and had the thing running until last night, going through the vast majority of it only to load it up again this morning and finished up some loose ends as well as the final boss.  It was hard to tear myself away from -- and in an age in which most games are hopelessly elongated in myriad artificial ways and want to just be able to beat them and feel 'finished' like in the old days, I really, truly wish I'd had more content to play with this time.  It's over too quickly with too little else to do than getting some arbitrary achievements; I felt I had well and truly ""completed"" it as much as I'd ever need to upon collecting absolutely every single nugget of ore in the game, finding every secret and slaying every one of the non-respawning enemies (except for the laser boxes that take hundreds of hits to defeat).  I can only hope the inevitable sequel creates a much larger world to continually upgrade and dig deep down into.So yeah.  It's not much new; it's a little bit of a stifled Minecraft and a little bit of an oldschool metroid -- but trust me when I say it's very fun and very much worth the price of admission.			"

												One of the few games I started but didn't finish. I don't know why, but this game end up being one of the few. I usually complete the games I begin, but with this I have had enough. It's not bad or broken, but it's not good either. It's well done, visuals look okay, sounds are decent, but the gameplay was boring.I had fun for the first dungeon, digging and trying to find something. After that I ""got lost"". I didn't know where I was going or why. Of course in this game you go only down, but still. At one point I was supposed to go back up, but I couldn't and I end up going much further than I was supposed to go with my skill set. Apparently I got stuck and felt like I didn't need to finish this game, at least for now. Maybe some day. Digging with even the best pickaxe was freaking slow, enemies were pretty dull, teleporting and light seemed artificially complicated and annoying without contributing much to the game. I just had to walk back up to get full light and since teleports cost spheres instead of money, and one could carry only one, I end up walking way too much back and forth.I feel that this game could've had me playing it to the end if it were done differently. All in all, I cannot recommend this game, even though I can understand why some might like it and why developer thought it was ready. For me it wasn't, it was like playing a well polished alpha version, no bugs, no content.			"

												I had no idea what to expect when I purchased this game from the Steam shop. After the requisite due diligence that I perform before laying down the cash for any game, SteamWorld Dig appeared to be right up my alley. My shortlist of games is exactly that and I have to say that developer Image & Form tied my hands with this one. They gave me no choice but to add their latest release to it because, from the moment I picked up my controller, SteamWorld Dig became an instant favorite.A mining, platform adventure set in the steampunk equivalent of the old west, SteamWorld Dig takes place in a mining town by the name of Tumbleton, with a burgeoning population of a whopping three NPC's. Crazy right? Well if you're impressed with those stats then let me season your ears with this juicy piece of news. I'm happy to inform you that with a lot of blood (steam), sweat (steam) and tears (more steam), you can attract a lot of attention and get that number all the way up to five, as new shopkeepers arrive to make Tumbleton their new home.The story here is as straightforward as you're likely to get as you - Rusty, that is - arrive in town to claim the deed to your uncle Joe's mine after he suffered an unfortunate and untimely end. Your goal is to explore and collect as much ore as possible by digging up everything you find and selling it at the trade shop back in town. This will allow you to purchase various upgrades from Rusty, the old Tumbleton native, such as better mining equipment like your pickaxe and storage, as well as armor enhancements and better lighting. After all, isn't it best to see where it is you're going to avoid meeting the same fate as your late uncle?Aesthetically, SteamWorld Dig is clean and crisp with high-resolution artwork that sets the western/steampunk theme beautifully and never falters. Right away, the audio is engaging with its sharp, edgy notes, similar to the atmosphere that might be present in a saloon. On the other hand, perhaps what you might typically expect from the sound effects used in a period film surrounding the lifestyle and nature of a small western town during the early 17th century. Either way, it grabs your attention, complimenting the stunningly rendered graphics and allowing them to do their job. Without wanting to give away too much, I'll just say that the more you dig and the deeper you get, the music begins taking on a darker, almost grungier tone, becoming progressively more exotic to set the stage for the changes that take place the farther down you get.SteamWorld Dig isn't exactly an action-packed, high-octane thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat but it's still unbelievably fun, in its own way. The same kind of fun you would have playing The Sims, Minecraft or Terraria for example; a more reserved, mellow sort of fun that's just as satisfying and more than sufficiently entertaining.Taking advantage of the terrain there are traps, such as falling rocks and barrels of TNT that can work both for and against you, depending on how the player interacts with their environment. The enemies too can seem rather docile at first glance, either standing still to throw objects in your direction whenever you enter their line of sight or just leisurely walking around. Much of the time this is limited to the number of uninterrupted blocks they are currently standing on. The AI itself works based on cause and effect, towing the line between simplicity and effectiveness by forcing the player to adapt rather than pursuing them relentlessly. As a result, most of the difficulty comes from situations the players will get themselves into; I don't know about the rest of you, but there is something quite refreshing and humbling about that.As with any platformer, a tight control scheme is vital because without a solid, responsive setup a good game can devolve into a fumbling, erratic mess.  This is true of any game I know but even more so for the genre in question, along with a few others that require honed reflexes and a quick eye.While other games may be able to get away with controls that are seamlessly interchangeable between keyboard and gamepad and I applaud those that accomplish such a feat, this is not one of them. Trying to play a game of any genre with both hands on the keyboard is a thing of the past and a practice best isolated to other areas and styles of gameplay like FPS or Action RPG's such as Diablo. No matter how your actions are assigned across the keyboard, it always feels unnatural and forced. Something that will always take away from the enjoyment, the fun you were looking forward to going in. Who wants to spend all their time messing about with clunky, archaic controls when they could be spending it terrorizing trilobites and shiners, wreaking havoc on the denizens of the old world?As is the case in these kinds of situations, a controller will no doubt solve that problem for you. Highly customizable, your keystrokes and button presses can be programmed according to your distinct preferences. With an eight-button selection right at your fingertips, you'll have everything you need and won't give it a second thought after the initial setup process. Your movements will feel smoother and actions far easier to execute without a hint of awkwardness because the level of polish that's present keeps you from being distracted, allowing you to focus on what's important, (like digging up that last piece of Chocolotite).There's probably only about 7-10 hours of gameplay and only a single boss fight at the end of the game. Although still great, this leaves me feeling slightly underwhelmed. I think there should have been at least three - one for each section - at the bare minimum and would have added so much more substance to a game that is already so highly regarded. The length of SteamWorld Dig, however, is not an indicator of its quality and is by no means detrimental to what it tries to accomplish.So, you've read the reviews, watched the trailers and otherwise analyzed the hell out of SteamWorld Dig, but you're unsure whether to go ahead and give this one a shot. If that's the case, let me make it easier on you. The price tag that comes with a purchase like this may be $10.99 at full price, but you have my blessing to go ahead and give up every one of those 1,099 pennies, so you can hoard it with the rest of your collection. If by any chance, you're reading this, thinking to yourself that I've lost my mind in some way, then I've done my job and you have your answer. Tuck it away in your wish list for another day and wait for a sale.			"

												Great indie game, for some quick time-killing. Not recommended for hours after hours of gaming i'd say, but to sqeeze out 30-60 mins per run it's a great game! Finished in a bit over 6 hrs, replay value high, although not right after finishing (unless you love to just start over & do it all again). I'd say i'll play it again in a few weeks.Definatily worth its 7 euro's i bought it for!8/10			"

												SteamWorld Dig, a game that I've had the pleasure to recieve from one of my friends as a random gift. It had been collecting dust in my Steamlibary for more then a year before I've given it a chance. To me at the time it looked like one of those indies that ""never would be worth your time"". Oh how I was wrong.SteamWorld Dig is an platform mining adventure where you take the role as Rusty, a lone mining steambot. In the game you dig your way trough the ""old world"" and even deeper into the  Vectron . In your adventure you'll spent most of your time gaining riches while uncovering an ancient treat that lurks below.You'll spent your riches on various upgrades that you'll unlock troughout your adventure. You'll also uncover more abilities and ""skills"" to use in your mining adventures. Besides the ussual diging and dodging the game also throws several ""puzzels"" at your and secrets to keep you entertained.I've enjoyed this game a whole lot, and wished I had played it earlier to recommend it to all my friends that are looking for some of that ""good old enjoyment you don't see that much anymore"".To close this all of here is a small table of some key factors of the game:  Factor Rating   Graphics 4/5, original and fun anitmated catroonish graphics.   Controls 5/5, more snappy then a crocodile.   Story 3/5, it's there. It's a platformer let's not forget that it's not trying to tell a deep story, it's trying to entertain you troughout various platforming scenario's. TRYGRE OUT!			"

												SteamWorld Dig is a really clever and unique 2d platformer. Sort of a Minecraft meets Metroidvania. With steampunk robots in a Wild West setting. I don't remember why I grabbed this one. But I'm really glad I did. You play as a robot who's uncle has sent for you to come to his mine in the town he lives in. When you get there, you fall into a hole and meet a girl-robot in the mine who shows you to your uncle's dead (deactivated?) corpse (or junk pile, not sure if robots have a corpse). Well now, you own the mine and your uncles mining pick. Welcome to Steamworld, population of 3. So the basic thing is, you have a pick. You go down into the mine and mine around, looking for ore to take back to the surface and sell. Every x dollars worth of ore you bring up, you get the option to buy an upgrade from the nearby shop. There are many different types of ore you bring up, all worth differing amounts. There are also various enemies, trapped in the rock or running in tiny caverns. You can stay in the mine as long as you want, but you do have a light that slowly runs out, causing the illumination to get dimmer and dimmer until it evertually is gone. When this happens, you can barely see and definately cant see the ore you are looking for. Upgrades are things like stronger picks, longer light, stronger armor, more inventory slots and so on. There are also ladders and lamps, which can be purchased for cheap and placed in the mine but not picked up again, once they're there, they're there.  You can carry up to 4 lamps and 5 ladders, (in the beginning anyway), but wasting them sucks even though they are cheap.There is also a little story, and various caves ""your uncle hid stuff in"". The caves have cool power ups, things like an extra high ""steam jump"", the ability to sprint and other permanent power ups. Just like Metroidvania style games, getting these power ups allows you to access areas that were blocked to you before.The graphics are cute and slightly cartoony, but very well done. Each character (besides you) has a portrait when you talk to them, and all sprites and images are rendered well in vibrant color.The music is Western sounding and fits the scenery well. Other sounds are typical as expected for mining in a steampunk world inhabited by robots (pings, clanks, stones falling, steam hissing) but all are appropriate and not intrusive. One important sound is the popping noise an enemy imprisoned in the rock makes as it tries to break out. Killing these enemies while still imprisoned is important, as they can be killed in one hit, but if they break free (by having open space near them, they become harder to kill and harm you if you hit them).The controls arent quite as perfect as some platformers Ive played (Dust and Thomas Walks Alone come to mind as two platformers with near perfect controls) but they arent terrible. You wont be missing jumps due to poor controls and getting frustrated, but neither they arent that perfect almagam that makes the character feel like an extention of the controller. You can't mine while jumping or wall jumping- a way to go up a shaft by bouncing along the walls). Also you cant mine (at least at the point I'm at, dont know if an upgrade changes that) other than the block directly above you without a ladder. So if you want something above you and dont want to waste ladders, you must go all the way back up and mine from on top of it to get it. Thats kind of annoying in my mind.Also, if you accidentally drop a ladder in a one-square high tunnel, you cant mine directly above or below it while standing on the same sqaure as the ladder. That is REALLY annoying, and something I think the devs should fix.Overall, this game is quite fun as you mine deeper and deeper in search of treasure, creating strange tunnels nad paths as you go. It does have a self-destruct feature in case you pin yourself due to falling rocks or bad judgement, but pinning yourself is not a common occurance. Death takes half your money, which seems kind of steep as the minerals do not appear to regenerate at all. But dying is rather rare, as easy to kill trapped enemies which drop recovery items are abundant.			"

 Summary Rather enjoyable metroidvania digger. Well worth the money, well worth the time. Optional logical+action challenges for completists. End boss is tedious (as usual). Recommended for platformer/metroidvania semi-casual fans. Details In tradition of digging games like Motherload[www.miniclip.com] (and in same broad genre like Glean[www.newgrounds.com] or Mustached driller[www.newgrounds.com] and the like), you dig down from your town, periodically returning to it to sell found minerals and upgrade yourself. On your journey down you'll encounter new environments with new enemies and obstacles. The main world contains entrances to separate small levels (like ""instances"" in MMO) - some of them required by plot and giving you new abilities, some are just optional puzzles to test your brain and nimble fingers.In best tradition of metroidvania games you are forced to return to previously explored areas and instances to uncover more. For those struck by OCD (Obsessive Completion Disorder) - game is balanced to allow you to collect every mineral and kill every monster there is in the game - given you don't screw up royally. New skills and new enemies are placed evenly on your path to the endgame - there are no tedious or boring streaks except for the final boss.Graphically game is excelent in its cartoonish style. Technically it's also very stable, responsive and polished overall. Although I usually turn off ingame music, here I played it through without turning music off. Sound FX design is also very good.Overall, it's a nice little digger with great polish to justify it being paid.			"

												Overly simplistic gameplay with limited exploration.  Dig down, collect ore, sell ore, buy upgrades, dig some more.  By the end of the game you will have all of the upgrades and no difficulty facing the boss.  I ran through what I take to be the complete game in 6 hours with no interest in doing it again.  I guess I'm spoiled by all the other great games out there, but I expect more than one hour of entertainment per dollar spent.  SteamWorld Dig doesn't provide that return.  Skip this and buy Terraria or Minecraft or something else entirely.			"

												An amazing & fun game! It's not to long, only around 5 hours but the experience has been amazing.I really miss this kind of classic 2D Platforms. Basically you dig ... and you get some minerals that you sell in order to upgrade your pickaxe and other stuff. Then you dig some more and ... find amazing and weird stuff!My full video review can be found here:

												Release a game number 2 with more upgrades and a longer story, that would be perfect right now..This game has a nice adventure, feels pretty much as minecraft but i liked this a little bit better the first days playing it. I finished the game in less than a week, and the game is not to be played after finishing it. So really just an update where we get a longer story or more upgrades would be nice, i would accept DLC's to the game aswell. Really anything to make the story longer would be nice.			"

												Normally, the idea of a ""digging game"" puts me off entirely. Terarria bored me to tears. However, I got this in a humble bundle and decided to try it. I found that SteamWorld Dig is a very endearing game, and a distinct advantage it has is that platforming in your own tunnels gets increasingly rewarding and interesting as you get more upgrades. On top of that, you can dig yourself into situations that then take on a more puzzle-platformer element, like getting yourself onto a certain ledge when you only have one ladder left. Getting yourself into difficult situations is often more challenging than frustrating and I appreciate that. Additionally, the music/sound design is very enjoyable and the art style is charming. The largest complaint I take with SteamWorld Dig is the scarcity of resources, or at the very least, that trying to scrimp the last chocomite out of an early world area when you're preparing to fight the end boss is pretty unrewarding. I feel like special areas that can only be reached with certain upgrades should have substantially more loot. On the whole, SteamWorld Dig is what I might consider a hidden gem, so to speak. The digging itself isn't too tedious (and gets better as you go along), the platforming is rewarding, the art and music direction is pleasing, and the plot isn't half bad. The late game can get a little tiresome if you don't have the finesse to take out the final boss without a lot of upgrades, but I don't think it would prevent many people from having a positive experience.

												8/10 A must have for any platformer fanReally nice graphics, good gameplay, a simple yet fair deal of customization and progression available. A nice story which is definetly refreshing in a sea of mindless (yet fun) platformers.The only downside is the size of the game. 7 hours. And the fact that it doesnt offer much in terms of replayability.			"

												SteamWorld Dig is a fun experience. Something along the lines of a Terraria with a story mode, this game has you grinding (or selling?) ore in the mines to buff your hero with upgrades.It's sadly a short experience. Although you can press forward to hunt the harder achievements and turn a 3 hour game into 10-20+ hours, it doesn't change the fact that the actual game ends quickly. The story is lacking, SPOILER: I found myself confused at the ending regarding Joe, and angered at how simple the final, and only boss was. A predictable 3-tier boss fight with no need for dynamite, ladders, or anything else you've found along the trail.Throughout the game you're given several upgrades; however, most of them will become archaic to the newer upgrades you receive. Endgame, there is no point to use your pickaxe, as you will have a drill with full water buffs. Your steam jump is required in only TWO spots, and one could be bypassed with enough trickery. Overall, the game really didn't focus on a lot of the upgrades you receive, even though you'll put thousands of coins into upgrading them on the path to 100% completion.With the few negatives out of the way, the game really isn't bad. It's such a fun adventure even though it doesn't last nearly as long as I wish it would. For anyone who has already enjoyed and finished Terraria, this is a welcomed addition to your library.			"

												Nice simple relaxing game.You keep digging deeper and deeper and try solve mystery of storyline.To keep simple gameplay more interesting, it has character progress.You dig gems on your way to earn money by selling them for shopkeepers to buy your character upgrades.More dmg, faster digging speed, more healt, longer torch time + other stuff.It took me 5,3h to complete the storyline by going just straigth forward, and i had fun during that time and i definatly recommend this game, but better watch the price, cus i wouldnt pay too much for short game like this.But also if the game would be too long, maybe digging would get boring even with nice character upgrade system? So i guess overall 5h game is good for simple relaxing game.			"

But I really wanted to like this game, so I reinstalled it and stuck with it, and it turned out to be a lot of fun.  Once you get some of the movement upgrades and lamp upgrades, you can dig a lot more freely without worrying about getting yourself stuck, and you aren't constantly returning to town to refresh your lamp.  So stick with it -- it gets better.			"

Finding a new home on Steam from the 3DS, SteamWorld Dig is a mix of exploration and platforming gameplay with a few light puzzles tossed in.The basic gameplay loop is exploring the mine to collect resources to unlock new equipment and abilities to allow you to explore deeper into the mine.The western robot theme fits well and the townsfolk have a few good lines but overall the game is thin when it comes to story.

												An enjoyable, yet very basic game. It's quick, quirky, cute, but lacks any real depth.

Worth it for $1, something to keep you happy for a couple of hours on an afternoon, but not much more.			"

A fair number of secrets to uncover. Also the underground caves that shift the gameplay focus away from digging and briefly toward segments of platforming/combat/problem-solving go a long way toward staving off mining fatigue.Short. Simple. But good. Definitely worth buying if it's currently discounted.			"

												If you want the same experience but without the cost, go play Motherload. It's pretty much exactly the same thing, except with a bit of backtracking thrown in at the end. It's pretty to look at it, but I'm afraid that's all SteamWorld Dig brings to the table.(Bit of a spoiler ahead; you were warned) At the end of the game, when the girl-bot says shes going to look for Rusty because she believes he's still alive, I thought ""Oh hey! A newgame+ where we play as girl-bot looking for Rusty. Cool."" and then the game brings you back to the title screen. Clicking ""continue"" puts you back into Rusty's boots, back before the final boss fight. There is no newgame+. Once you beat the game, there's nothing else to do. SteamWorld Dig has no replayability, unless you're a perfectionist who wants every achievement.			"

Get to the bottom, buy everything in the store,  beat the big scarecrow robot  .

												SteamWorld Dig is as the name implies, a game about digging... and that's pretty much all there is to it.The game is incredibly short (I've beaten it in about 5 hours, including bonus levels that are spread around), and between the extremely repetitive, dumb enemies and the incredibly simple mechanics, there is almost no challenge involved, with the exception of the final boss, which can be mildly challenging.There is little consequence for failure: die and you will be revived. Your lost loot will stay there so you can pick it back up and keep going. Healing and refilling your water tank which you acquire fairly early in the game are both very easy to do.Speaking of the loot though, all you can find is different types of ore (which are only used for money) and special orbs with are used in more expensive purchases that improve your character: You can dig faster, have more health and so on. There are upgrades spreaded around here and there that WILL change your character, such as a steam-powered jump or a drill, but ultimately, even they do little to improve the game's overly simple mechanics.The soundtrack while good enough, isn't very diverse and can get boring pretty quickly. The only good thing I can say about it is: The game's pretty, it has a nice aesthetic to it... but that's not enough for me to recommend it, unfortunately.It probably has some value as a ""My first platformer"" for those who never played the genre and are hoping for an easy, unchallenging experience or if it is on some very generous (75%+) sale, but otherwise I'd say skip it.There are other platformers out there such as Spelunky, Guacamelee or Battleblock Theater that can offer you a more enjoyable experience, in my opinion.

												Well, I've just completed this game in about 5 hours total on lunchbreaks, and frankly, I don't see what the excited reviewers are talking about.The game is way too short.It's a game with 3 levels and one shop overworld area. That's it. Once you complete it, I don't see why you'd bother replaying it, there's no multiplayer or even some cool New Game + mode, although upon completing the game it teases you with a ""new"" looking main character.Unfortunately, it's also WAY too easy.The enemies are laughable. Even the potentially dangerous kamikaze robots leave powerups behind, so basically, even if a kamikaze targets you, there's a 33% chance you'll just get your life back in a powerup. Come on... The rest of the enemies are basically a joke, a nuisance at best.The laser traps are quite deadly but aren't ever used in a way that leaves you puzzled.That's actually the problem with the entire game, there's no real puzzle element at all.The only ""puzzling"" you'll see is poking around for a tile (Zelda bombable walls style) to break and reach a secret area.The spelunking mechanic, while addictive and cool in theory, is actually quite shallow. It might seem like digging your way down efficiently requires effort but it really doesn't. If you can put two and two together, you'll figure out how to dig the mine properly in 10 minutes.Finding treasures? Not only is it easy enough initially, you eventually pick up a powerup that just displays every single treasure on the map, pretty much turning your exploring into running through a checklist, so yeah, a chore instead of a challenge.Oh yeah, and the story? Well there isn't one. You jump into a mine built by your uncle or something and everyone is like oooh, what could be there... And then you finally stumble upon a menacing area that looks like something out of Metroid and you finally think oooh... some depth in the story finally? But nope, the final boss is some random♥♥♥♥♥contraption named Vectron or whatever, you beat it and you're supposedly assimilated with a new technology, and you get the main menu...Seriously, I'd rather have this game be entirely abstract than have this lazy♥♥♥♥♥attempt at a story that tries to put steampunk and futurism together in the most vanilla way possible.Anyway... My personal rating would be 5/10 as in absolutely mediocre and not really worth your money.Not recommended.			"

												This game is fantastic. Everything Super Motherload did wrong (which is more or less everything) this game did right. The pacing is great, the increase in game mechanics is nice and steady, there's always interesting new areas or obstacles to deal with as the game progresses. There's a real sense of accomplishment as you gradually upgrade your character and begin digging in ways that would certainly have trapped or killed you earlier. The plot is great, the characters are neat, and I encourage people to play this.			"

												Very very good, better than Spelunky.Mining with style...Not so long, but some 6-10 hours will be enough for price they ask, right?No bugs, good game mechanics.On the down side is that feeling that everything can be even greater, that idea is not fully developed which is a shame.But game will get 8/10 from me and big recommendation anyway.

												Was lulled to a deep sleep by the rhythmic sound of my pickaxe hitting rock.Pros:Nice art styleNice sounding soundtrack (until you've heard the same bloody theme about 10 times since its the only one when youre underground)Cons:As you can guess by my opening line; tediously boring. Over an hour in and I still haven't been the slightest bit interest.Lack of combat (only walking into enemies and dying) hurts this game in my opinion.Tunnelling down to new missions takes a nightmarishly long amount of time; its what convinced me to pack the game in.Summary: Looks nice at first glance with its art style, but is just so boring to play. If there is anything interesting in the game, it comes too late to be worth it.			"

												It's an okay game. The target audience is more for children I feel. After a certain point I couldn't bring myself to finish this game... I don't know why, but everytime I start it up I suddenly shut it down quick. Guess it got too boring and tedious for me. Just wasn't for me I guess than what I was told.It's fun, it's intuitive, bit of a time killer in some respects... there's not much I can really say about this game.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.

												Not a bad little game.You dig down into the ground to find ores, while trying to dodge/kill the various monsters underground. Then you return to the surface to sell the ore and buy upgrades so you can go do it again.Very nice art style.One problem I have with it is the fact you can't reconfigure the controls, they are set in stone.

The game is pretty easy and the story simple but it is still enjoyable. A full playthrough took me about 5 hours but it could be done in half that.			"

												I really didn't know whether to give this game a thumbs up or thumbs down. It's pretty fun while it lasts, and it has beautiful art and music, but it only lasts 4 hours and it probably would only be 3 if the digging was reasonably fast instead of being (slightly) irritatingly slow. As it is, this would be an excellent flash game but isn't worth spending much on.			"

												A very mixed bag with this game. It cannot decide what it wants to be. Does it want to be super mario with the double jump and a head boss at the end? Does it want to be a game where you just explore and look for loot? The start of the game was great. Look for loot and get a better drill and other powers ups.  No time limit just explore to your hearts content.Great idea. Build up a town using loot to attract others. However for whatever reason they got bored with that idea and switched over to a head boss. Where you need to dodge laser beams, tons of bad guys and my favorite blocks that re appear after 2 seconds. Those never get old. Oh boy. Not only do you have to do this 3 times it gets harder after each wave. Great.  I feel like this game was designed by 2 different mind sets. One wanted it to be about exploring the other wanted a Mario Clone. Who doesnt love Mario right?The game looks and reminds me a lot like Platformines. However where that game knew what it was exactly. This game tries to straddle both lines and doesnt do a very good job at either. I recommend it with some caveats. Get the game cheap because its not a long game. Took me around 5 hours to get to the head boss. I did not finish the game as I got mad at the stupid end boss. Tried 3 times and called it a wrap. I Watched the ending on youtube. I wish they would have another game like this and leave out the Mario stuff and make the game what it should be exploring and finding stuff. I give it 6/10.			"

												Since getting about 12 hours ago, I have played it off an on for about 2 and a half hours.  I got a little frustrated with the gameplay after about 45 minutes because I kept dying, but I gave the game a second chance and I am in love with it. At first glance, you may think it is a Minecraft or Terraria ripoff, but it is nothing like that.  Mining is a part of the game and so is collecting resources, but it's not as grindy as you may expect.  The resource gathering is only part of the gameplay and it is more of something that you do on your way to your ""goals"".  SteamWorld Dig is slow to start off at first, but if you can stick with it through the first half hour, you will certianly enjoy it.  There are certain RPG elements in terms of having tech trees and upgrades, but the game is not too heavy in that area and does a good job at keeping things moving forward and pacing itself.  This isn't a game for everyone, but I think most people will enjoy it.  SteamWorld Dig is a relaxing game to play for an hour or two at a time or for several hours at once.  I highly recommend trying this game, especially for the price. So far with just over two hours, I already feel I got my money's worth.			"

												This is the reason indie games exist in my life. If someone told me I'd enjoy a game that consists of 4 hours of digging down a hole, I'd have said ""yeah, right"".There's this vicious grinding vibe that somehow finds its way to us, and suddenly you just don't care about pressing the pick button 50 times just to get yourself that shiny stone, only to go back up, sell it, and start it all over again.The metroidvania-esque elements are smartly spread across all the digging to keep things fresh, it's always exciting to find a new power up. By the end of the game the whole mechanic was already burned out so I'd consider it ended at a perfect timing, even though the actual ending feels very weird.Be very aware SteamWorld Dig is not for everyone, but if you are the sort of person who truly appreciates the experimental game mechanics indies are thankfully allowed to try, go ahead and Dig it.

												Apparently Steamworld Dig is a port of a 3DS title, and for that it more or less has no bugs or performance issues.  I've heard this game described as a metroidvania, but its more accurate to give it the -lite tag that has been applied to the roguelike genre.  It has some similarities but is lacking a lot of what makes those games interesting. The main core of the gameplay is more or less progression.  You dig, get minerals, return to town to sell minerals, and then buy upgrades to improve digging.  The similarities to metroidvanias pretty much lie in the 2d platforming and new abilities you find as you progress.  Enemies are not really interesting or varied, and the only boss battle is at the very end of the game.  You only need to backtrack at the very end of the game to access said boss battle, and quest markers make the goal of the backtracking fairly trivial.  The game is good at not being too difficult, as I never once found myself unable to get out of some pit I had dug and the game gives you a few ways to get out of such situations.  Even a little preparation makes it more or less impossible to become stuck and have to suicide via the pause menu, which is good.The story is just a minor premise of a relative owning the mine before you arrived and disappearing inside, and just gives a bit of a setting.  The only NPCs are vendors who give little small talk.  Aesthetics aren't very strong but are also not unpleasant, and while the music becomes repetitive after a bit it also did not grate on the nerves.Overall, about a 7 hour game for a full playthrough, and not much reason to replay.  Its not bad for a $10 title by any means, but I can't help but imagine that you would have better games to play unless you want a game with progression mechanics (which is the main gameplay) that doesn't require focus on the visuals or dialogue to enjoy it, so you can listen to a podcast or something.

												It's a nice, short, comfy little game. Decent platforming, if not not a little tricky with the walljumping. Nothing upgrades don't fix later on in the game. Charming 2D graphics that are pleasant to look at throughout. Definitely recommend if you want a game you can just chill out to while listening to music for a few hours			"

												This game is great, it's not entirely like Terraria. It's more simple, fight creatures, mine stuff, upgrades. However, there is only three areas which kind of dissappoints me, but it was probably to decrease file size from it's original release on the 3DS.Overall, it's worth the money.			"

												I really enjoyed this game! It's in the same genre as Motherload and Dig It, but expands upon it with an interesting story. So if you liked those games, get SteamWorld Dig! In addition, there are fun puzzles and upgrades, making it feel like you're really progressing through the game.That said, I wish it was a big longer, I completed it in about 6 hours. I also wish the story was more developed, though I went into the game not expecting any story at all, so good on them for making digging holes more than just... well, digging holes!			"

												If you're like me and you enjoy action platformer games with RPG elements (I am of course talking about the Metroid/Castlevania/Megaman genre), you will probably love this game. In the same vein as Dig Dug (I couldn't help using the pun!), SteamWorld Dig is primarily a digging game, featuring a robotic miner that mysteriously obtains the deed to a derelict mine. As you search the seemingly endless depths of the mine you collect resources, purchase power ups and retrofit your robot body with new upgrades, better weapons and digging equipment in order to reach even further into the darkness. All the while you must contend with environmental hazards, avoid falling down wells, combat the creatures the live underground and figure out how to reach ancient treasures in underground ruins. Additionally, you also have to contend with running out of light, water and inventory space - giving the game a slight survivalist undertone. Of course, you can upgrade your capacity to hold these resources through retrofits and upgrades in town. The story is great, the music and art is great, the controls are superb (I used an old Logitech Dual Shock controller with no problem) and the abilities and upgrades, if you take the time to grind for them, are mighty indeed! My only 2 gripes about the game are: 1) Some of the ""dialogue"" noise that the robot NPCs in town make. Some of them were particularly grating on the ears.2) The game left me wanting more! Despite taking my time and grinding for all the upgrades, I finished the game in under 10 hours. However, considering I didn't pay much (less than $5 dollars) and considering it was a greenlight game, I really can't gripe, especially considering the replayability of the game and the cool achievement goals. What more can I say!? Treat yourself to SteamWorld Dig immediately!  "

												Since getting about 12 hours ago, I have played it off an on for about 2 and a half hours.  I got a little frustrated with the gameplay after about 45 minutes because I kept dying, but I gave the game a second chance and I am in love with it. At first glance, you may think it is a Minecraft or Terraria ripoff, but it is nothing like that.  Mining is a part of the game and so is collecting resources, but it's not as grindy as you may expect.  The resource gathering is only part of the gameplay and it is more of something that you do on your way to your ""goals"".  SteamWorld Dig is slow to start off at first, but if you can stick with it through the first half hour, you will certianly enjoy it.  There are certain RPG elements in terms of having tech trees and upgrades, but the game is not too heavy in that area and does a good job at keeping things moving forward and pacing itself.  This isn't a game for everyone, but I think most people will enjoy it.  SteamWorld Dig is a relaxing game to play for an hour or two at a time or for several hours at once.  I highly recommend trying this game, especially for the price. So far with just over two hours, I already feel I got my money's worth.			"

On the one hand I like that the achievements aren't just ""you loaded the game, yay!"", but on the other hand I don't think it's fair to force players through replaying a not very replayable game to get achievements that you have to plan for perfectly. For example, sequence breaker requires you to know about the story's events beforehand, and then abuse game mechanics to achieve since you can't collect the needed upgrades to access the specific areas.

												This was a pretty nice ""spelunking"" game with a touch of metroid. You play as a steam robot named Rusty who arrives at  a remote Old West town in search for treasure - and to find out what happened to his father (I think). Turns out there is a  danger hidden in the depths. + Bright and mostly colorful visuals, with characters with some charm to them.+ Good music.+ A decent-enough story.- Not challenging enough, the only thing that ended up killing me a few times was falling rocks.- Rather short, took some 5-6 hours to finish and find nearly every ore and secret.- Frustrating to have to pay 50% of all you've earned so far to recover from a death, just make sure to spend it on upgrades so you won't lose it. - Enemies are not particualrly variated, mostly 2 versions of the same.Get it on a sale and you won't be disapointed, or maybe the 3DS/WiiU version would be better.

												Fun little game and very polished. It's not an incredibly long game, so pick it up on sale. After completing the game there are some definite issues that will either please hardcore gamers or seriously♥♥♥♥♥♥people off.Good:Style is pretty niceGreat music and atmosphereUpgrades to your character come pretty quickly, there's no grinding as suchLots of side things to do, and some of the achievements look like you have to make a serious effort.It's not like minecraft where you can dig wherever you want (pretty much). You need to plan routes or you can easily become stuck. You can't jump & mine simultaneously.Bad:Walljumping feels weird sometimes, but this is a problem with lots of games with wall jumpingSome deaths can be rage inducing. Initially I had ""take teleporters here"" but don't because...There is ZERO leeway on the number of orbs available in relation to what needs to be spent on upgrases. Spend any on teleporters? Sorry you're locked out of late game upgrades. Also I'm pretty sure there's not enough money to get through unless you play a perfect game. If you want to do achievements then this forces a second unnecessary playthrough.Digging can get a bit tedious unless you keep up to date on your pick and drill.Combat is kinda annoying. Wish there was an alternative to hitting something with your pick and waiting for it to path back. Dynamite isn't always a good choice.I didn't know you could charge the fist until right at the end of the game. I don't know if it's mentioned in a tooltip, maybe I missed it, but yeah, you can charge it to make it go farther.The sleeping trilobite achievements are BS and once again you're screwed if any of them wake up. Which they will in Vectron because you won't have the drill power to get them before they do. Unless you knew beforehand about it.Overall it isn't a game I would've paid full price for, but it was a fun time waster. On the one hand I like that the achievements aren't just ""you loaded the game, yay!"", but on the other hand I don't think it's fair to force players through replaying a not very replayable game to get achievements that you have to plan for perfectly. For example, sequence breaker requires you to know about the story's events beforehand, and then abuse game mechanics to achieve since you can't collect the needed upgrades to access the specific areas. Is this fair? I don't know. It feels like lazy design instead of adding more content.			"

												A clever indie take on Metroid-style games, blending in Mr. Driller-inspired digging around a vertically-oriented game world, with a hub town at the top. Character designs are full of charm, but are let down by some very flat writing.I completed this in around four hours. I enjoyed it, but something about the experience felt a little... hollow to me. Regardless, it's well worth the asking price.			"

												It's like Spelunky, but with saving.And probably less play time.I played a few hours and beat it. It was decently fun, but essentially just repeating the same thing over and over again. Dig down, get upgrade, go to surface, dig farther, need more upgrades, etc.Not a bad game, but too short. No difficulty settings or new game+.However, it was decently fun and is very well polished. Just needed to be about 5x longer.			"

												I would say that the Metroid influence here is very clear except that this game has very limited replay value. In general it takes around 6-7 hours to play through as a casual pace and frankly I was disapointed that it didn't progress into a more open ended game. This almost reminds me of Mr Driller, but with some character development. At it's normal price of £6.99 I wouldn't recommend it, but when it is on offer for less than £3 I would say it is worth a look if you want to enjoy a limited but well polished game with a lot of personality.

												Extremely repetitive, very dull. Dig to get money to buy a better pickaxe to dig. Repeat. Having the tiniest inventory in the world means that after every few ores you have to drudge your way back up the hole you dug, while hoping that you didn’t dig in a way that would trap you.The combat is incredibly dull, and amounts to mash ‘x’ to win. After an hour of play, I could only find two different enemy types: the slug thing and the monster that shoots four spikes.It feels like the developer just saw Minecraft or Terraria, but didn’t know what made them fun, and just attempted an exploration game anyway. Highly overrated. "

												I will start by saying that this game was incredibly fun and interesting. The ability to work your way through the levels and create your own system of tunnels, teleporters, and pathways is a cool concept that made me feel incredibly familiar with the potentially complex maps. Additionally, the ability to upgrade different parts of yourself based on what you find and what feel is most important was nice, although obviously going for every upgrade makes it easier to dig and survive longer.With all of that said, the game took me less than 3.5 hours to complete. The only reason I am not recommending this game is the length. It's a great game, but there is not enough to it to warrant your time/money. I managed to get the game during a steam sale so I only paid $5, but I'm still not sure I got my money's worth. Again, the art style is great, there is some good humor, and the digging/exploration are great. If you increase the amount of content by 5 to 10 times, then I would absolutely recommend this game!

Had i not got it on sale I would have been rather disapointed the games rather short with a disapointing ending sure it looks nice but theirs no repalyability which is a shot in the foot for a 4 hour experience with little plot and is a walk in the park. Some of the towns people really rubbed me up the wrong way with their noises as you are just looking for stuff to buy and alot of the stuff to buy is just to allow you to contiune to mine at the same speed as the deeper you go the harder the soil gets slowing you down. Would have prefered alot more of the puzzels as they were really the better part of the game.			"

												This game had caught my eye a while ago so it had been sitting in my wishlist for some time, so when I saw it at half off I snagged it.  Steam powered robots, a western setting, and mechanics that looked like one a better version of the old xGenstudios game, Motherload, all had this game looking like it'd be wicked fun.  I have to say I was a little let down.The art is decent, and the characters can be entertaining, but this game lacks depth.  It is only about four hous long.  Much of that time is spent on repetitive mining trips.  The limited platforming puzzles are a cinch, providing little in the way of real challenge.  The final boss fight was only tricky if you stayed still and it came to soon.  Right before the final battle, you get several upgrades that could have had some real fun platform puzzles attached but it just kind of fizzles.If I had paid anymore, I would have been angry,  at five bucks it's just a disappointment.

Worse than a $1 Xbox Indie GameAre you one of those people who never waded into the cesspit of Xbox Indie Games to find the few gems in it? If so, you missed the only-costs-a-dollar 2009 classic Miner Dig Deep, where you dig deeper into the mine to find rare minerals so you can afford better equipment and eventually reach the bottom. SteamWorld Dig has much better art than MDD, but is otherwise inferior in every way. In this game you can walljump, which largely removes the challenge of carefully tunneling in such a way that it's actually practical to leave the mine with your haul. Combat has also been added in, and it's BAD - your mining pick has a very short reach, and the two monsters I've encountered so far are more of a nuisance than a real threat. There are also special platforming levels (where you aren't allowed to use your items such as ladders to avoid the stupid platforming) that feel really out of place.			"

SteamWorld Dig got a fair amount of hype and praise when it released. While this is quite polished, and deserves the asking price, I found myself wanting more. Much more. It feels a *bit* more like a mobile game to me. I get that it is not, but ... Still. It plays like a MetroidVania lite with a low amount of upgradability.The whole package - the artwork and music and atmosphere - is fine enough, but this does not bring the level of complexity or open-worldness that is fairly standard with games like this.It is not bad by any means, just short on features and complexity.

												Steamworld Dig reminds me of another game, a game that this game was probably inspired by, and a game that, unlike Steamworld Dig, is free. Motherload. Motherload had the concept of you being on... Mars, I believe? You're given a machine to mine for ores, you sell the ores for money, you buy upgrades. The difference was that Motherload was actually good.Steamworld advertises itself as a ""platform mining adventure"". Well, it has mining, it has terrible platforming, and its a very boring adventure. It seems to be trying to have some steampunk western feel, but its just that. A feel. The western part feels poorly thrown in so that there wasn't more steampunk crap on the market, but as far as the game is concerned, it is very steampunk robot, and the only ""western"" part is that the main hub is a very ""kid's cartoon version of a wild west town"" town, and you got a cowboy hat. Yes, this is very western. The platforming, as said, is bad. Until you get a certain upgrade, you can suffer fall damage, which can hurt your ""adventures"" until you get it. Why fall damage in a platformer? Motherload also had fall damage but 1) It was not a platformer, 2) It gave you rockets from the start to get yourself out of a hole and to soften your fall. Here, you're expected to waste valuable orbs on teleporters, buy cheap ladders, which you can only carry 5 of at a time, or make your own ""platforms"", but if you got some TNT nearby, or a creature/robot that destroys tiles, then oh no, your platforms are gone.Motherload had a world that made sense. Sure, its final boss might have been something people didn't want/expect from that game of mining resources, but as you gain more valuable minerals, you could reasonably say you can sell them and expect a paycheck, since you're working for a corporation that has enough money to pay for you and another miner. In Steamworld Dig, you get a mine in a failing town, yet the town always has enough money to buy your full-to-the-brim inventory of diamonds, worth about 500 gold each. Why is this town paying me for♥♥♥♥♥♥it ain't using, when it could use the infinite money it has to improve its town? Nitpicky? Maybe, but Motherload had a believable world, where as this world is just... ehhh.This game involves something terrible. Backtracking. You'll have to go back to old zones, or back to the main hub at times during the game's ""story"", so some random woman robot can tell you something you already figured out. There's a bunch of lasers blocking your way, and you already had to deal with lasers before by destroying their generator? Nope. You gotta go back to town so she can tell you what you already figured out. Speaking of story, its not a very good one from what I've seen. ""Oh hey, your uncle is dead, and there's this strange stuff below the mine that gives you upgrades, I wonder what it was all for"" repeat ad nausem. I'm feeling like I'm near the end of the game, and there's nothing like a journal entry to give me a hint of what's happening soon. Why my uncle was keeping this tech a secret. It's just... tech. That no one knows about, that gives me upgrades, and no reason for its secreacy. I'm hoping that if I continue to play this game, I get an answer to that, but for now, the story just doesn't advance. You just get upgrades, and people talk about how odd the upgrades are, and nothing happens.$10? No. Don't pay $10. Wait for a sale, or for it to appear on the Humble Bundle.			"

												Anyone describing this as a ""Metroidvania"" game doesn't know what the term means.  Yes, your character finds upgrades throughout the game, but there's no exploration aside from ""dig down, then dig down some more"".  If you want a good feel for what the game's like, go look up the flash game ""Motherload"".  Steamworld Dig is pretty much just a prettier version of Motherload.You dig until you can't dig any more (lack of resources or full inventory), you go back up, sell what you've found, go back down, dig more, and repeat until the game's done.  There are some puzzle caves along the way, but they never really present a huge challenge, and I ended up spending the entire game waiting for things to start getting interesting, and then the credits rolled.

												The best word to sum up SteamWorld Dig is ""transparent"".The game loop consists entirely of going into the mine, collecting ore, going back up, selling it, buying +1 to your pick, and repeating. It is an extremely mindless and unchallenging way to spend 3 hours. It's not fun or interesting at any point.I get it. All games require some sort of loop to keep you playing it and keeping the feel consistent. But SteamWorld is, as I said, completely transparent. Nothing exciting or shocking happens, there are no interesting puzzles to solve, challenging monsters to battle, or interesting characters to talk to. There's nowhere to explore, and nowhere to go but deeper into the mine, where the gems are a new color and the numbers are bigger. If, like me, you play this game to the end, you will hate it and yourself all the way through for being so obviously manipulated into dull, glassy-eyed complacency by a skinner box's ""reward"" of a bigger number next to your mining pick. Do yourself a favor and don't buy it - and if you have bought it, just say no. Life's too short for this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.			"

												SteamWorld Dig isn't bad, but it really just made me want to play Spelunky.  If you can get it cheap, it's worth a play through if you like these type of games, but overall I can't recommend it as a buy.This game is not trite or contrived at all.  It's quite the opposite...it's fresh and interesting, and it's authentic and well-done.  It simply isn't as fun as it could or should be, and in the end is not a particularly satisfying play.  On one hand, I beat it as fast as I could so I could get it over with, but on the other hand, it was interesting enough to make me want to finish.SteamWorld is a cute little game, and the story is fine, but too much of the game is either repetitive or simply not fun.  The only non-repetitive part is using the new tech you acquire as you progress, and certainly the new tech is pretty fun to use.  But the game is so short, you are acquiring the new tech about every 30 minutes or so, in which time the novelty from the previous acquisition has not yet worn off.  More simply put, acquiring new tech was sort of ho-hum rather than exciting.Story and graphicsThese are definitely strong points.  Along with overall atmosphere.  I got the rogue man in a strange new world feeling from it.  The townspeople are good characters and add to the feeling of authenticity.GameplayGameplay is fine, and probably is the biggest challenge, in a good way.  Getting a feel for the wall jumping takes some practice, but when you get it down, you can maneuver quite well, and it is rewarding.   Combat is pretty simple...it could be more dynamic.  Combat gets repetitive.  Also, having to climb back out of the cavern time after time gets old fast.Upgrades, Leveling, and Resource ManagementThese are fun at first, but get repetitive quickly.  Finding minerals gets old fast.  It becomes a chore.  Upgrades are very linear and uninteresting (each upgrade is basically plus damage or more resource efficiency).  Upgrades would have been much more interesting if there were trees to choose from or tradeoffs (speed vs power, or different gimmicks) instead of having them be so linear.  Finding the crystal balls is exciting at first, but toward the end, they seemed to be everywhere.  Also, I found the limited lantern time to add nothing to the game...it only served to annoy when the flame ran out.TL;DR:  SteamWorld Dig is a short game with a fresh story and environment, and certainly some fun parts, but it has too many repetitive and overly linear aspects that make it overall not particularly satisfying to play.

												The first hour really isn't encouraging me to keep playing. It's a pretty game, but the mechanics design is lacking. You can only dig directly to your left, right, up, or down, and you can't dig while jumping. This means that you can easily get yourself stuck, since you have no way of building an upwards staircase, or breaking through a ledge two blocks above you.If you're really into the wild west steampunk robot aesthetic, then you'll probably enjoy this game, but as an exploration game/digger it fails in many respects. The linear puzzle levels are where it shines, but getting between those is a slog of slowly digging downwards and avoiding the gems not in your path out of fear of getting stuck.			"

												So as with all “”reviews”” this is my personal opinion and that opinion is I don’t like it and i don’t recommend it im sure that some will love it but not me.So reasons I didn’t like it, it felt like a free flash game, the story from what little I played of it was you have a mine so did to find gold so you can dig some more (there may be more to it but I have better games to play) now I can’t say I remember what the soundtrack was like so that’s not a bad thing but it can’t have been great or ied remember it.So if you love grindy puzzle platformers pay no attention to what I say you will at least like it but if not don’t get this game.

												I don't really get all this hype around ""SteamWorld Dig"". Imagine a ""Terraria"" version there you would not be able to build and craft anything but only sell items, and buy new ones from merchant. Also simplify world so blocks are much bigger. That's, more or less my experience with ""SteamWorld Dig"". Also you are forced to repetively go back not only because of limited inventory size, but also because of light source exhaust. I suppose they did it to make game last a bit longer, but seriously this just adds frustration. Music and especially enviroment also become very repetative soon. So we have a some sort of a very simplified ""Terraria"", which is a great game, but this, at maximim, just quarter as fun.			"

												This game made the fundamental mistake that I see rather often. It attempted to create a fusion of several great games and genres, but did so without a core comprehension of what made those games good in the first place. The gameplay can be split into three aspects.The first is the town area, where you can buy upgrades and talk to people. That's about it. To be fair, not much more can be expected out of a town area in a game with only a few hours of gameplay. But you may very well come to hate this town as you keep having to return over and over again. The second aspect are the caves beneath the town. Have you ever played Minecraft or Terraria and thought, ""Man, I love digging through solid walls for extended periods of time!""? If so, this might be the game for you. Otherwise...There are things to be found in the caves, yes. However, all of the major things you /need/ to find are thrown right into your face so you don't miss them. On top of that it's just enemies, pockets of space, and ore.  Speaking of ore, the game has a brilliant way of artificially extending its length: only letting you carry three stacks of an ore at once. I don't really see any good reason for this besides forcing you to go back up to the surface sometimes. Which of course involves backtracking all the way up the shaft you've dug down up to the last warp point to the surface. Other than that occasionally interrupting the game flow (and using the word ""occasionally"" is being generous), it's nothing but digging around looking for ores and then digging downwards to continue with the game. Oh, and did I mention that the better digging tools you get all have limited fuel? So you'll need to backtrack for that too. This whole major aspect of the game feels incredibly pointless and like it's designed to take way longer than it needs to.The final aspect of the game are the special challenge caves you find along the way.  These are certainly the best part of the game, but they're dragged down by the main cave. If the main cave didn't exist and the engine was truly made for a platformer with puzzle aspects rather than what it is, they would likely play a lot better. The most apparent example is enemies. Combat just does not play out very well because all of your ""weapons"" are digging tools. I think if the entire game consisted of gameplay like in these caves and if the engine was made to reflect that then the game would certainly have a lot of potential. But as is? Eh.....			"

												I'm not recommending this because there's a danger you're looking at this and thinking""Hey, that's one of those digging games""It's not one of those digging games...Basically, what you're looking at is a jumpy platformer which just happens to require you dig between areas - and requires you earn upgrades to do that.  The 'game' here is timed rrunning/jumping/wall jumping and the controls are - erm - not the best, shall we say.You'll spend a lot of time wall jumping - which works 'when it feels like it'.  You'll spend a lot more time falling when it doesn't.You character also slides on landing (you fall off a lot) and generally just doesn't have the pin sharp control you want in a platform game (all IMO of course)The game is also pretty short and quite grindy even tho it's fairly short.Want a digging game?  Look elsewhere (perhaps Motherload/Super Motherload)Want a platformer with tight controls?  Loads of those out there which won't demand you grind to unlock the next level too!			"

												The game has no illusions about what it is and what it intends for you to do: dig, gather minerals and sometimes hit bugs just like you're hitting stones. An hour in and if I wasn't listening to podcasts I would be extremely♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that I just wasted that much time. Progression is slow; you have to methodically chip away at the walls and make sure that you've got some openings on the walls on the off chance you pass under some minerals that you cannot reach. You can expand your pack but you're still running back to the nearest teleporter every few minutes to drop off another load in the hopes that you can afford a decent upgrade.The platforming is stiff and entirely reliant on finding certain upgrades rather than any actual skill: if you can't reach it, you're not meant to yet. Oh and there is some light backtracking, great.It's just a mindless, bland little game. Lovely graphics and a cute idea but if you have any other game to play, do that instead.			"

												This game was surprisingly fun. It has something for everyone. Casual players can enjoy the game and hardcore players can aim for the time, resource, and no death achievements.This game plays like Dig-Dug and oldshool Megaman had a baby. There are various upgrades to buy, which adds fun, but there is no new game plus. Replay value is offered in the form of the previously mentioned achievements.This game was a great break from more story intensive games where every decision alters your course. It has just enough story to make progressing interesting.8/10			"

												While it was cute and fun. The game overall just has you digging like a madman. It will make up 90% percent of it. While I liked parts of it...as a whole I did not. I needed more puzzle solving or just anything to get my gaming motivation going. Try it if you want, but remember its all about digging deep for lack of change.			"

												Though I enjoy the game's art design and setting, the gameplay is completely bland. You grind for minerals in order to collect upgrades. The upgrades let you grind for materials more efficiently. The monsters you fight are limited, and the fighting mechanics are subpar at best. The act of digging for minerals just isn't fun, and the only reward you get for partaking in this dull exercise is the ability to dig deeper in order to find even more minerals.			"

												When it comes right down to it, the game is boring.  You essentially dig into dungeons and ore and fight enemies with your pickaxe.  That's about it, it doesn't really expand the forumula, even given the additional powerups, not to mention you're holding the dig button all the time and occasionally jumping if you're avoiding something or going back to the base to sell stuff.The biggest issue is the variation that is there, is not very engaging or interesting.  You'll gather minerals to get a better pickaxe to then gather more minerals gaining a few special moves along the way.  The enemy varation is very poor, there's few enemies and they all are bit on the floaty side.  The first ones you encounter you just hold your dig button and trap them agains the wall and the second you hit them and run away, then repeat.I wanted to like this game, but due to it being singleplayer only, lacking depth (pun) and being incredibly repetitve, I didn't even get enjoyment out of it from a bundle, and I LOVE Terraria, it's easily one of my faves.I'd say avoid.

I downloaded it on a whim, while having a ""I don't feel like playing anything"" kind of night, plugged in my Xbox One controller, and set out playing it for my first time.3 hours later, I realized I was having a good time, digging deeper and deeper, and smiling at the mix of humour and instant gratification.It's a well thought-out game, has good level design for the puzzle challenges (caves), it offers tons of upgrades to discover, and just feels great.Intuitive controls, lots of ""carrot on a stick"" motivation, and just feels good to play.It's worth the price, and then some.I certainly recommend this game.

												This game popularly known as Rango The Game. Honestly I'd rather watch the movie than play it. I mean seriously, the voice actor for Rango isn't even Johnny Depp!!! Also, the depiction of Rango in this game makes him appear more robot-like than lizard. The gore in the game is quite graphic too, I let my child watch me while I played and when I died he ran off crying and has never been the same. When I finally finished this gruesome fps lizard-simulator, the town wasn't given anymore water..... like what the hell?? IT""S NOT EVEN THE SAME ENDING AS RANGO!!!!!!!!!!Steamworld Dig??? More like Rango Unchained....Gameplay: Needs a more open world approach... more of a like a Skyrim to get that real Rango feel  Story: Needs more lizards and Johnny Depp voice actingGraphics: Needs updated graphics to get anywhere in the world... more like Roblox or Battlefield 4Engine: I have a nvidia geforce 990gtx graphics card, and yet I can run Battlefield 4 on ultra with ENBs enabled better than this.... savagely hardware intensive had to build a new computer just for this gameThank you... can't wait for more!!!!

												In this game, you dig. A lot. For hours. That's all you do. Oh yeah, and you have to climb out of the hole you dig ever 3 minutes because your light runs out, or you have to sell ore for a couple of bucks (because you can only carry a few ores at a time). With that money you can buy upgrades to carry more ore, or mine faster... Except the ground gets harder as you go down so you never feel like you are getting a better pick. It's about the most boring and tedious game I've ever played.Occasionally you will find a cave, with an upgrade to your abilities (ala Metroid). But they are only useful in said caves, and the most useful one I found was the ""Steam Jump"", which you could only do like twice without needing water, which was basically nonexistent in the mines.The graphics are nice to look at, and the music isn't bad...at first. Until you realize that it's like a 2 minute loop for the main area. So not only is digging tedious, it has super repetive music.If you die, you get taxed. Yes, taxed.

												This game is easily the best game I have ever played in my life. This game's plot is incredibly in depth and well thought out. I wont spoil anything in this review, but it has an fantastic story line filled with romance and betrayal. There is a great suprise ending. All of the characters have well written back stories and have great character progression. One of the robots' stories had me literally in tears by the end of the game. Her story has inspired me to reform my shallow life. The characters in this game have more depth to them than most people I know. The gameplay to this masterpiece is very good as well. I would say that this game might be mechanically too difficult for the average casual gamer, but for truely hardcore gamers it will challenge you and truely push you to your limits. Gamers seeking a challenging game that they can seek to master will absolutely love steamworld dig. There are many different ways one can go about trying to accomplish the main goal of the game; ""digging"". First, and most important, is using the pickaxe to break appart blocks in order to collect resorces. This might seem like a realatively easy task, but it gets more difficult as the game goes on. Luckily there are other ways to accomplish this ""digging"". You can use the drill and steam punch later on in the game to quickly and efficiantly dispose of pesky blocks. This will however drain one of your important resorces; ""water"". Managing this ""water"" resorce while maintaining rapid ""digging"" rates is one of the most important ways to improve your effectiveness in steamworld dig. This all may sound pretty complicated and technical. Sorry to disapoint casual players, but it is. Steamworld dig has an extremely high skill floor. Masters will be delighted to find it has a very high skill ceiling as well. Because of the high skill ceiling and the indepth plot steamworld dig has very high replay value. I know I have logged hundreds of hours into this game just to experience all of the outcomes.Steamworld dig has the best graphics out of any game released so far (to my knowledge). The robots and an insane level of detail and the dirt blocks look more real than the dirt outside my house. Truely the artists that put together the visuals should be praised for their attention to detail and their ability to create 3d models that bring this game to life. I have spent hours in steamworld dig just walking around so I could full appreciate the detail and craftsmenship of the game's artists. Once, during a 24 hour marathon, I forgot  I wasnt in real life. I would recomend getting this game even just to observe the graphics. Its hard to make comparisons to other games because steamworld dig is just so far ahead of any other game. Overall I would recomend this game to anyone who wants a beautiful, challenging, and well written game. This is my favorite game of all time and I hope it can soon be yours as well!			"

												Boy is this game boring. It is a real life pickaxe swinging simulator combined with a simulation of wall jumping back up hundreds of feet that you have dug to constantly go back up to the surface to sell items. I found a teleporter, but that only works for so long until you dig down so far that it becomes a real chore and a burden getting back to it, especially since if you dug around a certain way you can't jump up but sometimes you can use a steam powered jump but if you are out of water you can't use it... what a mess. I couldn't afford another personal teleporter because I didn't have any more blue orbs and they are hard to come by, so it was back to wall-jumping my way back up to the teleporter to reach town. In fact, this could have been a much better game if there was a easier way to get back to town to sell your mined ore, but there isn't. I started falling asleep because about 90% of my time was spent wall jumping back up, way up, and the rest of my time was spent pressing the B button on the controller to hit rocks.What a ♥♥♥♥ing borefest, 3/10			"

												Plot (Engaging, but nothing too spectacular):Rusty (if I had a nickel for every robot with that name…) inherits a mineshaft from his dead uncle but soon discovers there’s some pretty weird stuff going on down there. Mainly curiosity is the driving force behind the plot and once that curiosity is fulfilled the rest if somewhat forgettable. On top of that the game ends on a somewhat sad note (and from what I can tell, there aren’t any alternate endings). As for the other characters they’re fairly generic and a bit annoying. You’ve got your old-geezer, rootin-tootin-Texan, rich snob, bimbo and the other fem-bot with a fairly bland personality. One particular quirk that stands out is that Rusty only talks at the beginning and end of the game. In between he’s your silent protagonist. Gameplay (I think I’ve seen similar on a popular flash-game hosting site): If you’re looking for another Terraria you’re going to be disappointed. While it plays borrows from the block-mining genre like Terraria, Starbound and Junk Jack it seems quite lacking in depth by comparison. Mining serves to acquire ores with which to upgrade Rusty. There’s no crafting, all you can do with the ores is sell them for upgrades to buy from the old-geezer, rootin-tootin-Texan and rich-snob. Also you can’t skip upgrades. Say you have enough for the highest tier armor, but you still have basic armor. Before you can buy the highest tier you have to buy the other armors first. Back to the mining, you can’t put blocks back which can make it difficult to reach those ores you missed if you’re not strategic about how you dig. While you can buy ladders you can only hold 5 at a time and you can’t take them back once you set them down. Replay Value (…meh):The game follows a linear path with a definite end rather than a sandbox type game with endless replay value. At the end you’re given an evaluation for your performance such as how long you took or how many times you died. There’s probably an achievement for getting gold on all ranks, but personally I can’t say I find the game interesting enough to try for it. All and all I wouldn’t say it’s a bad game, but if you’re looking for something that will keep you busy long term, look elsewhere.			"

												Sort of fun, but there are maaaany things it needs. 1. You can't even change half the controls, including movment! The default controls for movement are the arrow keys. They need to change it so you can actually change the controls for moving. 2. IT'S A TOTAL RIP-OFF OF SPELUNKY! Go right now and search ""spelunky"". Compare the metascores and the fact that it came before this. There you go. 3. I don't like the fact that you have to be facing a certain way if you want to mine that way. I prefer the Terraria style of mining, where you put your mouse over the block you want to mine and click to mine it. Please add this option or something similar. Now, I do understand that this is a very new game, but these are things that should've been fixed before they released it. Especially the most obvious one: BEING ABLE TO CHANGE THE DARN CONTROLS! I don't know how they could've missed that, and I can barely play it because the controls are so awkward! It feels like it was designed for a left-handed person. And as my own personal taste, I would rather play a game like fez or the stanley parable. Go buy those games. They're undeniably fun and enjoyable.			"

												At first glance, SteamWorld Dig may seem like a Terraria-style game, or otherwise a slow-paced game about getting into the dirt.Not so fast there, pardner.This game has a unique aesthetic, a surprisingly interesting story (told without feeling forced or in-your-face), and some very competent platforming controls that let you take on some surprisingly tough sidescrolling challenges. What's more, even the digging itself is interesting; once you dig downwards, you can't easily make a branch off of the shaft you've made, which encourages you to dig careful exploratory shafts to hunt down loot early in the game. There's an element of thoughtfulness to mining in this game, and it works well with the simple combat and platforming.Later in the game, you can expect to face everything from explosives to acid to deadly monsters in the depths, so the game isn't short on diverse challenges, either. Without spoiling anything, suffice to say that by the end of the game, you'll be facing challenges far more bizarre than you probably had in mind. Give the game a try; it'll probably surprise you.

												I don't understand why this game has such rave reviews from critics. This is a game that's more suited to be a free game on the pages of Kongregate than a game you pay money for. The art style is boring and the game can get a little repetitive considering you mine minerals to get better equipment to mine even more minerals. Your money is better spent elsewhere.			"

												SteamWorld Dig is a similar design to Terraria, however it is has more puzzles and only a single boss battle.  It is an experience that falls in line with a platformer, you don't craft and it is definately a more finite world.  The character power progression feels good, which encourages you to keep going.  I enjoyed my time playing it, but I wouldn't have paid the full price and I don't see myself revisting the game again.  I'd recommend the game if you really enjoy Terraria and traditional platformers.  Fair warning, it is a short experience which will only take 3-4 hours to complete.			"

The game is the Dig Dug tribute that we desever all honestly but the one that will be overlooked. And In my own opinon plays better on the PC then the 3DS version but then again I'll have to buy the 3DS version and dissect it on my own time. This Coal mine is a true gem.

												Wonderful game!  Easy to learn but it does not hold your hand throughout gameplay.  Simple but interesting narrative told in various different ways throughout your journey.  Fun characters to interact with.  Interesting items and upgrades.  Great soundtrack, great art, gameplay keeps you coming back and wanting more.  Challenging but not too difficult.  I wish that I would have been able to grow the town more and I wish that a couple of the charaters would've brought more to the story/game.  Could have been a few more variety of enemies possibly.  I wish that I could carry more than 5 ladders at a time, also.  These things are definitely nitpicky and do not greatly affect the quality of the game or gameplay, but I did feel like I should throw in a few things that could be improved on if they make a sequel.  9/10 for sure, one of the best games I played in 2013 (even though I finished it in 2014).

												I was excited to hear that Steam would come to Linux, as Wine can be a royal pain in the $@#! I've tried 4 games so far and this is by far the best. I've played a lot of games on Windows, SNES, PS2, and others, so I can tell you, this is a great game to play a few minutes, or an hour at a time. Imagine digging your way through Super Mario Brothers 2 with a pick-axe and a Steampunk/Wild West theme. The art is gorgeous and the music isn't half-bad either. The best part is, it develops into a puzzle game where you have to dig in the right places, while still allowing you to go ape on a few beasties. There are various upgrades too you earn by turning in ore. These new Flash-type games are refreshing. The FPS 3D stuff is just too violent; I don't worry about my 3yo boy watching me play this.			"

												The notion of ‘digging’ has carved out a niche little sub-genre in recent times. We’ve had the indie juggernaut that is Minecraft, Super tough Spelunky and Terraria to name just a few. SteamWorld Dig  is, as the title suggests, another game that wants you to dig. However, it’s certainly doing it in its own way.Playing as Rusty, a lone steamboat designed for digging, you find yourself exploring a post-apocalyptic world where humans seem to have disappeared. You arrive in the dustbowl town of Tumbleton after receiving the deed to your Uncle Joe’s mine. The town is home to a few remaining robotic inhabitants and it’s up to you to uncover the story of the mine and the towns folk.Your initial forays into the mine will mainly be to find gold and gems which can then be traded and used to upgrade Rusty. All manner of items and upgrades are available and they continually expand as you find more money to spend. Along with this you will gradually uncover more abilities that Rusty can use to help traverse the depths. There’s an element of Metroid to the character advancement but we wouldn’t go as far as to say that this is a Metroidvania.The game world sets itself out into three main sections. You have the town where you can talk and upgrade, the main part of the mine and self-contained rooms within it. For a large amount of the game you’ll be continually digging downward in the main mine area. The goal here is to find cash, avoid critters and find rooms as you uncover the truth of what happened to the humans and the world. The deeper you go, the thicker the rock gets and the tougher the enemies become. Unless you keep upgrading it can be a tiresome task to break through the bedrock so you’ll need to be heading back to the surface to upgrade your pickaxe and other mining gear often.This is perhaps one of the few flaws with the game. While there are a number of short cuts back to the surface, there really aren’t enough of them for it to stop the game from dragging and getting repetitive on occasion. It’s not so bad when going down the mine as you can normally drop down tunnels you’ve dug, but going back up can be tiresome. It’s not enough to take away from the experience in the long term and there are teleporters that can be purchased, but a few more short cuts really wouldn’t have gone a miss.The self-contain rooms within the mine provide a mixture of both platforming and puzzle solving to negotiate. Plot related rooms lead to power ups and boss fights while other hidden areas generally contain precious gems. SteamWorld Dig really is a platformer at heart and these rooms allow for the developers to show off how they have mastered the form. You’ll need quick reflexes and a good understanding of how your powers work to succeed and the difficulty level is pitches just about perfect throughout. Each room and boss is challenging but you’ll always feel you know how you should be beating it - it’s just a case of mustering the skill to do it.There’s something really compelling about the game and as you dig deeper (both literally and into the mystery), you’ll really want to know what’s going on. It’s the sort of game you’ll start playing for a few minutes and end up sticking with for hours. Moving from the 3DS eshop to the PC digital services was always going to be a tough jump but it’s one that SteamWorld Dig has made easily and it shows a skill and understanding by the development team rarely seen elsewhere. SteamWorld Dig may well have gone unnoticed by a lot of you, but we would really recommend checking it out. It’s no longer just one of the best 3DS eshop titles but one of the best digital games available right now and it offers a fun, challenging and fresh experience for gamers to test themselves with no matter the platform.Overall 8/10			"

												I would just like to start by saying that I absolutely loved this game! It's officially one of my new favorites and I would heartily recommend it to just about anyone.Steamworld Dig is what results in a mashup between something like Terraria, where you're digging a mine through a randomly generated world for resources. And Metroid, where you find upgrades that make your journey easier/more badass. The game's randomly generated ""overworld"" makes up the bulk of the game, where you're digging your way down looking for minerals that will allow you to purchase upgrades back in town, and looking for the predesigned (not RNG) caves that give you new items or just a little challenge with large rewards. The mineshaft that connects these caves is not as dull as a large pile of underground dirt initially could sound though. The random generation in the world is very well done, making the mine fun to explore as you come across larger open areas, mazelike hard stone that you can't initially dig through, and plenty of enemies. The game also does a very good job teaching you its many mechanisms, with a steady drip of mechanics to keep you interested as you mine your way further down. New enemies, objects that both hurt and help you, and a surprisingly large amount of items for your little digbot to accumulate you'll be seeing new things all the way to the very end. The platforming is also surprisingly well executed, with high flying antics near the end of the game consisting of a super and double jump, dodging a multitude of lasers.Now that I've extolled its virtues, there are a couple of flaws. Nothing major mind, more like missed opportunities that very easily could've come from it being made by a smallish indie developer. First, I feel like the game could've used more of the pre-designed challenges. The challenge caves you find never take very long, and I feel like the game would've been exponentially better if they had gone whole hog on full zeldaesque dungeon design rather than single-multi room platforming challenges. Similarly, I think that having more than a single boss would've helped the difficulty of the game, which, while never easy, isn't one of the hardest I've ever played. It's also a tad shorter than I would've liked, though that's more a personal thing related to wanting to keep playing.Overall, a highly enjoyable game that is most definately worth the very low price of $10.

												Pretty fun game, I must say! It takes me back to my older 'Miner Dig Deep' or 'Motherlode' days but with a platforming aspect that really adds to the depth of the game. It's simple enough to grasp that the addictive qualities of the game can really sink their hooks into you pretty quickly. Also, there's a certain metroidvania charm to is as well as you increase your abilities to access new areas via new technology you uncover. All in all I'd definitely recommend the game to anyone looking for a fun time, especially at this price point.Still not convinced?

												Dig for ore, sell ore, upgrade equipment. Rinse and repeat. Except with SteamWorld Dig there is enough of a backstory to keep you intrigued and the equipment you are upgrading is....yourself. You are off in search of your father in his old mines and you meet a few interesting characters along the way. Gameplay is as you would expect, audio is about average (which is not to say that it's bad), and the graphics are fairly well done and have a nice polish to them. The game is easy to learn and not too difficult to master.The issue I have with this game is that it's very short. I've almost completely upgraded my character and I've already beaten the game. Once the game is over there isn't much replayability which saddens me because I really do enjoy the feel of the game. The problem with a story arc like the one in this game is that it's not open-ended so you don't feel the need to come back for more when it's over. Hopefully there will be some DLC to help expand the story and give it the replayability that it sorely needs.If you can find it on sale it's a definite grab. If not it depends on what you like in a game. If you enjoy mining/selling/upgrading games then this might be worth the $9 tag.			"

												It is a great game, a tad on the short side.  I wish there was some DLC extension content.  Overall I'd say the game is worth the time to play through.The upgrading and platform action really scratch an old-school itch without a crazy amount of frustration.  The mining alspect is surprisingly fun as well.			"

												Definitely a very solid, enjoyable game, the gameplay a nice mix of Metroid and Terraria.  It introduces new gameplay mechanics flawlessly, right about the time when you've mastered the old ones and are looking for something new.Don't expect this game to last too long, though - it's only about 4-5 hours of gameplay (unless you're like me and need to explore every single nook and cranny, in which case expect it to clock in at 6 hours).  Sadly, there isn't much replayability here.My only really big complaint is the music.  Don't get me wrong, the music - what there is of it - is great.  But there's not enough.  I got pretty sick of listening to the same track over and over again while I was mining.  A little variety there is sorely missing.7/10			"

												This is a fun, simple, sandbox puzzle game.  However, it is too simple, it doesn't really push any boundaries or have a whole lot of new exciting elements.  Basically you just dig deeper and deeper, and solve puzzles along the way.  It could be fun if you like puzzles (I'm not a big fan of them) but even then, the puzzles are way too easy, even for me.  Also the start of the game is extremely slow and tedious.  There isn't a whole lot of buyables and you spend way too much time digging.  As the game progresses you are able to dig faster to speed things up with a drill but the drill requires water so if you run out you have to go back to using your slow pickaxe.  And the ""town"" really only has 3 other people (robots) in it and 1 doesn't really do anything.  The chat can be witty but really there just isn't a whole lot there.  It's a pretty short game as it is.Overall this game could be worth getting if you like sandbox puzzles but only if you can get it for a really good price.  I don't know whether to give it a thumbs up or down because I'm pretty mixed so I'll just give it a thumbs up because it still seems to be a fairy well made game and because I'm nice.			"

												SteamWorld Dig possesses a unique combination of old-school progression and mastery, and the modern spelunking style of gameplay.  As you dig deeper, you overcome challenges in order to unlock new mechanics that will enable to go further and solve new problems.  It's a tight, satisfying progression structure which fits into a relatively short, but satisfying time.Post game challenges emphasize mastery, ranking the player on the speed of completion, as well as items collected and deaths endured.  It is perhaps the most approachable game of it's kind, though gaming veterans may find it to be shallow by comparison.			"

												This is a quaint little title, not too indie, not too mainstream.  When i first saw it, i immediately drew correlations to Minecraft or Terraria, but this game plays by its own set of rules, and has its own distinct flavor.   You dig for minerals, bring them to the surface, and exchange them for money, which you then use to upgrade your equipment.  Its very simple, and yet, its just complex enough to be compelling. Overall i found this game very enjoyable and very inexpensive.  I recommend buying it next time it goes on sale			"

												SteamWorld Dig is very charming and a lot of fun. Many people as whether or not the game is similar to 'Terraria', and the answer is no. If you were to compare SteamWorld Dig to any other game I think the closest would be Motherlode - the old(ish) Flash title that was popular on Miniclip. You go underground, you dig for minerals, you return to the surface to drop them off and make money to purchase new upgrades in order to dig for more minerals, more effectively. It's simple, but the game's constant introduction of new mechanics keep it challenging and interesting. In 2013, where there are so many games out there that focus on exploration that give the player a degree of sandbox freedom, it is fair to wonder whether or not a game like this will gather a large fanbase. In a sandbox game, the exploration and gathering of materials feels a little bit more organic than in Steamworld Dig, where you really only have a few options for upgrades and the resources are essentially melted down into the same currency. SteamWorld has no intention of being that kind of organic exploration/survival title though, but people will still draw that comparison and I am sure that there are people that will find fault with that. If you're looking for a game that fits that description, SteamWorld is not for you.I have two main faults with the game. First, the PC port does not allow for the rebinding of keys. I am usually pretty lax when it comes to crucifying a game for being a lackluster port but not giving me the ability to re-bind keys is a pretty big issue - especially when the game uses up, down, left, right as the movement controls and not WASD, meaning some gamers with 'gaming' keyboards (such as the Logitech G510) will run into input conflicts. I found myself using an Xbox 360 controller and a third party program, which I think benefited the game, but is still inexcusable. Second, the length. I beat Steamworld in 3.5 hours according to my save file, and I am by no means a good gamer. For $9.99, that isn't entirely damning of the game, but it does leave you wanting more. There are plenty of achievements that encourage replay, though.			"

												This game comes across as Spelunkys more forgiving cousin. You go and dig around and find some precious minerals and gems then hawk them for some cash to buy upgrades for your little robot character.  The art style has steampunk and wild western influence in visual direction and executes it rather well without being too bulk with it. The Music is typical western movie with slight electronic highlights and is quite enjoyable. The game controls quite well with a controller and doesnt feel it'd be unfriendly to a keyboard its easy to pick up and get right into with the layout and movement. When it comes down to it its a fun, simple and short little game worth picking up on sale but dont expect anything particularly groundbreaking despite the interesting turns the adventure takes.			"

												(7.5/10) SteamWorld Dig is a fun and addictive mining game. You play Rusty, a steambot, who just acquired the will to his uncle's mine. The game has you explore the mine, and as you explore you uncover upgrades, and progress the story. Upgrades are key in this game, and it is exciting to see each new piece of hardware. There is a handful of NPCs in the town of Tumbleton above the mine, and they provide depth of the story, and purchasable upgrades for Rusty. There is a nice list of Steam achievements and a medium replay value. The art style is beautiful, and the audio is surprisingly good. This 2D platformer is a fast paced hour run through, or a leisurely six hour adventure. It is a great PC port from the original Nintendo 3DS.			"

												I really enjoyed this game; very much a metroid feel (cant progress to the new area before you get a poweru) but in a block drilling world.  Areas of the game are randomly generated (while the actuall dungeons you find within, are static) so every time you play it is massivly different giving it some replayability.  I drilled every resource in the game (completionist), and blasted through the story in 5:33 min but most reviews I see are 6-8 hours.  This game was so addictive I beat it within two sittings.  The only reason I was turned on to this game was it cought my eye during the christmas sale, but looking back now I would pick it up for the retail price had I known how good it was earlier.  This game ranks up there with some of the best games I've ever played and I recommend it to everyone.			"

												Just finished this one up and really had a lot of fun. But then again I am very patient. For a good portion of this game after a few accomplishments earlier in game play you'll find yourself a little confused. After digging and digging and more digging I started wondering if I was missing something or even going in the right direction. There isn't much indication of where you are in your game play which is fine but you don't find yourself finding an exact direction(besides down) to follow. Not to spoil but I believe the ending was left wide open for an inevitable sequel which I will be more than happy to play and look forward to more defined ""levels"" and maybe the addition of more Bosses. The final battle for me was really satisfying because of it's nastalga boss battle feel and I really wished I had more of that throughout the game. Maybe even a Completion bar would be nice to have to know whether or not it would be worth the time and effort to go out Mining and have the satisfaction of knowing that every nook,cranny and stone has been turned for that 100% completion. solid 3.5/5 for me			"

Grind the mineshafts for cash, or rush the free story progression items, its your choice. Even mining never gets old, being far more a puzzel game than a platformer. Look at the screenshots of the mines, you can see gems in the rock. Now, picture this: you can mine 1 block space either side and above you, but you cant mine while jumping. This makes mining a challeging process, but ultra rewarding.			"

There's a plot thread tieing everything together, but nothing very deep. The upgrading is addicting and the digging is fun. The graphics are nice and animation is sweet. For $10, its not a horrible deal, but I'd wait for a sale honestly.			"

												SteamWorld Dig is an enjoyable exploration game with bright visuals and fun playability. You control Rusty, a little robot that's come to take over his Uncle's Mine. It starts off innocently enough as you mine for gems to make some money, but the deeper you get, weirder things start showing up. The controls are great; I played with an XBox controller so I can't vouch for keyboard. The gameplay ranges from exploration to a bit of action, to a fair amount of platforming. Throughout the game you buy upgrades that allow you to do a lot more, giving the game a Metroid or Castlevania-esque feel at times. SteamWorld Dig isn't the longest game; there's an achievement for beating it in under two hours. (Though I imagine that's a hard cheevo to get.) My playthrough took five, but I was hellbent on digging up as much gold as I could. It's very enjoyable for what it is, and I could see myself returning to it again for another playthrough.			"

												This is one of those rare games where back tracking is as enjoyable as the first journey down.  As you get more materials and orbs to upgrade your parts, heading back to previous areas really shows you how far you've come.  Plus, busting through a 5-strength rock in one swing of a pickaxe is so satisfying.  It may not be incredibly long (3.5 hours for a first time while missing a secret area or two), but it's worth the time for a game with simple controls, wonderful aesthetics, and charm coming out of all directions.

												The notion of ‘digging’ has carved out a niche little sub-genre in recent times. We’ve had the indie juggernaut that is Minecraft, Super tough Spelunky and Terraria to name just a few. SteamWorld Dig  is, as the title suggests, another game that wants you to dig. However, it’s certainly doing it in its own way.Playing as Rusty, a lone steamboat designed for digging, you find yourself exploring a post-apocalyptic world where humans seem to have disappeared. You arrive in the dustbowl town of Tumbleton after receiving the deed to your Uncle Joe’s mine. The town is home to a few remaining robotic inhabitants and it’s up to you to uncover the story of the mine and the towns folk.Your initial forays into the mine will mainly be to find gold and gems which can then be traded and used to upgrade Rusty. All manner of items and upgrades are available and they continually expand as you find more money to spend. Along with this you will gradually uncover more abilities that Rusty can use to help traverse the depths. There’s an element of Metroid to the character advancement but we wouldn’t go as far as to say that this is a Metroidvania.The game world sets itself out into three main sections. You have the town where you can talk and upgrade, the main part of the mine and self-contained rooms within it. For a large amount of the game you’ll be continually digging downward in the main mine area. The goal here is to find cash, avoid critters and find rooms as you uncover the truth of what happened to the humans and the world. The deeper you go, the thicker the rock gets and the tougher the enemies become. Unless you keep upgrading it can be a tiresome task to break through the bedrock so you’ll need to be heading back to the surface to upgrade your pickaxe and other mining gear often.This is perhaps one of the few flaws with the game. While there are a number of short cuts back to the surface, there really aren’t enough of them for it to stop the game from dragging and getting repetitive on occasion. It’s not so bad when going down the mine as you can normally drop down tunnels you’ve dug, but going back up can be tiresome. It’s not enough to take away from the experience in the long term and there are teleporters that can be purchased, but a few more short cuts really wouldn’t have gone a miss.The self-contain rooms within the mine provide a mixture of both platforming and puzzle solving to negotiate. Plot related rooms lead to power ups and boss fights while other hidden areas generally contain precious gems. SteamWorld Dig really is a platformer at heart and these rooms allow for the developers to show off how they have mastered the form. You’ll need quick reflexes and a good understanding of how your powers work to succeed and the difficulty level is pitches just about perfect throughout. Each room and boss is challenging but you’ll always feel you know how you should be beating it - it’s just a case of mustering the skill to do it.There’s something really compelling about the game and as you dig deeper (both literally and into the mystery), you’ll really want to know what’s going on. It’s the sort of game you’ll start playing for a few minutes and end up sticking with for hours. Moving from the 3DS eshop to the PC digital services was always going to be a tough jump but it’s one that SteamWorld Dig has made easily and it shows a skill and understanding by the development team rarely seen elsewhere. SteamWorld Dig may well have gone unnoticed by a lot of you, but we would really recommend checking it out. It’s no longer just one of the best 3DS eshop titles but one of the best digital games available right now and it offers a fun, challenging and fresh experience for gamers to test themselves with no matter the platform.Overall 8/10			"

												This game is surprisingly good, and also a relatively good challenge, which is something rare in the gaming industry now days. When I picked it up I was afraid it will be just another boring title, but so far I'm loving it and I've decided to do a full playthrough of it on my YT channel.Personally I recommend it for anyone that likes this genre, check it out at

												Steamworld Dig is a quirky game. It is remenescent of iDigit on the iPhone but with upgrades and some platformer elements (on the set levels). For most of the game you just dig deeper in your grandfather's mine to collect rescources to sell at the town. In the beggining you have little tools and abilities, but within a few minutes you will unlock abilities like dash and super jump. The graphics are remeniscent of the 16-32 bit era but are rendered in HD. The game is simple with only three stats that you need to keep up with: health, Fire and water (the later two being used up as a varation of a mana bar). The game is slightly humorous and keeps the player entertained while also holding the player's hand.			"

												Everyone who has played Motherload should play this. This game is fun and addictive. You dig (surprise!) your way down the map in search of minerals and caves. You can then sell those minerals to buy better equipment. During your digging you will have to worry about your light supply running out, obstacles and various different enemies.SteamWorld Dig has some minor metroidvania elements. You know the drill (sorry), during the game's progression you get lot's of new equipment and abilities that let you go to different areas, get minerals you previously couldn't or simply make your way down easier.The game has a nice little story behind it, but it's not the focus of it. The graphics and sound are very nice, which adds to the experience.The only thing wrong with this game is it's length. It's too short. The only replay value comes from additional playthroughs to get all the achievements. Or to simply do it again for fun.Despite it's short length, I highly recommend this game. You're gonna dig it.

												Steamworld Dig truly is one of the first games of its kind. A one of a kind gem worth way more than it's extremely reasonable asking price.From the beginning, this game hooked me in with its addictive spelunking gameplay, and further hooked me in with this spiritual ""Super Metroid"" feel. I mostly felt that from the crumbling blocks, character upgrades, and mini map. Top all that off with great loveable characters (regardless of their annoying voices), compelling (and shockingly) post apocalyptic setting, and awesome main character. This is one game that you'll feel sad to complete, because it was so good and endearing that you want more. Luckily, this game has immense replay value, so if you can't get enough give it another go!Highly reccomended for fans of Minecraft, Terraria, and all ""Metroidvania"" style games! Now go mine that ore for yourself, get this game!			"

												I played through SteamWorld Dig on my 3DS first, and after about an hour with the PC version I can safely report that it holds up even on a bigger screen and a more powerful machine.It is an enjoyable Metroidvania style game about exploring randomly generated mines in search of new special powers and some sweet minerals. Because of its portable roots the game encourages (or rather forces you into) short mining sessions by giving you a limited amount of lantern time and a very small inventory space for minerals. After you return to the surface you can sell your minerals for some gold, and then buy consumable items or permanent upgrades for your HP or lantern or for the various special powers you come across while mining.The game is in no ways very deep, but it is very easy to get hooked in the simple but rewarding mining. The mixture of scifi/western on the art also makes the game fun and unique. It can also get quite atmospheric on the dimly lit mines which have great ambient background music and changing art assets when you get deeper. SteamWorld Dig comes highly recommended.			"

												SteamWorld Dig is fantastic dig-sell-upgrade-dig platformer. It is easy to compare it to Terraria because it is 2D and you dig, but there is a lot more to it than that. First, the platforming  feels perfect. Your gem-hungry robot pilots like Super Meat Boy, easily jumping up walls and performing acrobatic maneuvers, making it a blast to navigate the mines. Second, the pacing is superb. You find and purchase fun upgrades constantly from start to finish. Though it is fairly short and may not have the replayability or depth of the Terarria series, I enjoyed every minute and would highly recommend it to anyone.			"

The game has basically everything you could want, except for gametime.  I beat it in a little less than three hours, total.  Now, it does have some random generation to it, and multiple save slots that help with replayability (Not to mention some achievements to go back for) so it's still pretty good for another time around!

Luckily, this game has immense replay value, so if you can't get enough give it another go!Highly reccomended for fans of Minecraft, Terraria, and all ""Metroidvania"" style games! Now go mine that ore for yourself, get this game!			"

												Took my time with the game, since I played the 3DS version for only 10-20 mintues roughly. All honestly I got the game for $7.99, and by god was it worth it. The game is the Dig Dug tribute that we desever all honestly but the one that will be overlooked. And In my own opinon plays better on the PC then the 3DS version but then again I'll have to buy the 3DS version and dissect it on my own time. This Coal mine is a true gem. Just wish there was more bosses and a way to stack more rubbies.			"

												If hardcore metroidvania is not your cup of tea, but you still like general idea behind it, then SteamWorld Dig will work like a charm. It has wonderful 2d visuals, cute ""spelunkyish"" art design and solid casual gameplay, which still delivers some friendly challenge. But do not expect too much - the game is one-timer, with very little replayability. It's not long and the world is rather small.			"

												Have you ever wondered what Samus or a Belmont would be like with a pickaxe? Or how a steampunk-styled metroidvania game would be like? Well enter Image & Forms SteamWorld Dig! This game is a Dig Dug/Spelunky/Metroidvania-fans dream come true.You are Rusty, a steambot who inherited his uncle's mine and has to venture through it to see the mysteries below. On your way coming across, what I have lovingly dubbed ""Chozo Statues!"", to gain more powers. Thus allowing you access to previously inaccessible areas. In true metroidvania fashion...I could speak volumes about this title, but I'd rather just say ""BUY IT!"". Oh, and get the wonderful soundtrack with it.I did a blind Let's Play of the game, which will be up on YouTube shortly.			"

SteamWorld Dig is probably my favorite game of 2013. It's an incredible little side-scrolling platformer title with strong Metroidvanian influences about a robot who digs up valuables in an attempt to reinvigorate a desert town. You take control of Rusty as you mine rare minerals, take on enemies, and uncover ancient treasures deep below the surface.If you can believe it from the screenshots, SteamWorld Dig actually began as a Nintendo 3DS eShop game! They have completely revamped the game for PC by adding HD visuals (including high-resolution textures, animated character portraits, bloom filter, and more!), gamepad support, achievements, trading cards, and some rather tongue-in-cheek jokes exclusively for the PC crowd.The game runs consistently at 60 FPS and just looks beautiful overall. Rusty and his enemies are smoothly animated and the surrounding backgrounds and textures are sharp and lend a great sense of atmosphere to the game. Everything in SteamWorld Dig has a really nice, hand-drawn look that really stands out. This is a game that I highly suggest you enjoy on your television while sitting back on the couch.The gameplay is pretty straight forward, but incredibly fun. When you begin the main story, you're given a pickax, a solid layer or dirt, and a simple objective: DIG. In SteamWorld Dig, you carve your own route through the levels. There are 4 main areas, each of them bigger than the last and sporting unique themes), that are completely destructible.Along the way, you'll discover rare minerals that you can sell topside to the local vendor to upgrade and expand your arsenal of digging utensils. Deep underground, there's also secret areas that have fun puzzles that reward you with more minerals or special upgrades upon completion.I won't sugar coat this last bit: The game is short. It only took me roughly 4 or 5 hours to complete. It's pretty obvious that it was made for fairly brief play sessions on a mobile platform such as the 3DS.HOWEVER, it packs so much content into those 5 hours. You're constantly discovering, puzzling, jumping, dashing, falling, climbing, upgrading, teleporting, and most importantly DIGGING. I can't stress enough how ridiculously charming and fun this game is. In my opinion, it is entirely worth the base price of $9.99.http://forums.fungineers.net/index.php?topic=1408.msg22679#msg22679 "

												When I was browsing through my never-played games, I noticed this one. I have to say, this game is a lot of fun. Actually, it's pretty simple: You mine ores, and sell those for money you can use to upgrade things like your pickaxe or health. Ores will get more value as you get deeper into the ground. The unfortunate thing is that I completed it in 5 hours. I enjoyed it very much, and would love to have more gameplay. Anyways, I absolutely recommend this game, as you can replay the game if you'd like.			"

												I like the fact how simple this game is, you can grasp all the main concepts in a few minutes. Still, even though being that simple, it is very much enjoyable. Especially for us, collectors and perfectionists, it's very charming to be able to dig through the world and try to find every single last precious ore nugget that is out there.The game length is 6 - 10 hours, and that's a benefit for me. The worlds were quite different and they introduced new concepts, which is great, one would never feel bored.The only thing I disliked about this game is the ""light"" game concept. It seems to be that it was introduced in order to make the game less plain, to make the game mechanics more complex. Which I agree with, it would be way too simple otherwise. But it's not designed properly. With current design, you simply have to go above ground every few minutes, even though your bag is almost empty and you have no other reason to return, just to refill the light lamp. That often means spending up to several minutes traversing the mine to the top. That's crazy, and it's annoying as hell. Some possible improvements to this concept include: a) an ability to refill the oil from the (eternal) lamps scattered through the level, maybe at the expense of extinguishing that lamp forever b) an ability to purchase and take with you an extra flask of oil, maybe even at the expense of one of the inventory slots. With this approach, you have immediately made the game less painful and also more interesting, because there is very interesting choice to be had - spend more money and have less inventory space, but have longer and more convenient light? Those are exactly the right tough question every game should offer. Sadly, in this case, it was not though out well.Except for the single issue mentioned above, I very much enjoyed how the game looked and played, and recommend it to everyone enjoying this kind of casual exploring/digging/a bit puzzle and platforming genre.

												SteamWorld Dig has a lot of polish. The controlls are tight and feel good when you are playing. The world is simple and elegent. Graphically it has a great look. I enjoyed my time until about 3/4 of the way through. About half way through something started eating at me. When I was about 75% of the way through it hit me. This game has nothing to it.   You mine for ore, you sell your ore, you buy stuff. You are not hunting down recipes, or farming for specific ingrediants. You are not looking for specific enemy spawns and hoping for the correct loot drop. The secret areas might as well have a glowing neon sign pointing to it. The game is extremely simple and linear.   It feels like a glorified flash game. A well done flash game, but even still. This could have been a really fantastic game. It just needed more depth.			"

												It's a modern graphics version of the old Dig Dug or Motherload games. As usual, dig down, go back up, buy upgrades to dig further down and move around better. The bottom layer is usually a hell layer with the big boss, which is usually your mentor or father or some other kind of person gone bad.It doesn't add anything new other than graphics and a cool soundtrack and a cool western robot setting. If you've seen Futurama, Bender, those types of robots.Remember that it is a mobile game ported to PC so it is very short.My total hours probably say something around 4 hours... that's how long it takes to beat.You don't actually do all that much mining. You just dig down, make sure to get a few ores on the way and that's it. It has a slight puzzle aspect to it because you can't mine diagonally, you can't mine while hanging from a ceiling etc. You can only mine up 1 block, left, right and down. So if you don't play smart, you can get stuck. Upgrades aleviate this but not entirely.I got it in a bundle, so paid maybe 1 buck for it. The graphics and themes and sounds are more polished than other games in its genre so I'd say it's worth a few bucks.There's many flash games out there for free, with the same gameplay.			"

												A delightful little surprise this one.It's a very cool metroidvania-lite blockbased digging platformer. Unlike games like Minecraft or Terraria you can't place new blocks, so you actually have to be careful when digging so you don't get stuck. You also have to be careful not to make it impossible to dig areas above you, because you can't swing during a jump, so you need to stand on the ground to dig, so if you dug too far down to reach something above you, you have to go back up again and dig down on a different place.It's a game where you can't just dig mindlessly, especially not as falling un-diggable blocks begins flooding your mine, if they land on minerals or ore-blocks they might very well crush the ore, losing you money. They can also trap you if you're not careful, and if you're unaware you might even get one falling right down on your head, costing you your life and 50% of the money you have on you.As you dig deeper and deeper you unlock more things that solve frustrating situations you previously couldn't deal with, and allow you to dig more carelessly, but at the same time that carefreeness can easily become your undoing.It's a very fun game that ate up several hours of my time completely unexpectedly. You can beat it in probably 3 1/2 - 4 hours, but if you're like me and try to make all the fallable blocks fall as far as the level allows them, then you will phase into a world of deep concentration in what I would like to call Tetris Hell.Expect to die.

												SteamWorld Dig is quite amazing, really.The game gives you a pickaxe, and you dig. You get cool ores, you sell them, then you get better gear so you can dig more. Then you dig, and there's digging.But there's so much more than that, too. The game has a great learning curve that ramps up difficulty to a challenging, rewarding, and satisfying gameplay experience. I got this in the sale (why not?) and was awed by its intuitive design. Whether you're figuring out how to get that awkwardly-placed mineral or your outburst of mining TNT has led to a chain reaction explosion, the game will find a way to make the simple prospect (excuse the pun) of mining enjoyable in an unexpected way.This isn't Minecraft. It's not Terraria. It's a completely different gaming experience that will turn you from an amateur digger to a platforming pro.Oh, but there is ONE small problem. The controls are awkward (arrow keys to move and wasd to use tools), something cringeworthy for any seasoned PC gamer, but it was designed with a 3DS in mind, so you can't blame the developers...9/10:Worth your money. 100% awesome.

												Steamworld Dig is a fairly predictable and simple action/platformer. Most of your time is spent digging to get ores to sell in order to improve your ability to dig. Or rather, since the ground gets more dense as you dig deeper, to maintain your ability to dig at a given rate. Your tools also double as weapons, though none of the enemies are particularly difficult or interesting. All of the upgrades you can buy are simple stat increases, and the new tech you discover is unoriginal and predictable.But it isn't a bad game. The world is interesting and hints at a backstory that may be more interesting than the game's Mcguffin plot. SD has a sharp aesthetic, good music, smooth animations, and well-executed, if unoriginal gameplay. If Metroid meets Minecraft sounds good to you, you can get an enjoyable 2.5 - 8 hours here, depending on how much you search for ore.			"

												This is a fun little platformer type game. Due to upgrades you get, you could say it is a metroidvania type game.You start out with nothing and are dropped into the underground caves of a town. You a local, and are told about you uncle. Shortly after, you get you first item, a pick axe.The game revolves around using digging devices (throughout the game you find more) to keep mining the gems under the town and fend off enimies. While there are enimies, that isn't the highlight of the game. You keep getting upgrades of your digging devices as well throughout the game.If you die, you drop all the gems you are carring and are returned to town. You loose 50% of your gold as well, so you want to avoid this. The first time through you might find yourself digging down faster than you should. It is wise to plan ahead so you can always get back up to sell those precious gems.While at first there might not be much stratigy, as stated above you do need to be careful just digging down and fast. Plan ahead, so you have tunnels that you can use to your advantage. Thera are consumable's you can use to help out, but I found them not very useful. I found spending my money on upgrades more worth the money.There are 3 diffrent ""types"" of mning areas you go through. They get progresivly harder to mine, but the game overall isn't very challanging.Overall I would recomend the game. I also feel it is sutable for the younger crowd if you are looking for your children. I played the game completly with a wireless xbox 360 controler, and had no issues with it. I do now know how a KBAM would be.			"

												I just started this game but I'm already addicted to it! The graphics are really nice for this kind of game, wish more of them were like this instead of employing those ""retro"" pixellated worlds. Level design is also quite nice. Only downside is that it's short (took me 3.3 hours to complete according to Steam).This game reminds me of Metroid (although it is less hard). Especially, it reminded me of Super Metroid with Terraria (or Junk Jack for iOS) elements. In other words, single player platformer with exploration, rpg and mining elements, but with no building. It's the first game that I find succeeding in doing this mix of genres.			"

												Dig, Collect, Sell, Buy and get the digging again...No it's not just about that, and that yet is very relaxing. This is a game where you will find confort in playing on casual moment, as you will find yourself engaged by it's town folk on the scavenge breaks, maybe even laught with the country's style dialogs.Anyway, it's available to all plataforms, has a music theme you will remember in another moment when not playing (which will cause you to want to). Nice ambient music and sounds, good atmosphere and graphics and a polished plataform action style puzzle (???).That's not a crafting game (if are to expect something like Terraria, and not that big either). It define's itself good as a scavenger plataform.			"

												Steamworld dig is accourding to most people the next ""Must-have"" Game on the 3ds and Steam but is it really true well let's begin with the story of the game.WARNING: Spoiler alert!The story is about a robot named Rusty coming to a town named Tumbleton when he falls into his uncle's mine. When he falls into the mine he runs into dorothy which after a brief conversation he goes to find his father when he finds out that his uncle died in the mine so you ""borrow"" his pickaxe to find out what he was up to. Then after a while he falls into the second section of the mine known as Old world a nuclear plant section. Then later you reach vectron a electronic generator underground where after mining a bit ou reach the final boss of the game known as the Voltbot who plans on taking over the world making voltbots the dominant species on the planet. After destroying the voltbot the mine collapses on you and you end up dying in the mine. Then the townspeople build a statue of Rusty and then the credits roll...ok I know what your thinking why didn't I mention the townspeople well because all they really do in the game is give you upgrades to your tools.The Gameplay:The gameplay is a mix of Metroid and Minecraft. But what do you do in steamworld dig you mine then sell your ore then go back to the mine then sell and so on. It doesn't sound like much but it's a really addicting game. Like Minecraft the main goal is to well Mine. Like Metroid the game is setup like a maze except you make the path But when you leave the cave it doesn't reset so you need to think out a move before you do it. But there is one major flaw it ends too soon just when your used to everything the game ends with the only boss in the game the voltbot also it takes around 5-6 hours to beat give or take. Yet this is also the best thing in the game too because when you beat the game it posts your score so it makes you destined to come back to beat your last score. Also there's another flaw  which are the side characters they just don't do anything but upgrade your tools. The Verdict:Steamworld dig is one of those masterpieces that comes around every once in a while where a game is so good you always remember the experience you had playing the game. This game is a must have game in anyone's steam library. The game is $9.99 and that is a great price so this game gets a 9.5 out of 10.Pros:+ Great story+ Addictive Gameplay+ Amazing replay value+ Great visuals and soundtrackCons:- Side characters- Length 9.5Must-Have			"

												Pretty fun time. Took about 4 hours to beat the game. The game style is nothing you've not seen before, it's dig, grab ores, go topside, sell ores, buy upgrades, dig deeper... rinse and repeat until end boss. That said it has a nice athmosphere. Not sure if I'd recommend it at full price, but if it goes on sale it's a good grab.			"

												A fun little metroidvania action/mining game. However, unlike most mining games the world is finite and not procedurally generated, and the game itself is rather short and can be easily completed in one sitting. That said, the game is a lot of fun to play with the various upgrades and mining mechanics, and is very well done and well polished game. Despite the lack of a procedural world, the game still has a fair bit of replayablity due to the flexibility of the mining system and the ability to buy upgrades in different orders.Definitely a game to consider if you're a fan of metroidvania or mining games (although it tends a bit more on the metroidvania side with the amount of combat). Recommended.			"

												Quite nice. Only thing I liked about Minecraft was digging ridiculously elaborate tunnels. That's pretty much the main hook. Digging, getting treasure to let you dig better. My only regret was its end. I won't spoil it, but I thought the end could be better. Like some sort of Metroid style, climb back through your tunnels before the mine collapses? I don't recall how many hours I played. I'd put on music, grab a controller, and dig. But the fact that I wish there was more, indicates that the game was quite nice.+ Smooth controls+ fun digging tunnels- it eventually ends- ending a bit sudden and subpar.All in all, I'd rate it a diamond pickaxe.

												This is a hard game for me to review. On the surface, I should not like this game. The entire time I played the game, I thought to myself, why do I like this game? But, for whatever reason, I really really enjoyed playing this game. I guess that is all that matters in the end even if I can't quantify why. Something about it just kept pulling me along until I finished it. I don't know if I'll go back to this game for a second play through, but I do know if they release a sequel (which I think they are in an indirect way) I'll probably get it.			"

												StoryDig to find 'Joe'... and everything else the NPCs say is just a runaround way of saying this.Adds some depth to the character and background plot but nothing really changes. I found myself skipping dialogue. Visuals+ Rich colour and vibrant artsyle paired with fluid animation makes each area unique.- Although the lighting is great for 2D sprites, as a mechanic to manage feels a bit annoying.Audio+ Cool Westerny title music, Very effective SFX audio in the character voices and every action.- The rest of the game's music is atmospheric I guess as caves are but is not very memorable.Gameplay+ The movement felt weighty and awkward at first but it just made it feel more like you were a robot.+ Most of the mechanics feel really great but it takes quite a while to obtain them to feel fun.- Although the gameplay prides itself a ""Strong Metroidvanian"" Influence.. it is not. Those games have a sense exploration... this one you just keep heading down.- The game is quite easy and most of the 'challenge' is managing your inventory. Replenishing light, save points, water, and emptying your treasure bag are not fun... it just slows things down and feels more like a chore.- Puzzles are not hard. Enemies types are quite limted. Environmental hazards pose more a threat than enemeies.- There is only one boss.Overall: 5/10 (Meh)The game is quite short and not challenging, however what it does, it does well.As soon as you obtain all the abilities... the game is over. There's no real motivation for replay value except to acquire half of the achievements. The ending was also quite 'dry' and will leave you wanting more.			"

												Another styish indie title I picked up at a bargain price, I hear SteamWorld Dig compared often to Spelunky, though I have not played that title. What I can tell you is that it is a 2D digging game that casts you as rugged frontier steambot Rusty, who travels out to the tiny town of Tumbleton one day to speak with his uncle, who he soon finds has passed on. But Rusty's uncle left behind a series of clues that will lead him to the deepests depths of the world, and to a terrible secret. You begin the game with a simple pickaxe that can only dig horizontally or vertically. Make sure not to dig under any rocks and crush yourself! Along the way the player digs up ore that can be traded for money back in town, and in turn used to buy useful upgrades and items such as ladders and dynamite. Skirting into the realm of Metroidvania, Rusty can come across strange, blue platforms that grant him incredible new abilities, such as double jumping. Though Rusty can dig almost anywhere in the main cavern, there are side caverns where he must follow a set path as if in a dungeon, various enemies and puzzles barring his way. There's decent music too, most notably the main theme, a take on Ennio Morricone's ""The Ecstasy of Gold."" Steamworld Dig will hand you the occasional cheap death, and you may not immediately realize that there is a finite amount of ore in a single playthrough, and therefore limited cash, so spend it wisely and avoid taking any uncesssary risks. Steamworld Dig took me a fair bit of time to get through, though I took the time to dig up every last piece of ore I could find to ensure I'd have the cash I needed. This game will reward the cautious and meticulous player, as it did me. It's a lovely title overall and I would play it again.			"

												Pretty fun time killer. Feels like a much more polished version of Motherlode (a flash game that was on Newgrounds AGES ago... probably still is on the internet somewhere) with tweaked mechanics and better narrative / visuals / audio. it's pretty short so if you're going to give it a once-through than I don't think you should pick it up. If you're a sort who loves the gameplay (think dig dug with a splash of metrovania) and/or will want to finish all of the achievements you'll get more time out of it than... perhaps? I'm still hesitant to recommend it for that price point.Granted, I have had much less fun with more expensive games, so there is always that.			"

												SteamWorld Dig is a similar design to Terraria, however it is has more puzzles and only a single boss battle.  It is an experience that falls in line with a platformer, you don't craft and it is definately a more finite world.  The character power progression feels good, which encourages you to keep going.  I enjoyed my time playing it, but I wouldn't have paid the full price and I don't see myself revisting the game again.  I'd recommend the game if you really enjoy Terraria and traditional platformers.  Fair warning, it is a short experience which will only take 3-4 hours to complete.			"

												PROS:  This game has a good rewards system and sometimes you may feel surprised because of the enemies that come out of the rocks. Also I like the Drill! The drill helps you drill through rock faster and get where you need to go, it's a great power up in the game. Also this game carries alot of upgrades for your Pick Ax, Water Supply and much more. This is a good game for casual and serious gamers. The gameplay looks nice and cartoony. It also has few NPC's which could be a bad thing but it allows them to stand out and become a big part of the game. CONS: This game is short, more content would of been nice. It is also hard to know what to do next if there isn't a big red dot on the map. The upgrades in the game could of gotten more use but was neglected. After you beat the game, it is quite bland and unrewarding. Money is scares and can't be brought back which is intresting but hard when you know you need big upgrades for the Final Boss.INCONCLUSION: This game is nice but very short and would be better with more content. This game is for you if you want a nice story with decent gameplay. This game isn't for you if you want a long story and don't like limited use of upgrades.7.3/10			"

												I'll say that I like robots and that I like the wild west. It has both so I can't complain. Steamworld Dig is a great mining game with several influences such as Terarria, Megaman and Metroid. You play as Rusty who has inherited an old mine from his uncle. The main objective is to mine, collect ores, sell them and reach for the bottem of the mine. It was originally released on 3DS and the game is quite appealing to the eye, they managed to add quite a bit of colour for a mining game which is nice. The music is decent but I wouldn't say catchy. It more melds right into the game which is great as it adds to the game. The mining in the game is all about risk versus reward and it is done quite superbly.Overall I give it 8.5/10 Its fun, looks great and you can play the game in your own pace. If you're not a big fan of games like Minecraft or Terraria, you should at least give this a go because (for people like me) it has a story and an ending plus the game has a bit to offer.			"

												Liked: Great, fun, addicting game. Collecting treasures and constantly buying upgrades feels very rewarding. The game is not difficult to play, but offers just a bit of challenge in the form of ever-present enemies who will make you lose your treasure when you die.Disliked: when it was over. Was short.			"

												It was alright. The gameplay wears a little thin as time goes on, but is fairly fun for a while. The game is very similar to a number of flash games that all pretty much have the same core gameplay as this one.Dig down, grab minerals, avoid hazards, manage energy/fuel, sell stuff for upgrades, wash, rinse, repeat.There's an alright story, the characters are serviceable, but I ended up skipping a fair amount of dialog near the end.Weirdly enough the game reminded me a lot of Full Bore, and given how strong Full Bore is of a title, I'd have to recommend it over Steamworld Dig.But, if you're looking for a metroidvaniaesque title that you'll spend 5 to 10 hours on, you could find less palatable games out there.

												Clearly inspired by Motherload, SteamWorld Dig is a satisfying and addictive ""snack"" game. It's easy to sit down and play for just a few minutes, but much like a bag of chips you can sit down intending to eat just a handful and accidentally eat the whole bag.Though the game mostly consists of mining downwards and gathering ores to sell in order to purchase upgrades, there are puzzle/platforming elements throughout. It helps keep things fresh and interesting.It is worth noting that the story- though quite subtle and not of utmost importance- is actually quite interesting. Image and Form has done an admirable job on building an unusual universe. It's enough to keep me hooked for their next project, SteamWorld Heist.Time to completion will range from 4-6 hours on average mostly depending on how thorough you are in your ore collection. I have now purchased two separate bundles containing this game and gave the second code to a friend of mine. Now he's addicted too. $11 CAD is a reasonable price for this game, but if you don't want to spend that, grab it when it's on sale. You won't regret it.			"

												This is a fun little platformer type game. Due to upgrades you get, you could say it is a metroidvania type game.You start out with nothing and are dropped into the underground caves of a town. You a local, and are told about you uncle. Shortly after, you get you first item, a pick axe.The game revolves around using digging devices (throughout the game you find more) to keep mining the gems under the town and fend off enimies. While there are enimies, that isn't the highlight of the game. You keep getting upgrades of your digging devices as well throughout the game.If you die, you drop all the gems you are carring and are returned to town. You loose 50% of your gold as well, so you want to avoid this. The first time through you might find yourself digging down faster than you should. It is wise to plan ahead so you can always get back up to sell those precious gems.While at first there might not be much stratigy, as stated above you do need to be careful just digging down and fast. Plan ahead, so you have tunnels that you can use to your advantage. Thera are consumable's you can use to help out, but I found them not very useful. I found spending my money on upgrades more worth the money.There are 3 diffrent ""types"" of mning areas you go through. They get progresivly harder to mine, but the game overall isn't very challanging.Overall I would recomend the game. I also feel it is sutable for the younger crowd if you are looking for your children. I played the game completly with a wireless xbox 360 controler, and had no issues with it. I do now know how a KBAM would be.			"

												Beaten the final boss and got heaps of achievements, still need to max out my equipment though. It caught me by surprise, thought it was more similar to Spelunky, turns out it's more puzzle like in its approach and has metroidvania elements for the progression. It's very nice and polished, the graphics are great 2D artwork, everything works and feels awesome and responsive; it feels repetitive after a while, but I'd say that only happens when you are basically at the end of the game (the game's short), so it's not a huge issue. Only real issue is that the developers could have done much more with the world and characters.			"

												Ok so full disclosure I haven't played this game fully on steam but have recently purchased on xbox and racked up about 15 hours on xbox which should go to show you how great this game. Overall your playing as a robot with other robots trying to revive a town and find what your uncle was working on. Overall the story gets lost really. All you need to know is that you dig and along the way you pick up some sci fi powerups your uncle found and try to figure what is buried down there. In reality if you got the mineral radar before hand this game would be signifigantly shorter as there are only 3 worlds and is my one big complaint about this game because it is so fun I wanted to keep on playing but seeing as this developer only has one game I hope the capital they gain from this game will allow them to make longer games in the future. Overall the mining is where it is at as you can dig side to sidse or down but you gotta be careful because you can't dig upwards easily or at all in some places if you screw up and you can't get the exact angle. You carry a latern which goes by 60 second intervals so you gotta refill it by going to the surface and you can only carry so many minerals. Refilling your minerals will give you money to buy upgrades and passing certain thresholds allows more people to come to town and purchase better upgrade.  Again this game would be a lot shorter and I think the developer realized the mineral radar at the very end. You are given a mini map but your not able to view the whole thing only what your currently right by which can be annoying but it does shows you entrances to places. Honestly for a first game this is very good and definitly worth your purchase. What I hope to see the developer do is expand on this for a possible sequel. Its much like the first portal its very short and leaves you wanting more.  My only other word of caution to the developer is that because minerals don't respawn the only way to heal yourself is money or by farming enemies which can be tedious and dying doesn't refill your health fully. Granted they give you a wide burth but still.  I would pick this up on sale its well worth it			"

YouTube™ Video: Review-O-Lution - Episode #1: SteamWorld Dig 

			Views: 17		

			This is the pilot episode to the my new review show, Review-O-Lution (Re-view-O-Lu-Tion). Today we review a game on Steam, called SteamWorld Dig an indie platformer and mining game that I will tell...		

I do recommend first of all to anyone who may play this game, but I do suggest buying this game on a sale day, because one of the few problems I found with the game is that it is short for its pricing. BUT I enjoyed the mechanics of platforming in a 2D enviroment but with the possiblity of destroying the grounds around you. It has some humor that I find quite charming, and some of the jokes are obvious but I smiled when some of them happen. NOW there are some issues I did have such as some characters not being as well... memorable or as lasting to me, so I didn't feel to attached to them. But some were pretty funny and nice to talk to but there weren't that many good moments that allowed me to get to know them better. Maybe if the Saloon in town was a place you could hang out with all of them maybe that could have maybe them more memorable. But overall I do suggest playing this at some point it is very great in my opinion, I just think you should get it cheaper.			"

Its not the most complex game in the world, but it is very fun, and as you dig you are sort of making yourself a giant puzzle, as you need to navigate the tunnels you have made with limited movement. If you can grab it for a few quid, totally worth it. Also, it looks so nice. :)			"

It isn't really hard but doesn't forgive mistakes too. I admit of being so possessed while I was playing this. Graphicaly it looks quite ok, music and sounds are very well done and they match to the entire game. I haven't noticed any bad sides. Everything is nice. Developers have successfully avoided any mistakes. Although there's nothing remarkable so I can't give the highest scores but it deserves to be appreciated and played.8+/10			"

												A good game, with a quite intersting concept but a little bit too small and easy. I believe they should make a sequel, longer and more challenging. Indeed, there is a ""to be continued"" feeling at the end (I'll not spoil it) so we'll probably see more SteamWorld Dig in the future!If you aren't a hardcore platform gamer but like the genre, it's a really good pick. For hardcore platformers it's a relaxing tour in a very well made world and with mechanics with a lot of potential.			"

Puzzles, monsters, big big levels to dig through. Not a difficult game, but it give you a couple of hours of fun. If you want to unlock all stuff in the game, you have to work for it. (I had unlocked roughly half of them at end of game) Characters in game are fun at times, and there is an overall nice design. Play it.			"

It is a pity because the game has really miss a tremendous oportunity of making this into a really nice action/puzzle game. It has the game mechanics at least.Get this within a Humble Bundle deal. Otherwise, not really worth too much money. It will give you around 3 hours of game.			"

												Combine Terraria + Spelunky and strip them of all their fun, and that's the end result.I'm sincerely baffled by all the positive reviews this game has... It almost feels like people didn't even test the game at all.Don't let yourself fooled like I did, it's really not worth your time at all.If you want a fun Metroidvania, just play Unepic.If you want a fun rogue-like, play Spelunky.If you want a fun mining game, play Terraria (or even Minecraft)I gave this game a chance and finished it with (almost) all achievements, but I'm not gonna recommend it to anyone, so many things are just plain bad about the game.It's boring repetitive, and the controls are not even nearly as tight as a Super Meat Boy, especially the wall-jumping, oh God the wall-jumping, did they even finish coding their game?Thumbs up for the graphics though, I gotta admit the 2D steampunk atmosphere is very appealing visually.+ Visuals- Way too short (~4 hours for all upgrades)- Too repetitive, you'll notice that after your first 10 minutes (no joke)- Music is sincerely dull and bland- Controls are approximative at best, but the wall-jumping timing mechanics get the cakeFinal note: 3/10			"

												It was alright. The gameplay wears a little thin as time goes on, but is fairly fun for a while. The game is very similar to a number of flash games that all pretty much have the same core gameplay as this one.Dig down, grab minerals, avoid hazards, manage energy/fuel, sell stuff for upgrades, wash, rinse, repeat.There's an alright story, the characters are serviceable, but I ended up skipping a fair amount of dialog near the end.Weirdly enough the game reminded me a lot of Full Bore, and given how strong Full Bore is of a title, I'd have to recommend it over Steamworld Dig.But, if you're looking for a metroidvaniaesque title that you'll spend 5 to 10 hours on, you could find less palatable games out there.

												I love this game, it seems as though it's just an exploring game like terraria, but the story line is so gripping. Usually I get bored of games after a while and play it after some other games, but after 1 run of FTL, I couldn't think of anything but playing this game there was almost nothing I hated about it... and then...(Disclaimer, this is not a spoiler, although it may seem like it, there is no hinting to what the end IS.) The ending, I love ends of games due to the fact that practically anything can happen. But when I completed it, I knew what the 1 drawback to this game was, once you finished the ending... It started from the last save... THE LAST SAVE! There's no after the ending, you just get to play through the ending over and over again until you make a new save... So overall I'd give this game an 8/10... so I would recommend this game, but it's not my all time favorite...			"

												Disclaimer, I did not actually log 30 hours on this game. I just accidentally left it minimized overnight once. My actual completion time was round 8 hours.It's a very fun little platformer. Think, Metroid-vania sidescrolling, meets Minecraft or Terraria. Has very strong 2D sidescroller dungeone crawling themes. Hidden pathways that lead to secret loot, and upgrades upgrades upgrades! It also has the whole, dig a mineshaft to search for stuff aspect as well.It's short, not really much ""story"" very little actually emotionally motivating you, really I found myself just wanting to move deeper to get more ore, so I could by the next upgrade. Cute little game, worth the time.			"

												Sorta feels like metroid or mega man X with getting the upgrades finding out how to use them best, A lot of times while playing I was reminded of Mr. Driller, although much slower paced. It's a rinse and repeat type game. Getting minerals, selling them and getting upgrades only to do it again and again. For a short game I like how it starts to feel more like a platformer to keep you interested and takes a really great turn near the end. The music is one of my favourite things about this game. If you've watched Joss Wedon's Firefly. you'll dig (ha!) the soundtrack to this game.			"

												Steamworld Dig is a fun and immersive game that follows the story of a lone steambot called Rusty. He came to a town called Tumbleton because his uncle sent him the claim to his mine. After finding out that your uncle has passed away you get thrown right into the game.The core gameplay of Steamworld Dig is to mine valuable ore and bring it back up to the surface for money. With this money you can then buy all sorts of upgrades that will help you explore even deeper into your uncle's mine and find more valuable ore. Even though it may seem that all you do is digging, there is actually a really cool story that unfolds as the game progresses.The game also allows for different styles of gameplay. You can try to go through the game as fast as you can, or you can take your time and try to collect every single piece of loot you can find.While playing the game I have also found a few bugs. However, they are really minor so I'm not going to nitpick about them.All in all, Steamworld Dig is a really fun game and I would recommend it to anyone. So if you're on the fence about this game, definitely pick it up.			"

												A charming platformer/miner with RPG elements. It holds some hints of metroidal levels within its main mining focus. I thoroughly enjoyed it.All that being said, I don't think I found the replayability resident in the game. I took away about six hours of total game time from start to finish.The art is beautiful, the mining and movement systems entertaining, but the length of the game/urge to replay slightly lacking.I recommend it with that one main reservation.

												It may not be the most captivating game on the market, but it has a fun gameplay and design.If you like robots, steampunk, westerns, exploration, and mining this is a game for you. When i first baught it i played for a solid 3 hours just to kick the tires and had a good time, the presentation of the game i think is the best part the art style and gameplay go very well together.Only thing is that it gets repetitive after a while, but that tends to be solved when you find an upgrade while digging that adds another mechanic to the game.7/10			"

												It is apparently a Metroid-influenced game, but I haven't played Metroid. It is also quite like Terraria due to the mining down and collecting precious stones. In SteamWorld Dig there is considerably less emphasis on open-world exploring and extreme numbers of items to collect, and more of an obvious storyline.I found the game good fun. Unlike the beginning of Terraria, it was obvious what to do, and I was clear on my next goal. Roll into town with population 3, talk with the NPCs, then down the mine and start hacking away. The NPCs have exaggerated personalities, which is to be expected I suppose, and are rather obvious and traditional in their roles. It would have been nice to mix things up a bit. As I dig further down, I found quickly that it pays to go horizontally more than vertically, and any vertical movement needs to be carefully planned. Even with the higher jump and other power-ups collected later on, it can still be very difficult to go back up without a little forethought. Rusty can only dig one space up, and cannot dig while jumping.I was pleased that the pause screen displayed the current keys to use - this made it easy to quickly check how to change objects to place, rather than accidentally placing an object. The inventory is straightforward and provides all the information required while playing. It is possible to further inspect the inventory and reject items, but I haven't needed to do that. The movement and hit zones for Rusty are reasonable. I was frustrated occasionally by digging the wrong space, just because I was slightly off centre over the top of rocks. The map is very useful in seeing where I'd been, and what's coming up. Displaying the number of strikes required to mine the default rocks as separate levels was very helpful. I would have liked a way to see the current goal again - new goals pop up in a red banner once the previous goal is achieved, but I haven't found a way to see the goal again.Overall a pleasant game, simpler and more straightforward than Terraria, but with reasonable progression and some small choices to be made between available upgrades. I would recommend this game as a casual game, as a small amount of time invested can give a good return. For more complex or open-ended exploration and building, Terraria is the way to go. SteamWorld Dig is a fun way to pass some time.			"

The mechanics were good, the upgrades were interesting, the story was amusing, the zones and enemies were intriguing, and death was a setback without being a game-ender.The only downside to this game was the length - I finished it in 4 hours, and while I don't have all the achivements (or even all the ones I could have reasonably gotten), I don't feel like there's more to do.  That said, for those four hours, I had a great deal of fun.  "

												A post-apocalyptic tale (with Old West influences) of a robot who goes into a mine to continue the work of his robot uncle. You dig down, look for minerals, and unravel the mystery of how your relative disappeared. This is a simple side-scrolling platformer with some RPG elements, but a worthwhile one. It's paced nicely, the gameplay is good, the art and characters are interesting, etc. To beat the game it requires about 3-9 hours of playtime depending on how much you explore and how many upgrades you want (personally I don't mind grinding but others may disagree). SteamWorld Dig is a bit lighthearted and casual, but it's not a yawnsome breeze to play either. You'll probably encounter a few parts here and there that are semi-challenging. Nothing serious of course, but it was nice to see some level of strategy beyond ""point and click anywhere to win.""I'm not sure if the game is worth $10 - maybe a bit closer to $5 - but it's well done. 8/10, like Metacritic says, seems accurate. Not the best game ever, but it's pretty fun and worth a try. I got this in a Humble Bundle and it's definitely worth more than what I paid.			"

But add just a little extra to the mix via clever platforming and water powered tools and you have something that makes you choose how to tackle the puzzle of getting to the prize.Feeling a lot like a platformer version of the block digging games of recent times, the game immediately grabs you with it's elements as a whole, but right when you are feeling the game take the reins off and allow you to play as you please, the final boss comes. It's over in about five hours, leaving you to wish there were more traps, enemies, tools, abilities, and worlds to explore.Wait for a sale. it will be a fun but depressingly short ride.			"

												SteamWorld Dig is the kind of game that targets a specific gameplay loop with its design, and it reaches it while not really bothering with anything else. It's pure Metroidvania fundamentals, straight out of the book of Metroidvania fundamentals. You will most likely enjoy this game if you liked the Metroids, Castlevanias, Akuji the Demon, Cave Story, Strider (2014) or Dust: An Elysian Tail. It essentially plays the same way, but with a bit of Minecraft mixed in as well. However, the actual end product has a Feel and Mood more reminiscent of a 2D-Platformer-Steampunk-Harvest-Moon. Your Money and your XP are one and the same. You don't downlevel when you spend it, don't worry - so be going for every upgrade. It'll help you a lot too. SteamWorld Dig is a short game, but it has great visuals, great atmosphere and a cozy sense of adventuring underground. If you enjoy this kind of game, with a lot of mining for resources and upgrading, and progressing downwards, you will REALLY enjoy THIS game in particular. The controls and movements feel chunky and satisfying, and returning down into the mine, then going back up to Town with a Portal feels almost like Diablo or FATE. This is not a long game - but it is a good game. I'd rather play a well-designed game that's short, than a poorly designed game that's long, that I'll never beat.The mines themselves (but not the Instanced Dungeons within them) are randomized every playthrough. Enjoy.			"

												Metroid and Dig Dug had a baby!Fun and satisfying.7.5 / 10Cons:- Once you dig fairly deep into one of the mine locations, it becomes a chore to climb back out to save and re-supply.- The game has only one boss at the very end of the 3rd Mine location. It would have been nice to have at least one for each location.Pros:- The game is a platformer and puzzle solver. Just exploring the mines and digging for valuables is a puzzle in technique so that you don't get stuck, miss something, or make it hard to access something later. You have to think each time you swing your pick.- Metroid style upgrades that give your character powerful and fun new abilities keep the game exciting, while upgrades to your new equipment can be purchased by mining for valuables, making it less of a grind.Tips:- Death isn't that bad... Unless you're hording cash. Dying takes away 50% of your cash for repairs! It does NOT take your minerals or orbs (though your minerals will be dropped where you die and you will have to go back to get them). So make sure that when you cash in your ore for money, SPEND AS MUCH OF IT AS POSSIBLE IMMEDIATELY. This way, if you die, you'll lose some pocket change and not a paycheck, and there is only so much money to be gained in the game.- Don't buy teleporters. They cost orbs, which are rare and even more limited than ore. There will be more short-cuts and teleporters to the surface the deeper you go, so be patient and save those orbs for upgrades.			"

												This game was a lot of fun. I got about 8 hours out of it until I beat it and I still want to go back through and try to get the achievements.  I hope they make a part 2!Describing it quickly: a platform game, with digging (discovering), quests, ability to purchase upgrades, and collecting treasures. Discovering areas is really satisfying, and the mystery (what's next?) as you go along is done very well. It has some replayability to it which surprised me. I didn't think I would like this game, it was part of a humble bundle package. I got hooked almost right away. The beginning feels a little tedious as you chip away at some of the blocks - but once you start buying drills (that happens quickly) and higher pick axes, it's a blast!I highly recommend this game!

												This game took me a little less than 5 hours to beat from beginning to end, and I collected A LOT of stuff. If you ever played Super Motherload, it's exactly like that except with an actually engaging story and combat. The combat wasn't that great, but that platforming and collecting was fantastic. I got it as part of the Humble Indie Bundle 12 (still available at the time of this writing), and it was SO worth it. It's tough to just blindly go into a game, but if I knew then what I knew now I'd easily pay $5 for it. The replayability is limited to you wanting to complete a speedrun, but that's just not for me.I HIGHLY suggest you try it.			"

												Mindless fun. Not very challenging, but scratched an itch. In short you go into a mine, dig up gems, avoid or attack monsters, return to the surface, sell gems, buy upgrades, and dig deeper into the mine. Repeat. There are little puzzle sections to progress to the next section of the mine that are probably my favorite part of the game, mainly because it's pretty much the only part of the game you really need to think a little. That said, there are some interesting hazards throughout the different levels of the mines that make you think about where you're digging. You also quickly learn to not just dig willy-nilly so that you don't accidentally make some gems impossible to reach. Art style was cute, story was practically non-existent, and sound design was good. Not an incredible game by any stretch, but well worth it as part of the Humble Bundle.			"

												A really good game. I haven't gotten far into the storyline yet (I just started playing today), but even though there doesn't seem to be a BIG plotline to it, it's very intriguing. It reminds me very much of a mining version of Harvest Moon. Granted, it is not exactly the same, but you ""inherit"" your mine from your deceased uncle who apparently liked to work with a whole bunch of random contraptions that give you boosts and such.			"

												I played through SteamWorld Dig on my 3DS first, and after about an hour with the PC version I can safely report that it holds up even on a bigger screen and a more powerful machine.It is an enjoyable Metroidvania style game about exploring randomly generated mines in search of new special powers and some sweet minerals. Because of its portable roots the game encourages (or rather forces you into) short mining sessions by giving you a limited amount of lantern time and a very small inventory space for minerals. After you return to the surface you can sell your minerals for some gold, and then buy consumable items or permanent upgrades for your HP or lantern or for the various special powers you come across while mining.The game is in no ways very deep, but it is very easy to get hooked in the simple but rewarding mining. The mixture of scifi/western on the art also makes the game fun and unique. It can also get quite atmospheric on the dimly lit mines which have great ambient background music and changing art assets when you get deeper. SteamWorld Dig comes highly recommended.			"

												This game surprised me. I bought a HumbleBundle and SteamWorld Dig was part of it. I don't like the steampunk genre, from the screenshots I didn't like the game color tones like warm/desert stuff and the gameplay seemed, well, like a rehash of other games.I still registered the game to my account even though I was about to gift it. Then I tried it real quick expecting a shït little game.How wrong was I.This game is actually very good. It's very addictive thanks to a progression mechanic: you dig, find ore, sell them, and after a certain amount of ore has been sold, the town's people can create upgrades for you using them. Obviously you will have better pickaxes but not just that. You can buy teleport beacons thingy to go back in the main cave in no time for example.Sometime while digging, you will encounter small caves. Entering them will present you a puzzle like environment where you need to reach a specific area. Some caves are part of the game story, and completing them will grant you new abilities, like double jump or using your fist and stuff.Using those new skills you'll be able to reach ore inaccessible before. You see, our dude can only dig one tile around him. Some ore are sometimes across a pit or something. You'll be like ""damn that's too far."" So you'll keep digging and upgrade more and more. It is very rewarding.The story of the game is... well average. The graphics, the drawings are nice. Animation is good too. Nothing else to report.The difficulty is awesome. It's progressive but never too hard or too easy. Very nice.Finally the game controls are just very good. I played this using a DS4 pad and DS4Windows. All the movements are smooth and I had no trouble moving my dude around. I changed however the dig button to right trigger so I could hold that stuff down for long time.The only 'problem' with the game is its replayability: levels are not randomly generated :/I have seen reviews saying it’s a good thing because the game focuses on speed running, which I hate. But tru dat we have leaderboards and achievements like finish the game in less than two hours and stuff. I guess the whole game becomes a real crazy puzzle if you wanna speed run. Yep I can't even imagine that. BDSM style :DWell I recommend the game, it is well made, has lots of details, never crashed, and is... just good you know. 10 hours of that game were required to finish it, after having explored everything and taking care of looking stuff around. Definitely worth it.			"

The art style is one which I've fallen in love with honestly and I do suggest getting the game.  Especially if you also share the game with a younger sibling or just friends because it's fairly easy to simply pick up and get digging.			"

There are many obstacles and they don't feel too stagnant.  The game changes every so often to keep you entertained.  Nobody actually talks (its dialogue boxes).

Click Here for the Full Review! [monthsbehindreviews.blogspot.com]Synopsis: An interesting blend of DigDug and Metroid, where you drill and pickaxe your way through strata, grabbing ores and gems as you go, making your way from cave to cave in search of upgrades and the reason why your deceased uncle left you a mining claim in a town with a population of 3. Back topside you can sell your goods for cash, which you can use to buy additional incremental upgrades for the major ones you've found in your travels.It's a fun little game, though it does have it's quirks. Some of the navigating can be tricky, such as wall jumping, and you can't dig upwards at a diagonal, so be careful you don't get stuck, because having to self destruct (or any other death) means losing half your cash and dropping all your loot (this last bit can be recovered). Worth your time, which won't be much because the speed achievement requires you to beat it in around 2 hours (it took my 7, but I grabbed all the loot, and died more than a few times from digging under a rock). I'd suggest getting it around $2.50, and enjoying a sadly brief respite from Real Life (c) problems. I give it an 8/10.			"

												Steamworld Dig is a Little piece of Art. As an Indiegame, it is way less known than first and third party titles. When I first bought this in the 3DS E-shop, I didn't know what to expect. But after playing this game for a couple of minutes I already got this feeling of adventure while playing the game.I think mainly the unique artstyle of this games makes the atmosphere of this game so, how do you say it, luminous. |t's not dark. It's not Lighthearted. In fact, when you get deeper and deeper (litteraly) into the game, a sense of eeriness is pretty common. Especcialy in times where your time (in this case light) is running out.Everything, Everytime is random. This makes the game very replayable. It's fun, eery, strategic, in-depth (litteraly), replayable and overall a very good and polished game.Pro's:+ Good Gameplay+ Unique Artstyle+ Smooth (accurate) Controls+ Atmospheric+ Strategic when you want to and not if you don't+ Self-Paced+ Polished+ Relatively Cheap+ ReplayableCon's:- Lack of Story- Always Timed (Light running out)- Little bit too shortIt's not the perfect game but worth the money you spend on it. If it's on Sale -50% or up. There is nothing stopping you enjoying this wonderfull game.Overall Score: 8.5/10			"

												A very fun game, but very short.It took me little over 6 hours to complete the game (and nearly all the achievements).I feel like the game could benefit greatly from more challenges hidden throughout the world, and even New Game+.While it was a very short experience, I enjoyed every second of it.

												FUN.  It's like a mashup of Torchlight style dungeon-crawlers and mining games (Terraria/Starbound) with some platforming thrown in for kicks.  Rather more lightweight than those examples as it wants to be more of a jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none sort of game but totally worth it when it's on sale.  I would be all over a slightly more complex sequel.			"

												SteamWorld Dig is a very fun 8 hours of gameplay.  There was much more story and humor than I expected going in.  I am not exactly a master of platforming (or anything reflex based) but there was something about this one that made me feel like I could wall-jump and dodge hazards all night.  The traps and puzzles were well integrated and interesting without being frustrating.  The resource gathering was engaging enough that I wanted to find all the secret areas in a way I haven't in many years.  The sound was above average and the music added to my enjoyment throughout.  I never once thought they had cut corners on the graphics or failed in achieving their artistic vision.  Even the closing credits held a fun twist.  If you are comfortable with the length, I definitely recommend this one.			"

												This is one of those rare games where back tracking is as enjoyable as the first journey down.  As you get more materials and orbs to upgrade your parts, heading back to previous areas really shows you how far you've come.  Plus, busting through a 5-strength rock in one swing of a pickaxe is so satisfying.  It may not be incredibly long (3.5 hours for a first time while missing a secret area or two), but it's worth the time for a game with simple controls, wonderful aesthetics, and charm coming out of all directions.

												Charming, little game with a lot of heart. It’s not as difficult as Spelunky, nor is it as open as Terreria. What it is is a simple, well crafted and responsive controlled game.  It’s a joy of just digging away trying to find the right route dodging traps and discovering new enemies and items. There are beautifully designed character and just clever takes on a robot western.I do hope there’s a sequel, because the game is short and lacks new game plus or even procedurally generated levels.

												I would just like to start by saying that I absolutely loved this game! It's officially one of my new favorites and I would heartily recommend it to just about anyone.Steamworld Dig is what results in a mashup between something like Terraria, where you're digging a mine through a randomly generated world for resources. And Metroid, where you find upgrades that make your journey easier/more badass. The game's randomly generated ""overworld"" makes up the bulk of the game, where you're digging your way down looking for minerals that will allow you to purchase upgrades back in town, and looking for the predesigned (not RNG) caves that give you new items or just a little challenge with large rewards. The mineshaft that connects these caves is not as dull as a large pile of underground dirt initially could sound though. The random generation in the world is very well done, making the mine fun to explore as you come across larger open areas, mazelike hard stone that you can't initially dig through, and plenty of enemies. The game also does a very good job teaching you its many mechanisms, with a steady drip of mechanics to keep you interested as you mine your way further down. New enemies, objects that both hurt and help you, and a surprisingly large amount of items for your little digbot to accumulate you'll be seeing new things all the way to the very end. The platforming is also surprisingly well executed, with high flying antics near the end of the game consisting of a super and double jump, dodging a multitude of lasers.Now that I've extolled its virtues, there are a couple of flaws. Nothing major mind, more like missed opportunities that very easily could've come from it being made by a smallish indie developer. First, I feel like the game could've used more of the pre-designed challenges. The challenge caves you find never take very long, and I feel like the game would've been exponentially better if they had gone whole hog on full zeldaesque dungeon design rather than single-multi room platforming challenges. Similarly, I think that having more than a single boss would've helped the difficulty of the game, which, while never easy, isn't one of the hardest I've ever played. It's also a tad shorter than I would've liked, though that's more a personal thing related to wanting to keep playing.Overall, a highly enjoyable game that is most definately worth the very low price of $10.

I took away about six hours of total game time from start to finish.The art is beautiful, the mining and movement systems entertaining, but the length of the game/urge to replay slightly lacking.I recommend it with that one main reservation.

												SteamWorld Dig is the kind of game that targets a specific gameplay loop with its design, and it reaches it while not really bothering with anything else. It's pure Metroidvania fundamentals, straight out of the book of Metroidvania fundamentals. You will most likely enjoy this game if you liked the Metroids, Castlevanias, Akuji the Demon, Cave Story, Strider (2014) or Dust: An Elysian Tail. It essentially plays the same way, but with a bit of Minecraft mixed in as well. However, the actual end product has a Feel and Mood more reminiscent of a 2D-Platformer-Steampunk-Harvest-Moon. Your Money and your XP are one and the same. You don't downlevel when you spend it, don't worry - so be going for every upgrade. It'll help you a lot too. SteamWorld Dig is a short game, but it has great visuals, great atmosphere and a cozy sense of adventuring underground. If you enjoy this kind of game, with a lot of mining for resources and upgrading, and progressing downwards, you will REALLY enjoy THIS game in particular. The controls and movements feel chunky and satisfying, and returning down into the mine, then going back up to Town with a Portal feels almost like Diablo or FATE. This is not a long game - but it is a good game. I'd rather play a well-designed game that's short, than a poorly designed game that's long, that I'll never beat.The mines themselves (but not the Instanced Dungeons within them) are randomized every playthrough. Enjoy.			"

												Just finished this one up and really had a lot of fun. But then again I am very patient. For a good portion of this game after a few accomplishments earlier in game play you'll find yourself a little confused. After digging and digging and more digging I started wondering if I was missing something or even going in the right direction. There isn't much indication of where you are in your game play which is fine but you don't find yourself finding an exact direction(besides down) to follow. Not to spoil but I believe the ending was left wide open for an inevitable sequel which I will be more than happy to play and look forward to more defined ""levels"" and maybe the addition of more Bosses. The final battle for me was really satisfying because of it's nastalga boss battle feel and I really wished I had more of that throughout the game. Maybe even a Completion bar would be nice to have to know whether or not it would be worth the time and effort to go out Mining and have the satisfaction of knowing that every nook,cranny and stone has been turned for that 100% completion. solid 3.5/5 for me			"

After inheriting a mine from his uncle he has to dig through the earth, gather minerals and use the minerals to buy upgrades as he digs ever deeper towards the secrets of the depths.The game will deliver about 3-4 hours of gameplay which is ok given the price and it makes sure that you don't get tired of the game or its mechanics which are quite simple and easy to master.This game isn't perfect and could have been expanded greatly with more upgrades, enemies and so on and so forth, but I'm very pleased with this purchace.

That is not to say that steam world dig is too short or bad, but it could be better.			"

												- Was lookin at this one for a bit, and I'm thoroughly satisfied. Well worth the price in my opinion.- It Runs / Plays / Looks / Feels / Sounds very good in my opinion.- Some replay value since the main levels are procedurally generated.- Unfortunately, I've heard it's short, and I don't want this one to end...- It would be really nice to see some DLC add-on content, and I hope there's a sequel...  Maybe extra mines that are randomly generated and more baddies or something.- Overall it's a lot of fun and a good experience, happy mining. :)			"

												SteamWorld Dig is very charming and a lot of fun. Many people as whether or not the game is similar to 'Terraria', and the answer is no. If you were to compare SteamWorld Dig to any other game I think the closest would be Motherlode - the old(ish) Flash title that was popular on Miniclip. You go underground, you dig for minerals, you return to the surface to drop them off and make money to purchase new upgrades in order to dig for more minerals, more effectively. It's simple, but the game's constant introduction of new mechanics keep it challenging and interesting. In 2013, where there are so many games out there that focus on exploration that give the player a degree of sandbox freedom, it is fair to wonder whether or not a game like this will gather a large fanbase. In a sandbox game, the exploration and gathering of materials feels a little bit more organic than in Steamworld Dig, where you really only have a few options for upgrades and the resources are essentially melted down into the same currency. SteamWorld has no intention of being that kind of organic exploration/survival title though, but people will still draw that comparison and I am sure that there are people that will find fault with that. If you're looking for a game that fits that description, SteamWorld is not for you.I have two main faults with the game. First, the PC port does not allow for the rebinding of keys. I am usually pretty lax when it comes to crucifying a game for being a lackluster port but not giving me the ability to re-bind keys is a pretty big issue - especially when the game uses up, down, left, right as the movement controls and not WASD, meaning some gamers with 'gaming' keyboards (such as the Logitech G510) will run into input conflicts. I found myself using an Xbox 360 controller and a third party program, which I think benefited the game, but is still inexcusable. Second, the length. I beat Steamworld in 3.5 hours according to my save file, and I am by no means a good gamer. For $9.99, that isn't entirely damning of the game, but it does leave you wanting more. There are plenty of achievements that encourage replay, though.			"

												This game comes across as Spelunkys more forgiving cousin. You go and dig around and find some precious minerals and gems then hawk them for some cash to buy upgrades for your little robot character.  The art style has steampunk and wild western influence in visual direction and executes it rather well without being too bulk with it. The Music is typical western movie with slight electronic highlights and is quite enjoyable. The game controls quite well with a controller and doesnt feel it'd be unfriendly to a keyboard its easy to pick up and get right into with the layout and movement. When it comes down to it its a fun, simple and short little game worth picking up on sale but dont expect anything particularly groundbreaking despite the interesting turns the adventure takes.			"

												I think IGN pretty much nailed it when they likened this game to a cross between the arcade classic DigDug and old-school console platformer/adventure favorites like Metroid.  The game is a fun, cartoony mix of a ""mining""/gathering platformer where you gather resources to level up your skills, and a basic adventure game where you quest about, defeating baddies and finding new weapons/power-ups as you move through the light story mode as the game unfolds.  Overall, it's a nice, breezy title...but it SCREAMS for why Steam so desperately needs a SteamBox Console/Big-Screen version with decent controller support, as it's a crime to try and play this game with a keyboard and mouse and even using and Xbox console controller on a PC screen just feels like it's not doing the game justice.  I feel like I should be jamming a cartridge into a gray plastic machine, untangling controller wires, and waiting for my CRT to warm up before playing this title...cursing when the game won't boot a few times, blowing dust off the contacts of the cartridge and re-trying again and again (even though I know that won't help)...and playing this the ""right"" way.  ...and that's not a bad thing at all.  Kudos to the devs on a fun title.  Too bad I just wasn't one of the lucky 0.075% of applicants who actually got to beta the SteamBox hardware.  I mean...what's a guy gotta do?			"

												The game is solid mining for upgrade games with only a few flaws to the gameplay that can quickly make it frustrating at the start of the game when you do not know how it works.-First problem is the customization of controls needs improvement. Not setting the controls to a way that feels comfortable just makes me die not having a setup i like.-Need a better way to go up tunnels you have dug down instead of constantly buying ladders. Maybe just add the function to make your own ladders at no cost...-The wall jump is great maybe a little better wall colission to bounce between 2 walls in a narrow tunnel.With some adjustments to those little things i think the game would be a lot more fun.  As is i just cant spend a heavy amount of time into it without a couple minor changes. "

												I just started this game but I'm already addicted to it! The graphics are really nice for this kind of game, wish more of them were like this instead of employing those ""retro"" pixellated worlds. Level design is also quite nice. Only downside is that it's short (took me 3.3 hours to complete according to Steam).This game reminds me of Metroid (although it is less hard). Especially, it reminded me of Super Metroid with Terraria (or Junk Jack for iOS) elements. In other words, single player platformer with exploration, rpg and mining elements, but with no building. It's the first game that I find succeeding in doing this mix of genres.			"

												Steamworld dig is accourding to most people the next ""Must-have"" Game on the 3ds and Steam but is it really true well let's begin with the story of the game.WARNING: Spoiler alert!The story is about a robot named Rusty coming to a town named Tumbleton when he falls into his uncle's mine. When he falls into the mine he runs into dorothy which after a brief conversation he goes to find his father when he finds out that his uncle died in the mine so you ""borrow"" his pickaxe to find out what he was up to. Then after a while he falls into the second section of the mine known as Old world a nuclear plant section. Then later you reach vectron a electronic generator underground where after mining a bit ou reach the final boss of the game known as the Voltbot who plans on taking over the world making voltbots the dominant species on the planet. After destroying the voltbot the mine collapses on you and you end up dying in the mine. Then the townspeople build a statue of Rusty and then the credits roll...ok I know what your thinking why didn't I mention the townspeople well because all they really do in the game is give you upgrades to your tools.The Gameplay:The gameplay is a mix of Metroid and Minecraft. But what do you do in steamworld dig you mine then sell your ore then go back to the mine then sell and so on. It doesn't sound like much but it's a really addicting game. Like Minecraft the main goal is to well Mine. Like Metroid the game is setup like a maze except you make the path But when you leave the cave it doesn't reset so you need to think out a move before you do it. But there is one major flaw it ends too soon just when your used to everything the game ends with the only boss in the game the voltbot also it takes around 5-6 hours to beat give or take. Yet this is also the best thing in the game too because when you beat the game it posts your score so it makes you destined to come back to beat your last score. Also there's another flaw  which are the side characters they just don't do anything but upgrade your tools. The Verdict:Steamworld dig is one of those masterpieces that comes around every once in a while where a game is so good you always remember the experience you had playing the game. This game is a must have game in anyone's steam library. The game is $9.99 and that is a great price so this game gets a 9.5 out of 10.Pros:+ Great story+ Addictive Gameplay+ Amazing replay value+ Great visuals and soundtrackCons:- Side characters- Length 9.5Must-Have			"

												It's pretty much Terraria-lite with platforming elements and clearly defined goals. Also without any real combat system. I mean, there's kind of combat, but it's still really hard to defend yourself save for using dynamite. The upgrades you get are generally all good and I was quite happy with how mobile your main character gets by the end of the game; it plays really smoothly, definitely. No control issues at all. My one gripe is that it's really easy to get stuck to a point where you either have to die or keep digging deeper in hopes of finding the one or two teleporters in each area; true, you can bring a teleporter along yourself, but those cost orbs, which are rare and valuable and better used on other upgrades. That aside, it's a fun little exploration platformer, with some decent puzzles to boot. The story's nothing special and almost non-existent, which is really how I like it in a 2D game like this. The final boss is also pretty clever for the type of game this is and makes good use of the mechanics. All in all a delightful but short game that I'd say is probably worth full price, but wait for a sale if you're really tight on money.			"

												A bit similar to Spelunky, just way more forgiving! But not in a bad way. It's simply more relaxing and I like this game a lot. Very slick controls! Next to perfection. The default configuration made no sense to me though, thankfully you can configure all of it to your liking even with a 360 controller.I do however feel it was a bit too short. Could really use some ""random dungeons"" or something like that. Would be fun to play around a bit with the character all maxed out, not just have the game end at about the same time. That however might be a sign of very good balancing.			"

												A really addictive cross between Terraria, Spelunky, and the Metroidvania genre. SteamWorld Dig starts a little slow, but as you descend and gain new abilities, it just gets more and more fun. I'm a big fan of the Dark Souls style death mechanic where you drop your possessions (and lose half your gold) when you die, but can retrieve them if you can make it back to the same spot.If I have any complaints, it's that the game is a little on the easy side; I only died 9 times over the course of the entire game, and most if not all of those deaths could have easily been avoided if I'd been more careful.

												SteamWorld Dig has been good fun to play, the mechanics are simple to pick up and the gameplay is enjoyable.Played through the story in two sittings so kept my attention for a couple of hours at a time and realistically you're looking at between 3-5 hours on story depending on how quick you want to run and how thorough. Quite a short game if you're more prone to running through games for story but if you're an acheivement hunter there's a batch there that will extend the gameplay time. One of the downsides I found is that acheivements were bugged and quite a lot of mine didn't register whether that's the game or a steam server issue is debatable but not a big deal for me.I would suggest picking it up when it's on sale rather than the full price as I feel it doesn't have the replayability that some other games have. But overall had fun for the £5 I paid.			"

												Read the full review: http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/steamworld-dig-game-review/SteamWorld Dig immediately reminded me of Gem Miner, a game for Android-based devices, that I used to play. I had fun with Gem Miner, but SteamWorld Dig vastly improves on the faults of that game, providing me a completely fresh, unique experience. Upon playing through the game, I realized that SteamWorld Dig certainly does justify its standing as a Super Metroid x Terraria hybrid.The main concept in SteamWorld Dig is to, well, dig. You dig/mine through various different types of dirt and rock searching for ore and other treasures. These ores can then be sold at the surface, providing the money needed to purchase upgrades and new equipment at the town’s shop (I should also mention that this town only has three residents, which I found quite amusing). The main character, Rusty, ends up at this town due to the death of his uncle, who owned a mine in the town. Rusty then takes over this mine and has to uncover the secrets of what’s below.Not only are you digging and mining your way through the various objectives in the game, but you also have to watch out for the multitude of enemies hidden below the dirt. A few of them are actually fairly difficult to just ignore, like the guys that throw bottles at you, which damage blocks, although I did use this to my advantage in some scenarios where I was unable to destroy a certain block. I would continuously wall-jump off of the block I wanted destroyed while the bottle-throwing badguy destroyed it for me, missing me every throw.The visuals in the game are far superior to the 3DS version and are a treat to look at. The characters and backgrounds were great and really added to the immersion. The ore textures seemed a bit off to me, however. You cannot tell what material is contained within the ore until you mine it, which I found a bit annoying. All of the ore textures were the same, but there were a variety of minerals and gems dropped from them. The variety of drops was awesome, some of which I’ve never heard of (as they’re probably made-up). The game’s audio was also excellent, no complaints there.The game has a story to it, and although it may be minute, it still exists. The story does progress at a very rapid pace, as the game is quite short, only taking me about three hours to finish. It was an enjoyable experience nonetheless, and I highly recommend it.SteamWorld Dig had a few annoying mechanics that I should mention. There was one instance in the game where it was impossible to progress without getting hit, from my observations. I was stuck in this situation with a sliver of health left and I couldn’t progress. I had to go back and get some health before I could pass. There was another instance where I kept getting myself trapped under boulders, but that’s probably due to my own stupidity!Overall, SteamWorld Dig is a short, enjoyable experience, combining factors from Gem Miner, Terraria, and Super Metroid. It executes this well, combining the gameplay aspects of the three with great graphics and sound. It may lack in replayability, but it still is a worthwhile experience.

												Steamworld Dig is one of those games that you enjoy for a couple days, and then move onto something else without much of a thought. It's a western, steampunk dig-em-up. Meaning you are part cowboy and part robot and you're going to dig. Dig dig dig. So you can get ore to get money to get upgrades that make it easier to, you guessed it, DIG. Luckily, it's not too tedious as you have to manage your resources, fight enemies, and watch your tunnels to make sure you've got a way out. That third aspect is diminished somewhat by the end of the game when you unlock powerups that make it unnecessary to plan things out, but it does give a sense of progression.It's also broken up with platforming challenges... well platforming exercises. Nothing in this game is terribly challenging. Even death just means a loss of money and going back down to your death bed to pick up your items. However, it's fun enough to be worth playing and short enough not to drag on. I'd reccomend.			"

												A solid game about digging, jumping, and selling gems with charming robotic shanty town people. Took me a touch over 6hrs to beat the game, with a bit of rushing at the end. Make sure you have a controller! Worth picking up (especially at $5) but would not spend more than $1/hr on this, as there is little to no reason to play it more than once, unless you <3 achievements.			"

												The game was clearly inspired by the great old flash game Motherload (which is still available to play for free if you want an idea of what to expect).  The genre goes back even further to the 80s arcade classic Dig Dug.  The general idea is to dig deep into the earth and uncover treasures so you can return to the surface and buy fancy upgrades so you can dig even further.A few of the mechanics are different (in Motherload you used up ""fuel"" to fly which let you return to the surface, here the fuel provides lighting and you wall jump to go back up; Motherload's currency was just cash, here there's also special orbs needed for some upgrades).  The characters and art style are great.  My only frustration was some difficulty in landing jumps without slipping off things.  I wish you could stick the landing a bit more.  If you liked Motherload you'll like this.			"

												7.5/10It is very fun... but very short.Also, fairly easy.The biggest drawback to this game: No controller support.... this is a game that would just be really fun with a controller... and they didnt do that.There really is not much of a story to this game... it plays really well though and reminds me of Metroid 2 for original gameboy.. you just keep going down and down and down.I got this game on sale... I do not recommend paying $9.99 for this title... due to the shortness this feels more like its retail price should be $4.99... because of that I will drop the score from 8.5/10 to 7.5/10			"

It is a pity because the game has really miss a tremendous oportunity of making this into a really nice action/puzzle game. It has the game mechanics at least.Get this within a Humble Bundle deal.

												SteamWorld Dig is fantastic dig-sell-upgrade-dig platformer. It is easy to compare it to Terraria because it is 2D and you dig, but there is a lot more to it than that. First, the platforming  feels perfect. Your gem-hungry robot pilots like Super Meat Boy, easily jumping up walls and performing acrobatic maneuvers, making it a blast to navigate the mines. Second, the pacing is superb. You find and purchase fun upgrades constantly from start to finish. Though it is fairly short and may not have the replayability or depth of the Terarria series, I enjoyed every minute and would highly recommend it to anyone.			"

The game has basically everything you could want, except for gametime.  I beat it in a little less than three hours, total.  Now, it does have some random generation to it, and multiple save slots that help with replayability (Not to mention some achievements to go back for) so it's still pretty good for another time around!

												SteamWorld Dig is an enjoyable exploration game with bright visuals and fun playability. You control Rusty, a little robot that's come to take over his Uncle's Mine. It starts off innocently enough as you mine for gems to make some money, but the deeper you get, weirder things start showing up. The controls are great; I played with an XBox controller so I can't vouch for keyboard. The gameplay ranges from exploration to a bit of action, to a fair amount of platforming. Throughout the game you buy upgrades that allow you to do a lot more, giving the game a Metroid or Castlevania-esque feel at times. SteamWorld Dig isn't the longest game; there's an achievement for beating it in under two hours. (Though I imagine that's a hard cheevo to get.) My playthrough took five, but I was hellbent on digging up as much gold as I could. It's very enjoyable for what it is, and I could see myself returning to it again for another playthrough.			"

												The phenomenal art style and fun rate of progression makes this game you feel like you're in a rapid-fire upgrade paradise full of darkness and shiny objects. Awesome fun to be had here, reminds me of some retro flash drilling games of the mid-2,000's only with much more content.			"

												I was overall displeased with the amount of content in this game, I imagined a far more advanced ""terraria/starbound"" steampunk robot metroidvania feel, but I was disappointed in that realm, although, I will say that for $1, I got 6 hours out of it in casual gameplay, that kind of gameplay you are fine with like you would a tablet game, in fact, if this game isn't a tablet game, it should probably be, maybe even Zynga-ish Newground-ish game, meh for 6 hours I had an okay time, everything was simple, there's only one boss, maybe 8 different creatures to fight, maybe 20 different types of ore, maybe 5 sublayers of soil to dig through, and roughly 6 hours of game to be played. As, I said before...ya, it's worth a dollar...so, I can't really complain. Saying ""Don't pay full price"", might not be the classiest thing to do, because maybe my son/daughter might like playing it for longer, but not me, good sirs/sissies.			"

												I beat this game in 5-6 hours (until credit scroll.. is that over?). my first impression was this game is similar to terraria, but later after 30 minutes of playing I realized this is totally different thing. There is no ""crafting"" in this game and it has linear story line. I like the puzzle and short story. The art style, music, animation and sound effects are great too.I like the concept of when you die your belonging will stay at that point and you can grab it later.  But because there are limited materials(ore) in this game you should manage your resources. I think the playtime is a bit shorter than I expected, I was expecting it to be at least 9 hours playing, but overall I enjoyed my time playing this game and I hope this game has a sequel!so final word: RECOMMENDED :D			"

												I'll begrudgingly recommend it. Pros:-It's a good way to pass the time and hard to stop playing.-There's a feel of development as Rusty gets new skills and upgrades.-It's a cute new idea that combines elements of spelunky and some other games.-Art style.-A disturbing undercurrent of menace as you realize that humanity has been reduced to radioactive lunatics and alcoholics. Gives it a little bit of the steampunk feel.Cons:-Very short (finished it in 7.1 hours with all upgrades maxed out)-Very little replay value. I think the mines will be randomly organized in new games, but the order of new skills etc are always the same.-Lackluster music and sfx.-disappointing ending. Overall:I almost wanted to say no to recommending it, but it was still a fun little game. If you like Rogue Legacy but always thought replay value was for losers, you'll probably really like this game.			"

I do not recommend paying $9.99 for this title... due to the shortness this feels more like its retail price should be $4.99... because of that I will drop the score from 8.5/10 to 7.5/10			"

												A reasonably fun digging game, although a game where you spend 97% of you time digging with no real purpose can feel kind of dull. The actual digging part resembles Terraria, although instead of the different varieties of ore found in Terraria, Steamworld Dig just has gem nodes that give you junk to exchange for gold. Unlike Terraria, the stuff you gather while digging doesn't have any real use. You just trade it for gold and use that gold to upgrade your digging capabilities. So that you can dig faster, get more gold, and use it to buy more upgrades. Perhaps this is a deep meditation on the pointlessness of consumerism. Or maybe its just kinda dull gameplay.Towards the end of the game, there are caves that feature something resembling puzzles, although none of those puzzles are particularly puzzling. They still make for a nice break from the previous ~4 hours of largely uninterrupted digging. Aside the from the general tedium of the gameplay, my major complaint is the death penalty. You lose half the gold you're carrying every time you die. And because there are only a limited number of gem nodes, you can only get so much gold during the game. If you die more than a few times, you will not be able to afford all the upgrades. This ultimately doesn't really matter, since the upgrades just make you dig faster or die less. But not being able to get everything is frustrating. The story is mostly non-existent, with a random conclusion thrown in at the very end. The narrative certainly won't keep you going if you find the gameplay dull.Overall, I mostly enjoyed Steamworld Dig even with all my complaints. This is probably just because I tend to enjoy tedium in games if it comes along with a sense of progress. If you enjoyed the mining aspects of Terreria, you may like this game. If you like grinding in JRPGs just to make your characters' numbers bigger, you may like this game. However, if you want exciting action or a compelling story, Steamworld Dig is not for you. I would give Steamworld Dig a 6.5/10 and recommend it only if you like digging.			"

Its not nice to listen to, like a screech :/  also when it kills you it takes like 10 seconds to get back there and you need to listen to him speak again although you can kinda skip it but idk why if makes you run pass some useless stuff that is going to hit you unless you stop before (It becomes frustrating)  "

												I love this game, it seems as though it's just an exploring game like terraria, but the story line is so gripping. Usually I get bored of games after a while and play it after some other games, but after 1 run of FTL, I couldn't think of anything but playing this game there was almost nothing I hated about it... and then...(Disclaimer, this is not a spoiler, although it may seem like it, there is no hinting to what the end IS.) The ending, I love ends of games due to the fact that practically anything can happen. But when I completed it, I knew what the 1 drawback to this game was, once you finished the ending... It started from the last save... THE LAST SAVE! There's no after the ending, you just get to play through the ending over and over again until you make a new save... So overall I'd give this game an 8/10... so I would recommend this game, but it's not my all time favorite...			"

												Sorta feels like metroid or mega man X with getting the upgrades finding out how to use them best, A lot of times while playing I was reminded of Mr. Driller, although much slower paced. It's a rinse and repeat type game. Getting minerals, selling them and getting upgrades only to do it again and again. For a short game I like how it starts to feel more like a platformer to keep you interested and takes a really great turn near the end. The music is one of my favourite things about this game. If you've watched Joss Wedon's Firefly. you'll dig (ha!) the soundtrack to this game.			"

												SteamWorld Dig reminded me a lot of Mario Brothers or Megaman. The ability to dig through most of the map is really satisfying, especially late in the game when you have the digging tool upgrades. The comments of the NPC vendors actually hint at the ending of the story so that when it happens there is a forehead slapping moment of revelation, which I enjoyed.The game is open sandbox. You can go back to any previous area and play more. So if you miss anything you can always backtrack and get it. As you progress, you will find the previous areas are much easier to play, which can help if you got stuck anywhere.The Vendor narrations get annoying. As you scroll through each item, they start narrating immediately. And it's just gibberish and starts sounding like a Skyllex concert if you scroll quickly. It's just a minor thing.The resource management in this game is tremendously fun. You have a lot of limited tools and end up searching for water because you need it to power some of the things you can do. It really makes the game feel steampunk.Naturally I want more. The game started to feel a little repetitious near the end. But for the 4$ Black Friday sale, I can't complain! What I'm saying is that I'm REALLY looking forward to a sequel with more features and I would certainly be willing to pay more for it. This was a really good game. It just felt like Megaman 1. I know there is a lot more that could be done with it.The game is relatively short, moreso because I couldn't put it down. I beleive I beat the game in 6 hours over 3 sittings. I am sure I missed a few things and it's a game that later I will go back and play again. Unfortunately because of the repetitive nature of things near the end, I'll want a little break before I do that.The ending felt a little short. Maybe it's all my time struggling with games like Megaman, but I figured out how to defeat the end boss immediaely and made short work of him. I haven't even checked to see if there are different difficulty modes. If not, that would be a good upgrade.I would have like just a little more at the end of the game. Many games do this. You defeat the boss and the screen fades to black and the game is over. I would like to need to leave the room, with the option of wandering around the dungoen a bit more before having to enter a portal, gate, push a button or do some other activity that would end the game and start the end game sequence.A lot of work was put into this game. I didn't notice any bugs or problems. The music was good. The game play was really good. The teleport system for getting into and out of the dungeon wasn't too easy or too hard. It was a good balance. The game had a built in solution for getting stuck, which was probably possible but never happened to me, in the way of a self destruct in the menu options. That's just smart programing.If you like side scrollers, give this one a try. It's unique, western steampunk fun. "

												Another game that shows me the joy digging. This game take me back to the joys of Dig Dug. You play as a robot digging in a mine you inherited from a family member. From there you dig deeper in the mine finding hidden power-ups, ore/gems to sell to buy more power-ups, and enemies to hinder your progress. It's  a fun game, and if you enjoyed games like Dig Dug then you'll enjoy this game.			"

Also not too difficult and not too simple, this is certainly important for games like this.  The price is low and very manageble especially when on sale. So take some time and enjoy.			"

												This game is a Metroidvania type. It's a mix of Motherload, Terraria and a little megaman games. Though it is NOT as hard as megaman games, it is as fun!  You play a long lost nephew coming to your uncle's town to make his old mine prosper. As you dig and collect ores, you get new abilities, gadgets and powers. You can upgrade your gadget with the gold you made exchanging ores.The plusses : - You dig for ores- Controls are great (I played with a controller)- Power-ups, gadgets and upgrades- Cool old console gaming feelingThe Minuses- You can't dig up and you can't dig while jumping- voices of one character was REALLY annoying (you can skip the conversations but MEH!)- Somme people will find that the game is really short. I thought it was all right.9/10! Very recommended!			"

												SteamWorld Dig is a fun little game that blends Metroidvania-esque ability progression with the platforming and money management of a mining game. You play a robot drawn to a dusty Western mining town, who discovers his miner uncle has died and left him a hole in the ground. Your goal: get to the bottom of it.The game has a great visual style and I found the core mechanics engaging, if more than a little repetitive. It was fun for a playthrough. However, I don't think it's a home run game.My first complaint is the story. The world of SteamWorld Dig is a neat one--a world where steam-powered robots are the dominant civilization, and some untold catastrophe has left humans trapped under the earth. But the driving plot of the game is thin to the point of being unsubstantial. Supposedly, you dig deeper in order to figure out just what your uncle was up to, but as a player, I didn't care a lick about that. I was digging just to dig.A more compelling plot would have provided me with reason to care about my uncle and what he found. Since the mechanics of the game encourage an obsession with digging deeper, tying an insatiable urge to dig into the character of the uncle would have made him more sympathetic, and caused the story to resonate better with the gameplay. As it stands, I entirely ignored the ""plot"" of the game, and I feel the lack of a story detracted from the experience.Secondly, SteamWorld Dig seems to me to have very little replay value. Your mileage may vary if you're inspired by achievements and the idea of speedrunning, but for me, once I reached the bottom, attained all the various skills, and maxed out most of my stats, I had no reason to play the game again. That's because the game's progression is almost entirely linear, with very few challenges requiring backtracking or use of your new abilities (as one might expect from a Metroidvania game). What's more, unless you are very bad at money management, there are next to no branching options for character development in the game; you can upgrade your pickaxe and your other tools and other attributes, without ever having to choose a trade-off. And given the finite amount of resources in the game, there's very little point to returning to a finished game for more mining--eventually, you will have mined all there is to mine.This could have been solved in a number of ways. Inserting more optional high-level challenges at the beginning of the game would reward backtracking and would make the acquisition of new skills feel like more of an accomplishment. Offering more upgrade options, or otherwise making stat boosting feel like more of a meaningful choice, would reward playing through multiple times to experience different ""builds"". And a New Game+ mode that added new or more difficult enemies and additional challenges would have brought a welcome amount of replay value.This isn't to say SteamWorld Dig is a bad game. Like I said, I enjoyed it when I was playing it. But I think it's a thin game--good for a few hours of enjoyment, but not anything worth returning to once you've finished it.Final rating: 6/10			"

												Not much to say about this one other than the fact that it’s short but sweet. The music/sound is good and the gameplay style/mechanics are like a steampunk version of Terraria set in the old west (sans the crafting, among other features).  The price isn’t bad, especially when you get it on sale, and among the many retro games available on Steam this is certainly a diamond in the rough. "

												Fun platforming and movement around the landscape. Great story, but lacks replayability. No New Game +. For a normal game, if you don't backtrack and try everything you can to get every upgrade and every piece of mineral, it'll take about 3 hours.$9.99 USD seems too much for this game, given its lack of replayability.But it's a great game to obtain if you get it through Humble Bundle.

Click Here for the Full Review! [monthsbehindreviews.blogspot.com]Synopsis: An interesting blend of DigDug and Metroid, where you drill and pickaxe your way through strata, grabbing ores and gems as you go, making your way from cave to cave in search of upgrades and the reason why your deceased uncle left you a mining claim in a town with a population of 3. Back topside you can sell your goods for cash, which you can use to buy additional incremental upgrades for the major ones you've found in your travels.It's a fun little game, though it does have it's quirks. Some of the navigating can be tricky, such as wall jumping, and you can't dig upwards at a diagonal, so be careful you don't get stuck, because having to self destruct (or any other death) means losing half your cash and dropping all your loot (this last bit can be recovered). Worth your time, which won't be much because the speed achievement requires you to beat it in around 2 hours (it took my 7, but I grabbed all the loot, and died more than a few times from digging under a rock). I'd suggest getting it around $2.50, and enjoying a sadly brief respite from Real Life (c) problems. I give it an 8/10.			"

												I like the fact how simple this game is, you can grasp all the main concepts in a few minutes. Still, even though being that simple, it is very much enjoyable. Especially for us, collectors and perfectionists, it's very charming to be able to dig through the world and try to find every single last precious ore nugget that is out there.The game length is 6 - 10 hours, and that's a benefit for me. The worlds were quite different and they introduced new concepts, which is great, one would never feel bored.The only thing I disliked about this game is the ""light"" game concept. It seems to be that it was introduced in order to make the game less plain, to make the game mechanics more complex. Which I agree with, it would be way too simple otherwise. But it's not designed properly. With current design, you simply have to go above ground every few minutes, even though your bag is almost empty and you have no other reason to return, just to refill the light lamp. That often means spending up to several minutes traversing the mine to the top. That's crazy, and it's annoying as hell. Some possible improvements to this concept include: a) an ability to refill the oil from the (eternal) lamps scattered through the level, maybe at the expense of extinguishing that lamp forever b) an ability to purchase and take with you an extra flask of oil, maybe even at the expense of one of the inventory slots. With this approach, you have immediately made the game less painful and also more interesting, because there is very interesting choice to be had - spend more money and have less inventory space, but have longer and more convenient light? Those are exactly the right tough question every game should offer. Sadly, in this case, it was not though out well.Except for the single issue mentioned above, I very much enjoyed how the game looked and played, and recommend it to everyone enjoying this kind of casual exploring/digging/a bit puzzle and platforming genre.

												I think I got this in an Indie game bundle for Humble Bundle, and I played a few other of the games in it and wasn't really impressed, so I didn't get to playing this.Well, now I'm visiting my parents with my somewhat old laptop and decided it looked like fun. Well it's 3 am now and I am happy to report that it is pretty fun.It takes some elements from an old favorite of mine ""Motherload"" and I think it puts it's own twist on the ""mining platform"" genre (?)I really liked the progression, I think it was well paced. I never felt too underpowered but I always felt that there was a goal to be reached, and I think that the timing of the abilities was well done as well as the introduction of new shops that made it feel like a real accomplishment when you bought all of the upgrades from a store.The different stages were nice, it again added to the progression. Though I do think that the enemies should have been slightly more specialized for each area. Like the basic melee enemy, which was the worm and the shiners. Instead of having them just hit you and bounce off, it would have added a little variety by making the shiner actively attack you when you get near them. The enemies seemed a little to basic in general, usually only having 2 or 3 enemies per stage, which got a little repeatative but the environment helped keep things interesting overall. The puzzle and ability rooms were well done, not too simple, and making you feel like you are missing something, making you look for a way to get to a certain ore or something. It was nice. Basic platforming done well in my opinion. Though the secret areas contained within the rooms were very easy to see, so it wasn't very gratifying to find them.Overall I think this is a very nicely done game. I felt the progression is very well done, the environment was interesting, and it is a fair game. However, I feel like there could have been a little more enemy variety, the music isn't great, and my god the characters' voices make me want to punch a baby seal in the face. If there were a slider or box for their ""voice"" I would have been less happy that I could skip their dialogue and I might have actually read what they were saying.I apologize for any spelling or grammatical errors that may be present.TL;DR progression and environment are great. Can be a little too repeatative and the overworld characters' ""voices"" are annoying as ****.			"

 I recommend this game immensely. first playthrough 8 hours, Second playthrough 4 hours. All of a sudden I'm playing to get the master prospector achievement which I did get. This is the only game that really had me coming back to beat my highscore. The Master Prospector achievement is -   Beat the game in less than 2 and a half hours   Make $20,000 Dollars or more   Collecting 150 or more orbs  You can only die once Getting this achievement was really frustaring but well worth it in the end. I don't know if it's the collecting ore, upgrading and digging but this game had me hooked. This game made me want to %100 the game and I accomplished that. You should get this game honestly the best $11 I have spent for the most fun. "

												A very addictive game that never feels like a grind. I was genuinely surprised at how fun it was and the constant sense of progress and achievement is probably the reason it's also pretty short. It's never a grind and it never feels like you're wasting your time collecting meaningless upgrades.I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys games where you explore, collect resources and collect power-ups. Sort of like Metroid but it's up to you really how many resources you want to collect and what upgrades to prioritise.			"

Very well put together, and one I don't regret playing. Did feel a little short, and that might be an issue for some. The quality of this game though is pretty high.

												Lately, I've been compulsively buying games that I've seen selling for cheap, in retrospective kind of a dumb thing to do because I now have little over 10 games that I havent finished. This game was one of those, I bought it because it was on a sale, and so far it's been the only one I've finished. Probably the best 2.5 bucks I've spent in a while. Great fun, a bit on the short and easy side, but should be a challenge for speedrunners. 8/10 would have liked a bit more replayability and/or more content, but for 2.5 to  10 bucks its a win win situation. Get this game if you like Metroidvania/ Upgrade centric games, great fun, great graphics, good game overall			"

												This is a fun little platformer type game. Due to upgrades you get, you could say it is a metroidvania type game.You start out with nothing and are dropped into the underground caves of a town. You a local, and are told about you uncle. Shortly after, you get you first item, a pick axe.The game revolves around using digging devices (throughout the game you find more) to keep mining the gems under the town and fend off enimies. While there are enimies, that isn't the highlight of the game. You keep getting upgrades of your digging devices as well throughout the game.If you die, you drop all the gems you are carring and are returned to town. You loose 50% of your gold as well, so you want to avoid this. The first time through you might find yourself digging down faster than you should. It is wise to plan ahead so you can always get back up to sell those precious gems.While at first there might not be much stratigy, as stated above you do need to be careful just digging down and fast. Plan ahead, so you have tunnels that you can use to your advantage. Thera are consumable's you can use to help out, but I found them not very useful. I found spending my money on upgrades more worth the money.There are 3 diffrent ""types"" of mning areas you go through. They get progresivly harder to mine, but the game overall isn't very challanging.Overall I would recomend the game. I also feel it is sutable for the younger crowd if you are looking for your children. I played the game completly with a wireless xbox 360 controler, and had no issues with it. I do now know how a KBAM would be.			"

												I found this game very reminicient of some of the different mining flash games you see online.  Dig deeper into the earth, find more valuable things as you do, and bring them back to the surface to sell so you can upgrade your digger.  This game changes things a bit by having a bit of a story and more interactions with some puzzle elements and enemies, which helped it from feeling too repetitive during its short runtime.  Game only took 5 hours or so to finish, so good for a quick fix if you can pick it up on sale.			"

												SteamWorld Dig is very charming and a lot of fun. Many people as whether or not the game is similar to 'Terraria', and the answer is no. If you were to compare SteamWorld Dig to any other game I think the closest would be Motherlode - the old(ish) Flash title that was popular on Miniclip. You go underground, you dig for minerals, you return to the surface to drop them off and make money to purchase new upgrades in order to dig for more minerals, more effectively. It's simple, but the game's constant introduction of new mechanics keep it challenging and interesting. In 2013, where there are so many games out there that focus on exploration that give the player a degree of sandbox freedom, it is fair to wonder whether or not a game like this will gather a large fanbase. In a sandbox game, the exploration and gathering of materials feels a little bit more organic than in Steamworld Dig, where you really only have a few options for upgrades and the resources are essentially melted down into the same currency. SteamWorld has no intention of being that kind of organic exploration/survival title though, but people will still draw that comparison and I am sure that there are people that will find fault with that. If you're looking for a game that fits that description, SteamWorld is not for you.I have two main faults with the game. First, the PC port does not allow for the rebinding of keys. I am usually pretty lax when it comes to crucifying a game for being a lackluster port but not giving me the ability to re-bind keys is a pretty big issue - especially when the game uses up, down, left, right as the movement controls and not WASD, meaning some gamers with 'gaming' keyboards (such as the Logitech G510) will run into input conflicts. I found myself using an Xbox 360 controller and a third party program, which I think benefited the game, but is still inexcusable. Second, the length. I beat Steamworld in 3.5 hours according to my save file, and I am by no means a good gamer. For $9.99, that isn't entirely damning of the game, but it does leave you wanting more. There are plenty of achievements that encourage replay, though.			"

												Read the full review: http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/steamworld-dig-game-review/SteamWorld Dig immediately reminded me of Gem Miner, a game for Android-based devices, that I used to play. I had fun with Gem Miner, but SteamWorld Dig vastly improves on the faults of that game, providing me a completely fresh, unique experience. Upon playing through the game, I realized that SteamWorld Dig certainly does justify its standing as a Super Metroid x Terraria hybrid.The main concept in SteamWorld Dig is to, well, dig. You dig/mine through various different types of dirt and rock searching for ore and other treasures. These ores can then be sold at the surface, providing the money needed to purchase upgrades and new equipment at the town’s shop (I should also mention that this town only has three residents, which I found quite amusing). The main character, Rusty, ends up at this town due to the death of his uncle, who owned a mine in the town. Rusty then takes over this mine and has to uncover the secrets of what’s below.Not only are you digging and mining your way through the various objectives in the game, but you also have to watch out for the multitude of enemies hidden below the dirt. A few of them are actually fairly difficult to just ignore, like the guys that throw bottles at you, which damage blocks, although I did use this to my advantage in some scenarios where I was unable to destroy a certain block. I would continuously wall-jump off of the block I wanted destroyed while the bottle-throwing badguy destroyed it for me, missing me every throw.The visuals in the game are far superior to the 3DS version and are a treat to look at. The characters and backgrounds were great and really added to the immersion. The ore textures seemed a bit off to me, however. You cannot tell what material is contained within the ore until you mine it, which I found a bit annoying. All of the ore textures were the same, but there were a variety of minerals and gems dropped from them. The variety of drops was awesome, some of which I’ve never heard of (as they’re probably made-up). The game’s audio was also excellent, no complaints there.The game has a story to it, and although it may be minute, it still exists. The story does progress at a very rapid pace, as the game is quite short, only taking me about three hours to finish. It was an enjoyable experience nonetheless, and I highly recommend it.SteamWorld Dig had a few annoying mechanics that I should mention. There was one instance in the game where it was impossible to progress without getting hit, from my observations. I was stuck in this situation with a sliver of health left and I couldn’t progress. I had to go back and get some health before I could pass. There was another instance where I kept getting myself trapped under boulders, but that’s probably due to my own stupidity!Overall, SteamWorld Dig is a short, enjoyable experience, combining factors from Gem Miner, Terraria, and Super Metroid. It executes this well, combining the gameplay aspects of the three with great graphics and sound. It may lack in replayability, but it still is a worthwhile experience.

Along the way you meet brainless monsters that prolong your stay underground before restocking in town.If you expect it to be action/spelunky type game - it's not. It's fun but nothing really special. There are many other titles better then this. Although it's fun and casual + as for me for one-walkthrough (~5 hours gameplay)			"

												Bought it at the ongoing HumbleBundle sale. Oh boy, just wanted to have a try this night, ended up goin' diggin for about three hours. So far it's an addictive making experience. The upgrade for your character are coming in just perfect to keep you motivated all the time. And the mixture between Jump n Run and diggin the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the levels is just awesome. In the trailer the diggin seems a bit boring but its extremly well set up in the game environment so its a very exciting experience and you will find yourself in the loop of mining and upgrading in no time. The level design just makes fun and the graphics are very good aswell and a nice change compared to the famous 8-bit looks these days - which i like but after the 10th game its nice to have some variety. And there are jewels and drills, and super-burning-fists, upgrades, funky characters. You really should try it out as soon as you can!			"

However, beware, this game is extremely addictive. I finished the game in a day because of non stop playing. At first things can feel like they are dragging on some but the game does pick up. The only downfall of this game is that there is very little to do once you beat the game except replay it or try the final boss again for a better time.			"

												It's like a fusion of elements from games such as Super Metroid, Motherload and Spelunky. The game features a gorgeous art style and some nice audio to boot. Game play was very enjoyable and moderately challenging, without ever being overly difficult or frustrating.The simple story is fairly intriguing and serves well to keep the player motivated. Though it is fairly short (~4 hours), frequent items, upgrades and new enemies keep the game fresh and enjoyable throughout.A+ on a scale of 1 to Banana. "

												If you liked the old motherlode game, and cant wait for the new steam release, this is an excellent stop gap, and will probably be better than the full motherlode release. Dig for minerals, upgrade equipment, repeat. Astounding value if you get it in the humble bundle, still great at the full $10 price. Only downside is I finished it in about 6+hours. I would have liked a little longer playtime, but meh, still extremely satisfying. 9/10			"

												Do not let my short time with this version mislead you; whereas, I have destroyed the 3DS version of this game and found myself surprisingly hooked for hours.  I was pleasantly surprised to notice this on sale today, and purchased it immediately - it's that good.  After only 15 minute on the Steam/PC version, rest assured, the transition is everything it should be.  Here's an actual review of the game itself.  Last, I apologize now for spelling, grammatical, or contextual errors, i.e., I am typing quickly in a dark room~This game is fresh, imaginitive, visually stylish, and is easy to pickup, but requires elements of strategy as you dig and rewards you with progress often.  It delivers a perfect balance; whereas, it is far from super easy, though never hits impossibile or the bang your head against the wall to end it all 'frustration rage' (we've all seen this, be it controllers, walls, friends, etc).  You start casually, but there are no long drawn out tutorials, cut scenses, or credits.  Shorrtly after hitting the start button, you are playing - a feature that is more uncommon than is often noted.  Its apparent almost immediately that the game possesses visually asthetic fluidity.   As you continue to explore, the pacing set by the game is consistently maitained and develops respective to the depths you traverse, and keeps you balanced by means of progressive upgrades, powerups, the twon's growth, purchasable items, and increased value of the loot you find. This game constantly rewards you and creates the sense of wanting to play just a bit longer.  I found myself setting aside some of lifes responaibilities simply because I enjoyed the time I spent playing, e.g., foolhardily making the wife wait longer than any wife prefers to wait...multiple times (Protip: AVOID this mistake).  Additionally, the balance feels very natural and honestly has a rare bit of brillance that you never really think about, probably because it does play so well.  The time you spend jmping through the air, punching, digging, upgrading your items, treking back to town, while thinking about how youre going to get all the way back to the pipe/teleporter as you make some questionable wall jumps never really got old; rather, it did feel as though you accomplished and understand the game more.  As the game tosses new dynamics this feeling continued to evolve... and I found myself enjoying it as I evolved as a player.  Despite the hollistic theme of digging, digging, digging, the gameplay never really got old.  It all comes together in a package that delivers an experience that really ends up complimeting the multiple componets of its own gameplay; therfore, bringing itself together delivering syle, balance, exploration, while provinding a (gamer's) sense of accomplishment, excitment, and fun -> a feeling often associated with video games; however, is all too often replaced with a sense of obligation to finish simply becasue we started or have put so much into it.  This gam never created a sense of obligation, and if your a gamer you know the feeling I am referring to.  This game transcends that dynamic and sccomplishes the ever more difficult task of creating the fundemtntial elements of enjoyment.  This game is appropriate for gamers of all ages, styles, and skill level(s).  The constant rewards will develop younger players, yet can offer old school gamers (the one's who grew up on arcades/atari/nes/collecovison) an experience that is a often more difficult to find in a game.  Buy it.  You will literally find yourself digging in~			"

												This game is great! Kind of a mix between, say, Spelunky (minus the difficult and ""roguelike"" elements) and a super-lite Metroidvania game. Love the art style, music, and it just has a really fun feel to it; digging deeper and deeper into a mine to further upgrade items and unlock new abilites to make previous areas you've explored easier to clear out. You find caves throughout that have some minor puzzle elements to them, making sure you dig the right path to get extra unlockables and such, which adds a little variety to the ""dig deeper and deeper"" gameplay, too.Spent about 7 hours total playing through it with 100% completion. I guess it doesn't have much replay value if that's something you're looking for before the purchase, but it's something I intend to return to at a later point, so try not to let the lack of it hold you back.

												Great, addictive, fun little game. If you have played any kind of mining game recently, this is like that, but more in tune with a dig dug clone. You mine for gems worth money, turn them in for cash to spend on upgraded tools, so you can go deeper. All with a steampunk robot west feel. Story is simple and pretty quick, game is only about 5 hours long. If you enjoy Terraria, miner dig deep, starbound's mining, this is probably up your alley.			"

												A post-apocalyptic tale (with Old West influences) of a robot who goes into a mine to continue the work of his robot uncle. You dig down, look for minerals, and unravel the mystery of how your relative disappeared. This is a simple side-scrolling platformer with some RPG elements, but a worthwhile one. It's paced nicely, the gameplay is good, the art and characters are interesting, etc. To beat the game it requires about 3-9 hours of playtime depending on how much you explore and how many upgrades you want (personally I don't mind grinding but others may disagree). SteamWorld Dig is a bit lighthearted and casual, but it's not a yawnsome breeze to play either. You'll probably encounter a few parts here and there that are semi-challenging. Nothing serious of course, but it was nice to see some level of strategy beyond ""point and click anywhere to win.""I'm not sure if the game is worth $10 - maybe a bit closer to $5 - but it's well done. 8/10, like Metacritic says, seems accurate. Not the best game ever, but it's pretty fun and worth a try. I got this in a Humble Bundle and it's definitely worth more than what I paid.			"

												This is a fun, simple, sandbox puzzle game.  However, it is too simple, it doesn't really push any boundaries or have a whole lot of new exciting elements.  Basically you just dig deeper and deeper, and solve puzzles along the way.  It could be fun if you like puzzles (I'm not a big fan of them) but even then, the puzzles are way too easy, even for me.  Also the start of the game is extremely slow and tedious.  There isn't a whole lot of buyables and you spend way too much time digging.  As the game progresses you are able to dig faster to speed things up with a drill but the drill requires water so if you run out you have to go back to using your slow pickaxe.  And the ""town"" really only has 3 other people (robots) in it and 1 doesn't really do anything.  The chat can be witty but really there just isn't a whole lot there.  It's a pretty short game as it is.Overall this game could be worth getting if you like sandbox puzzles but only if you can get it for a really good price.  I don't know whether to give it a thumbs up or down because I'm pretty mixed so I'll just give it a thumbs up because it still seems to be a fairy well made game and because I'm nice.			"

												Just finished this one up and really had a lot of fun. But then again I am very patient. For a good portion of this game after a few accomplishments earlier in game play you'll find yourself a little confused. After digging and digging and more digging I started wondering if I was missing something or even going in the right direction. There isn't much indication of where you are in your game play which is fine but you don't find yourself finding an exact direction(besides down) to follow. Not to spoil but I believe the ending was left wide open for an inevitable sequel which I will be more than happy to play and look forward to more defined ""levels"" and maybe the addition of more Bosses. The final battle for me was really satisfying because of it's nastalga boss battle feel and I really wished I had more of that throughout the game. Maybe even a Completion bar would be nice to have to know whether or not it would be worth the time and effort to go out Mining and have the satisfaction of knowing that every nook,cranny and stone has been turned for that 100% completion. solid 3.5/5 for me			"

												If you like games like Terraria or Starbound then SteamWorld Dig may be right up your alley. This single player experience has you controlling a robot in a steampunk world. After inheriting a mine from his uncle he has to dig through the earth, gather minerals and use the minerals to buy upgrades as he digs ever deeper towards the secrets of the depths.The game will deliver about 3-4 hours of gameplay which is ok given the price and it makes sure that you don't get tired of the game or its mechanics which are quite simple and easy to master.This game isn't perfect and could have been expanded greatly with more upgrades, enemies and so on and so forth, but I'm very pleased with this purchace.

												This is a 2D mining game done right. The deeper you go, the harder(slower) it is to mine. Thankfully the game provides upgrades that increase the mining power of your pickaxe. Then you unlock lots of fun upgrades that build up your platforming powers. The controls are nice and behave as expected. If you're looking to get a metroid-vania fix with a bit of mining thrown in, this is about the best game I know of. Highly recommended.My first playthrough was about 4 hours, and the second time through was just under 2 1/2. There are plenty of unlockables and secrets to keep you playing for a while longer though if you choose.The story isn't even half bad either!			"

While it describes itself as a MetroidVania, it lacks alot of the combat options most of these title have. It's mostly about digging down, but the exploration and puzzles are all very adequate. If it's on sale, you might want to jump on it if you are starved out on metroidvanias like I was.			"

												Solid game. Those OCD types who have to clear EVERYTHING will be happy with this one and, frankly, will find it more satisfactory a purchase than those who make a sprint of it. If you're looking to kill a day with some well-rendered MetroidVania stuff, this is a decent choice. It's not as well-rounded, meaty or challenging as Guacamelee (which is fantastic), but it's worth a few hours and a few bucks. 7/10			"

												Pretty fun time killer. Feels like a much more polished version of Motherlode (a flash game that was on Newgrounds AGES ago... probably still is on the internet somewhere) with tweaked mechanics and better narrative / visuals / audio. it's pretty short so if you're going to give it a once-through than I don't think you should pick it up. If you're a sort who loves the gameplay (think dig dug with a splash of metrovania) and/or will want to finish all of the achievements you'll get more time out of it than... perhaps? I'm still hesitant to recommend it for that price point.Granted, I have had much less fun with more expensive games, so there is always that.			"

Gameplay wise it reminds me of the good ole Dig Dug for the Atari mixed it with aspects from Terreria and similar titles such as Craft The World. Sit back and relax with this one guys! , the addition of steam cards makes the game a little more appealing as well. No glitching or bugs found yet either. So if you enjoy the tunneling as your leisure gamestyle pick this one up you won't regret it!			"

												Steamworld Dig is a quirky game. It is remenescent of iDigit on the iPhone but with upgrades and some platformer elements (on the set levels). For most of the game you just dig deeper in your grandfather's mine to collect rescources to sell at the town. In the beggining you have little tools and abilities, but within a few minutes you will unlock abilities like dash and super jump. The graphics are remeniscent of the 16-32 bit era but are rendered in HD. The game is simple with only three stats that you need to keep up with: health, Fire and water (the later two being used up as a varation of a mana bar). The game is slightly humorous and keeps the player entertained while also holding the player's hand.			"

												This game reminds me when I would come home from school and sit down and play Motherload on Miniclip.com for hours - This game is like that but so much better; way better graphics just as much if not more fun and it has a sort of mineshaft thing which I guess is like a dungeon of sorts which is what was missing from Motherload so it didn’t get boring after a few hours. It is a very well made game, good and simple concept which is to go down and mine for resources so you can upgrade your gear so you can mine more - it has a good storyline which is one of the things that Motherload needed to improve on.Overall the game is brilliantly made and a lot of fun.I would recommend this to anyone who was a fan of Motherload or enjoyed it but felt that it needed a little more.

												The good: This is a fun little game to keep you entertained for the afternoon. The story is decent for the type of game it is, the graphics are cute, and the gameplay is a fun exercise in logistics as you try to mine ores and avoid enemies. The music is good and sets the tone well. The game has an achievement for finishing with speed and an achievement for being a completionist, so there is some replay value through different styles of play. The bad: The controls are somewhat finnicky, especially the wall jump. I had several frustrating slides and long periods of being stuck in deep mine shafts and unable to climb out. The story is also very short. It depends on how fast of a gamer you are, but there's actually an achievement for finishing the entire game in under 2.5 hours, so that tells you how quick it can go. That good music I mentioned can also get a little repetitive. General info: You play this game as a little steam-powered robot; you dig ores in a mine and sell them to get upgrades for your gear. This isn't a heavy duty type game; more of a light entertainment. It's an easy game to pick up and put down and come back to later, which is nice somtimes. Overall: It's a fun little game. Not sure it's worth the full price, but if you can catch it during a sale, I definitely think it's worth getting. I enjoyed it quite a bit.System Specs Used: Intel Core i7-3610QM, Nvidia GeForce GTX 670M / 3GB GDDR5, DDRIII 12GB RAM, Windows 7			"

Usually I get bored of games after a while and play it after some other games, but after 1 run of FTL, I couldn't think of anything but playing this game there was almost nothing I hated about it... and then...(Disclaimer, this is not a spoiler, although it may seem like it, there is no hinting to what the end IS.) The ending, I love ends of games due to the fact that practically anything can happen. But when I completed it, I knew what the 1 drawback to this game was, once you finished the ending... It started from the last save... THE LAST SAVE! There's no after the ending, you just get to play through the ending over and over again until you make a new save... So overall I'd give this game an 8/10... so I would recommend this game, but it's not my all time favorite...			"

												A short but fun game. You play as a robot as he mines his way down to the bottom of the World. The gameplay is fun. It is kind of like Terraria except you travel back to the surface frequently to sell ores to buy pickaxe upgrades/ a larger bag. Its simplistic, but generally fun. The game would get old if it was longer than 4 hours to beat and the challenge increases nicely. There are a few flaws. Firstly, you will need to travel to the surface frequently and teleporters back are not common enough (you can buy your own but they cost orbs which you need to collect for the best upgrades). Secondly, there are a handful of blind drops which you will need close to full health to survive. Spoiler warning:Finally the game ends with a boss fight and the combat in the game is really not its strong point. Overall, not a bad way to waste an evening. Worth picking up in a sale.			"

For a short game I like how it starts to feel more like a platformer to keep you interested and takes a really great turn near the end. The music is one of my favourite things about this game.

												SteamWorld Dig is exactly what you would expect: dig up ores, get upgrades, and solve a few puzzles. Upgrades could come a bit earlier, as you quickly end up in areas that take one too many chops. 3-4 hours is just the right length for a simple grindy games.			"

												Pretty fun time. Took about 4 hours to beat the game. The game style is nothing you've not seen before, it's dig, grab ores, go topside, sell ores, buy upgrades, dig deeper... rinse and repeat until end boss. That said it has a nice athmosphere. Not sure if I'd recommend it at full price, but if it goes on sale it's a good grab.			"

												Dig, Collect, Sell, Buy and get the digging again...No it's not just about that, and that yet is very relaxing. This is a game where you will find confort in playing on casual moment, as you will find yourself engaged by it's town folk on the scavenge breaks, maybe even laught with the country's style dialogs.Anyway, it's available to all plataforms, has a music theme you will remember in another moment when not playing (which will cause you to want to). Nice ambient music and sounds, good atmosphere and graphics and a polished plataform action style puzzle (???).That's not a crafting game (if are to expect something like Terraria, and not that big either). It define's itself good as a scavenger plataform.			"

 I recommend this game immensely. first playthrough 8 hours, Second playthrough 4 hours. All of a sudden I'm playing to get the master prospector achievement which I did get. This is the only game that really had me coming back to beat my highscore. The Master Prospector achievement is -   Beat the game in less than 2 and a half hours   Make $20,000 Dollars or more   Collecting 150 or more orbs  You can only die once Getting this achievement was really frustaring but well worth it in the end. I don't know if it's the collecting ore, upgrading and digging but this game had me hooked. This game made me want to %100 the game and I accomplished that. You should get this game honestly the best $11 I have spent for the most fun. "

												A very addictive game that never feels like a grind. I was genuinely surprised at how fun it was and the constant sense of progress and achievement is probably the reason it's also pretty short. It's never a grind and it never feels like you're wasting your time collecting meaningless upgrades.I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys games where you explore, collect resources and collect power-ups. Sort of like Metroid but it's up to you really how many resources you want to collect and what upgrades to prioritise.			"

												For first, this game looks A-W-E-S-O-M-E! Like, it is a feast for my eyes, even just lookin' to the game is entertaining for me. +1 from there.The mechanics of the game is really cool, Terrarria-Minecraft like mining, and then comes the fun part, platform. It is really cool and enjoyable but don't expect much more. +1 indeed.And since your going to mine, you must be careful and plan every step you'll make. As you go deeper you must set a road for you back there to climb back up, there are some thingys for you to make your journey easy but -If you are dumb like me- you can fail easily. And if you fail, you'll be regenerate outside of the mine with losing all your stuff. It's kinda rough-like and It's very very cool adds tansion to the game. Another +1.And It's wild west themed! I like wild west themed games and this a huge +1 for me.But I can't play this game so long, because of my stupid claustrophobia :( But if you don't have that, you can pretend you never read this part of the review.So there is no cons that I can think of about this game but I can surely say if you don't like games like Terrarria just simply don't ""waste"" your precious bucks. But in the other case, this game is a gem for who like Terrarria. (C'mooon noow! Your friends wasn't aware of this gem before you recommended it to them!!)			"

While you go down and explore you will find satisfying upgrades that will help you through the mining. There's also couple NPC that sell you more upgrades (Better pickaxe, More health, ecc..)In short: If you like upgrade games, this is one of the games you should buy.Final Boss bit lame tho :/			"

												PROS:  This game has a good rewards system and sometimes you may feel surprised because of the enemies that come out of the rocks. Also I like the Drill! The drill helps you drill through rock faster and get where you need to go, it's a great power up in the game. Also this game carries alot of upgrades for your Pick Ax, Water Supply and much more. This is a good game for casual and serious gamers. The gameplay looks nice and cartoony. It also has few NPC's which could be a bad thing but it allows them to stand out and become a big part of the game. CONS: This game is short, more content would of been nice. It is also hard to know what to do next if there isn't a big red dot on the map. The upgrades in the game could of gotten more use but was neglected. After you beat the game, it is quite bland and unrewarding. Money is scares and can't be brought back which is intresting but hard when you know you need big upgrades for the Final Boss.INCONCLUSION: This game is nice but very short and would be better with more content. This game is for you if you want a nice story with decent gameplay. This game isn't for you if you want a long story and don't like limited use of upgrades.7.3/10			"

												     Steamworld dig was a strange but fun experience. Its not exactly a 2D platformer, because the precision and combat that take place take a backseat to a slower thoughtful game. The player must descend into the earth (hence ""Dig""), but the route must be strategic so that one can explore the cave, reach resources, and most critically, not carelessly dig oneself into a grave.     The planning and excavation feels pleasantly fresh, but can often lead to frustration for those as impatient as myself when you realize you've gone too far, and may never be able to reach that critical resource beyond the reach of your pickaxe. On the other hand, it does make thoroughness feel all the more rewarding, especially considering that a majority of the upgrades have meaningful impacts on how you play the game and what you can accomplish.      It isn't a game that I could binge, but all its clever ideas deserve to be appreciated between the aliens we've been gunning down for decades.			"

												Beaten the final boss and got heaps of achievements, still need to max out my equipment though. It caught me by surprise, thought it was more similar to Spelunky, turns out it's more puzzle like in its approach and has metroidvania elements for the progression. It's very nice and polished, the graphics are great 2D artwork, everything works and feels awesome and responsive; it feels repetitive after a while, but I'd say that only happens when you are basically at the end of the game (the game's short), so it's not a huge issue. Only real issue is that the developers could have done much more with the world and characters.			"

												This game is absolutely fabulous! Everything about the entire experience is wonderful. The game runs at a SOLID 60fps, and I haven't encountered any bugs or glitches. The gameplay and story is great, but the real meat and potatos is the gameplay! The digging concept sounds boring and may rot quickly, but Image & Form has developed it so that the conceptr never gets old! I've %100 complete this game on both Steam and my 3DS. So what are you waiting for? Add this game to your cart, and get to digging!!			"

This game is an absolute gem and  I can't wait for the sequel to drop.  You can blow through it pretty quick, took me about 7 and a half hours total including screwing around just mining the jewels.

												Sweet lil game ! Soonnn, i enjoyed this game!For the price this game is worth it, now i got it only for 2 euros and something, and is god damn worth it.You might think this is a grinder game, but in reality is really not, all you gotta do in this game is go deep down till you reach the end of the game. While you go down and explore you will find satisfying upgrades that will help you through the mining. There's also couple NPC that sell you more upgrades (Better pickaxe, More health, ecc..)In short: If you like upgrade games, this is one of the games you should buy.Final Boss bit lame tho :/			"

												Not sure why I enjoyed this game so much.  I suppose it just didn't have any glaring flaws.-Controls are tight and responsive-Clear indications of what you're supposed to be doing without being annoying or insulting-Good difficulty curve-Progression feels rewardingTo vastly oversimplify it, it's like a stripped down, more focused version of Terraria.  All the fluff, crafting, creating of Terraria is removed and replaced with a progression system and a much more streamlined digging and ore-finding experience. While this game does seem to have replayability for achievements and such, you can suspect a much shorter experience with SteamWorld Dig (about 4 hours for a leisurely playthrough vs whatever 600 hours I've dumped on Terraria).

												I'll say that I like robots and that I like the wild west. It has both so I can't complain. Steamworld Dig is a great mining game with several influences such as Terarria, Megaman and Metroid. You play as Rusty who has inherited an old mine from his uncle. The main objective is to mine, collect ores, sell them and reach for the bottem of the mine. It was originally released on 3DS and the game is quite appealing to the eye, they managed to add quite a bit of colour for a mining game which is nice. The music is decent but I wouldn't say catchy. It more melds right into the game which is great as it adds to the game. The mining in the game is all about risk versus reward and it is done quite superbly.Overall I give it 8.5/10 Its fun, looks great and you can play the game in your own pace. If you're not a big fan of games like Minecraft or Terraria, you should at least give this a go because (for people like me) it has a story and an ending plus the game has a bit to offer.			"

												The good: This is a fun little game to keep you entertained for the afternoon. The story is decent for the type of game it is, the graphics are cute, and the gameplay is a fun exercise in logistics as you try to mine ores and avoid enemies. The music is good and sets the tone well. The game has an achievement for finishing with speed and an achievement for being a completionist, so there is some replay value through different styles of play. The bad: The controls are somewhat finnicky, especially the wall jump. I had several frustrating slides and long periods of being stuck in deep mine shafts and unable to climb out. The story is also very short. It depends on how fast of a gamer you are, but there's actually an achievement for finishing the entire game in under 2.5 hours, so that tells you how quick it can go. That good music I mentioned can also get a little repetitive. General info: You play this game as a little steam-powered robot; you dig ores in a mine and sell them to get upgrades for your gear. This isn't a heavy duty type game; more of a light entertainment. It's an easy game to pick up and put down and come back to later, which is nice somtimes. Overall: It's a fun little game. Not sure it's worth the full price, but if you can catch it during a sale, I definitely think it's worth getting. I enjoyed it quite a bit.System Specs Used: Intel Core i7-3610QM, Nvidia GeForce GTX 670M / 3GB GDDR5, DDRIII 12GB RAM, Windows 7			"

												SteamWorld Dig reminded me a lot of Mario Brothers or Megaman. The ability to dig through most of the map is really satisfying, especially late in the game when you have the digging tool upgrades. The comments of the NPC vendors actually hint at the ending of the story so that when it happens there is a forehead slapping moment of revelation, which I enjoyed.The game is open sandbox. You can go back to any previous area and play more. So if you miss anything you can always backtrack and get it. As you progress, you will find the previous areas are much easier to play, which can help if you got stuck anywhere.The Vendor narrations get annoying. As you scroll through each item, they start narrating immediately. And it's just gibberish and starts sounding like a Skyllex concert if you scroll quickly. It's just a minor thing.The resource management in this game is tremendously fun. You have a lot of limited tools and end up searching for water because you need it to power some of the things you can do. It really makes the game feel steampunk.Naturally I want more. The game started to feel a little repetitious near the end. But for the 4$ Black Friday sale, I can't complain! What I'm saying is that I'm REALLY looking forward to a sequel with more features and I would certainly be willing to pay more for it. This was a really good game. It just felt like Megaman 1. I know there is a lot more that could be done with it.The game is relatively short, moreso because I couldn't put it down. I beleive I beat the game in 6 hours over 3 sittings. I am sure I missed a few things and it's a game that later I will go back and play again. Unfortunately because of the repetitive nature of things near the end, I'll want a little break before I do that.The ending felt a little short. Maybe it's all my time struggling with games like Megaman, but I figured out how to defeat the end boss immediaely and made short work of him. I haven't even checked to see if there are different difficulty modes. If not, that would be a good upgrade.I would have like just a little more at the end of the game. Many games do this. You defeat the boss and the screen fades to black and the game is over. I would like to need to leave the room, with the option of wandering around the dungoen a bit more before having to enter a portal, gate, push a button or do some other activity that would end the game and start the end game sequence.A lot of work was put into this game. I didn't notice any bugs or problems. The music was good. The game play was really good. The teleport system for getting into and out of the dungeon wasn't too easy or too hard. It was a good balance. The game had a built in solution for getting stuck, which was probably possible but never happened to me, in the way of a self destruct in the menu options. That's just smart programing.If you like side scrollers, give this one a try. It's unique, western steampunk fun. "

												The game is quite fun and gives around seven hours of gameplay but only if you take it slow and want to explorer everything. This is basically the old “Motherlode” game from miniclip.com as you just go deeper and deeper while mining everything you find. The added twist here are the explorable caves which will then require you to solve a puzzle, which are really the fun part of the game as going down in a straight line does get a bit boring after a while. Art style is really well done as are the different characters and their dialogue. Game is best played by using a controller, although this isn't natively supported. I used a freeware program like Joy To Key to bind the input of my controller to the keybindigs of the game after which it played much better. The biggest negative about this game was the disappointing end boss, really easy and just lazy game design.Overall I would only recommend buying this game if it is on sale as it lacks a satisfying amount of playable hours.

												Looked into this game from a friend's suggestion after seeing Steamworld Heist. It's very fun; I've played some F2P games doing the ""dig & upgrade"" formula, but this had a very appealing aesthetic to it, and the controls were tight & the upgrades satisfying. Worth spending a couple bucks & hours on.			"

												Outstanding platformer with excellent level design, mechanics and controls. The artwork and the soundtrack are incredible and this is a game I will definitely replay at some point. The entire experience was fun and relaxing from start to finish. If you're a fan of Mario, Metroid, Oddworld, Castlevania, Ori and the Blind Forest, Terraria and similar games be sure to give Steamworld Dig a shot. You will not be disappointed.			"

I'm not going to compare it to Minecraft or Territaria because Its shown a unique way of using the dig/explore mechanics and your not crafting anything. The town does that for you as you mine ore and jewels. It also adds a story. You like the dig/exploration genre, you wont be dissapointed here.			"

While the game doesn't do anything truely spectacular or innovative, it does a lot of tried and true concepts but very well. What can I say, the platforming feels good, the art is amazing, the random generation works well, and it's just a nice game to relax and play a bit here or there.

												     Steamworld dig was a strange but fun experience. Its not exactly a 2D platformer, because the precision and combat that take place take a backseat to a slower thoughtful game. The player must descend into the earth (hence ""Dig""), but the route must be strategic so that one can explore the cave, reach resources, and most critically, not carelessly dig oneself into a grave.     The planning and excavation feels pleasantly fresh, but can often lead to frustration for those as impatient as myself when you realize you've gone too far, and may never be able to reach that critical resource beyond the reach of your pickaxe. On the other hand, it does make thoroughness feel all the more rewarding, especially considering that a majority of the upgrades have meaningful impacts on how you play the game and what you can accomplish.      It isn't a game that I could binge, but all its clever ideas deserve to be appreciated between the aliens we've been gunning down for decades.			"

												PROS:  This game has a good rewards system and sometimes you may feel surprised because of the enemies that come out of the rocks. Also I like the Drill! The drill helps you drill through rock faster and get where you need to go, it's a great power up in the game. Also this game carries alot of upgrades for your Pick Ax, Water Supply and much more. This is a good game for casual and serious gamers. The gameplay looks nice and cartoony. It also has few NPC's which could be a bad thing but it allows them to stand out and become a big part of the game. CONS: This game is short, more content would of been nice. It is also hard to know what to do next if there isn't a big red dot on the map. The upgrades in the game could of gotten more use but was neglected. After you beat the game, it is quite bland and unrewarding. Money is scares and can't be brought back which is intresting but hard when you know you need big upgrades for the Final Boss.INCONCLUSION: This game is nice but very short and would be better with more content. This game is for you if you want a nice story with decent gameplay. This game isn't for you if you want a long story and don't like limited use of upgrades.7.3/10			"

												Ok so full disclosure I haven't played this game fully on steam but have recently purchased on xbox and racked up about 15 hours on xbox which should go to show you how great this game. Overall your playing as a robot with other robots trying to revive a town and find what your uncle was working on. Overall the story gets lost really. All you need to know is that you dig and along the way you pick up some sci fi powerups your uncle found and try to figure what is buried down there. In reality if you got the mineral radar before hand this game would be signifigantly shorter as there are only 3 worlds and is my one big complaint about this game because it is so fun I wanted to keep on playing but seeing as this developer only has one game I hope the capital they gain from this game will allow them to make longer games in the future. Overall the mining is where it is at as you can dig side to sidse or down but you gotta be careful because you can't dig upwards easily or at all in some places if you screw up and you can't get the exact angle. You carry a latern which goes by 60 second intervals so you gotta refill it by going to the surface and you can only carry so many minerals. Refilling your minerals will give you money to buy upgrades and passing certain thresholds allows more people to come to town and purchase better upgrade.  Again this game would be a lot shorter and I think the developer realized the mineral radar at the very end. You are given a mini map but your not able to view the whole thing only what your currently right by which can be annoying but it does shows you entrances to places. Honestly for a first game this is very good and definitly worth your purchase. What I hope to see the developer do is expand on this for a possible sequel. Its much like the first portal its very short and leaves you wanting more.  My only other word of caution to the developer is that because minerals don't respawn the only way to heal yourself is money or by farming enemies which can be tedious and dying doesn't refill your health fully. Granted they give you a wide burth but still.  I would pick this up on sale its well worth it			"

												SteamWorld Dig has been good fun to play, the mechanics are simple to pick up and the gameplay is enjoyable.Played through the story in two sittings so kept my attention for a couple of hours at a time and realistically you're looking at between 3-5 hours on story depending on how quick you want to run and how thorough. Quite a short game if you're more prone to running through games for story but if you're an acheivement hunter there's a batch there that will extend the gameplay time. One of the downsides I found is that acheivements were bugged and quite a lot of mine didn't register whether that's the game or a steam server issue is debatable but not a big deal for me.I would suggest picking it up when it's on sale rather than the full price as I feel it doesn't have the replayability that some other games have. But overall had fun for the £5 I paid.			"

												I'll say that I like robots and that I like the wild west. It has both so I can't complain. Steamworld Dig is a great mining game with several influences such as Terarria, Megaman and Metroid. You play as Rusty who has inherited an old mine from his uncle. The main objective is to mine, collect ores, sell them and reach for the bottem of the mine. It was originally released on 3DS and the game is quite appealing to the eye, they managed to add quite a bit of colour for a mining game which is nice. The music is decent but I wouldn't say catchy. It more melds right into the game which is great as it adds to the game. The mining in the game is all about risk versus reward and it is done quite superbly.Overall I give it 8.5/10 Its fun, looks great and you can play the game in your own pace. If you're not a big fan of games like Minecraft or Terraria, you should at least give this a go because (for people like me) it has a story and an ending plus the game has a bit to offer.			"

												In short, metroid meets terraria. This is a game about exploration, puzzles and mining. To be honest it is quite a mediocre experience. Though hardcore mining fans find it addictive. It is certainly not for my taste, but perhaps for your's?On a side note. Game had problems detecting my xbox 360 controller. This is easily solved by downloading certain software. Though if you prefer to play it with keyboard & mouse. I'm certain you will not find the default key bindings enjoyable. Fully customizable key mapping is also missing in the game options meniu. Feels like devs are a bunch of console plebs who never played PC games before. Though you can fix the controls by navigating to %User%/Documents/My games/SteamWorld Dig/Controls.			"

You will recieve upgrades tech throughout the game by finding them in the mine as well as buying them with what you find in the mine. Delve deep and find out the mystery.PositiveThe game has very solid pacing. The atmosphere is unique and keeps you interested. The gems you dig up change as you progress. The characters may only speak in text but they are illustrated in a way where you can make it up accents by looking at them. The upgrades come in constantly which is a good thing.NegativeThe game wears thin so it is actually a good thing that it is only about 3.5 hours long. With more enemies and crazier upgrades the game could have been longer, but the real issue is the digging element itself wears thin. The story exists only to progress the game.ConclusionSteamWorld Dig is a solid metroidvania title that you'll enjoy until the end. That end will come rather soon, but it ends when it should. The game is from an unknown so they did a great job for there first game.ValueI got the game in a bundle, but I'd feel solid saying you wouldn't regret paying $3.50 for it at all.			"

												SteamWorld Dig is a nice refreshing little indie platformer.  I easily sunk in a little chunk of hours in completing this game.  I honestly don't see too much of a replay value other than trying to mop up missed achievements or something, as I'm pretty sure nothing changes the second time around, however it is certainly worth the cost for a go at it.  The controls are easy to get the hang of and very responsive and the graphics are very surprisingly pleasing to the eye and the story is fairly interesting.

												A fun little metroidvania action/mining game. However, unlike most mining games the world is finite and not procedurally generated, and the game itself is rather short and can be easily completed in one sitting. That said, the game is a lot of fun to play with the various upgrades and mining mechanics, and is very well done and well polished game. Despite the lack of a procedural world, the game still has a fair bit of replayablity due to the flexibility of the mining system and the ability to buy upgrades in different orders.Definitely a game to consider if you're a fan of metroidvania or mining games (although it tends a bit more on the metroidvania side with the amount of combat). Recommended.			"

												Great indie game! Ain't boring, as I thought at first look. The game has good exploration feature - brings new level genres/themes over time, new monsters, new upgrades, items, skills... A lot of indie adventure/platformer games lack such a good exploration. "

												Excellent game and great concept. Just wish it was longer. They should have added a few areas to have fun in once you got all the powerups. You can get everything in 4 hours. Got it on sale and was well worth it. Wouldn't pay more though, since it doesn't have much replay value.			"

												A little on the short side, but every aspect of the game was very well executed.  So rather than list all the pros and cons, I'll just say it is a great engaging game that has all the polish of a non indie game.  I only got frustrated by the lantern aspect, but the rest was great.  Who knew digging could be so fun? Highly recommended.  9/10			"

												Fun platforming in a quirky, charming setting. Easy to pick up, but hard to put down--at least for a few hours, at which point you'll have finished the game. However, I would rather have a good short game with no filler, like this one, than one that seems padded with useless content just for the sake of making it longer.			"

												Steamworld Dig is a small jewel I enjoyed more and more the deeper I digged. You start as a young robot with a small pick-axe in your dead uncle's mine and you can almost only go down. Then improvements come with the minerals you collect and the digging-fever begins.I enjoyed the curve of adapting to its core gameplay, which is digging wisely, collecting a lot, solve some nice puzzles and knowing how to return to your dead body.The atmosphere and art style of Steamworld Dig is really beautiful. I wished Tumbleton was larger and could explore more caves. After finishing the game I just bought Steamworld Heist, I want more!*I've nominated this game in the Steam Awards*			"

												Definitely a very fun combination of resource collection, character improvement and platforming mechanics. It'd be nice if it was a bit longer or had a New Game+ of some sort, because it was difficult to find an incentive to play a second time, but for the few hours that you do play it it's very enjoyable.

 I recommend this game immensely. first playthrough 8 hours, Second playthrough 4 hours. All of a sudden I'm playing to get the master prospector achievement which I did get. This is the only game that really had me coming back to beat my highscore. The Master Prospector achievement is -   Beat the game in less than 2 and a half hours   Make $20,000 Dollars or more   Collecting 150 or more orbs  You can only die once Getting this achievement was really frustaring but well worth it in the end. I don't know if it's the collecting ore, upgrading and digging but this game had me hooked. This game made me want to %100 the game and I accomplished that. You should get this game honestly the best $11 I have spent for the most fun. "
