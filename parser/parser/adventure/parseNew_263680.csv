												This is the worst game I've ever played and I highly recommend it. It's up there with Ride to Hell Retribution in terms of hilarious incompetence and misery. It's one of those unique experiences that are so bad that you just have to see it for yourself.You owe it to yourself to suffer and laugh through this game.			"

												UPDATE: Here is a full play through for the game done by me. I went through it a second time for you guys.

First and foremost I would like to say that their are a lot of people bashing it just based on what they read from Metacritic, without actually owning or purchasing the game. I have in fact purchased and played through the entire game already. In short I can't recommend it as it is the shortest story driven game I have ever played (1 hour to complete going slowly). Here are my basic points and review of the game. The pros:- The story, while your two main characters are a bit weird (brother and sister), has some potential. Sort of Indiana Jones'ish.- The environment looks pretty decent for a $5 title. Recently Indie games have been scaling back the graphics to focus on gameplay, this actually has some pretty decent looking areas.- It is fully voiced in English and Arabic.The cons: - Short! The game is super short. It took me about a hour or so to complete and I could have done it a lot faster. 1 tutorial level, 1 full exploration level, 1 short vehicle combat level, 1 walk around level, 1 quick chase event, and 1 driving event.- Weird movement issues at points. I would try to interact with a ladder to go down and it would jump me in the air and climb up something that wasn't there.- AI is dumb. I would shoot someone with a SMG and their buddy a couple feet away would still be walking patrol saying something like ""I know he's around somewhere"". Also some other nuances like ""Cover me, I'm reloading"" when no shots were fired.- The melee combat is awful.- The driving sequence has you driving around Moroco, but the city just loops around. You will drive through the same streets no matter how you progress.Would I recommend it? Not really. The game has some glaring issues with it, in many cases to the point of them being comical. However I am curious what they are going to do with the next few episodes. I don't regret the purchase if for anything will make for a good playthrough video. It is a $5 USD game for let's say 1 hour of campaign. There is a survival mode that I unlocked after completing it, but I could take or leave that. The price point is so low that you might want to pick it up just to see what it's about, but you aren't going to miss anything groundbreaking if you don't. Plus it is probably the shortest campaign driven story game that I have ever played.			"

												Many people would try to tell you that Unearthed: Trail of Ibn Battuta is a poor man's Uncharted, when it's clearly the other way around. My friend and I discovered after playing through the whole game that what we have here is clearly the better experience. For example:Uncharted had Nolan North. Unearthed has Troy Baker. Which one of these voice actors won GOTY last year? That's what I thought.Unearthed: 1 Uncharted: 0Unearthed runs at 60 FPS at 1080p. Uncharted only runs at 720p at 30 FPS. Basic math tells us that since the frame buffer has roughly 4 times as many pixels and twice as many frames, Unearthed is at least 8 times better looking than Uncharted.Unearthed: 9 Uncharted: 0Uncharted 3 had horses. Unearthed has 4 wheel ATVs. That's 4 more wheels than Uncharted lets you ride.Unearthed: 13 Uncharted: 0Uncharted only runs on the PS3, while Unearthed runs on Android, PC, Mac, and probably the Gizmondo.Unearthed: 17 Uncharted: 0Uncharted only has creepy slippery Nazis. Unearthed has full on zombies, and it doesn't need to explain why they're there.Unearthed: 18 Uncharted: 0Uncharted usually only gives you a few weapons to choose from at any time. Unearthed has more weapon types than there are enemies in the entire campaign.Unearthed: 19 Uncharted: 0Nathan Drake is a ♥♥♥♥♥ who gets scared and emotional when the going gets tough. Faris Jawad doesn't stop cracking jokes even when a gun is fired at his sister.Unearthed: 20 Uncharted: 0Finally, as Unearthed rightfully points out on the store page, this game has been translated into more languages than most best-selling literature will ever see, because Semaphore knows everyone will want to play this and wants to be culturally sensitive to everyone. Uncharted consists of playing a white guy shooting minorities. I think we know who is more socially responsible.Unearthed: 41 Uncharted: RacismWinner: UnearthedThis is just a summary of all the things that make Unearthed the best. I didn't even go into detail about the leisurely strolls through the city discussing the plot, or the Kafka-esque analysis of the futility of escaping in a car as the city loops around you. There's just too much to this game to pack in one review, and I implore you to check out what may already be the de-facto GOTY of 2014.			"

												While it's refreshing to see a game like this that doesn't feature a burly white American man as the main character, Unearthed: Trail of Ibn Battuta, is unfortunately a very buggy, poorly slapped together game with hilariously bad voice acting, animations and writing. It's nothing more than a mockbuster created to capitalize on the success of the Uncharted series. Even in one of the early cutscenes it's mentioned that the protagonist ""always enjoyed raiding tombs and uncharting mysteries in videogames."" If the game wasn't so broken I may have enjoyed it, but it makes Deadfall Adventures look like ""the Citizen Kane of Video Games"". It's sad because the Unity engine is capable of much, much more.Would only recommend it if you want something to laugh at.			"

												5 minutes in and already dropping down into white endlessness because of clipping errors. Moving is a hassle, left/right movement is not strafing but will turn the character, move him forwards and re-align the camera - no matter what the mouse tells the camera to do. Might be handy on a console, but when you're using a mouse to control the camera view - why build in things that override the player controls? It's really an utter nuisance. Controls can't even be configured. Maybe you'll find it better with a gamepad, but even with a controller there's nothing you could do to avoid ""jump-rolling"" into a wall and dropping into eternity. Doesn't look toooo bad, it's obvious that some work went into this, but to my eyes it's PS2 level, hardly PS3. Not ""current shooter average"".Pigeons sitting under water, enemies staring at walls and shouting lame ""reloading, cover me"" commands into an empty room, showing zero AI at all... Really sorry to be so negative, but it's just not worth the 4€ from my point of view.			"

												Well this is it ladies & gents, the most horrid game I have played in recent years.As soon as the game loads up you will feel the clunky, awkward controls and notice the incredibly bad character animations. The camera can be manually rotated, but it often gets ""caught"" on obstacles. The voice-acting is simply atrocious, and is backed up by an exceptionally poor script. I actually looked forward to ending the lives of the protagonists just to free them from their dull existence. The only thing this game had going for it was that the surround sound (5.1) seemed fairly consistent and some of the background noises such as flies buzzing around bins, were surprisingly good. The music was generic and uninspired though.The story of this game is not fleshed out at all... in fact, it barely exists. The narrative boils down to this: you look for treasure with your sister, but someone else wants that treasure too. That is it.To make matters worse, the game consists of several very short scenes which do not even warrant the title of being ""levels"". They are incredibly linear, and only the first scene (after the intro/tutorial scene) actually consists of any platforming and exploration. One level is simply walking through the market at snail pace without any meaningful conversation between the three people walking together. That level was the most tedious experience I've ever suffered through in gaming.Oh and also there's a pointless zombie survival mode tagged on at the end in which you get placed in a corridor while zombies spawn on either side of you. What... The... Hell?!Who thought slapping that in would make this game any better? WHO?The entire game lasted me around 90 minutes for me to 100% it (story, achievements, and a go at zombies)I cannot describe how bad Unearthed is in a review, so I will summarise with this: please do not waste your money on it.I did not waste my money on this; luckily (or unluckily) I won it for free.

												So where do I start? Being one of the very few games developed and (sorta) released from the Arab world, playing this game was akin to watching your one year old baby attempt to walk, but ends up falling down six flights of stairs. This sums up my experience with the game.Semaphore apparently had the budget and drive to create this project, but their weakness shines in the flimsy storyline (which inexplicably ties itself to a documentary about the legendary scholar Ibn Battuta) while aping gameplay elements from far superior games like Uncharted and Tomb Raider. The entire thing feels like a hastily cobbled fan project that attempts to check all the familiar game mechanic tropes: chase sequence, fire fights, platforming, remote controlled gadget, fist fighting and NOT polishing or nailing any of them. The vocals are OK, although the Arabic version suffers from some badly recorded lines, while the music is fairly decent and serviceable. The most impressive aspect of the game is the wide selection of available languages, I wish more games triple A games do that.Overall, I hope that Semaphore would use this offering as a learning experience and continue growing their skillset in the industry, as there are tons of interesting and ORIGINAL stories to tell from the Middle East (that does not necessarily involve stereotypical tropes), but for a $5 title, this is a low effort, short timed distraction and an easy +1 to your 100% game count. 2/5			"

												Despite the fact that Unearthed: Trail of Ibn Battuta - Episode 1 has some development potential, I can't recommend it in its current state, since it has many flaws.The first problem I had was dealing with the wacky controls. I played it with mouse and keyboard, and there were movement issues at various places, as well as scenes in which the camera was stuck in some weird position (I was unable to move it with the mouse). Being a console ported game, I expected it to be easier with a controller, but watching someone else play it with a pad and seeing that he had the same issues as me made me realise that these are in fact serious programming errors.Secondly, this game wants to be a mixture of adventure, puzzle, TPS and fighting games. However, it fails miserably at any of that. The story is too simplistic to be qualified as an adventure game, the puzzles are almost non-existent, the TPS scenes excel through how horribly the character models hold their weapons, and the melee fighting scenes are solely painful. On top of that, it offers a survival mode in which you have to fight zombies whose movement physics are utterly silly and who frequently get stuck on pathing nodes in big groups, unable to reach you even though you are standing right next to them.Thirdly, the story itself is very uninteresting and not in the least entertaining, with some very forced humor.The only thing I liked about this game was the nice Egyptian setting from the first episode - but this is only a subjective perspective, since I am a great fan of the Egyptian culture.It's also really easy to obtain 100% of the achievements - it only takes 1 hour. Any more time spent with it would have left me with irreversible damage.More reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page "

												The game has potential. It’s pretty, and the story is assassin’s creed like.The biggest problem with this game I thought was the controls. I just never felt that its fluid enough in both keyboard and Xbox controller. I give it 5/10The developer also jammed every game style they could in the game. You have tomb exploration, driving, FPS, chasing bad guys on rooftops, melee fighting, and shooting from moving vehicles. It felt like each scene was from a different game genre. There's even a Zombie survival mode you can unlock that has nothing to do with the game!!! There are game extras that are tied to finishing the game in different difficulty. I barely got myself to finish it once, and had no intentions of replaying it just for extras eventhough I liked the unclocked extras. Over ambitious for a first release.Technical glitches got to me like the room with randomly dropping boulders. One got stuck and a whole bunch of boulders started pooling behind the stuck rock. It’s never a good idea to leave levels like this to pure physics engine, there has to be a sequence. The car driving scene in morocco, the car was all over the place and got stuck on a post. The roads were too empty and didn’t feel like there’s a purpose for driving even when got surrounded by three police cars I was still able to drive on and push one out of my way.  I wished they’d focus on the controls this way we could enjoy the game and appreciate the levels.Every time I saw the loading screen I wished it would say “to be continued” and end because I did not enjoy the controls, but at the same time I wanted to see what will happen next because I’m curious.I like the localization and having both English and Arabic spoken. The English voice acting was better than the Arabic.I hope they get the controls fixed for episode 2			"

												I don't know what I expected. There are a number of things that are wrong in this game. First of all, I had FPS issues so it took me a little longer to get through all the crap. Second, the characters look lifeless and seem to almost creepy. Third, the protagonist is so stiff and slow that it takes more than five times to get through even the easiest trap. And finally, it's really short. You can almost tell that this game was made for the sake of getting profit. Though I have to say, this game does make me want to play Uncharted again.

												I can't really recommend Unearthed to buy for anyone at it's 100% price.  I've got it from a bundle for like 0.2-0.3$ - this is kind of the price I don't mind to spend on games that has the smallest chance to be enjoyable, and honestly I don't really regret it.The game itself  COULD be good. The story supposed to track the Marco Polo of the arab world: Ibn Battuta and find ""something dark, cursed and expensive"". Sadly I can't say what, because the story-videos were so badly constructed, presented and boring that I couldn't bear with them.The game itself, Uncharted Unearthed wants to be so much at the same time....and fails at them.  It wants to be a third-person shooter-platformer treasure-hunter game, but the camera control sucks most of the time. The character sometimes just bounces on certain surfaces, making jumps impredictable and unreliable. Shooting? I used mouse speed 4 (of 10) on chapter one, yet had to change it to 1 in the next chapter, because I was unable to target anyone during the chase - the targetting speed multiplied for some reason.   Shooting itself also quite painful, because enemies use the ""lead rain"" tactic: they'll shower you with bullets even if you're beind a cover, so it's quite hard to get out and shoot back. Also, bad camera settings made me once or twice die in enemy gunfire because I simply couldn't find where do they shoot from.Third person fighting scenes. Just plain horrible. Glitchy, bad camera system, no combos... simply pointless.Dirving part: endless city with repeated ""unique"" buildings. Also, I have to mention this: during driving the old man said "" Where did you get your driver's license, young man?"" then in the next cutscene the old man was driving! Sooo... some consistency issues.Good parts:You can get it for beans if bundled (probably will be again and again)Really easy to 100% (1-2 hours pure gameplay time)Definitely recommentded for achievement hunters, but only at or below 1$. If you're not intrested in achievements, skip this game. It has little to no story, it's only a prologue.			"

												""Oh look guys, it's Timothy writing a review for that one game everyone on youtube makes fun of! I can't wait until he tears it a new ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, because he's a cynical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and that's what cynical people do!""If this was your reaction when you noticed this review, then I'm sorry to tell you that I will not write a funny 9/11 Allahu Akbar type of review. I respect the dev team, who put a lot of work and effort in this game, too much for that. Well yeah, this game is inspired by Uncharted, Tomb Raider, what not, they won't deny that. But at least they are enthusiastic about it. What's the last time you saw people this happy about making a game? Even if the game is buggy (and oh, trust me, it is, I'll elaborate) I still had fun playing it simply because I know the devs had fun making it. They really want to make an amazing adventure series where you explore the arabic world and its many fascinating places (which it truly has, no doubt about that). The dev team knows that they're not making GOTYAY material and doesn't say they are. They try to stay positive while everyone on the internet's too busy making fun of them and their ""worst game ever"" (a title that many other games I've played deserve more). They respond nicely to often assholish or 'funny' behaviour and criticism, which I think is something most developers can learn from. So yeah, kuddos for that, guys.Now for the game itself. I'll give you a quick rundown of what I enjoyed and what I thought could use improvement.Good:The world: as mentioned earlier, the arabic world and culture and its interesting treasures is often overlooked because 'muh terrorism'. A shame, really, since some of the world's most amazing buildings and sculptures were made by arabians..The characters: I appreciate the duo being brother and sister instead of a shoe-horned love interest. While it felt a little awkward sometimes, there's still some awws and ohs to be had when Faris and Dania talk about Dania's obesity problem and how her choice of tea could help her.Music and sound:  music was pretty solid, I like the ""old man singing"" that's often found in arabic music and this game had plenty of it. Voice acting was decent and so was the sound design, although some guns sound a little weak.Story: the campaign has an interesting premise and it's nice to know that the main character and his female sidekick won't end up banging each other by the end of the game (right Semaphore? RIGHT?)Survival: I really liked the survival mode. I didn't expect there to be zombies or mummies, but I sure enjoyed killing them, although it's a little buggy, sometimes, and it'd be nice if weapons/power ups would disappear after a while so the floor doesn't look like the surface of a giant disco ball.Bad:Controls: while they are much better than on the console version, there's still much left to be desired. It's also a bit of a shame that you can't map any buttons yourself for the keyboard controls.Bugs: there are still a lot of bugs in this game. Both in graphic (the background in the desert chase level would have really weird chancing colours and stuff, weird shadows or character models that stretch out to disturbing levels) and sound (the MP5's firing sound would sometimes disappear in long burst fire, lines of dialogue that aren't heard, random bits of sound that disappear, etc).Combat in general: the boxing/CQC feels kind of awkward and stiff and gunfights are way too easy thanks to dumb AI and insanely accurate weapons with little recoil (AK2stronk). The 'stealth' in the tomb wasn't anything special either, but it did the job, I suppose. My major complaint is that all guns kind of feel the same. Sure, you have your pistols (which kind of feel the same) and the shotgun, but besides that, the three rifles (G36C, M16 variant and AK) and submachineguns (MAC 1, Mini Uzi and MP5) all kind of feel the same. Try to give them more damage, accuracy or recoil in order to give them ""their own feel"" so each rifle suits a different kind of player. Length: I completed the campaign on hard in one hour and a few minutes. Besides finding the few collectibles and the survival mode, there isn't a lot of gameplay left. Still, I only paid 70 cents for this game and I think that to be a more than fair price.And of course, the fact that the game still doesn't have its own face yet and feels like the arabic attempt at Uncharted. I'm sure the dev team will have a better idea of what direction to persue as time passes by, though.So yeah, in the end, I can't really recommend this game for its quality alone. If you can get it for 2 EUR or cheaper, though, then give it a try and have some fun with the campaign, silly bugs and survival mode. I wish Semaphore all the best and hope that they can make Unearthed a solid and fun gaming series.			"

												The game is really really bad and should be avoided by everyone, doesn't matter if you like puzzles or shotting or whatever, this game is not worth your time.So lets start witht he PROS:- Nothing (Except that the game is so short that you wont have to suffer for that long)Cons:- Mechanics are terrible and are so outdated that you can easily find better from games in the last century.- Shooting in game is god awefull, driving in the game i horrible.- The game tries to do melee fight which is dreadfull and some of the worst you will see.- Puzzles? what puzzles?- Voice Acting is bad.- Animations is terrible- The game is so slowThe last part of the game is so painfull to play since you basically just walk behind 2 people until the chapter is done.Oh and when i say walk then i dont mean the same speed you walk when you go slowly on the street, but more like a snail going through the city.Even at the end they try to get you excited for Episode 2 (hopefully it never comes) with a trailer.The fun part is the trailer is not about the game itself but just some random pictures taken of places outside and the put together, and then some added voice acting about stuff that might happen in next episode. Which just makes the company look more ridiculous, because they most likely didn't even start on the second episode whent hey made the trailer.Conclusion:Don't listen to people that tell you to support the devs buy buying the game, cheap or not, the game is not worth a cent in my opinion.Your money is better spent on something else or spent on supporting someone who actually deserves getting supported			"

												A game that feels like they tried to do Uncharted on a minimum budget and with limited abilities and talent for the creation of it. It has awkward controls and flaws all over the place, all from subpar voice-acting to really odd animations and sound. Really cant recommend it in any way other then a quick 100% (but will be a painful one).All but one achievement are for simply progressing through the games short chapters. The remaining one is for collecting seven different items hidden in the game and recommend having a guide handy for that as they are easy to miss and knowing where to look saving you a lot of pain.Recommend this one:

												I knew it would be bad the moment I saw the first cutscene. The character models have zero expression, their VA's have zero emotion, the subtitles are almost entirely unpunctuated, the animation is frankly hilarious in its ineptitude, the difficulty is nonexistent on Normal mode, the ""hints"" directly tell you what you're supposed to do (effectively turning it into a hand-holding ""you suck"" button), and the game threw a fit when I tried to return to the menu.Sure, it's good for a laugh, but there's no actual redeeming quality to be found other than unintentional hilarity. Don't go into this unless you're actively trying to find a bad game to play. In the meantime, I'll need to have a chat with the friend who gifted this to me.			"

												This game sucks. 0/10 Do you know uncharted? Play that one on Playstation.I tried my best not to consider is game as a poor copy of that one, but I was wrong, unearthed is far from being uncharted. Calling that a poor copy is a compliment.If uncharted is so-called masterpiece (I haven't played that one). Unearthed is nothing but a piece of-Bad controls, barely acceptabe graphics, horrible mechanics.Not to mention characters movements which is far from flexible.Voice acting is ok, I think.According to the store page,Minimum: OS: Windows 7 or 8 Processor: 2.0 GHz Dual Core processor Memory: 2 GB RAM Graphics: Intel® HD Graphics 4000 DirectX: Version 9.0c Hard Drive: 9 GB available space Sound Card: DirectX CompatibleIts minimum video card requirement is HD Graphics 4000But I run the game with that under 10 FPSIs that even playable?

It makes Adam's Venture look good.con, con, con:- puzzle element lasted for less than 10 minutes- the puzzles pretty much mock your intelligence- the game is 80% combat and it's basically the same thing for most of the game (you shoot people, you punch/kick people)- you are forced to endure a walking scenario where you all just blabber away (why couldn't this be a skippable cutscene like the rest?)- what in the actual fluff?

												This game is just sooo bad! LOLZ! The controls aren't very fluid, they work but feel uncomfortable though the entire game. AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Animation loops make hands and heads derp out while watching cutseens. It's extremely short, the game has 7 chapters each chapter can be completed between 2 and 10 minutes. The story only had me slightly interested, and most of it was ""ugh""... predictable. The game was sappost to be a series of episodes which I think they gave up on and wont ever release. Unfortunally I will quickly forget that I ever even played this game. The only thing that I actually liked was the backdrops and environment detail, it was very pretty to walk though the streets and temples but each zone is so small that I guess they actually had time to make it look good.

												Played this game and found it A-too short (even for a seperate episode-over before it began) and B-just lacked any kind of polish.Went into this not expecting it to be UNCHARTED and it isnt,but it certainly tries hard to be that other game and fails miserable.The voice overs are your standard affair with no real emmotion to speak of and the graphics are ok for a downloadable title,but when your trying to aim with the gun and shoot at enemies the cross hair is all over the place and far to sensative and when it comes to the sections where you have to climb and jump and grab hold of ledges again it can be a hit and miss affair as to whether you make it sometimes or fall of ledges.I was hoping for something a little longer than this (even at the price it isnt worth it-just my opinion though) and before you know it its all over,now i know this is episode 1 but i dont think i want to play more of this game its just not me and i dont think it will be something that a lot of other people will take to either (will be to some ones taste just not mine)So in closing i would wait if you want to buy it and either get it on sale or get it in a bundle offer (which it will more than likely become part of at some time).

												I am really surprised Sony allowed Naughty Dog to release Uncharted on the PC, maybe as their new PS ONE console is now out?I heard that the first game was a bit rough but Golden Abyss was way more advanced than this. That game had things like good shadows and fire effects that didn't look like they were stolen from an N64 game, controls that actually responded to input, a comprehensible plot and good voice acting. Come to think of it I'm sure they've changed the lead actor. He seems.. different?			"

												Kind of okayish. Despite having janky controls and being really short, I still sort of enjoy it. The combat feels not good at first, but it isn't terrible.I don't really know what to say, but it plays better than the very early Tomb Raider games, but they've got to be coming up on 20 years old at this stage, if they aren't already.There is a bit in the opening of the 2nd level where one of the protagonists refers to the other's affecdtion for 'Raiding Tombs and Uncharting Mysteries', and that really sums up the entire game. They're trying very hard to reference somethign else, but it's done clumsily and without clear comprehension of what it is that they're doing.Also, there are these forced hand to hand combat scenes that are just terrible. The game turns into a 3-button 3D fighting game that boggles the mind. Who would do this?			"

												Unearthed 3 Drake's Deception has been taken to a new level thanks to critically acclaimed gaming company Semaphore. Pulling out another AAA title after Unearthed 2  among thieves, we thought it could not be done, but we were wrong. The PC version, whilst dummed down in some of the features that brought us to the franchise in the first place is still worthy of its AAAAAA price tag. Nate's hair remains immaculate whilst I was left on the edge of by seat with the relationship between him and Arab Elena. The next gen graphics and 236fps means this game will make the older PC chug, but when played on a newer machine the photo-realistic graphics will blow you away. I myself am eagerly awaiting the adventures of Mecca and what will happen with the black box bomb. Also seasoned Unearthed fans will do well to recognize a fan favorite; Sully sneakily disguised as an Arab wizard. You wont believe it when you realize. 11/4 would play Tomb Raider: Trail of Ivan Butttererat again!			"

												Full review: http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/unearthed-trail-of-ibn-battuta-episode-1-game-review/Unearthed: Trail of Ibn Battuta is an episodic action-adventure game that had its first episode recently released onto Steam in the form of the ""Gold Edition"". I played through the entire game in about an hour, and, overall, it felt somewhat similar to a game from Naughty Dog's Uncharted series.Unearthed is a relatively simple game. This is the first episode, so you won't get to see the conclusion to the story anytime soon. There are a few puzzles in the game, most notably in the second chapter (come to think of it, that's the only chapter with any sort of puzzle to it, the rest are combat) and they're really easy to solve. Those few puzzles did not really add to the experience, they were simple ""move this to a pressure plate to extend this bridge""-esque puzzles.The high point of this game, at least for me, was the animation. It was hilariously overdone. The cutscenes had characters waving their arms all over the place and I couldn't help but laugh at how ridiculous it was. This should be a negative, but hey, I haven't seen any animations like this since Saints Row IV (*shiver*). Other than that, the music and graphics were on par, nothing too fantastic, but not bad. The story however, is really dull. I still look forward to the next few episodes though, just so I can know what happens.If I were to recommend this game, I'd recommend it entirely for the laugh you get from the animation quality. Other than that, it's just another episodic action-adventure game.			"

												Unearthed reminded me the Tomb Raider at the first sight. You are a treasure hunter assisted by sister. The first negative about the game is its size. You need to download all 21 languages even if you need only 1. The camera angles are awful. The controls are not so bad but time to time you will experience some difficulties because of the camera. There is a battle system but it'd be better if not. The worst part of the game is the story. I like games with a solid story but Unearthed lacks also in this field. If you've bought it in a bundle or give it a shot. Otherwise it's no worth to spend money.			"

It felt like a bad PS2 game. The game is only about an hour long (I have more time because I went afk during it). And the combat... Its the worst hand to hand combat I've ever experienced in a game. The game ends with a police chase, and its funny because you don't seem to be going faster than 25mph. On the plus side, if you like getting achievements, this is an easy game to get 100% in a very short amount of time.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: SemophorePublishers: SemophoreInitial release: Jan 2014Genre: Action, Adventure#Worth/NotWorth: #Worth Exposition, Concurrence and SummationWho the even heck is Nathan Drake anyways?This game is terrible in all the right places. I would put this one step down from something like Deadly Premonition. The whole 'episode 1' feels like a prologue as its likely supposed too but inevitably it all feels a little like the devs got too ambitious. Its got tomb raiding, cover mechanics, RC cars, platforming, rooftop chases, car chases, a slightly awkward fighting system and a Sci-fi original narrative to boot.Its got jenky animations in all the right places, just watch their hands during the cut-scenes. The shooting is AT BEST functional. Its hard how to put into words why exactly it is I like this game and want to see more (though that's likely not going to happen) Its kind of like a bad movie in the way 'The Room” was; it sort of has this vibe as this is obviously a disaster but I can't look away and simply must see this thru. I am not making a comparison to Dreamfall: The Longest Journey as they are completely different games but I can't help but shake the feeling that this game reminded me of Dreamfall in a way that I'm not entirely sure I can justify. Yet the feeling remains. Some of the dialogue seems hyper aware that it's a videogame which is always fantastic to see. It has also come to my attention that this is some approximation of an iOS version which would explain why there is an option to automate aiming entirely right after choosing new game. Which would explain a lot of the overall jenkiness. But part of that jenkiness is what makes it endearing. THE GISTPick it up when its cheap. Its harmless and I rather enjoyed it.Follow my curation for more "

												Unfortunately, this is not a good game. The controls are sluggish, the camera is horribly unresponsive (leading to several annoying deaths), the levels are thoughtless almost to the point of insult (an entire level of nothing but walking down a street  behind two people? What?!), the story makes no sense (your character is driving a car...but then he's in the backseat...), the fighting sequences (like boxing mini-games) were way more confusing than fun, and...well, if that's not enough to warn you away, I don't know what you're doing anymore.I'm not sure that I've ever intentionally skipped a cut-scene in a game before, but I definitely did for this. If another of these gets made, it will take a lot for me to care.			"

												Pick this one up during a sale (like I did) if you're up for a laugh... at your own expense. Because if it doesn't make you cry first, ""Unearthed: Trail of Ibn Battuta - Episode 1"" should make you laugh... perhaps even both. It's a game that tries to incorporate many elements from many games: shooting, platforming, roaming, puzzle-solving, driving, stealth, car chases, fighting... and more or less fails at each and every one.Note the ""Episode 1"" in the title. This game, as it is, features about an hour of gameplay, give or take 15 minutes. My playtime according to Steam is 72 minutes, and that was playing on Hard. Also note that about a quarter of that time was spent on cutscenes, so very little of actual gameplay remains...Either way, in this short hour ""Unearthed"" will treat you to:- a tutorial level where you will get accustomed with clunky non-rebindable controls, stiff character animations, the game's rudimentary cover-based shooting gameplay, messy hand-to-hand combat events, dodgy voice-acting at best, and finally - the beginnings of an almost non-exstant story which can be summarized as: you search for items other people want, too. Both of which are, by the way, for no apparent reason;- an actual ""Tomb Raider"" like level where you go and explore ancient ruins. Only there are no puzzles, no actual platforming or roaming of any kind. You just kinda go from the start to the finish. Once you get to the finish, you have to get back to the start, only this time the bad guys will shoot at you;- after you get through them you fight a bald guy;- then you shoot bald guy's baddies as your sister drives a quad over the desert, in what is a pretty awful sequence altogether;- then you walk a little in Morocco, following a character that explains the ""story"" to you;- then you chase a guy on the rooftops, before getting into another hand-to-hand fight with him;- then you escape the rooftops;- and then - my favorite! - you are privy to the slowest and most anti-climactic chase sequence ever! You get to drive in circles around a small area of the city, at a snail's pace, ""avoiding"" the police for a fixed amount of time. All the while dramatic orchestral music will play, while you cruise around. It's hilarious, I tell you!- and after all that, you drive off into the sunset, asking yourself whether even that measly 0.80 EUR on sale could've been better spent... hmmmmm...			"

												I really don't suggest this game. While it is very cheap ( don't forget it's only the first episode, ) it is really full of bugs!PROs:-Nostalgic-like gameplay.-Good graphics ( Environements. )CONs:-No clipping.-Poor character graphics.-Poor controls.-While doing certain obstacles you can fall through the world and get stuck.-Very short game.-Bad voice acting.-Passable story.-Bad AI's.-Random camera locks.-Some performance issues on Very High.-The story is to be continued. So you have to purchase a few more of these games to finish the adventure.I'll completing it only for the achievements, but if you are looking for an adventure game to play, I wouldn't suggest this one.

I will hand them all out and tell you why you should be spending money on Ibn Battuta.#1 - You will forever have a good joke to make. ''Hey guys come over and play somee uncharted with me!'' (secretly is unearthed)#2 - Your character is arabic, do I need to say more?#3 - Easy 100%ed game, takes about 30 minutes max.#4 - It has cards!#5 - Allahu AkbarBut yes, it's one of the worst games I ever played and I still make jokes about it now. It's a horrible game but actually should've played it to be able to talk about this with people. If it's in a bundle, get it!			"

												I wanted to love this game; I truly did. For starters, it's Tomb Raider in Egypt: a terrific, if stale, concept. I was also looking forward to playing a non-WASP character for a change. However, so many problems are evident right from the start (even in the tutorial level), that it's almost impossible for me to enjoy.The major problem here is the game's ambition, something which, at first, appears to be an asset. It genre-blends several different play styles into one game: FPS, fighting, and adventure. Unfortunately, it does all of them poorly. The controls are clumsy and slow to respond, particularly in the hand-to-hand combat sections of the game; you may be three moves ahead on your controller/keyboard before the PC actually does anything. And speaking of hand-to-hand, why the h#** would I throw down a perfectly good, loaded weapon, to engage in fisticuffs when I'm near death? I wouldn't. So stop forcing me, game! The mandatory swapping out of weapons is irritating, too. When I'm picking up the same weapon I have in my hand, why not just add to my ammo? Why make me completely swap out? Another fun thing is when grenades turn into unintentional suicidal aids by bouncing off invisible walls that the player can walk through. Insert your own punchline here.On the visual side, the graphics are nothing spectacular and, yet, the game is poorly optimized and just as choppy at 800x600 as it is at higher resolutions. Character models don't blink, ever...although there may be Weeping Angels around that I just haven't found yet. They also use overly grandiose hand gestures like they're fending off a swarm of hornets, and they say things like ""...as your elder sister, I have always been taking care of you like a baby."" Is the PC the dude from Memento, who keeps forgetting he has a sister and needs to be reminded who she is in conversations with her? Weird.Another problem is the hand-holding. When walking into the first area in the game, before you've even had a chance to look around, the player character says, ""This ancient fountain might be the key to progress. Maybe I can get the water flowing again. That might help."" How about letting me figure that out? Otherwise, why am I playing?I wanted to like this. I still do, but the fail is crippling my will to live. It wants to be Tomb Raider, but it controls even worse than that game, which had pretty horrible controls to begin with. It wants to be Counter Strike, but moves like you're playing underwater. And it wants to be Bad Street Brawler, which is just ... wtf?I believe this might be a long lost PS1 game that someone just found and is trying to get running for today's computers. I might be wrong, but it sure feels like I'm not. And the fact that this is only ""Episode 1"" scares me a little. Here's the scariest thing of all: The Steam version is the improved game: Originally posted by Semaphore: [...] My name is Ahmad Jadallah and I am the Director of Development at Semaphore and the Writer and Director of Unearthed. [...] We released Unearthed Episode 1 on PS3 and iOS back in May, 2013. Since then we got a lot of reviews about the game and feedback from actual players. It is no secret that there were a lot of negative opinions about the game, and so we took all that feedback on board and started addressing these issues. The game that we released on Steam today is the Gold Edition of the game which contains over 120 fixes based on the feedback across all gameplay systems.  Holy $#^!I love the ambition and vision, but the game needs some serious patching in order to be playable. Judging from the lack of updates since Jan 22, 2014, this isn't happening any time soon and, so, I have only this left to say: Not Recommended.			"

												I could give this game a negative for the controls response alone. Walking, jumping, kicking and punching all feel like an effort.The camera deserves a special mention too. Forced perspective, wheeling and eventually made me feel a little motion sick.The graphics are not fluid and feel dated. The sound is so-so.This is a very short game with long (skip able) cut scenes.Achievements are easy to get, most story acquired and one object related.Nice mix of scenes and game play and the story is okay.

												Okay, okay, okay....Yeah, this game sucks! I'm not arguing against it. It's horrible. It's garbage. But when you've played the sh** I've played through, Unearthed is hardly a ""bad"" game. The shooting and controls are decent.And... yeah, and that's it.It's obvious what game this is trying to rip off. A five year old could tell what Unearthed is trying to be like. But oddly enough... I can help but saw ""Awwww!"" like seeing a toddler trying to paint their own version of Van Gogh's ""Starry Night"" with some crayons. You just can help but love it and post it on your fridge.The graphics are pretty decent. They look nice and are well-textured. They don't come close to the very obvious game that Unearthed is ripping off, but they aren't the worst graphics I've seen in a game.Okay, yeah. I might as well mention everything that sucks. The animation. The stealth stage. The really easy puzzles. The RC car. The stealth section. The boring walking section. The driving section. The main meat of Unearthed is rotten to a black, squishy mess.But... I feel like the team that made this did put some effort into this game. It runs relatively smoothly. The voice acting is decent. There's tons of details put in to make this game feel ""alive"". It just completely fails and falls flat on its face.I don't know. Maybe my sympathy for Unearthed has spawned from seeing all the people out there make fun of it. Like the chubby kid at the playground you knew from elementary school. Sure he was the easy one to pick on, but he was just an innocent, unknowing kid. So forgive me if I show some pity on this game.Yeah, it still sucks massive a**, though. So... 4/10!			"

												How on Earth did Unearthed even get made?  I'd call this a poor man's tomb raider, but Lara Croft doesnt raid tombs anymore, she just runs around being edgy with a bow these days.  This game looks like what happens when a game is on a tight budget or the budget is done completely wrong.  While the mechanics are solid for climbing all over, most of them are just flat out missing the animations.  The game is easy to pick on dissecting it like an alien autopsy for humorous bits, but its just to easy.  The ideas are nice, tomb raiding, fist-fighting, shooting, a desert race on a quad then a car chase.   If this dev had more money it shows they can be pretty creative.  This IS not even a game.  This is a demo, the game is only 20-30 minutes long, and half of that time is literally walking around, not running, no action your walking through a market.  If the dev made this to show people to get more money, fine, just say that and people will go hey this seems like it would be fun if you get more money.  But it certainly isnt worth over 1$.The game does cliche good from the start, poking fun at how he likes tomb raiding while searching uncharted mysteries to the end where a police car stops in front of him.  He could go around the police, but why do that?  Instead he runs on top of it and jumps off the police car then performs a combat roll.  The creativity is there for this game, the only part missing is the GAME itself since it clocks in at maybe 15 minutes of playtime.  It's def worth a dollar to see what the game is like.  Even with no budget the ideas are here to make an awesome game, better than the latest tomb raider games we get at least which are nothing about raiding tombs being more about her emotional development, a game noone ever wanted.  For what this game does, I hope this dev made alot of money to make the game he wants in the next episodes.  They better not be 20 minutes long!!!! grrrrrrrrrrrr In those 20 minutes I saw more different stuff than I did in the last Tomb Raider game which was more like a COD game than a tomb raiding game.  No crashing, and no gamebreaking bugs, controls work, what it does do, it does well, but none of it looks good.  Even Double Dragon Neon is full of bugs and crashes and they have majillions of dollars, no excuse compared to games like this made at the minimum wage level of gaming that actually at least work letting you play them even if for 20 minutes.Rating:  9/10  Value:  $0.99			"

												So this first installment is about 2 hours and has a variety of types of gameplay, some good some bad.  Unearthed is obviously inspired by Uncharted and has similar gameplay.  The platforming and adventure parts are pretty well done.  The combat is decent for guns but the melee combat is terrible.  The gae has definitely improved with the updates.  The driving part of the game works it just isn't very exciting.  I enjoyed the story and will probably buy the next chapter.  I enjoy episodic games and this one seems to be priced well and gives a decent game.  Keep in mind this is an indie game running on Unity so if AAA games are the only thing you enjoy, steer clear.  If you like indie games and are interested in a good story, pick it up.The card drops are ridiculous, I played the whole game and still only got two cards.  Once the main story is completed a zombie survival mode is unlocked.  Zombies, they are everywhere anymore.			"

												Why on earth people claim this to be anywhere close to the Uncharted series, it is beyond me. There didn't seem a whole lot of point to this game. The most challenging level of the whole game was the tutorial.The story doesn't make a whole lot of sense, I found myself confused at the plot the majority of the time. There is actually an entire level of just following around two people listening to them talk, and even worse is you actually get an achievement for it.The animation of the characters are the most awkward that I have seen in a game for a very long time as well. Going by the fact that the story, from what I worked out, was left as a cliff hanger, and the ""Episode 1"" in the title, means there are going to be more episodes to follow. I hope to god they can pull something a little bit better out of the bag otherwise it's just going to be another flop.Stay clear campers!			"

I can tell the game was made by a small team, while some of the areas actually look pretty neat and are detailed well (the market mostly) it doesn't make up for the poor graphics.The fighting was terrible, by far the dumbest part, the 3 puzzles in the game are terrible and obvious. The rooftop chase scene was boring and easy. The best part of the game was avoiding the traps and laughing at the voice acting.did I mention that it is terribly short, which isn't a bad thing.

												Ok. I am giving this game a thumbs up, even though I would not say it's a good game. Here's why: 1. It's less than £1. 2. You can get 100% achevements in an hour or so. 3. This is the main reason really... Here is a game made where there is no videogame industry to speak of. We're spoilt for choice with the AAA games we have access to and the amazing talented devs in Europe and N. America who give us more than we can ever hope to play even. We've come to expect games to be at a certain level of craftsmanship, even small 'indie' games. It's a multi-billion dollar industryGames from Middle-Eastern countries are a long way behind, for many, many reasons. We need more games from cultural perspectives outside our own. We need to support developers from this fledgeling industry over there that can  give this to us. That reason alone is why you should cough up a quid for this game.			"

From the moment you start the game you can tell it lacks the polish it truly needed, fighting animations are extremely buggy and unfinished..animations in general just look horrible. The graphics environment wise are pretty decent but the character models are ugly, the NPC's around whatever the town was were very bland and lacked decent textures. Gameplay wise, it's just tryin to copy from Uncharted and Tomb Raider but failing miserably. The platforming is a joke and there is little to no freedom in the game..not to mention it is all extremely easy. I managed to finish this in 20 minutes o.o the driving sections had to be the worst.I know I probably sound harsh since the game is only $5 >.> but this game really is horrible, do not waste your money.

												As a fan of the ""Uncharted""-Franchise I took the chance and got this game from a 3€ bundle to see if it's as bad as people claim it to be. It is.Whilst the setting is quite nice, Animations are horrible, models and levels look okay-ish and the english voice acting is average. I guess I could neglect that if at least the gameplay was fun - but it isn't.  In general it feels extremly unpolished and climbing especially tedious. I gave up after roughly 30 minutes since I was continously glitching out of the map. Also the game didn't preserve my settings so I had to set graphics etc. everytime I started it (twice, he).I didn't expect a flawless masterpiece or anything near the quality of an Uncharted game since it seems to be the first game by Semaphore but definitely better than this.

Storyline looks like a very bad political propaganda; graphics and physics look like today is 1998; sound is okay, but the music, script and voice acting are just insanely bad. Gameplay looks extremely boring overall. Seems like the team didn't have a game-design at all. Another version is, the game was made by a group of students in 1 week. At least, I wish it was - in that case, it's okay (beside the fact that I've actually bought it).Anyway, playing this would be a waste of your time, I guarantee it.I'd rate this game 1.0 out of 10.0 (adding 1 just for trying).

												It's not a very good game, but of course, you probably already knew that. It's not as bad as the reviews make it out to be, but that's about it. Poor gameplay mechanics but at least it's got a good backstory with the history of Ibn Battuta.  I was playing in in Arabic, and that's what I would recommend to others because the American voices sound way out of place, but although I'm not fluent in Arabic I do know enough to know that the subtitles didn't match up to the speech sometimes.Oh, and the main character is kind of annoying, he sounds a bit stupid and his sister the smart one. All the problems are pretty much because it was made by people with a very low budget and very little experience.I'm only recommending it because it has something you can learn from, unlike a whole load of other games.

 Unearthed: on the Trail of a Gaming Revolution Seldom does a game come around that challenges our perception of a genre. A game that makes one questions the established definition of what ""entertainment"" really is. A game so magnificent that it transcends our wildest expectations  and leaves us begging for more. Such a game has not graced this earth since Quest 64 - that is - Until now.Unearthed: The trial of Ibne Batoota paves the way for the true Golden Age of gaming. Take on the role of Blake Drake, fabled older brother of Nathan Drake from the Tomb Raider series, as he works to stop the new face of terrorism headed by 3:16 Stone Cold Steven Austin and his group of highly trained robot soldiers. Along the way, Blake, only armed with the power of friendship and his own style of mixed martial arts (and also guns), is as modest as he is kind and decides to collect the missing treasures for his closest friend Ibne Batoota who is very sad. Meanwhile, Blake's sister is kidnapped by Stone Cold's robo-thugs and she might died, but I don't know I haven't finished the game yet.Unearthed controls like a dream. From the stiff movement to the camera that knows what you want better than you do, controlling Blake is as natural as breathing. Coupled with truly next generation MoCap technology and animations that feel more realistic than real life - if it were any more real, it would be real. Often times I found myself pausing the game and looking around the room to double check I was not actually there in the lush deserts of France. Developer Sememaphone really let their innovation show in the games special effects, notably with the motion controlled fire and gorgeous particle effects on the castable spells. The robot guards in-game cloaking devices were so impressive I truly could not tell them from the games backgrounds. Peter Moneylox has really outdone himself this time, and I for one cannot wait until the next installment in the Unearthed series. Truly Unearthed has set the bar for what games can achieve, and it may take years to dethrone this behemoth of a video game. While I am normally against funding terrorism, I cannot suggest enough that you buy this masterpiece.To see Unearthed in action,  please click here to check out my multi-part playthrough of the game!

												REVIEW -- UNCHARTED 4 PC -- REVIEWUncharted 4 takes place immediately after Uncharted 3, we find Nathan Drake in a beautifully rendered cave, the recognisable voice of Troy Baker rings through the air, god I love him...GAMEPLAY - 9/10The gameplay builds upon the nearly perfected action of Uncharted 3, with intense areas where you'll have to carefully navigate over ledges or through caves, it's a graceful and cinematic experience that could please anybody.STORY - 8/10I hate to find a fault in this game, but sadly I have to say that the story isn't quite as good as Uncharted 2 or 3...My main gripe is simply the fact that Nathan Drake now has a sister, who I don't quite remember from the last games, and it seems that her only purpose is to become kidnapped. As well as this, he now has an uncle (I think? It was hard to remember) that only serves to tell the story, and if anything becomes a bit of a deus ex machina.OVERALL - 9/10Overall, this game is amazing, a very well deserved sequel to Uncharted 3, and I'm just so happy it came out on PC. The only thing keeping this from being a 10/10 is the cliffhanger at the end, I have been kept in suspense since I finished and I just want Uncharted 5 already.			"

												The first problem I had with Unearthed: Trail of Ibn Battuta - Episode 1 was dealing with the clunky controls. Being a console ported game, I expected it to control well with a controller, but it doesn't. It controls worse with K/M and I soon realized that these issues are in fact serious programming errors. This game wants to be a mixture of adventure, puzzle, TPS and fighting games, failing miserably at all these genres. The ""story"" is unengaging and boring, the puzzles are sparse, the shooting/aiming is atrocious and the hand to hand fighting is painfully pathetic. A couple of positives; some of textures and lighting effects are well done, the enviroments look good, and its easy to get 100% of the achievements. If more time had been spent on game mechanics, it would have been a pretty decent game. It only takes around 1 hour or so to complete the game, I accidently left it idle. I've played worse games than this, but its not worth anymore than a buck. 5/10			"

												Contrary to most of the reviews that have been posted about this game, I would actually say that this is a near-masterpiece. There are certain elements in which the game falls down on, but most of its pros outweigh the cons.Let's just take a glance at the OST of Unearthed - it is very fitting to the scenarios which this game depicts, and it provides some atmosphere to the incredibly well-designed levels. Whoever composed the soundtrack deserves an award, at the minimum.The level design is something that should be appreciated as well; never before have I been lost and absolutely clueless with where to go, and that is just an indicator of well thought out level design, better than Elder Scrolls and Legend of Zelda dungeons. If an indie game can be compared to an AAA spectacle, then it definitely should deserve some praise.In terms of the lore, this game excels in story telling. You thought that the Souls series has a convoluted, ""see it your way"" experience? Well, think again! Unearthed: Trail of Ibn Battuta delves into some extremely deep, multi-layered lore, and every word that is stated definitely had some intentionality on the developer's part. It throws in some completely irrelevant historical figures as well, which adds into the cleverly designed lore. And man, the voice acting. Mother of god, the voice acting is phenomenal. Coupled with the amazing character animations/models, this package delivers an insanely good dramatical experience. Every word is synched in with the lip movement, which adds into the immersion which this game has. You can actually opt between either the English or Arabic voice acting. Of course, since this game is to do with the Middle-Eastern/African culture, I would say that playing this game with the Arabic voice acting will provide the best results.Most importantly, however, the gameplay itself is unique. It is nice to see the action-platformer genre mixed in with walking simulation and third person shooting. The CQC combat is incredibly fun and rewarding, requiring precise reactions and input. Most games these days manifests hand-to-hand combat in the form of a glorified quick-time event, but I can reassure you that this game doesn't fall down the same trap. Did I mention the gunplay, by the way? It's brilliant. The gun models look realistic and the firing animations + damage are commendable.Seriously, this game gets my highest honour.  10/10 Oh yeah, Dania is my new waifu <3/s			"

												They keep saying that this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥because of ugly collisions, gameplay, animations, story, blah blah.To me this game is kind of an achievement on its own, mostly because of the developers who were able not only to release a game like this but also to fix it to make it decent enough.Yes, the combat is wonky as hell, firefight and platforming itself are meh, but decent enough already and the car chase part it's just as clunky if not worse than the fistfight, the animation is still kind of subpar, but it's glorious compared to the unpatched version (just watch the cutscenes to have an idea of the amazing improvement of them).All in all, it's a game worth the dollar I paid for it, and for the hour and a half it lasts, it was quite fun, and again, even better when you think about the background of how this game was conceived.That's a lot more to say than the ♥♥♥♥ing piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥this game is supposed to be ""ripping off"".I'd rather play this game a million times than playing that awful mess of a ""AAA"" game (what a ♥♥♥♥ing joke), or any ♥♥♥♥ing turd those untalented, overrated hacks at Naughty Dog are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ out of their asses while being the ♥♥♥♥♥es of Sony and their ♥♥♥♥ing god-awful current consoles (and I'm saying this even though two of my favorite consoles ever are the PS1 and the PS2).

												I've never seen a game get so many things wrong.  The only semi-positive thing I can say about this game is that the voice acting is only moderately awful.  The gunplay, physics, level design, pacing and overall gameplay are some of the worst I've seen in a modern era game.  The game does not have a spec of original thinking in it.  The story, characters, and even the name of the game are ripped off from Uncharted.  They've also added a zombie survival mode, which makes no sense what so ever.  The survival mode is practically broken anyway since there is no headshot detection and unless you have a shotgun the zombies take 5 to 10 bullets apiece to kill.  This game is not one of those ""it's so bad it's good"" type of games, it just plain bad.  Its only saving grace is that it will only waste an hour of your life to play through.			"

												THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE WORST GAMES EVER MADE!!!!!!!!  And I will let you know why.  1. The graphics are awful.  The graphics in this game look like a Sega CD game ported to the PS2.  Textures don't load at all for most parts of the game.   All of the characters look like they are floating above the ground.  2.  The controls are BROKEN BEYOND BELIEF!!!!  Not only do you float a good 2 inches above the ground but picking up items can be impossible.  You can puss the pick up button all you like but it only works less then hafe the time.  On occasionally you must fight a person in hand-to-hand combat.  There no helth bars, no indication if you or the bad guy are doing any damage to one another and the fighting is so clunky that the game won't read your moves AT ALL!  The bad guy can block just fine but if you block, then they can just punch right though your bloch and land a hit.  That is Crap!!!  And lastly about the bad controls, the driving stage has to be... THE MOST BROKEN, FLOATY, ASSBACKWARDS, RIDICULOUS, TERRIBLE EXCUSE FOR DRIVING IN A GAME SINCE THE CREATION OF MANKIND!!!  During this stage, you are being chased by the police (which make no sense because they have no reson to chase you; if you play the game you'll see way)  The car floats above the road and the brakes can send you spinning in to a 360 spin, which accomplishes nothing! Oh and the police dont even attempt to stop you they just SIT THERE!!!  And you can't make a tern with out crashing in to a wall.  And lasty 3.  The voice acting, oh GOD! is it bad.  The main characters are supposed to be middle eastern but talk like they are from Beverly Hills!  And for some reson when ever they talk, they flail their arms around like a mad man.Now as for the plot, it can be summed up in two words ""Generic Crap!!!""   I can honestly say that I thin more time, patients and talent went into making a Nintendo Virtual boy game then this one!!!To the developers of this game I just have to say this;  Go home, sit down and rethink you're careers.  It's clear that making games is not you thing.  Maybe working at Taco Bell might be beast.			"

												Umm I dunno where to start with this...I'd like to say it was an interesting little game to play but the control of the camera felt stiff. The story was okay for a developers first game but it did feel like I was playing an early, and I mean very early version of the Uncharted Series. No offense to the developers, Semaphore, it was a nice little go. I just don't see myself playing this or in that case buying the next installment to find out what happens. I would recommend this game to a few mates but overall I think I'll stick to my 30fps and 720p textures of Uncharted. Unearthed didn't feel like it had the 1080p/60fps feel to it. If you can spare the fast food meal go ahead but there are other games I rather play through than to play this again. Great first piece, I just don’t see myself playing Episode 2.Voiceovers were fine just the limited animation of the models threw me off. Other than that good luck Semaphore I hope you improve on what you have here.			"

												I played this game for about 20 minutes before I gave up on it.  It is slow, boring, and just plain not fun to play.  While I would normally say this is usually due to a game just not being my style, I love adventure games.One major problem here is that the shooting mechanics are awful.  They're worse than awful.  You have no feedback that you're actually hitting a person, can only hold one gun so when you have to always swap with weapons on the ground.  You get no feedback before swapping weapons what the weapon on the ground is and the cover mechanic is overly sticky and very difficult to use.The other side of adventure games is traversing the environment.  This is equally frustrating by an odd mix of free camera and fixed camera areas including places where the camera is free but can't possibly get to an angle to give you a good view of what you're doing.  I gave up when I died because I couldn't look down and see the edge of a cliff so I ended up just falling to my death!The game needs a lot of polish work to become passable and even more work to be anything close to fun.

												I really want to finish this game, because I like the story and the idea, but I'm not sure that I can. It is really badly made! Because of that it is annoyingly difficult to finish some challenges that should be easy. If the lousy controls and game mechanics doesn't kill you, the camera will. If you're okay with this, get it, if not, don't!			"

												This game is a total joke, but I can't say that is a bad thing. Il be honest, I enjoyed to play this game with friends when they were over just for a laugh, like watching a dumb horror movie. The glitches and animations are quite hilarious. I finished it in about an hourbut it does offer a ""zombie"" mode for those who wish to venture into it. I can't reccommend this game to people who are looking for a legitamate game, but I can reccomend it to people who are looking for something related to the reasons above, for that, I did not mind the 5 dollar price tag.

												They keep saying that this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥because of ugly collisions, gameplay, animations, story, blah blah.To me this game is kind of an achievement on its own, mostly because of the developers who were able not only to release a game like this but also to fix it to make it decent enough.Yes, the combat is wonky as hell, firefight and platforming itself are meh, but decent enough already and the car chase part it's just as clunky if not worse than the fistfight, the animation is still kind of subpar, but it's glorious compared to the unpatched version (just watch the cutscenes to have an idea of the amazing improvement of them).All in all, it's a game worth the dollar I paid for it, and for the hour and a half it lasts, it was quite fun, and again, even better when you think about the background of how this game was conceived.That's a lot more to say than the ♥♥♥♥ing piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥this game is supposed to be ""ripping off"".I'd rather play this game a million times than playing that awful mess of a ""AAA"" game (what a ♥♥♥♥ing joke), or any ♥♥♥♥ing turd those untalented, overrated hacks at Naughty Dog are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ out of their asses while being the ♥♥♥♥♥es of Sony and their ♥♥♥♥ing god-awful current consoles (and I'm saying this even though two of my favorite consoles ever are the PS1 and the PS2).

												Ride to Uncharted: Retribution""A game that's like one of those oversized dog breeds: a big heart, a short lifespan and a talent for generating crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥""If you can get it on sale it's actually probably worth it for the laughs.  Trucks jump off sand dunes and fly into the sky. Your character can't walk faster during a stroll-with-exposition scene and it's possible to fall behind the other characters by half a mile and still hear them perfectly because the audio is localize on the player (I like to believe the protagonist just temporarily became schizophrenic). At one point two cars crashed together, neither my own, and the game just told me I won. The game smacks of good intentions crippled by amateur execution: there's set up for an interesting story and clearly a lot of love put in but the whole end product feels a lot more like someone's over-ambitious Unity hobby project than a finished work. I don't particularly regret buying it (again, on sale) because I feel like this developer has potential to do bigger and better things.			"

												TL:DNR:  A noble, but much flawed effort.  Buy it very cheap (<US$1), or for the achievement 100% (<US$1.50)Okay - so this is one of those games that the ""comedians"" of Steam just go on about either with brutal comments about it giving them cancer, or racist/sectist crap, or they do the lame sarcasm.This isn't one of those.  What I like about this game, is their intent.  To make a Arabic/Northern African themed game of adventure and discovery.  I like the characters most of the time, and would really like to see more games coming from Arab countries make it into the mainstream (Semaphore is a Saudi game studio), as I am intrigued to hear their cultural voice applied to gaming.  The graphics are generally pretty good, though the ATV escape 'chapter' had some odd graphics quality, I think to mimic a sandstorm, but looked like a bug.  The brother and sister team is a great idea too.Where it falls down is on several levels:The camera view is horribly inconsistent, and will change on you if you get close to a wall (sometimes), and if you go to cover mode (sometimes), or sometimes for no apparent reason.  Sometimes they don't move and you wish they would,  such as the left dagger room as you rope across - you can't see where you are compared to the arrows very clearly and when you are eluding the two police on foot after the sniper when you are in that foyer or whatever it is - the camera was TERRIBLE.  I also like the achievement choices, which were milestone with one straightforward collector.  It also had cards, which were themed well and a reasonable number.  The voice acting in English was ok.  Some of the translations were off (though Bride of the North is correct!) in the subtitles, and IMHO the English actors were a little better than the Arabic actors, as I played in Arabic with English subtitles part of the time to get into the game's mood a little more, but then switched back to English.The controls for me were WASD even though I had a controller installed when I played the game for the first time.  It gave me no option to use the controller, which is unfortunate, as there were times it would have been alot easier!  The wobbles on every board you walk across was annoying, given this guy is otherwise a ninja (e.g. obelisk).The game was woefully short, and at US$4.99 full price, there is no way it is worth it.  It was about an hour.  I let it run longer to get the cards.  In that short time, however, the team at semaphore tried to get every kind of chase and kickboxing fight they could, as well as some gunfights.  I was starting to wonder where Jean Claude Van Damme was since it was like a 'B' action movie.  Maybe he will do the movie version, since he is probably available these days...Finally, there were some really odd graphics choices.  The intro scene showed what I assume were Giza pyramids, but in the mountains.  There are no real mountains there, and ALOT of city growth around them.  The city of Tangier was nice, but while some elements had extreme detail, other things were undetailed, in the same area, giving it an unpolished, half-done feel.  The city streets of Tangier were about 100 yards wide by 1000 yards long, endlessly repeating themselves.  I drove by the same mosque and coffee shops endlessly...So, in summary, they tried really hard, but it came off like a low budget Van Damme movie.  My threshold for value is a reasonably fun game for US$1 per hour or less.  I bought this on sale for US$1.24 and played about an hour, so it was just below the threshold.  It has cards, so it levels out at the $1 per hour.  It didn't suck, but it wasn't something I would play again, and I would have to see Episode 2 be either much longer, improved further, or very inexpensive before I would buy it at all, let alone for 'retail.'NO @ US$4.995.5/10 @ US$1.24 I paid, and 100% achieved.

												First game of  Semaphore. The graphics are for a 5 euro Indie game really good. The story could have more details. The sound is okay. The chapter is very short, i really hope its not the end of the game. It has a few extra, so maybe you play it on medium/ hard to see them all. There could be more achievements for shootings, troughing grenade, killing 3 guys with grenade, killing 1,5,10 people, killing squad shooter/ driver, but its fine. I really enjoy it like a action version of Adam Venture, even if there could be more secrets, hidden ways & puzzles. For 5 Euros 1 hour is hard, get it with a discount. Adventure fans i give 77 %, achievement hunters 75%, normal gamers that dont dislike short indie adventures i give 59 %. Thx 4 reading.			"

												After reading some of the mixed reviews about this game I was somewhat doubtful as to whether I would enjoy it, however after playing through it fully I can genuinely say that this is one of the best exeriences that I have ever had in a video game. The full arabic voice acting was perfect and really added to the atmophere of the game, so much that I almost felt as if I was Nathan Drake exploring the world. There is a variety of gameplay mechanics that flow seemlessly from from the the next and this once again added to the emersion of the whole experience. I can honestly tell you that I plan to replay this game on numerous occasions and cannot wait for the next episode. I am astonished that this developers have sold it for such a low price as I would happily pay £100$ for an experience this greatIn conclusions, this is a must buy game and I urge the developers to release the next episode quickly and I cannot wait for more3/10GOTY			"

The positive things are the story, visuals, voice acting and music score, all done quite well in my opinion. And it's nice to see a game with a middle eastern protagonist, as well as a quite strong female character (though unfortunately not playable). The downside, and trust me it is a major downside, is thge controls, they are just incredibly clunky. I wish they had spent more time on them and hopefully they will fix that because if they do then this could actually be really good.			"

One day youre sister meets up with a Mysetrious man who has a diary that will to the Treasure of Ibn Battuta and then you set on an Adventure. So how is this game ? This game is just awfull. The game consist of a few chapters and in every one you do a diffrent thing. One chapter you drive a car and then in another you jump across roof tops. The game is broken beyond repair.The controls are awfull the graphics are amazingly bad and the story is just bad. The game can be finished in 50 minutes or even quicker so you can be done with it way too quick which in this case isnt a bad thing.

												READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY!do not get this game it tries to hard to be like uncharted and fails  with its bad storyline and terrible controls youll slowly begin to hate this clone oh and hate tutorials well enjoy having a random box appear randomly every time the game wants you to learn something and you have to click it off even if you are in a battle with someone...the voice acting is okay at points but it falls flat as you find out its only an hour long i do not reccomend getting this and if you want to try it wait till sales and get it at under £1			"

												Unearthed: The video game equivalent of an Asylum Movie. The Game is terrible. But it's one of those times that it is so terrible it loops around to being awesome. The developers obviously thought that imitaton was the best form of flattery, and tried to copy Naughty Dog's Uncharted almost beat-for-beat. Tomb raiding, cover based gunplay, on rails turret sections, it's got it all.Do they pull it off? HELL no. But you can not fault them for trying! For an indie title with a limited budget, especially coming from a middle eastern developer, of all things, They did the best they could. It all works, and there's an inkling of polish, but it's just not up to the standard of what it's trying to imitate.But should it be?If you enjoy well meaning, but flawed games, such as Alpha Protocol, or enjoy watching trashy Direct-to-video movies, this is well worth the 5 bucks for the hour-or-so of gameplay you get. A silly little Zombie horde mode is also included for a few extra laughs. 6/10. "

												Unearthed: Trail of Ibn Battuta - Episode 1 would really like to be the next Uncharted. It isn't. Not even close. Unearthed is a bad game, but in a strange way it's also very charming. It's obvious the developers were quite committed to their vision, but they didn't have the budget or manpower to pull it off.Unearthed casts the player as Faris Jawad, a wise-cracking, Middle Eastern version of Uncharted's Nathan Drake. Like Drake and Indiana Jones before him, Faris is raiding tombs as he and his sister seek more information about Ibn Battuta, a 14th century Moroccan explorer. But some bad guys are on hot on Battuta's trail too, and Faris is standing in their way.Unearthed follows the standard Uncharted/Tomb Raider blueprint: lots of wall-climbing, shimmying along ledges, simple (very simple) puzzle-solving, and death-trap avoidance. It works, although awkward animations make some of this stuff look funnier than it should be.In between spelunking, there is combat of the gun and fisticuff variety. Gunplay in Unearthed is cover-based, where you peek around corners and over chest-high walls and blast it out with stupid enemies. It's competent, but forgettable.Fist-fighting in Unearthed is more memorable, but for the wrong reasons: it looks like Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots as performed by marionettes. You and your opponents will flail about wildly, hoping to connect with weak-looking punches and kicks. There are no special moves or takedowns; you'll just hammer away with the attack buttons until you hopefully win. There are only a few fight sequences in Unearthed, but they're all really bad. Hopefully Episode II fixes this.Unearthed bears all the signs of a budget title: cheap-looking graphics, bad voice-acting, and unrefined, clunky gameplay. It's short too; most players should be able to finish the game in under two hours.Finishing Unearthed's campaign unlocks a survival mode. It's Zombies, and like nearly everything else in Unearthed it works but has been done better elsewhere.Unearthed isn't all bad. The music is decent, and some of the dialog is funny. And like it or not, players will learn about Ibn Battuta and may even want to find out more about him by hitting up his Wikipedia page[en.wikipedia.org].Make no mistake: Unearthed: Trail of Ibn Battuta isn't a particularly good game, and unless you're a fan of ""so bad it's good"" titles you may want to skip it. But much like a bad B-movie you can't help but be entertained by, Unearthed strikes just the right, campy, silly tone.			"

												Rumba is a family of percussive rhythms, song and ballroom dance that originated in Cuba as a combination of various musical traditions. The name derives from the Cuban Spanish word rumbo which means ""party"" or ""spree"". It is secular, with no religious connections.[2] People of African descent in Havana and Matanzas originally used the word rumba as a synonym for party.[3] Olavo Alén states that over time, ""rumba ceased to be simply another word for party and took on the meaning both of a defined Cuban musical genre and also of a very specific form of dance.""[4] The term spread in the 1930s and 1940s to the faster popular music of Cuba (the ""Peanut Vendor"" was a classic), where it was used as a catch-all term, rather like salsa today. Also, the term is used in the international Latin-American dance syllabus, but in reference to a slower dance based on the bolero-son. Ballroom rumba, or rhumba, is essentially son as opposed to the older folkloric rumba. Similarly, the African style of pop music called African Rumba or soukous is also son-based.The term is also used today for various styles of popular music from Spain, as part of the so-called Cantes de ida y vuelta, or music that developed between both sides of the Atlantic. Flamenco rumba is a genre that is entirely different from Cuban rumba.			"

Quote:“Uncharted Lite Demo”Discovery:I discovered that I like to play more Arab inspired games.Intro:Unearthed is a casual adventure that takes you to familiar gameplay mechanics but unfortunately leaves you hanging due to the length of the game, making the first episode feel more like a demo.Good/Bad:It is obvious that it borrows heavily from Uncharted, with the wise-cracking banter, character parallels and well, why don’t you watch an Uncharted gameplay video and see for yourself! There were even stealth parts and I swear that car sequence felt very GTA.Although it felt like a copy-lite, there is a clear effort in trying to make this game work beautifully. The character models look good, and there is a love in details of the environments, especially the marketplace in Morocco. Even the cats were polished, I bet a lot of time was spent in computing their data for them to look believably real. But shiny graphics aren’t enough because the whole episode itself can be easily finished in less than an hour while battling the kooky camera and somewhat immersion breaking glitches. Hopefully the next episodes would be longer and have tighter controls.Summary:Unearthed is clearly inspired heavily from a myriad of games, combining a variety of gameplays, trying to push for an epic experience, but falls short in execution which then limits the fun factor.Worth: Bought it for 1 USD but I don’t really regret it. I am curious as to where they will take this game next.Last Thoughts: Super rough around the edges but I do commend the people who worked hard on this game.			"

												First off, don't get me wrong: This game is terrible. Absolutely terrible. But it is HILARIOUS. It so shamelessly rips off the Uncharted series that you can't help but bust a gut laughing at it. Rather than paying a buck for a game, consider it paying a buck for an hour of comedy gold.In fact, I'm going to spoil the whole game right here. Why? Because it's an hour long. Literally. It will make it easier to review in this way as well. There is literally so little content to this game that I CAN'T review it without basically telling everything that happens!First, lets get the basic story out of the way. Faris, an Arab fortune hunter, and his archaologist sister Dania are following the trail of famous Muslim explorer Ibn Battuta. Why, I'm not sure, I think to find his tomb or something, I forgot and it honestly doesn't matter. That's about it. There's no character depth, no background that I can see. Throughout the game they're confronted by various baddies that are after the same thing they are. Now I'm gonna go after the chapters 1 by 1, and this will be entirely about the gameplay.Chapter 1: The game begins with our protagonist immediately under attack, and thrust straight into the action. He gets injured, which means he's going to be moving very, very slowly. I'm talking so slow it makes Resident Evil 1-3 critical health limp look like Sonic the Hedgehog. The character animation is also extremely stiff. After limping through a few corridors and shooting a handful of baddies, the first chapter comes to a close.Chapter 2: This is the longest chapter in the game, and from a gameplay perspective, the best one (and trust me, that's not saying much.) It begins with you hunting for 4 artifacts, which you must use to reactivate an ancient fountain and open a door. Once this is done, you will pass through some dark corridors and eventually come to another item collection segment where you must acquire 2 daggers from 2 rooms. One of these rooms has you controlling an RC car on a lower floor to hit switches and make bridges up above. I'm pretty sure they got this idea from Ape Escape because I've never seen any other game besides those games where you get to use an RC car to solve puzzles. Curiously, this idea is never, ever used again for the rest of the game. The other dagger requires you to do some basic Tomb Raider 1 style platforming to get up to it. With both daggers in hand, you can finally get to the heart of the tomb. At this point, the bad guys break in and one of them confronts you shortly after. At this point we have an awkward hand to hand fight, which is one of the most blatant ripoffs of Uncharted in the entire game. Trust me, reading about it may not tell you all that much but you have to SEE it to understand where I'm coming from. Once this is taken care of, guns come back into play and you must backtrack to the beginning of the level shooting badies with some of the worst AI I've ever seen. I didn't notice it that much in the first level, probably because I was still trying to get over how stiff and awkward the game was, but they are STUPID. I'm talking shoot the walls and walk right past you stupid. The chapter ends once you make it to the level start.Chapter 3: Thought chapter 2 was of decent length? Well the last 4 chapters are pretty much about that length if you put them all together. The third chapter of the game opens with another awkward hand to hand fight with a character who is suspciously similar to Guerro from Uncharted: Golden Abyss, and once he is taken care of Faris and Dania flee the desert in a short on-rails shooting segment (She drives, you shoot.)Chapter 4: Arriving in Morraco, Faris, Dania and another guy whos name I can't be bothered to remember walk through the streets chatting. That's it. The entirety of chapter 4 is just walking slowly through streets while listening to acting and dialogue that would have fit perfectly in The Room. I swear, this part seems like it was written by Tommy Wiseau. I know VSauce made that reference and yes, I did see that video, but it's truly the only thing I can think of to compare it to. The voice acting, the dialogue, everything feels like it was trying to directly copy the style of The Room, and this is probably one of the most hilarious parts of the game because of it.Chapter 5: This chapter opens with a chase sequence like the ones in LA Noire and Splinter Cell: Conviction, which after about a minute leads to the final hand to hand fight in the game. Once this is said and done, you must sneak past a grand total of 2 guards in the only stealth sequence in the entire game. End of chapter.Chapter 6: And now the game rips off Grand Theft Auto. The final chapter of the game is driving around avoiding cops. Literally, that's it. You drive around being chased by cops for about 3 minutes and if you can go that long without failing, you win the game. There is a bar which decreases every time you hit a cop car (or if the cops run into you) and the game explicitly states multiple times NOT to hit the cops. I did not fail this part, but I'm assuming this bar is something like a wanted meter and if it completely empties, you get arrested. This makes sense, since hitting cop cars is OBVIOUSLY a crime, especially if you run from it, but know what else is a crime? Hit and runs with other vehicles. Apparently this game doesn't realize that as you can smash into civilian vehicles as many times as you want and that bar will NEVER change, its only when you collide with the cops. But hey, I'm just running on assumptions here, maybe it's not a wanted meter at all. I don't know, and I honestly don't even care.And that's the whole game. If you read through all of that (or played it yourself) you will realize something: This game feels like a beta test. No, really, this game feels like someone was just testing what they could do. Either that, or decently long demo.There are several different gameplay elements that only make one or two appearances. There are only 2 on-foot shooting segments. There is only one RC car puzzle. There is only 1 on rails shooting section. There is only 1 stealth section. There is only 1 driving section (the finale of the game). It feels like they were just using random ideas here and there for the sake of seeing if they could actually impliment them and make them work right, as if this entire game was simply made to test gameplay elements that may be used in something much larger later on. Either that, or they just had absolutely no idea what they were doing with the game and threw out whatever came to mind. Considering how shamelessly this game rips off Uncharted in so many aspects (even the main character's personality, and to some extent, looks, are ridiculously similar to Nathan Drake) it would probably be safer to bet on the latter.Final word is, get the game if you want a few good laughs, or just save yourself the buck and watch gameplay on Youtube. Either way, I wholeheartedly recommend checking this out just to witness how badly it fails at being a game.			"

												This game is so hilariously bad, it's good. My top game of 2014 so far. Its graphics are among the worst in the 21st century, with no polygons and shoddy textures; the dialogue is just inane; and the main character is the shallowest character I've ever seen.It's so bad it's good.			"

												WOW, just WOW. I expected bad, but wow...It's not just that there's a melee system that consists of ""Push X fast"" to win, or that there's exactly one tomb to explore, with an astonishing TWO puzzles (such content!), or that the shooting has no responsiveness and feels like the worst excesses of the PSX era, or that the driving sequence has you drive through the same block of Morocco for 5 minutes for no reason, or that you walk through Morocco for 5 minutes while not mentioning, once, the 3 foot section of rebar the main character has inserted in his ♥♥♥♥♥♥ apparently. It's that they manage to cram all of this into ONE HOUR. That's it. It's not even a bad game, it's a bad APPETIZER.			"

												Rumba is a family of percussive rhythms, song and ballroom dance that originated in Cuba as a combination of various musical traditions. The name derives from the Cuban Spanish word rumbo which means ""party"" or ""spree"". It is secular, with no religious connections.[2] People of African descent in Havana and Matanzas originally used the word rumba as a synonym for party.[3] Olavo Alén states that over time, ""rumba ceased to be simply another word for party and took on the meaning both of a defined Cuban musical genre and also of a very specific form of dance.""[4] The term spread in the 1930s and 1940s to the faster popular music of Cuba (the ""Peanut Vendor"" was a classic), where it was used as a catch-all term, rather like salsa today. Also, the term is used in the international Latin-American dance syllabus, but in reference to a slower dance based on the bolero-son. Ballroom rumba, or rhumba, is essentially son as opposed to the older folkloric rumba. Similarly, the African style of pop music called African Rumba or soukous is also son-based.The term is also used today for various styles of popular music from Spain, as part of the so-called Cantes de ida y vuelta, or music that developed between both sides of the Atlantic. Flamenco rumba is a genre that is entirely different from Cuban rumba.			"

												Unearthed is an indie game that tries to be a Uncharted clone. But cloning a big budget game isn't that easy as a small company and it shows. The game is a buggy mess that just crashes to desktop. Sometimes on random spots, but you also have the chance it will crash on the same spot over and over again. Making you stuck. It doesn't remember the resolution when you start it. Besides all these problems the gameplay is poor. The shooting is trying to mimic third person shooters, but the executing is poor. The melee fighting scenes are horrible. The platforming is below average and the camera is sometimes controllable and other times fixed. The switch between these style is really annoying while playing. They should have chosen to either make it fixed or make it always controllable. This game is aiming to high making it just some bundle filler that you can idle for cards.			"

The shooting-mechanics are revolutionary and responsive. The graphics are to die for.

Like, really poor. It reminds me of Sonic Adventure 1 on the Dreamcast back when 3d animated models were still developing. 2.) The constant hint dropping on what to do next really gets to me as a long time gamer. It may not bother others, but it realy bothers me because it doesn't let me explore. Instead I'm being led by the nose on where I need to go and what I need to do. My praises: 1.) Graphically it's pretty good. It really struck me when you get to the first temple. The gate was spectacular, especially when you consider the sub par tutorial level. 2.) The voice acting is also really well done. A stark contrast to the poor animation. I almost wanted to go through this game for that part alone, but I just can't bring myself to do it. If you don't have a PS3, and haven't played Uncharted... give this a shot, on sale. If you've played uncharted, go do it again.			"

												Unearthed isn't as bad as everyone says. Seriously, I think it was pretty enjoyable. Of course you can't expect a new Uncharted but it isn't an absolute catastrophe. The graphics are outdated but you can actually look at them and I've also seen worse animations. The locations are beautiful and really atmospheric, especially during the market chapter which has a better atmosphere than most adventure games I know. The soundtrack is very good and the English voice actors do their job well. I haven't tried heard the arabic voice actors but they might be even better because they are the original. Subtitles are available in 21 different languages.The gameplay isn't outdated, just like the rest of the game, but it's playable. Climbing, aiming and shooting work fluently, but the melee combats are horrible. The chapters are rich in variety: You explore a tomb, fight enemies on your way out, have a quad bike pursuit in the desert, explore the atmospheric market of Morocco, pursue a thief on the rooftops, sneak past the police and take control of a car to escape the town. Yes, that's almost the complete game, and that's what you are able to see in the trailer. The campaign has it ups and downs and it's also very short, it took me about an hour. I didn't really get the story and it's not being concluded at all, but who knows when the next episodes will be released.After finishing the campaign you gain access to a zombie survival mode in which you can choose between about 10 different characters.I don't recommend buying Unearthed for the full price. It feels like an old tech demo, but with a higher budget and a longer playtime it could actually be a pretty decent game. If you are searching for a short but more-than-average enjoyable game, you should definitely take a look.			"

												If you can get over the ""Unity Jank™"" it's not *too* bad to go through on Easy in an hour. The game could be something more if it had more dev time and polish. The opening tutorial/prologue level is decent for a ""not big in game development"" area's studio's efforts, but then the actual rest of the game itself kinda falls apart and is janky. The melee system isn't needed and is only used for a few events. From the way they present it in the tutorial, you'd think you'd be able to use it like Uncharted (oops, shouldn't have used that title/game?)'s melee system. But it isn't.The stealth system is only used for like one area if that and could be axed as well.The cover system needs an overhaul as does the gunplay. Being able to fire behind you while your character is facing north on an ATV is... uh... kinda unrealistic and not really good animation-wise.Still, I *kinda* had fun with it for the $1 I spent to get it. So I guess if you can get it for cheap go for it?			"

												This is a very short game that shows quite some potential, making me curious what the developers might come up with for the next episode.What I liked: * the graphical style and detail* the atmosphere and setting* the music - although there's not a lot of it unfortunately* nice in-game tutorials and hints, never gets frustratingWhat I didn't like:* unrefined gameplay mechanics, especially in fist fights and driving* story very short and cut off abruptly* extremely linear, no way to interact with the nice and detailled environmentsThe story has a nice premise, but doesn't quite succeed to pull me in yet. Again, there is potential...Anyway, it was fun to play through and actually made me curious about the real history around Ibn Battuta. I recommend to support the developer so we may see what they've got up their sleeves for episode 2. There`s a nice post of the developer in the forums by the way that helps a lot to put their work into perspective.			"

												This game seems like a comedic spin off of uncharted or tomb raider. It's a relatively short game that only took me 1.2 hours to complete with easy to obtain achievements. If you're looking for a 100% achievement game, this one only has 1 missable that is still easy if you follow a guide.			"

												Yes, it's an unabashed Uncharted knock-off, but at least they picked a good game to mimic.The animations are twitchy, the controls awkward and it's only an hour long. That said, it seems like most of the major bugs have been patched out, as I played through it no problem.Super short though. Hopefully they get to finish the rest of the episodes.			"

												THIS GAME IS AMAZING!Seriously, I haven't had this much fun out of a game since The Logical Adventure of the ZOOMBINIS.The only real critique I can offer is that acquiring more ammo for a gun is a little finnicky since you gotta stand over a gun for a few seconds instead of it being instant, but once you know that then endless hours of fun and laughter and cheer and merriment can be had in the survival mode where you can play as such iconic characters as ""man wearing something"" and ""not-lazarevich.""Also, I like the G36C for no quantafiable reason and I wet myself during the parkour segment.I give this game 15 Frodo Baggins out of 18 Sully Moustaches.(hire me plz IGN/escapistmagazine!)

												Unearthed: Trail of Ibn Battuta is a bad game.  The physics are bad, the AI is bad, the combat is terrible, the graphics are mediocre, the first vehicle sequence is probably one of the worst things I've ever tried to play, characters constantly clip into themselves, the story is laughable, the voice-acting is workmanlike, and the camera is jerky and unfriendly.However, it is a very charming game with some interesting ideas buried under its terribleness.  Firstly, any game set in the middle east where you aren't a white guy blowing half of it up is uncommon, and fewer games still feature a badass Muslim woman in a hijab blowing away mummies and evil corporate goons with an AK-47.  It's an Uncharted knockoff, and it's terrible, but it seems like it's more a lack of experience and technical expertise that makes it terrible than a lack of passion or effort by the dev team.  Yes, it's bad, but they poured their souls into this damnit.			"

												En gång, så var jag ute på krogen. Det var en trevlig kväll med mina goda vänner. Vi drack Staropramen på fat och det var så gudomligt gott, (särskilt om man jämför med Staropramen på burk som man köper på bolaget.) Vi bjöd alla på varsin runda och alla skrattade och började sakta bli fulla och glada. Någon tid senare inpå kvällen så gick vi djupare in på krogens andra avdelning och insåg att det tydligen fanns ett dansgolv och de spelade dansmusik där inne. Inte för att någon av oss är särskilt intresserade av dans och den typen av musik, men vi gick in ändå för att det verkade ändå vara en rätt go feeling där inne. Jag beställde en öl till i baren, såg på bartendertjejens röv när hon lutade sig ner för o hämta flaskan i kylen som jag precis beställt. Den var fan inte ful.. asså denna röv är som en fotomodells sådan. En röv som man bara vill äta till julskinka med dijonsenap på över en stillsam middag i mörka tider. När jag väl fått min öl så rörde jag mig mot dansgolvet, fortfarande osäker på varför, men jag gjorde det. Och innan jag ens hann ta en slurk av ölen så såg jag en kvinna blicka åt mitt håll. Det slog eld och lågor direkt och jag kunde bara inte hejda mig så jag gick fram till henne och sa hej. Hon sa hej tillbaka och en sak ledde till en annan och innan jag visste ordet av det så hade jag funnit min själsfrände. Den här tjejen var så jävla skön på alla möjliga vis och vi hade en sån löjlig personkemi. Vi dansade, vi hånglade, vi fann kärleken på dansgolvet. Hon följde med mig hem den kvällen och vi älskade, Inte bara knullade utan det var ren älskog i timtal. Svetten rann och kondomer gick åt. Tiden gick och vi bestämde oss rätt snart för att göra det seriöst så vi blev tilsamans officiellt. Jag lärde känna hennes kompisar och hon lärde känna mina kompisar. Vardagslivet kom och vi trivdes båda två med att komma hem till någon man älskar varje dag efter jobbet. Hon jobbade med att skriva ut fakturor åt ett företag och ta hand om betalningar, jag var en vanlig knegare på en kullagerfabrik. En dag på jobbet så skadade min kollega Gunvald sin tumme på överfalsverket som formar kullagrena. Jag tyckte lite synd om Gunvald eftersom han tappade en del hud på sin tumme och, ja, fyfan vad onte det måste ha gjort. Jag tog mig en kaffe och försökte att inte tänka på det och gjorde mitt vanliga jobb istället. Efter jobbet den dagen så tog jag spårvagnen hemåt, lysnade på Ed Sheeran, och drömde mig bort mot Västindien och dess gröna vatten. Rätt snart insåg jag att min spårvagnshållplats närmade sig så jag drog i stopp-snöret, reste mig och närmade mig dörrarna. På vägen hem så kom jag på att vi behöver ägg så jag smet förbi gatubutiken o köpte ett paket. De må vara lite dyrare men vafan, orka dra ända ner till Coop tre hållplatser bort. Jag kom hem och jag tog av mig skorna, gick in i köket och ställde äggen i kylen. Rätt snart så hörde jag ljud från sovrummet och blev förvånad över att höra stön. När jag väl kom in i sovrummet så fann jag flickvännen i säng med en man jag inte känner och blev helt ställd. Jag ifrågasätte vad de höll på med trots att det var rätt uppenbart, men chocken fick mig att göra så ändå. Hon började gråta och mannen såg allmänt förvirrad ut, men innerst inne så brydde han sig inte det minsta. Rätt snart så visade sig att hon inte fann gnista i vårt förhållande längre och det var även därför hon råkat i säng med en främling. Jag fann detta avskyvärt och kunde inte känna mig mer avstött. Jag började supa och jag visste inte vad jag skulle ta mig till. Men en dag så knackade det på dörren och jag gick fram bakis, i bara mina kallingar och öppnade dörren. Där stog det en flicka runt tioårsåldern och undrade och jag ville köpa choklad av henne. Tydligen så skulle hon på klassresa och genom att sälja choklad så kunde de ha råd att åka ända upp till Karlstad. Just då så råkade jag se att hon hade mörk choklad med hallonfyllning och alla som känner mig vet att jag är löjligt svag för både hallon och mörk choklad. Jag frågade direkt vad hon ville ha för hallonchokladen. Hon sa att hon ville ha tre och femti.			"

												For 79p, I actually do not mind this game being bad. It's not terrible, its just funny to laugh at the dialogue and creepy animations made during cutscenes, which remind me of how NPCs talk in Sonic 06. The game needs many fixes and improvements, but overall, is a cheap knock off of an Uncharted game. It wanted to be Uncharted, but for PC, and proves that a lot. But look at the price, you shouldn't expect anything of high quality. I played this game and completed it in an hour, but in that hour, I actually had fun. I dunno if thats because I'm a big Uncharted fan and I let this game slip for what it wanted to be. In the end, if you want a game to laugh at for an hour, pick this game up. If you would prefer a functioning game, stay away from this.			"

The game is clearly a ripoff and has a low budget, but i kinda enjoyed it, it's a funny bad.Maybe because i got it for like a buck, but i was amused the whole way. Makes me kinda sad they didn't continue the game. I hope the devs at least got a tiny profit off it.Basically, you do EXACTLY what Nathan Drake does, shoot, jump through♥♥♥♥♥♥and walk through towns at a very slow pace for some exposition,  but with 5% of the production values put into it.All in all, i can't recommend unless it's 80% off. I had 'fun', laughed a bit, and made the money back through trading cards. If gets dirt cheap again, though, grab it for the lolz.			"

												I give credit to the developers for trying to express their culture in a way that makes the atomosphere believeable. The developers chose a Muslim explorer rather than some European figure, and that much made it feel like I was learning something. I can read Arabic with a somewhat intermediate proficiency, so I enjoyed seeing signs with everyday stuff on them, graffiti, etc. I enjoyed listening to the really stiff lines in Arabic (the Arabic is الفصحى, i.e. bookish) simply because there are virtually zero games that use Arabic as a language spoken by anyone other than ""those dirty insurgents"". I wanted to believe. :XBut yeah, as you can imagine, the game itself is just tragically bad. There are bugs and some stuff is pretty hokey, but the biggest flaw is that it just isn't fun. The fun factor is just not there at all. Yeah, you do stuff, shoot some things, but it just isn't fun. It's a chore. Fighting various guys isn't fun, it's just annoying. ""Exploring"" just isn't there - you just simply follow a linear path.I applaud the attempt, but it's clear that there is a lack of understanding when it comes to game design. Games are not sequences of levels and cut scenes. Games are first and foremost entertainment. I don't think they spent enough time refining the gameplay at all. This is alpha quality at best.			"

												I bought this game for price of 1€ and it's worth the price. Full price is 4,99 and let's say it's worth 2 € for sure, story is worth that much, although every other aspec of the game is subpar to expected standards.Story is interesting and really makes me want to know how it continues and buy sequels. I also like it because I think that developers made an effort and gave us opportunity to learn something of the muslim culture and history. (real one, not the TV b..♥♥♥♥♥♥propaganda given by media). This is really great effort and should be rewarded. Characters are interesting and have smart and witty dialogues.Game has quite a bit of bugs and flaws. Graphic, although scenery is very nice, it is very strange at some points. Especially when chased through desert on quad. At this point graphic was totally broken.Gameplay and camera is another thing that needs additional work. Movement and camera view just does not feel natural. Have in mind that this is only episode one, so it's quite short game, but it is full of events. General pace of game and story is good, but there are 2 quite dull moments. First being walk from the tea shop to get the appartment. Most of this walk did not have dialogue. I later found out it is a bug... There is dialogut, but I did not hear it, nor I seen subtitles. Second boring part is car chase. It's just driving through the repetitive blocks avoiding police cars. It does not matter if police is on to you, just don't crash into them. There's no goal when driving, it's without purpose you can drive around one building with same result.Also I noticed bug that happens when you pause game (esc) and return to playing it. Dialogue audio will become broken and you will only read subtitles but you will not hear audio.All in all, I hope studio that designed the game will be able to fix this errors in sequel because it's game worth playing.In current condition, is not to recommend for buying on full price.

												Judgment: ""The Ruins of Potential Greatness""I cannot in good conscience recommend this game unless it were given away for free, and even then I would have reservations as there are certainly better ways to spend your time; this is a game that one plays only to satisfy one's own morbid curiosity. There are the ruins of potential greatness nothing more to be found here. There's heart but the body around it has long decayed into dust and broken bones.Positives:-Fascinating source material (the voyages of Ibn Battuta)-Fairly intuitive gameplay (if you've played Tomb Raider or Uncharted, you will not feel lost here)Negatives:-Insultingly easy puzzles which felt like a technical demonstration of what could be done with the engine rather than actual puzzles-Disappointingly short (I finished the entire affair in less than two hours). -Clunky narrative choices and design(for instance,I learned more from the loading screens than from the dialogue and expository scenes in the game)-Frame-rate drops (this might be my machine but I've run a few recent triple-A titles without problem)Additional Comments:To be fair, going into this game, I had anticipated a disaster but I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt.  However, in playing this game, I discovered the ruins of potential greatness nothing more. There's heart but the body around it has long decayed into dust and broken bones. The source material of this game (the travels of Ibn Battuta) would have made for a great game, and it seems clear that the creators were passionate about the subject matter, but no amount of passion or love will make up for poor design and at beast humdrum gameplay. On the whole, this game felt like a demo of something great that could have been but will never be. The game's puzzles and action segments seemed more a proof of concept, as if someone were showing off what he or she could do with the engine in order to attract future investors. Tellingly enough this is the first episode of many planned episodes (none of which appear to be forthcoming). It's ultimately too short; I swear that two entire segments were spent walking slowly while one character furnished some historical context, and I finished the whole thing in barely a blink of an eye.Had this been a demo or a interactive pitch, I would not have felt so disappointed. I would only recommend this game if it were free (like demos used to be). Moreover, I'm certain that you could find a used copy or a free copy of the Rihla by Ibn Battuta for next to nothing online or at your preferred bookseller and reading the text which inspired this endeavor would certainly be a better investment of your time and money.

												This might be the worst game I've ever played, and I couldn't recomend it more. The animation is total dog♥♥♥♥♥♥ the gameplay is laughable (the shotgun can kill people at long rang) there are too many plotholes to count and it is a blatant rip-off of Uncharted. I bought it for $0.99 and it was worth every penny. Buy this game if you want a good laugh, though I would wait until it goes on sale.			"

												The game was okay. however, I believe the game's mechanics are decent at best.  I had a hard time maneuvering around the game, and I fell of to infinite sometimes for no particular reason.			"

												Oh man, all these Uncharted jokes.In all seriousness, this could have been an okay ripoff, if not for what were clearly lazy production values. Then the price was lowered to a buck, and suddenly it became worth it.It took me longer to download this thing than it took to beat, but if you want replay value, this game actually has it.Beating the campaign (took me less than an hour) unlocks zombie survival mode.

												I bought this game for price of 1€ and it's worth the price. Full price is 4,99 and let's say it's worth 2 € for sure, story is worth that much, although every other aspec of the game is subpar to expected standards.Story is interesting and really makes me want to know how it continues and buy sequels. I also like it because I think that developers made an effort and gave us opportunity to learn something of the muslim culture and history. (real one, not the TV b..♥♥♥♥♥♥propaganda given by media). This is really great effort and should be rewarded. Characters are interesting and have smart and witty dialogues.Game has quite a bit of bugs and flaws. Graphic, although scenery is very nice, it is very strange at some points. Especially when chased through desert on quad. At this point graphic was totally broken.Gameplay and camera is another thing that needs additional work. Movement and camera view just does not feel natural. Have in mind that this is only episode one, so it's quite short game, but it is full of events. General pace of game and story is good, but there are 2 quite dull moments. First being walk from the tea shop to get the appartment. Most of this walk did not have dialogue. I later found out it is a bug... There is dialogut, but I did not hear it, nor I seen subtitles. Second boring part is car chase. It's just driving through the repetitive blocks avoiding police cars. It does not matter if police is on to you, just don't crash into them.
