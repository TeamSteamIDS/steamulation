												I've been playing Path of Exile since 2011 closed beta and it's remarkable how far the game has come purely from crowd funding.  The passion of the userbase is equally matched by it's developers.  They've shown throughout the years to constantly improve and tweak the game with regularly scheduled content additions.  I still feel I don't know everything there is to know about this game, and that isn't changing any time soon.  Path of Exile is an incredibly complex and rewarding game that is definitely worth your time.Outside of having an absurdly intricate skill tree and a fantastic crafting/currency system,  the other large appeal of this game is the end-game.  Most ARPGs fail to offer incentive to continue to play your character after you've exhausted the content.  Usually this just comes in the form of a easily attainable level cap or grinding the same final zone of the game at length.  Instead, in POE you are given item drop instances, as described by the developers: ""Maps can drop as normal, magic, rare or unique with higher rarity Maps yielding more items. Using a Map item opens six portals to the area, which can each only be used once. Like most other items in Path of Exile, Maps have mods that change their risks and rewards. Map mods can affect the size or complexity of the level, monster packs, monster properties or even alter characters while in the level. Players can modify Maps themselves using their currency items. For example, you can use an Orb of Transmutation to turn a normal Map into a magic Map, or use an Orb of Alteration to reroll its mods.""It goes to say that each and every map is a different experience, with room for countless variation in modifiers letting you push the limits of your character.  Not all characters are equal.  You will find that some characters that excell in early progression have difficulty in the end-game and visa versa.  Each character I've made has informed the next which is critical in a game that rewards experience and skill.And if that wasn't enough, POE offers alternative ARPG experiences in the form of daily race events which are time based leveling with unique modifiers that you won't see in the real game like 'Turbo Mode'.  Moreover some of these races have entirely unique content like Descent: Champions or Endless Ledge which offer players the ability to win special art reskins of legendary items for the leagues of their choice.All in all POE is a truly exciting game and a breath of fresh air for the genre.

Warning: this game will consume big part of your life. If you start playing it, you will keep coming back for more all the time. Before I started playing Path of Exile, my attitude towards Hack'n'Slash genre was... let's say bad. This is my first game of such genre and I am completly satisfied.Now let's go straight to good and bad points of PoE.-PROS:+ truly Free To Play model, there is no such thing as Pay To Win, there are microtransactions that are all about purchasing visual effects for your character and his abilities (you can also purchase more tabs in stash, but that does not impact the game),+ developers actually care about the game, listen to their community and keep fixing bugs, creating new content or reworking old visual effects (I have been watching development of PoE since open beta and it constantly changes until this day, successfully becoming better),+ the desynchronisation issue has been fixed with the introduction of the update 2.0.0 - this was one of the biggest flaws of this game, it is gone now! Hurray!+ new leagues and events are started on a regular basis,+ huge amount of passive skill points which gives you enormous combinations for character developement, every build is unique (unless you begin copying others' builds which kills the fun). There are so many possibilities that you are even able to turn an archer into a melee character!+ large variety of active skills - you want to sweep your axe? You want to cleave through enemies with your sword? Maybe you fancy raining arrows or using various kinds of magic? No problem, you can choose anything you want and upgrade your skills so they can consume less mana, become faster or fire more projectiles at once and that is not everything.+ many armors and weapons: one handed or two handed: axes, maces, swords also daggers, claws, bows, wands and staves, items also have different stats and 4 grades: normal, magic, rare and unique, same thing applies to monsters,+ crafting-currency trade system, it might come out to be hard to understand at first, but then you keep realising that everything has its value, there is no gold, just barter trade system. Crafting-currency items have one important function - they slow / prevent inflation which is a disadvantage of gold based systems,+ this game has challenging end-game consisting of large variety of special maps that can be modified to become more rewarding and demanding at once, if you reach high level [80+] with decent items and statistics you will simply feel satisfied + nice, vivid and helpful community,+ with the introduction of version 2.0.0 majority of in-game locations have been reworked, thanks to that some quests are now less time-consuming and do not get you bored!-CONS:** - with the introduction of version 2.0.0 this game has become flawless in my opinion.I hope that I managed to describe this game generally, but I have to say one more thing: you will not be able to experience the game by reading others' reviews, just give it a try and you might fall in eternal love.

												REVIEW OUT OF DATE. I'm going to be writing a new one soon.This is probably one of the most in depth ARPGs I have ever played, and its free to play! The character customization in this game is absolutely crazy. The game may seem daunting at first with its unique currency system and absolutely huge skill tree but once you learn how these works you will get addicted to this game.Now lets look at the Pros and Cons. I will list them in a very detailed manner. TLDR version will be at the bottom for those of you that just a brief look because this is going to be a long one.Pros:+This game is free to play. And when I say free to play I don't mean free to play and buy your way to the top. There is no way possible to buy any sort of advantage in-game. The only things you can buy are visual armor sets that can be applied to your in-game items, alternate skill visuals, pets that do not fight, more character slots (which you have about 24 slots to start with), and extra stash tabs (which again you start with plenty space).+Character Customization is amazing. There are 7 classes. Marauder, templar, witch, shadow, ranger, duelist, and scion(has to be unlocked by completing normal mode). All of these classes lean toward certain builds but if you wanted to play the strength heavy marauder as an int caster then that is very possible. The skill tree is huge and any class can go in any direction. It may seem daunting at first but once you learn your way around its fun to plan out the rest of your build or your next character.+Unique currency system. This is one of my favorite things about the game. In this game you don't have gold or anything like it. Instead you buy and sell things with orbs. There are many types of orbs with varying rarity. I won't go over all the orbs but I'll talk about a few as an example. For instance, the orb of chance can change a white common item into a magic, rare, or even unique item (the different rarities, think magic as uncommon, rare as well rare, and unique as legendary). Or say a chaos orb which can change the properties of a rare item. Orbs like these can be traded to npcs for items or upgrades in your hideout(I'll explain this later). Or players will buy and sell items using these orbs. So you can use these orbs as currency or to upgrade your own gear.+Leagues. This game has a couple permanent leagues as well as temporary leagues. The 2 perma leagues are standard and hardcore. Standard is pretty simple. There are 3 acts in 3 game modes at the time this review is written (I believe a 4th act is coming next year). In normal you suffer no penalty at death. In the next difficulty, which you access by beating all acts on normal, is a little more punishing. In  cruel if you die you lose 5% of your experience (don't worry you can't lose a level if you are at less than 5% exp for that level). In the last difficulty, merciless, you lose 10% experience for death. In the hardcore league if your character dies at all it is moved to standard league. Each league can only share a stash with characters in the same league. GGG also releases temporary leagues. The big highlight of this is their 3 month leagues. These are good for providing a fresh start and for people who enjoy tring to race to the top first can do so. It also lets players play in a fresh economy. When they release these 3 month leagues they release of them. One of them is a Standard league and the other hardcore. However, these aren't copy-paste modes. The 3 month leagues have something exta to them that the perma leagues don't have. For example, at the time of this review the torment(standard) and bloodline(hardcore) leagues are going on. In torment there are tormented souls that fly around making enemies stronger but they drop better loot. In bloodlines there are enemies who gain synergetic abilities that make them way stronger. And with these temp leagues they also have access to several new unique items that the perma leagues won't have access to until the temp leagues are over. If a character dies in bloodline they will be moved to standard league.+The developers care about this game. This one is pretty simple. They update the game a lot. There's always new things coming into this game. You can even spot GGG staff members from time to time talking to people in global chat. It is very obvious that they care about this game and its community.+Gems. Gems are what you will use for all of your skills. There are red (strength) gems, blue (int) gems, and green (dex) gems. You can get these gems by questing or by finding them as random drops. To use these gems you have to put them in the correct colored socket that your gear has. If your gear doesn't have enough sockets or the wrong color sockets then that's okay, you can manipulate this with the use of orbs. For example, the chromatic orb can change all the socket colors on a piece of gear and the jewelers orb can change th number of sockets on gear. Your gems also gain experience just as you do. The higher level the gem, the better. Gems have a max level of 20.+Endgame. Endgame begins once you are at the end of act 3 merciless. You can get maps that drop from enemies. These maps will generate a random level with random enemies. Thats not all they will gain extra effects or maybe you will gain extra effects or lose them! The harder the map the more rewarding it is. You can also use orbs on the maps! If you have a white quality map then you can use something like an orb of alchemy which will change its quality from common to rare making it a harder but more rewarding map.CONS-Desync. This biggest problem with this game is that it suffers from desynchronisation problems. This means you will sometimes randomly lag back a couple seconds which can sometimes kill you. If you keep this in mind most of the time you can play carefully and this won't really effect you much.-Starting out as a new player in this game can be rough at first. There is so much to learn and the game has a lot of depth to it. With all the skill gems, skill points, and currency orbs its hard to know what to do with everything. However there are ways to learn. The official poe website is a good place to learn more about the game. The class forums are a good place to go to see how people build their characters. People can even post the path they went on their skill tree and you can look at each node they took to help you gain an understanding at what it takes to make a decent character.-This game can also be a little bit boring getting to end game if leveling isn't really your thing. You have to complete all 3 acts on all 3 difficulties before you make it to end game. Doing all the same quests 3 times over per character may seem a bit boring at times.TLDR PROS+Free to play+great character customization+fun skill system+unique currency & trading system+developers care about this game and its community a lot+geat end game+frequent updates+fun league systemTLDR CONS-game suffers from desync-game can be rough on beginners-leveling characters through each difficulty can get tedious.Thank you for reading. I know this review was extremely long but I just wanted to make sure I put out as much info as I could think of for people who are interested in trying this game out. I hope this review has helped you.This game is extremely fun and I def reccommend it to anyone who likes diabloish type games. Starting out may be rough because of everything you have to learn but it is worth it if you stick through.  If you have any questions please leave a comment and I will try to comment back as soon as I can!			"

												If you like Action RPG but have not played this game yet, you must. Grinding Gear Games, an indie gaming company with their entirely free-to-play game, have created one of the most complex, in-depth and innovative ARPG in the gaming industry.Business ModelFirst of all, this game has one of the most fair and ethical business model you could ever see in the free-to-play market. Absolutely nothing you can get with real money gives you advantage over other players. This encourage players to support the game because they actually want to donate for the developing and its developers and not because they are forced to progress.Audiovisual artThe developers have stated that they ""are sick of the recent trend towards bright, cartoony RPGs. The art style [they] chose for Path of Exile is dark, gritty and realistic"". The graphics are beautifully detailed, the music is iconig and the voice acting is outstanding.Gameplay & MechanicsThe customization and character progression in Path of Exile is complex and impressively in-depth, with a vast diversity in their mechanics.ClassesEach one of the 7 classes starts at different location of a passive skill tree, composed by 1325 nodes, with non-linear progression (the tree is actually a web).Items & GearsSet items is a horrible decision for builds diversity, so this is not what you will find here. Of course there are Unique items, but having a full set of Uniques of the same theme/type does not grant you bonus mods. This is meant to be this way to avoid forcing players to play with sets, breaking their character building freedom.The item drops: maps, divination cards, jewels, gear items (their category, rarity, mods, gem sockets and links), are randomly generated.JewelsThere are socketable nodes in the Passive Skill Tree that makes possible to socket Jewels that grants bonus and special attributes to your skill tree. These jewels have rarity, mods and can be crafted too.SkillsThe skill system made by gems makes possible that the characters are not limitative to a few skills, so the game does not dictate how the player is going to play. These gems have level and attribute requirements according to their color (Strength, red; Dexterity, green; Intelligence, blue), they can be leveled up, have quality % and can be corrupted for bonus mods.Divination CardsThis kind of items are collectibles that gives you a specific item once you have gather enough cards of a set. Each card is dropped in a specific areas of the map. This system allow players to systematically work their way to the acquisition of the items they want, without having to rely on an eternal grinding.MapsTheir structures and pack of monsters are randomly generated, and is the main focus of the end-game, since they can be crafted.Currency & CraftingThere is no gold in Path of Exile, there are 25 currency items (orbs) that have crafting functionality. They can add/remove/re-roll the mods of the items, modify the sockets (number, colors and links) of the gear items, they can corrupt the items, change their rarity, etc. Basically people trade items for items they are going to use, and not for gold. This makes the trade highly in-depth and open.Forsaken MastersThere are 6 Masters (NPCs). Each one of them can be leveled up to level 8 by doing daily missions, and they offer crafting bench and hideouts that can be decorated and customized as the player wish.The variety of builds and the hideout customization is so open that the developers runs two series called Build of the Week and Hideout of the Week.Developers & SupportThe developers work along side with the community to improve the game and add new content. They do a great job balancing the game and deploying constant patches and updates. The support is surprisingly responsive and open to any kind of feedback.ConclusionAll these elements makes the different ways a character may progress literally infinite, and the game always encourage to make new builds and try different mechanics. Some players likes to experiment with builds and other players likes to break the ""rules"" and metas to come with insane mechanics. The developers are, as explained, the most ethical and responsive gaming company you could find out there considering the success of their game. Reason to be disclosed: they are hardcore gamers creating a game after all, what would be better than that?			"

												Simply the most in-depth Hack'n'Slash out there and the best according to me. Character customization is top-notch and replayability is huge. I have a little bit over 1k hours played on it (did not link the game to my steam account immediately) and I still  have many things to discover. However, it is a ""hardcore game"" less accessible than Diablo 3 or others games.Pros:- Huge passive skill tree offering in-depth character customisation- Interesting spell customisation using gems (close to FFVII's materia system)- Interesting trading system relying on barter only (no gold or any other in-game currency)- Interesting crafting system allowing to modify dropped items- Game is very skill based (rare for a hack'n'slash!)- Very little Faceroll/OP builds, almost every build has drawbacks and strengthCons:- Can be hard to get into: trading system can seem overwhelming and in-game mechanics are quite complicated so use of the wiki and forum is much advised- Animation can seem clunky at the beginning and game seems to play slow at the beginning- Player can feel like reaching a gear-ceiling at the beginning of end-game if playign self-found (much better since Forsaken Master's 1.2 update though)- Will eat your life if you get into it...

												I've spent about as much money on this game as I would have on a similar non-F2P RPG and I still feel guilty. I feel like I've ripped off the hard-working developers and artists who put this game together. I never needed to buy anything. I never needed to pay one red cent. There is no mechanical advantage to paying for the (kick♥♥♥♥♥ cosmetic changes. But if I'm ever flush with cash I'll be sinking more coin into Path of Exile. Simply because I don't feel like I've paid enough for this awesome game, given so freely. Play this game. And then reward the designers for their lack of greed. Please buy some stuff because I told you to. I'll sleep better at night.			"

												This game is not very friendly to casual players, beginners will have a relatively hard time grasping the game's multiple mechanics that have never been in an ARPG previously. However those who put in the time to learn the game's basics will be rewarded with a tremendously addictive game with nearly infinite ways to play. There are many reviews here explaining what the game's features are, but on mine I would like to focus on what a newbie can expect when first playing. I recommend reading this after having read one of the other reviews, that will do a better overview of what the actual game features are.Some of the first struggles a new player will face when first starting this game will be: Learning what is good and what isn't for their character (Many gems/passive traits can be ""noob traps"", such as going full evasion/energy shield gear (without proper understanding of how ES works), or building a full glass cannon character, which is not a good idea (even in a non-hardcore league). Learning to plan their character before even making it. PoE is all about planning, and building your character as you go is rarely a good idea. This is something that players learn over time, and meanwhile a good way to decide what to play is to find a fun skill in-game, and then look up a build for it on the forums (link provided below). Remember that almost anything can work in this game, with proper planning. The economy - PoE's economy is based on trading. There is no universal currency such as gold. There are, in it's place, currency items. Currency items are the items that are used for buying and selling in PoE, but they have an added value in the effects that they can have when used on items. For example: An orb of alchemy can turn a white item (item with no stats), into a rare item with random stats. All the currency in PoE has a different use, and some are rarer than others, adding value to them. I will add a link in my list of links at the end of this review/guide where you can trade items, and trade one currency for another. You can also see the value of each currency there. The gem system. Going back to the subject of ""noob traps"", the gem system has many of them. In PoE, skill gems can level like your character, however there are reasons to consider not leveling them. For example, the ""Cast when damage taken"" gem, which, causes skills linked to it to be automatically casted when you take a specific amount of damage, sometimes should not be leveled, because leveling it increases the amount of damage you need to take in order for the skills to trigger, which can lead to skills not triggering as often as you'd like. Another example is the clarity gem, that gives you a mana regen aura. Leveling it increases the amount of mana reserved, which can be undesirable. It is recommended that you research what changes with each level up for your gems. Leveling gems also increases the level and stat requirement, so if for whatever reason you lose some of an attribute, all of a sudden you will not be able to use that gem anymore until you get more, or, due to the increased level requirement, you will not be able to equip it on another character until they're higher level. The gear system. From mods to sockets, gear in Path of Exile will rarely be equippable as soon as you get it: Those gloves you just got have amazing stats, but the sockets aren't the right color, or aren't linked! Which means you have to craft on them (crafting is the act of spending currency to modify an item, such as linking sockets with orb of fusing). Many times as a new player have I gotten an upgrade, but screwed myself over by spending all my currency trying to craft on it, or on something else, and not ending up with the result I desired, resulting in the item being put in the stash until I had more currency to use on the item. Some management is required.The list will be updated if I am reminded of new things to add to it.All in all, PoE is a great game, one of my favorite games, and once you get into it, you can expect to be playing it for a really long time. The relatively high barrier of entry might intimidate you as a new player, but if you don't mind doing some research of game mechanics, few games will provide the gameplay that PoE provides. Useful links: PoE's Official Wiki, your best friend when playing this game. Almost any question about the game is answered here.  [pathofexile.gamepedia.com] PoE Goods page, where you can trade with other players [poe.trade]  PoE community builds list, link is for witch but at the top there are links for other classes[www.pathofexile.com] Might be outdated depending on when you're reading this  PoE passive skill tree planner, so you can decide where to spend your points before even starting your playthrough [poeplanner.com] "

												Great action-adventure game.  Allows very deep customisation of characters.Removal of gold (basic currency item is an identify scroll) forces you to make choices about which items are really important to you.  Higher-tier currency items allow you to customise your equipment in various ways, such as: making an item magic/rare, re-rolling modifiers, increasing base stats or changing the skills you can slot into them.Purchasable stuff doesn't generally give large benefits - you start with 4 shared stash pages which is enough for casual play with a handful of characters.  You can buy extras, although guilds don't start with any stash space so all guild tabs require purchase.  Everything else is cosmetic.Race events are interesting, as you can't keep anything you pick up once the race finishes it is very focussed on levelling and killing as quickly and efficiently as possible while staying alive (all race characters are hardcore).

												Easily THE best diablo style ARPG I have ever played. This game is one of those games that will never, ever, be uninstalled. The classes are fantastic, the skills are even better, and the combinations of possiblities for character builds are absolutely mind boggling. While it may have a steep learning curve, if you enjoy ARPGs it is well worth investing the time to learn some of the more interesting mechanics.Path of Exile is constantly updated with new content, new skills, new mechanics and various Quality of Life improvements. The team at Grinding Gear Games actually care about the integrity of what they are producing and also have an incredibly fair buisness model, no pay to win here.If you are looking for a new ARPG or even just something different to play then give it a shot. 100% free to play with only ethical microtransactions, there is no reason not to try it.Act 4 - The Awakening will take Path to even greater heights. Extended storyline, new areas, streamlining of the older content, new skills, new items and more QoL improvements than you can poke a ""Lifesprig"" at.If you have wanted to try Path and keep putting it off, then now is the time! Join us and you shall be Awakened too.			"

For past 3500+ hours I've been smashingmonsters like H*ll. I've been praying to get one lucky drop,I've been farming Alts, Chaos, Regals to get even one 6L that's not Tabula,The fact I've never achieved anything cool and stillI could call this game my life more than my ""real life""makes me wonder why I still keep playing it.Why I'm still playing it?

												Where to start... well this game is absolutely amazing, really. Of course if you like dungeon crawlers/actionRPG's you'll aprecciate it even more. I played in on beta time ago and enjoyed it, the final release is even better!! It's TRULY free to play, you can only pay for some extra visual enhancements for items/skills which gives you not a single benefit on gameplay, shinier armor/weapons and pretty effects on weapons or skills for example. After you play for a while you'll even want to buy something to support the developers which made such a great job on the game. And keep doing it actually, they have periodic in-game events and update the game regularly with more legendary items and some other stuff.Very Diablo II style, not the dissapointment that Diablo III was (IMHO). Only con for me would be always online as I don't have the most reliable internet, but since it's a free to play game it's hard to complain about that. Also, it might start a bit slow but give it a chance and it will become very very enjoyable, addictive maybe. It has the most complex and deepest skill system I've ever seen, it might get hard to get used to it at the beggining but it's a crucial part of the game being that special.This game is a masterpiece.

												Not your typical F2P game. This is a company (Grinding Gear Games) who are devoted to their players. The game literally can be played, for free, without you being hindered in any way shape or form. Every skill, item, level, difficulty, everything is open. The cash shop is all cosmetic stuff (and its awesome).The depth of the game is fantastic, and no two builds are ever the same! I highly recommend checking out the forums. Experienced players have wrote some fantastic guides for the passive tree and how to build a succesful character.Ignore the comments such as ""everyone uses the same op build"" or ""same op skills"" because it couldn't be further from the truth. Go look for yourself, check out the leaderboards and there is a massive array of skills and builds that people have succesfully used.The only negative point i have to say is, ingame trade could have been done better, HOWEVER, a website that is now widely used http://poe.xyz.is/ solves the trading spam and is fantastic for finding the items you need. So i guess that could take away half a negative point? :P9.5/10If you aren't playing this game, or at least given it a good number of hours, then you are missing out!			"

												This is the game Diablo 3 should have been. If you're a former Diablo purist, obsessed with Diablo 2, ditch that poser called Diablo 3 and install Path of Exile. It's also a shining example of FREE-TO-PLAY done right! You can't even buy temporary boosts, everything is purely cosmetic. You only have to spend money if you want special effects or simply want to support some awesome devs.			"

												Woke up on a beach, talked to some dude who got killed by a zombie. Slapped the crap out of that zombie, then ran along the coast. Slapped the crap out of more zombies and crabs. Found a big zombie and slapped the crap out of him, too. Entered the town, got told to go an island. On my way there, I slapped the crap out of some more zombies and crabs, as well as some cannibals. Found their cannibal leader on my way to slap the crap out of whatever was on the island. So I slapped the flaming crap out of her, too. Got to the island, and slapped the crap out of more scrabblers, as well as some water-mud like things. Then found an ice cannibal and got frozen then killed before I could slap the ever loving daylights out of him. That was in open beta.Now I'm throwing swords, leaping all over the place, Attacking insanely fast, and burning an undying sphincter.I would absolutely reccomend this game. Very fun, very diverse. Way above average.10/10 game, would burn more immortal sphincters			"

												The best ARPG ever made and it's 100% free. Only thing you can buy is cosmetics and item storage the best F2P model out there. If you grew up playing Diablo 2 this is it's spiritual successor its has depth in spades great skill tree progression and end game mapping system virtually limitless gearing options, New players beware stick to one of the many build guides on the forums to start with, the more you learn about the game the more options there are for creative build designs. I am 4k hours in and will be playing this for years to come. Once again it's a free game give it a download and try it you won't regret it.			"

 “In my dreams I see a great warrior, his skin scorched black, his fists aflame.” Path of Exile (PoE) is an online action role-playing game (arpg) developed and published by the company Grinding Gear Games.  Atmosphere & presentation: + Free-to-play game that can be completed, enjoyed and continued without spending money. + Grim and dark atmosphere is supported by appropriate background music.+ Creative level and monster design.   o A permanent internet connection is required, in order to access the PoE servers.o Cosmetic effects can be bought via in-game microtransactions.  Combat & gameplay: ++ The passive ability tree is massive. In combination with the creative skill gem system it provides a multitude of options for character development and tuning towards the end game.+ Replayability profits from the league system and randomly generated (end game) maps, with countless variation in form of map modifiers, increasing the difficulty with each added attribute.+ Creative currency system with elaborate item-changing properties.  + In-game trade system allows the easy acquirement of high end gear from other players.  + ‘Hardcore’ mode satisfies the needs of the masochistic player community. Characters & story: + Interesting side characters provide the player with entertaining information about current and past events of the game world.o Limited identification of the player with the protagonist. - No cutscenes or other means of exposition are used to support the storytelling or foreshadow future events.  Summary: Overall, PoE offers offers high-quality hack & slash gameplay with sophisticated arpg mechanics that can be enjoyed from the beginning to the end on a free-to-play basis. It is a challenge to reach the end and you can definitely end up putting a lot of hours into it. Furthermore, the game succeeds in the field of long term motivation by providing an elaborated league system that maintains the in-game economic balance and replayablity.The only shortcoming of this game lies in the presentation and simplicity of the storytelling. While the different non-player characters will fill you in about the historic and current events in Wraeclast, no other means are used to bolster up the storyline.  Trivia: While 60 percent of donors were in the $10 range, the ‘diamond tier’, in which someone commits to $1,000 or more, found 183 supporters. Achievements: A little advice for achievement hunters. The level of difficulty is a 10 out of 10 on the freak scale with a badass seal of approval.Estimated time for 100 % completion: +300 hoursOffline achievements: noneOnline achievements: 84			"

												In my opinion, Path of Exile is the greatest ARPG currently available.  The fact that the game is free to play, yet offers an incredible amount of depth, frequent updates and solid gameplay sets it apart as not only the best ARPG currently, but also one of the best F2P games created to date.  If you are a fan Diablo-style games, then I must recommend you give PoE a go.  I have played Grim Dawn, all three Diablo games, Marvel Heroes, both Torchlight games, Titan's Quest and several other ARPGs (these mentioned are the best of the lot to date, in my opinion).  It is my favorite style of video game, and that has made PoE my favorite game for some time.  The early game is a bit slower/clunkier feeling than say Diablo 3's due to the way skills work in PoE, but by mid to late game, it becomes much faster-paced.  The skill and class system is an interesting thing in PoE.  You are not bound to a set of skills or play type by the class you pick.  Certain classes lend themselves better to certain playstyles, but you can certainly play a tanky, melee witch and a glass cannon marauder.  Skill gems must be socketed into your gear you are wearing to grant skills to be used, and skills can be modified to augment the way they work and their damage by socketing support gems into linked sockets.  PoE doesn't tend to explain things, or make things so simple that they require no explanation/figuring out.  The wiki for PoE is an extremely valuable source of information, and trading in the game nearly necessitates the use of a third party site - which is essentially an Auction House where one lists or finds items for sale.  Nearly every item in the game is tradeable, and the currency in the game is expendable and usable, making it useful both for trading for items as well as crafting/upgrading your own items.  There are recipes in the game that still have not been discovered (or at least made public) since the game was released!    That is not to say the game is not without its faults.  Chief amoungst them is the game's engine.  It was developed before there were great engines available for free to build your games with (such as Unreal Engine and Unity).  As such, the developers made their own engine, which allows them to custom tailor it to their game.  It also means that upgrades are more difficult and solely on the shoulders of the development team.  The engine does not handle graphical effects such as particle effects as well as say, Diablo 3's does, and this can cause framerate issues.  As the game has gotten more popular in the past year+, they have been able to expand their team, allowing them to dedicate folks on fixing such issues as well as make regular updates - new content is released every 3 months alternating between an expansion and a smaller content update.  ARPGs are a grindfest, a grind for loot and experience.  PoE keeps things fairly fresh (or gives you a reason to come back every 3 months, at least) by adding regular content.  The 3 month cycle also includes the release of a new challenge leagues, which introduces some new element to the game.  At the end of the challenge leagues, characters from those leagues (there is a hardcore and softcore challenge league) are moved to the permanent hardcore and softcore leagues.  Sometimes the content/mechanics from these challenge leagues is permanently added to the core game, sometimes it is not.  There are a couple things (like stash space and special stash tabs that make organizing things & trading things easier) that are available for purchase that will make the game more convenient.  I played the game for a long time without paying for anything though as you are in no way impaired from enjoying the game without extra stash space.  Cosmetic items make up the bulk of the cash shop, and provide no stat bonuses or any kind of edge other than looking different.  In conclusion: If you like ARPGs, you really ought to give this a try.  It's better (in my opinion) than any other game in this genre, releases new content updates far more often as well, and all of the other games in the genre cost money to play (Marvel Heroes being the other exception).  Even if you don't end up liking it more than Diablo 3 or Grim Dawn, I highly recommend at least giving Path of Exile an hour or two.  You may find, a couple thousand hours later, you're still learning new things about the game and still having a lot of fun playing it.			"

												This game was really good back when the developers had nothing but their life savings and pure drive. Now they have access to money, employees, etc.The game is now, as of this league, (for me) the best MMORPG / MMOARPG on the market.I say do not say something like this lightly, I've played pretty much every MMO released in the west to date. I've been playing MMORPG's since Lineage 1 days. I am disturbed by the design stagnation happening in the current MMO scene. Clone after clone, trope after trope. Why deviate too strongly when a formula works? PoE has so much freaking depth and just keeps getting bigger every patch. More stuff is added to the game than I can keep up with. Which is a good thing, mostly.I'd like to just do a pros/cons bullet list to keep this as short winded as possible. (Ended up being long winded anyway)Pros:* Intense skill customization. You can take a skill gem, socket it in a piece of gear, link other gems with it and change how the main skill functions. * Gigantic skill tree, allowing for very custom builds.* Uniques do very hilarious and weird things, allowing for even more customization* Endless endgame. Endgame comes in the form of maps and currency accumulation. Maps are basically paper portals into other dimensions. You can enchant these maps with mods of your choosing. They are randomized to a degree, but you can tweak them.* I should also mention that maps aren't the entire endgame. Technically you use the ""Map Device"" to access the rest of the endgame, but there's like tons of bosses and specialty fights.* A very cool currency/enchanting system that is in of itself a goldsink. You use the *currency* items to change... well, lots of things in the game. Items, treasure chests, maps* The more wealth you have the stronger you are, no lockouts whatsoever on any content, love it or hate it* Is going to do away with multiple difficulties for acts, will have one straight playthrough with 10 acts in version 3.0* Devs actually listen and adjust the game both to their vision, and player suggestion* Due to constant additions to systems in the game, has yet to get boring, I've never been so engaged in a game. When I grind, I don't watch netflix. That's huge. * Customer support is on point man, they'll hold your hand through whatevs.* Game is full of secrets. Secret undiscovered vendor recipes, the whole fishing thing, entire game reeks of conspiracy* Lends itself to playing with friends, socializingNeutral:* Uniques in general drop often. Later in the game, you just leave them on the ground. They do this because there's many ""Build Enabling"" uniques in the game. It still feels weird leaving uniques behind, or vendoring them.* Top tier gameplay (anybody who wants to be efficient and progress) absolutely requires constant trading, unless you play Solo Self Found, which limits prevents you from partying or trading with others. Some days I love trading, it's a fun interactive experience. This game taught me how to barter, haggle. Other days I get really, really tired of trading face to face with everybody. I feel there needs to be an inbetween.Cons:* The depth is also a negative, they keep making improvements to make the game more newbie friendly, just not quite to where it needs to be yet. There's so much to take in, it can be a major deterrent.* The wealth = power thing with no restrictions lends itself to RMT. This really shouldn't be a con though, if you allow players to trade in a game like this, it's going to happen to any game. It's a design issue that can't easily be addressed due to human tendencies. Removing or restricting trading would completely destroy this game though, because it's built for it from the core. * The whole game is a giant flippin' casino. You can smack your first zombie in the game and it can potentially drop an item that would payroll anything your sweet little heart could dream of for a league. This will be moved to the Pros section as soon as I get a Mirror of Kalandra, or T1 unique drop. *sexually implicative wink in GGG's general direction** It's an ARPG, it can still get repetitive* Technical issues, sometimes. Each league and patch is different for me and my friends.* If you're unlucky, progressing as a casual can be tough, depending on your goals.Overall I highly suggest you give it a try, the game just hit peak players this league and I'm sure 3.0 will push those numbers even higher. PS - Oh yeah, and the game is totally free, but you probably knew that.			"

												The best isometric aRPG I've ever played... and it's free. That should be enough to get you to try the game; a character-limit in-depth review follows:OVERVIEWA top-down isometric action RPG. This genre has for many years been called ""Diablo clones"", and no doubt the game feels like Diablo -- questing, levelling up, finding gear, and using skills to kill stuff -- but the systems behind the gameplay are really well thought out, and especially the skill system is much deeper than any other aRPG.Path of Exile is completely, utterly free. And don't let this dissuade you from trying it, because I think it's the best isometric aRPG I've ever played. Microtransaction cash offers no competitive advantage in the game, just cosmetic enhancements, extra stash tabs, and character slots. So if the game sounds interesting, just try it for yourself! But meanwhile, here's why you should:STORYOkay, let's be honest: This probably isn't a game you're playing for the story. Without the huge budget of a Blizzard Entertainment, you're not going to get 3-minute epic cutscenes that draw you in with movie quality. Grinding Gear Games seems to have focused on making the game good instead, and I support that decision. That being said, the underlying narrative isn't bad per se, just fairly standard and doesn't really distinguish itself.GRAPHICSThe graphics are perfectly good for my purposes. They look decent, even if they didn't blow me away in the fully zoomed out mode. They actually look pretty good zoomed in, but of course when enemies can attack you from offscreen even fully zoomed out, nobody is going to play zoomed in. Regardless, the graphics made the game much more gritty. While Diablo went cartoonish, and Torchlight was brightly colored and animated, the world of Wraeclast is dark and dangerous, and everything in the game re-enforces that harshness. Levels are nicely differentiated: cavernous dungeons, a waste of sunken ships, temples of polished marble, rocky cliffs, forests, etc. Some of the dungeons are really downright creepy. As are some enemies. Heck, even your hero -- You are a criminal, an exile, and as such are portrayed with a harsh ugliness that works pretty well. Other minor things show attention to detail, like arrows sticking out of enemies or walls after you fire them. While the graphics may not impress on a technological level, the art direction here is well done.(I'm also led to believe that various spell effects become a lot more impressive-looking if you buy a microtransaction.)SOUNDI didn't really notice the sound. And I think that's not a bad thing; while it would be nice to have music tracks that really blew me away, other than that I tend to think good sound in a game is like good service at a restaurant -- mostly invisible, because it delivers what you need without belaboring the point. Creepy areas felt creepy, spiders skittered, armor clanked, spell effects were satisfying, and perhaps most importantly, commentary from my character was just frequent enough to be interesting. I easily tire of games where my character blathers on every third minute with the same tired catchphrases. Likewise, there was never any lull in music where the game felt too silent, nor irritating track repeated so often that an annoying melody got stuck in my head. So I'll again say the sound is perfectly fine; unlikely to impress, but no negative marks here either.GAMEPLAY MECHANICSAh, finally the thing that matters most, and the reason you should be downloading this game right now. The fighting itself is fairly standard aRPG; click on things and push letters to use various skills to attack the enemies. There's more strategy than that, because you can drop traps and totems and have forking and radius skills etc. etc. But the systems behind all of this game are what put Path of Exile far ahead of the pack. So let's talk about them. There are a lot of small things that show some thought behind the game, from the various loot settings, to the ease of dropping into pick-up groups, to the simple way instances are handled, to the large 4-tabbed stash shared between all of your characters. But the main gameplay innovations, the reasons Path of Exile is the game I've been playing non-stop for weeks on end, can be divided into two main categories: Skills, and Economy.SKILLSSkills in Path of Exile are complex. The briefest way to describe it is that their active skills were inspired by Final Fantasy VII, and their passive skills by Final Fantasy X. But that would be far from giving you the whole story.So, the first thing to explain is that any character can gain any skill. Your class determines starting stats and starting location in the ""Skill Forest"". Every active skill exists in the form of a gem that is red (str), green (dex), or blue (int). Gear has sockets of those colors to hold gems. When a gem is placed into your gear, you now have that skill. Skill gems can be removed at any time, so no worries about experimenting. Some gear has linked sockets, allowing you to equip support gems that augment other linked gem skills. Equipped gems gain experience over time, and you can choose to level them up, raising their power, but also raising the stat requirements. So any character can use any skill, but it will be tougher for a Marauder to use a level 15 Firestorm than it will for a Witch. Each time you level up, you will receive one passive skill point to spend in the Skill Forest. The Skill Forest contains something like 1,350 nodes. No, that's not a typo. There are 1,350 places to spend skill points. So even if you maxed out your character after a year of playing to the highest level, you'd have covered less than 1/10 of the grid.There are basic +10 to a stat nodes, and your character will start near many of their favored stat, although you can follow a path anywhere you like. There are nodes to improve spellcasting, movement, accuracy, damage, and so on. At various places on the grid, there are clusters of nodes that grant bonuses to each weapon type or elemental damage type. Some nodes add life, evasion, or energy shield. Some nodes add resists, block rates, or criticals. Bigger nodes are fewer and farther between, but each one gives a benefit generally more than twice as good as a standard small node. And then there are keystone nodes. These giant circular nodes around the edges of the grid tend to be huge trade-offs that completely change your character. Eldritch Battery removes your character's energy shield, converting it entirely to extra mana. Chaos Innoculation reduces your life to 1, but makes you immune to chaos(poison) damage. Either one will change your character drastically; taking both will kill you. Other skills remove your armor, your evasion, or even your ability to deal damage with active skills, offering various trade-offs in return.Anyway, the skill system is incredibly complex, and while there are thankfully respec points you can gain by questing in game (and more from certain loot), it's worth pre-planning skills.ECONOMYPath of Exile has no gold.Because there is no accumulating pile of money, there is no money sink of repairs or potions. (Flasks are equipment items that refill automatically as you kill enemies, and can be enchanted.) Vendoring items nets you various orbs, and vendor items have orb purchase prices. But the key difference is that everything has inherent value. Orbs do not just accumulate uselessly like gold in many of these games, because every orb has inherent value. They improve your items in different ways, allowing you to enchant your new hybrid flask, reroll the enchantment on your boots, and reroll the number of sockets on your armor. Crafting is complex.CONCLUSIONSkill Forest is complex too. Path of Exile is aiming for hardcore gamers when other games are streamlining more casual. This is a game by gamers, for gamers, and it shows.			"

												And so you start your journey in Path of Exile. You look at the massively overwhelming passive tree and feel like running a mile. You'll either be blessed with awesome loot drops or cursed with crap all because RNG. Your first character, or even second, will probably feel rubbish eg. too slow, too squishy, not enough damage etc and you'll most likely struggle with later game content because of said character. In a word, this game is rather overwhelming for a new player and it's important to note that it is not on the casual side when it comes to ARPGS like, for example, Torchlight II. If you're looking for a more relaxed ARPG that you don't need to invest a bit of time into then this game isn't for you.However, if you can overcome some of those hurdles then you're in for a treat. As you start to learn the importance of different defences, capped resistances, allocating your passive skill points in a way that perfectly synergises with your skills and gear, skill gem setups, game mechanics and more, you'll start to end up with a rather satisfyingly strong character. You'll begin to understand about crafting, what all those currency orbs mean and vendor recipes (the Path of Exile wiki will be your bible!). And of course, the never-ending quest for amazing loot and GG items.So, if you're looking for an Action RPG that has a lot of depth to it, that offers a ton of replayability, a game that you can grow and learn with, offers a plethora of builds that are only limited by your imagination and has a fantastic Free to Play model, then this game is for you.

												I rate this game HoursPlayed/10.What's it about?Path of Exile is not a game for everyone. That said, it's a game with many facets to explore that is certain to scratch some niche itches better than any other.In essence, a character in PoE is a means to an end which is up to you to decide on.Typical characters can do any generic content alone with relative ease but within that spectrum there's a huge variety of character types tailored to each preference and if what you like doesn't exist yet, you can most certainly try your hand at creating it.What's this variety you speak of?To name a few general archetypes amongst the quite literal thousands of possibilities:• Melee - with access to a large variety of weapon types (recently expanded upon in the 2.0 Awakening expansion with the exotic Maraketh weapons) and build enabling unique items with special properties. You can wield a shield and a weapon for what is traditionally the most defensive approach, take up dual wielding any two melee weapon types which provides less blocking chance than a shield but enables many interesting combos and 'stat-stick' strategies, and of course you can take the typical barbarian approach and wield a variety of two-handed weapons that allow you to stomp everything in your wake;• Spell Caster - there are droves of spells in PoE. There are your three classical elements in Fire, Cold and Lightning as well as Chaos and Physical spells thrown in for good measure. The latter have been greatly expanded upon in the recent 2.1 Talisman content update. Spell casters can, like melee characters, wield a shield, two weapons or a single two-handed weapon. But unlike the attack-based characters, spell-casters' damage is provided by their skill gems directly rather than the weapon, which only grants bonuses to the damage. There exist a variety of elemental statuses and styles of spell with different interactions; the main categories being AoE spells and Projectile spells, all with a unique twist or mechanic that more often than not results in different gameplay;• Archer - although archers will be the characters who most often play generically, they've been a solid bet during the game's history thanks to their clear speed and ease of play. As an archer you  have a choice between bows and quivers. Most attacks will use your bow to deal damage with the exceptions being Explosive Arrow and Caustic Arrow, which deal damage based on the skill gem (akin to spell casters, but restricted to a bow). There also exist wandslingers in PoE, which use their wands to directly damage enemies rather than through spells. Usually regarded as 'wanders', they are best known for being a hybrid between a bow user and a shield wielder, sacrifing damage for defense at range;• Summoner -  I'd venture to guess you don't think this warrants being distinguished, and they really are what you are likely picturing: a pet class. But in PoE the variety of combinations has spawned a plethora of different summoner types, generally coming down to builds specialising in either permanent minions or temporary minions to do your bidding, stacking auras or stacking survivability (with the strongest end-game builds acchieving both). To the inexperienced, a summoner may become synonymous with a necromancer in most other games, but in reality there is good reason for the nomenclature used - not all summons in PoE are necromantic. A good variety of them are animatronic. The game includes a variety of golems and two animatronic minions you can use directly that are solid components of builds (as well as some you can access indirectly through the Rampage mechanic).Secondly, there are characters that are fit for very specific purposes rather than generic content (maps) such as: boss farming (atziri/uber), ""culling"" (finishing off bosses with gear that augments loot dropped), and even pure supporting (Whispering Ice/Ice Shot/Aurabot and some brands of summoner). These can be built with wide variation and Uber builds are theorycrafted and discussed very often.These are only examples. There's everything in-between. Spell casters can wield bows to gain projectile speed which results in incredible range, or for damage conversion. Every spell and bow ability can be turned into a mine that can be detonated at will or a trap that is triggered when stepped on. Wandslingers can forfeit damaging enemies directly and turn into a hybrid that shoots out spells triggered by attacks. You can set yourself on fire and run into people. Seriously.There are many ways to build your character defensively too, usually focusing on either life or shield for building an effective HP pool and regeneration, leech, armour, evasion or elemental resistances for mitigation of damage taken. Or a mixture of all of them to your liking.The same equipment that provides defenses also provides the sockets for your skill gems that you gain from quests and drops or acquire from NPC vendors. This creates another layer of customization, since you can also socket modifiers called Support Gems that alter your skills' behaviour if their sockets are linked, and there are tens of these modifiers for you to create what is essentially your own custom skill with.The Node ForestDid I mention the passive skill tree? There's a passive skill tree.It has 1325 nodes.Although it may sound rather intimidating, it is only a web that connects all 7 classes and grants passive bonuses to your character. Traversing it is quite easy if your mind is honed for efficiency.It's where a lot of the magic happens when you're new, and you will fall in love with it as your understanding develops.What now?If you have a knack for collecting, grinding or engineering, my recommendation is for you specifically. Welcome to theorycrafting heaven, exile.Post Scriptum:The original review consisted of the first line only.And now, over a hundred people have added me because of this review. I don't mind you adding me, but please do it if you have a question or need help, not if you might have a question or might need help in the future. Thanks for saving both of our time, enjoy your hacking and slashing.			"

												This is what Diablo 3 should have been. I have been playing since the beta. I have yet to discover a lot of things in the game but still like this a lot. I would recommend this on any other ARPG.Pros:- Free to play with no pay to win- This game will keep you entertained for long- The community is very active- Devs are a great bunch and listen to feedback actively- Great Immersion- Great Depth- Regular content updates and patches- Everything is slot-able. Skills, maps, etc.- Lot of character build optionsCons- The depth can be overwhelming for new players- Games mechanics might take some time getting used to.- Some skills have desync lags. After 2.0 Update this has been fixed a lot with new mechanisms.- Kills your social life. :P			"

												Comparing D3 and PoE is like comparing summer camp and boot camp. In D3, Hi! welcome to the game! Here are bunch of stuff to get you started. Oh you killed your 1st boss? CONGRATULATIONS have some more legendary loot!! You've been playing for hours and feeling like not getting enough loot? Here! have some more legendaries!In PoE, Alright you maggots! here are some basic rules and take this piece of crap and get killing. GO! GO! GO! 1st boss kill huh? WELL WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME FOR,  DO I LOOK LIKE A FRIGGIN' CHARITY TO YOU? Get your♥♥♥♥♥to the next stage GO! GO! GO! What's that? you've been playing for hours and nothing good? BOO F!@KING HOO! You want uniques? You gotta grind like a cheap hooker and work like a kid in a chinese sweatshop I guess what I'm saying is, in D3, there are lots of hand holding, nurtring and caring. While PoE will abuse you, drag you through mud, abuse you some more and then maybe, just maybe throw you a bone  but for some reason, you want to keep going and keep coming back for more.			"

												Imagine yourself exiled to a grimdark fantasy Australia where nothing stays dead and you start with a rusty sword or a driftwood club or the like. Welcome to Wraeclast, land of darkness, crappy loot and addictive, ARPG gameplay. To some, Path of Exile is merely regarded as the anti-Diablo 3. While it is true that it takes a very different route in the evolutionary path of the ARPG, to call it a better game, or a worse one, or even the ""real Diablo 3"" all fail to accurately describe it, though that being said the similarities to Diablo 2 are noticable, down to minute details like the scrolling NPC dialogue boxes and the translucent map overlay. In terms of combat difficulty Path of Exile is actually roughly analogous to Diablo 3. Where it greatly defers in its character progression. Where in Diablo 3 you unlock skills and passives in a linear fashion and can swap them around freely, Path of Exile has a unique, wide-open and very daunting system based around active skill gems and web of passive skills. I was actually scared away from the game at first simply because I didn't think I had the smarts for it. Path of Exile defies several common mechanics of Diablolikes. There is no limited item durability, but most uniquely there is no money: items are instead traded for crafting ingredients, with scraps of identify scrolls representing the lowest denomination of value. Each of the game's seven character classes have no actual abilities- these are instead tied to the skill gems, which in the style of Final Fantasy's materia crystals are slotted into color-matched slots on your gear, all of which has at least one of these slots. None of these gems are dependent on class but they are dependent on one of only three core stats: strength, dexterity or intelligence, each color coded and tied to an elemental damage type, fire, ice or lightning. Equipment drops you find will usually be of the lowest quality (anther contrast with Diablo 3, which in its current state makes a point of giving you good, class-flavored equipment drops), but any piece of equipment can be modified to a usable state using crafting items- that being said, you will eventually be required to do this as the ratio of good quality, level-appropriate drops starts out ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and only gets worse as you progress, and it will frustrate you. Potions are not stacked the disposable ton but are equipment unto themselves, slotted into your belt with random stats of their own, and charged by defeating enemies- making Path of Exile the only ARPG I know of to have legendary-quality potion bottles! By far the most interesting feature is the skill tree, which is really more of a skill spider web, with all passive abilities earned in the game tied to nodes on the web. Each of the seven classes begins at a certain point on this web near nodes flavored to them, but each can eventually be built in virtually any way you want, to use any weapons, gear and skill gems in the game. Your character does not gain attribute points automatically on a level up, merely a single skill point, which can be spent on a +10 boost to an attribute or something flashier, like attack speed, life drain. The web is laid out as sort of a highway with exits leading to cul-de-sacs, which often contain powerful capstone passives that add things like 20% faster mana regen, but require an investment of skill points to unlock the nodes leading to them. You will need to strike a balance between raising your stats and obtaining critical passive skills. This is where the hidden challenge of the game comes in, though: while virtually any build works just fine for Normal difficulty, on higher ones the game outright punishes you for any poor build choices, though thankfully respecs are plentiful enough that you have at least some room to experiment. I have played through each of the classes at least once, on Normal difficulty, as the game follows the Diablo 2 style progression where beating the game on one difficulty allows you to progress to then next in a linear fashion. I found myself enjoying each in their own way, but found myself most comfortable using a Duelist (the strength/dexterity hybrid class) built for fast, hard attacks with two-handed swords. For a free game, the depth of customization, quality of music, sound and voice work, the developer's commitment to non-pay-to-win cash shop items and the overall quality of the game in general is remarkable. The game has received a number of large content updates since launch, all free, including end-game random dungeon generation, a number of NPC crafters with reputation missions, and most notably an entire fourth story act bringing the game to a spectacular, blood-soaked conclusion. If you love ARPGs but perhaps crave more stat-crunching, min-maxing, and build challenge then Diablo 3 can provide, Path of Exile may be just what you're looking for. For me, it offered exactly what I loved most about Diablo 3- non-stop, click-mashing action in a dark fantasy universe with plenty of zombies, skeletons, monsters, misshapen horrors and some truly despicable villains I could really, really hate. Take a journey into nightmare, and walk the Path of Exile with me. You won't regret it.The Doctor's Final Report: 9/10; If you enjoyed Diablo 2 or just ARPG style games, then you absolutely cannot go wrong with this title. Its a free game that does not have a Pay to Win system attached to it. The variety of character styles and builds is amazing and before you know it, you will have accumulated hundreds of hours in this one.			"

												BOY! this game is a Diablo fans dream! 99% Free to play, and 0% Pay to win, only thing you can buy from the ""microtransaction"" store is cosmetics and more shared player storage, even though you get like 4 pages for free. Me and three buddies got this game and started a new character together, next thing you know, we logged almost 8 hours in one session. This game is fun to play in single player, but the real joy is sharing the fight in Wraeclast. Pros:-THE LOOT: Holy Saint Hugh Mungus there is a lot of it, but never enough to quench your thirst for more. The Devs really    know what we want because they even let you make your own loot filters so you can sort through all the trash easily.-GRAPHICS: Ever wonder what Diablo 2 would look like if you could play in 1080p with amazing textures? Well its just like that....BUT EVEN BETTER! This world is beautiful, and not just one of the biomes, ALL of them. With an ever changing landscape and diverse enemies, this game never gets old.-SKILLTREE: your class doesn't define your skill tree, but where you start in THE skill tree. I mean just Google Path of Exile skill tree, go to images, and look at it in all its glorious beauty. the skill tree is almost as big as the map, and with diversity like that, everyone can have their own *extremely* personalized play style with stats to show it. oh and did I mention that the all skill tree abilities are passive? surprised? well its time to talk about...-GEMS: In most items there is sockets, and they are used to equip these gems, and the gems are where your real q,w,e,r,t skills come from. So there is no limit on what you can use besides your stats, which you can set to your liking. You can also assign these skills to MOUSE 1-3-CRAFTING: there is no in game currency, like ""gold"", but you collect crafting materials and such that you can trade to other players, but you need to be level 25 to trade em. (psst...you can drop them for your friends when in a party and outside a town) this is, in my opinion, one of the most interesting and fun features of this game.*{IMPORTANT}* !!!CONS!!! *{IMPORTANT}*-that you're still reading this review and not playing the game...DOWNLOAD NOW, IF YOU DONT LIKE IT I WILL PERSONALLY GIVE YOU YOUR ""FREE"" BACK.EDIT 1: Well after puting +70 hours into this game in one week ive switched to to the standalone launcher so I dont have to be faced with my hours every time i play this game...

												Before I download a F2P MMO, I need to know if the game is P2W.Path of Exile (PoE) does not sell:Experience boostersItem rarity/quantity boosters (increased through gear only)Stat buffs (increased through gear/skills only)Skill tree resets (through in-game currency only)Cosmetic items with stats Item quality (increased through in-game currency only)Megaphones (global chat is open access)DLCs (non-soundtrack)The only items in the microtransactions (MTX) store which benefit your charactors directly are the 'currency tabs,' 'stash tabs,' and 'premium stash tabs.' Stash tabs: Each account has access to four stash tabs by default, sufficient to reach end-game content with. No problem here.Currency tabs: Functions as a bank. The max stack of currency items is increased (20 for orbs of alterations, for example) to 5000. It is worth noting buying stash tabs is more bang for your buck if you don't amass lower tier currency, as currency tabs cannot contain items. For comparison, currency tabs are able to 5000 of each currency, while stash tabs are a grid of 144 boxes, each able to hold one stack of currency. Allocating one of your four default stash tabs for currency will suffice. No problem here.Premium stash tab: Default stash tabs which can be renamed, colored, and set to public. The benefit of purchasing this tab is for the easy indexing (selling) of items.Grinding Gear Games faced community backlash when they released the option of setting these tabs to public. Public premium stash tabs are able to be indexed by 'poe.trade', the 'auction house' of the economy. The option of indexing one's stash through the application 'Procurement,' is less efficient and not implemented as an in-game function.If you do plan on selling items through poe.trade instead of trade chat, and index through premium stash tabs instead of 'Procurement', you buy one (4 USD), or premium a default tab (1.5 USD) and you're set.Conclusion: To my knowledge, this is one of the best MTX models on the market. It is worth noting you do not need to purchase the forementioned to progress and experience all of which this game has to offer. Contentwise, Path of Exile is an ARPG at the forefront of its genre. It's F2P, there's next to no reason as to why you shouldn't try it yourself instead of taking my word for it. While I downloaded and run PoE on the official standalone client, please feel free to message me on Steam if you need help.			"

												I could recommend this game for a good many reason, most of which I notice have already been mentioned by other reviewers.The best thing, for me, about this game is it's truly open-ended character building. You aren't squished into a rigid, constricted class. Granted, certain classes have certain bonuses to certain stats(ie, Maurader class starts with high strength stats), but beyond that you are perfectly free to build your character into whatever you want them to be.Skills are gained, not through grinding, leveling up and unlocking them, but by finding skill gems throughout the world. The gems fit into color-coded slots on your armor and weapons.Some pros and cons:Pros:-Free to Play but not Pay to Win-Easy enough to get into if you have the time. No real background in RPGs needed to enjoy this game.-Plenty, and I mean PLENTY to do. You will not be bored.-Maps are randomly generated labrynths. No dungeon will ever be the same twice.-(this could be a con depending on your tastes) hoards of monsters that inhabit each dungeon. Getting strong enough to mow them down like blades of grass is oh, so satisfying.-A unique barter system that cuts out gold or other currencies from the game. New players don't start out poor and feel they have to grind just to buy good gear.-Diablo style loot system. You're going to find the best stuff out there in the game world, not in an NPC's shop.-(Mostly personal preference here:) No constantly buying potions. Flasks that fill with health potion or mana potion are found as drops ingame and are refilled each time you slay an enemy.Cons:-If you like it, it will take over your life.-Definitely not casual. When you sit down to play, plan on spending at least two hours on one play session.-Quests become somewhat repetative. ""Go here, find this. Come back with something to prove it."" Sort of thing. Each dungeon being unique helps cut out any sense of monotony, though.-Waypoints are few and far between. At maximum, there is one per map. Some maps have multiple levels to them, and the waypoint exists only on one specific level. Some maps lack a waypoint entirely.-Won't run on a toaster. I tried downloading this game on my old windows 7 toaster, and the game never even made it past the loading screen.Overall, especially considering the price tag, I am calling this my favorite rpg ever. The graphics are beautiful.The voice acting blew me away considering this is F2P. It's dark and mysterious. Even now that I feel I'm getting the hang of it, I still feel a sense of forboding whenever I enter a new portion of a dungeon.Some people might call this a Diablo cheap knock-off. Cheap? Well, only if you mean the price tag. It's a very well-thought-out and well-made game. Diablo knock-off? Maybe. It does borrow heavily from the Diablo franchise. I can't personally say how much as I don't play Diablo; but I notice the similarities whenever I watch a youtube video involving the Diablo games and for a moment think ""Hey, is that Path of Exile?""

												Here's a few metaphors to describe what I think of this game from a very hardcore Diablo fan.Diablo 1 is an ugly expensive antique painting that most of us don't care for, but still appreciate it's existence and the influence it's done.Diablo 2 is a long lost vault filled with treasure and gold, diamonds, and riches as far as the eye could see, and will be remembered for years and years to come.Diablo 3 is an infamous ragged old satchel with a couple of gold coins in it, and once in a while a couple new coins gets dropped in out of pity.Path of Exile is a graceful, elegant, and awe-inspiring golden statue of a fabled goddess that tries to breathe comfort and love into those who had their heart and souls crushed by Diablo 3.

Pros-Free.-Money can't give you an advantage (aside from more stash tabs...).-Immense depth, pleasant mechanics.-Satisfying and relaxing gameplay.-Enorm lasting appeal and replayability-Fun expansions, there's always something new to do.-Great diversity of gameplay.-Amazing developpers.-Everything always seems well-thought and polished, few bugs and imbalances.-Massive skill tree:http://i.imgur.com/7QeaYe4.jpgCons-Updates are unbelievably long. And there's a lot of them. And me here thinking I'd play some PoE tonight. Sigh.Brief descriptionIn this game, you will stare as an exile fighting for their life in a chaotic world where the only thing you can count on is monsters assaulting you at each and every step you take. You will equip yourself with the best swords, maces, bows, axes, claws or wands and the optimal armor pieces you can get a hang on, and choose the best skills you can gather the power to use in your fight against an endless horde of sanguinary monsters. Along the road, you will become stronger and stronger with each battle in your quest to defeating the evils of the world.The game plays in a god-like view in a real-time combat game.Verdict Definitely	 recommend this game. I mean, it's free, what's the harm in trying?			"

If I could only play one game for the rest of my life, I would pick Path of Exile without thinkingI feel like I should let you future players know that my steam time does not reflect my actual playtime what so ever, I started in 2011 in closed beta and has mostly used the non steam client due to faster load times, which is now fixed on the steam client.THIS GAME RUINED MY SOCIAL LIFEPath of Exile is by far the most advanced arpg you will find on the market, with the possiblity to make your own unique character with different skills and make them work for end-game.Want to play a str based class with fireball as your main skill, no problem its totally doable in path of exile.Want to afk while having a billion summons kill stuff for you, no problem path of exile has that to.Path of exile is constantly updated by a very dedicated team!The learning curve for the game can be quite high due to how punishing the game can be at certain situations not to mention the gigantic passiv skill tree that will make your jaws drop when you see it for the first time.Basic tips that might save your life during your first playtroughInvest heavily into % life based passive skills.Always keep your resistances as high as you can (Becomes crucial in merciless)Playing a caster might be easier for your first playtrough, I recommend witch with the skill called ArcPath of Exile - Wikia[pathofexile.gamepedia.com] Contains all the useful information you will need.Support gems are used to boost your active skills making them stronger with unique effects.Orbs is the main currency in path of exile, you will find all kinds of different orbs when traveling trough wraeclast. Main orb for trading is called chaos orb.Dont worry about screwing up on your first character, we have all been there.Path of Exile is like a cluster♥♥♥♥ of Diablo 2 + Titan's Quest all mixed togheter to form the perfect ARPG.The way you get skills in this game is to activate the skill gem into a item slot with a open socket, blue, red or green. And then link them togheter with other skills (support skills) to for example give fireball 5 additional projectiles and fire penetration, faster casting.The customization in path of exile is endless and is in my opinion the reason why so many players keeps playing the game.There are 3 difficulties in the game called: normal, cruel and merciless. The last two features exp penalty for dying, similar to diablo 2.End-game in path of exile consists of doing different kinds of map that comes in different tier levels aswell as doing ubers.Did I mention you can design your own hideout?PVP updateI noticed that I forgot to add anything regarding pvp so here it goesPVP in path of exile is very very unbalanced at high lvl duels where someone can just kill you off screen or  run straight into you and kill you with rightheous fire.If you are looking for semi balance pvp that are actually fun I highly suggest that you check out the LLD bracket (low level duels) where your max level is 28. Less skills, better balance and way more fun.You can gear yourself up semi quickly with just some basic rares and then work your way up to god statusOr you can simply select a premade level 28 character for example witch with freeze pulse or templar with firestorm I believe.The pvp in poe is not as balanced as in let's say diablo 2, but its still hell alot of fun!

												So, as i'm writing this i got over 2100 hours in it.Still learning new mechanics, new set-ups and enjoying it as much as i did 2099 hours ago.Path of Exile brings you a great selection of different playstyles and builds to do. As a beginner i would recommend copying others builds for a start to learn the game and the different classes.What makes Path of Exile so great is that there is no such thing as ""you can only play melee as the 'marauder'"" or ""The witch can only be played as a spellcaster"". Sure, the witch is better at spellcasting than the marauder initially, but depending on your build a Marauder can do just as much damage as a spellcaster as the Witch.What makes Path of Exile hard for beginners is learning the passive tree and where to go, It's MASSIVE (1325 passive skills as i'm writing this), but i highly recommend anyone with some time to try it out!The lategame offers a map system that you yourself as the player can craft the map mods and what you prefer.Grinding Gear Games (the people who made it) are very dedicated and updates the game frequently. So far any time i've found something strange like a bug i've always managed to get in touch with them and they've helped me with the problem at hand. I'm not entirely sure what more to write, just try it! See you in Wraeclast!			"

												I don't know what Blizzard is doing or why are their heads so far up their behind, but Path of Exile is what we expected from Diablo 3 when we were waiting for it and as time went on, Diablo 3 only got worse and worse, simpler and dumber.On the other hand it seems like with every patch, league and DLC, Path of Exile becomes a better and more mature game. It is precisely crafted for the people who love ARPGs and aren't afraid to dive deep.It has everything you loved in Diablo 2 and sooo much more. The biggest downsides in PoE are probably the massive learning curve and the fact gameplay feels very slow and clunky in the beginning, a big reason why many people quit before they even understand it. Once you break through this entrance barrier, you can say goodbye to your social life.			"

												A for sure reccommend that does a great job reminding us that games can make us plan ahead and think that aren't RTS's. Path  of exile delivers great and fluid combat and interface mechanics that any veteran of Dungeon Crawler or Newcomer to the genre will find super comfortable. The true star of this game is the spider web like ""Passive Talent Tree"" that had me and my friends taking repeated breaks to discuss and strategize our grandeur plans for winding our way through it too make our ultimate Loot Grabber.  This tree takes the place of the all familiar splinter tree from most RPG's and at first glance can be overwhelming cause like most gamers we shun new things, but now that I've played in it, I feel like it will be hard to go back to the old way. Grinding Gears also does a great job in changing around other tropes of the genre most notably being the removal of currency. Instead now you use scrolls and other items that serve other purposes all well, so each purchase holds more weight and just like everything in this game requieres you to way the pro and cons to each decision. Being a impulse shopper can come back and bite you. You will also forgo the common center laid hotbar for a new move system where socketed gems which are inserted into armor and weapons that level up themselves determine your move set. This in combonation with the skill tree lead to and endless ammount of customization for your character. Performance wise the game has run great and I have very little bugs and none that jump too mind enough to note. Grinding Gears took their time too polish and while the graphics are not going to take any records they have not once felt outdated. Too some up this rant, I reccommend it highly. Cause it does what many recent dungeon crawlers have failed too do, and thats keep me and my friends discussing our trees, comparing our DPS and spending countless ours spilling the blood of anything that come within our mouse click, and then sifting the loot of course.

												POE is basically an ARPG based loosely off the Diablo system.  From what I have read about POE many old Diablo programmers are involved with POE and its gameplay mechanics.  There are many saying that this is what Diablo 3 should be.  I am not hear for that and would rather not compare the two, as I am one of the few who really enjoy Diablo 3.  POE sports some interesting mechanics in gameplay as there is no gold or currency value in game or auction house of any sorts.  Gems play a big part in leveling your gear and increasing stats.  Inventory loadouts tend to fill quickly as you can not carry much.  The locations and minions of POE universe are interesting and varied.  POE has a rather dark tone to it with violent acts and blood. I do have a gripe with sync/lag as it has been an issue for a while and that nano second where you dont get a hit or take damage in a ARPG is critical and this can be become frustrating.  I do want to note that if you have not played this game yet and get started into it - the game starts very slowly and with very weak environments that are bland and a turn off.  Many people have quit thinking this is what the game will be and it does indeed get more varied and graphically interesting... just need to play through a couple of realms first.For a FTP game this is just an amazing game where I would be willing to pay actual money for it, so I will consider donating with some visual items you can buy directly through Steam in the POE micro transaction shops.  These micro transactions are not pay to win and are cosmetic enhancements for the most part.  In case you missed it - Gamespot announced POE as the PC Game of the Year.  Recommended.			"

												As I approach 1,000 hours...This game deserves a review.I have spent easily $200+ on microtransaction aesthetic content for this game.BECAUSE IT""S THAT ♥♥♥♥♥ING AMAZING.I probably played about 500 hours before I even got to true end-game content. I still havent come close to building every unique character type I would want to yet.I don't think that would be possible given ANY amount of time.If you're reading this and haven't tried this game yet, you're DOING IT WRONG.Play this game. Now.--------------------------- EDIT------------------I decided I would add some actual thoughts on this game, so read on if you're interested in details. By details I mean random thoughts on the game.YES, it is easily considered the diablo 3 that many wanted. It basically has everything diablo fans liked about diablo, and much more of it. Like any game, it's not for everyone, and one of it's strengths is, for some, a weakness; it's complexity. I love the depth of the lvling system, for a ARPG dungeon crawler hack and slash like this. It is certainly less complex than some other RPG games, and far less complex than any pnp like D&D (except maybe 5th edition?)Moments of analysis paralysis spent staring at a skill tree that seems to branch on forever. One person's RPG moment of bliss is another's moment of anxiety and indecision. Analysis paralysis is real, and it lives in this game.That being said, I feel like the game developers have done an amazing job at pacing and creating rewarding gameplay from start to 'finish' so any level of gamer can enjoy time spent playing this game. FOR FREE.The paid content is aesthetic only, no PTW. So nice.There are a decent number of skills to choose from, and skill augmenting.The developers are very active and the game is designed to be actively evolving and adding new content. FOR FREE.I love the design elements of the game, and the quality sound/voice in game.I love the complex end-game gameplay that creates more in-game content than I have ever played ina  single 'season'.What are seasons, you ask? Why every so often (what, twice a year?) The game launches a new season, and all current chars are transfered to 'standard' mode, the only mode that keeps chars forever, but still updates the chanegs in the game as it progresses. Eachs eason brings a new game mechanic, sometimes small expansion, sometimes big. At first, this may seem lame, as it puts a 'timer' on the game, but not really. The seasons last a long time, and a few days is enough time for me to play a char enough to have enjoyed progressing it. And standard season is always an option for reaching epic epicness. So, seasons are really a genius way of encouraging game growth/active developing. Hurrah!You can play for free. FOR FREE.Now, minor crtiques or things to add:1. More ranged weapon classes. Bows. Bows. Bows. MOOOOORRREEEE. Throwing knives, crossbows, grenades, water balloons, WHATEVER. Just add more ranged weapons.2. Maybe a little work on creativity on base character design. They all seem a little typical.. standard? boring? Maybe differentiate the female char's, they look like the same character with different clothes/wig.3. I love this game, and you can play FOR FREE.			"

												Best in class in terms of the action RPG genre. Yes, this is even factoring in the sacred Diablo 2.Hefty learning curve, but huge payoff if you manage to build out and gear up endgame characters. Having decent survivability and tremendous clearspeed/dps is the name of the game here. The most challenging content the game has to offer will require you not to get oneshot to death whilst also testing your human reflexes.Potion system is of note here - you equip permanent flasks that fill up when killing monsters, so there is a constant gameplay loop of kill/heal/kill/heal. It solves the busywork of other games which treat potions as one-use expendables (and annoyingly requiring you to head back to town for a restock). It also avoids the binary choice of having to immediately pickup health orbs (or not) when it comes to games which drop healing powerups instead.Content is it's strongest suit, with the playerbase largely gravitating towards the short-term 3 month leagues. Each league is a fresh start that allows newer players not to feel left behind. Leagues have also traditionally implemented or experimented with) sometimes drastic changes to the game mechanics (from bounty-style sidequest system in the form of Prophecies to AI-controlled enemy exiles who drop significantly better loot.) The development cycle usually follows an alternating league cycle - i.e. 3month league featuring a major expansion, followed by 3month league featuring minor gameplay shakeups, then a possible 3month league that introduces a brand new storyline Act to the game, and so on.Endgame for PoE can be approached several ways:-aiming for the short-term league achievements within the span of 3 months, these typically earn permanent account-based cosmetic rewards.-filling out the endgame Atlas of maps - this game's equivalent of randomised dungeons.-defeating endgame Map Guardians & The Shaper boss - accessible only once you manage to climb your way up the highest tier maps.-various alternate boss farming opportunities (Izaro, Atziri, Council, Breachlords - each with tier own unique way of getting unlocked by the player.)As for paid advantage concerns, the best selling items would be the extra stash tabs accessible in town as well as the various currency stash tabs that organise your looted currency into piles of 5000 pieces each. Content is not gated by money; free players can access the same amount of content as a paid player. This game is also generally not considered pay to win as there are no paid exp-boost, loot-boost or the other usual suspects in other f2p games. Cosmetics are also another source of developer income.Feel free to give it a go. Game is very rewarding if you manage to stick around.			"

												Hi, young female here with 0 gaming experience before this game. My husband is a huge PC gamer and really wanted me to take interest in it. This is the first game I ever looked into and I.LOVE.IT! I downloaded it when it first became available a few years ago and played it all the time. I took a bit of a hiatus after starting D3, but always came back to this game. I still play it to this day and it just gets better and better. I've gotten my husband interested in it, as well. I'm sorry my review isn't very informative, but I'm not an expert in these things. I just know that this game is super fun, has a great storyline, and is for everyone. I definitely recommend!			"

												The most amazing free to play game out there, depth-wise, gameplay-wise and replayability-wise, no doubt about it.Most people often compare D3 vs PoE, then i remind them that a free to play game is putting out more than twice the amount of content as the other game which you'd spend 70-80 euro(with expansion) to play. It's an obvious choice for me, seeing how Diablo 3 has evolved into the kinda game which you play one week out of the season to restart, play with your friends and then you go back to Path of Exile, because this game does not rely on playing with your friends, does not rely on you playing at the start of a league, or in a league at all.As for the game in it's entirety, i feel that the graphics are a tiny bit lacking, it has a bit of frame rate issues because it's not very optimized, which is getting fixed by pretty much every patch, the gameplay has a bit of repetitiveness to it, but you will never ever learn every single thing there is to the game, it is next to impossible, therefore the depth to the game is huge, the tons of possibilites in skill, class, build & item variation is what makes this game just brilliant. I've played this game since closed beta, and i've probably accumulated around 3-4k hours played in the game, and i feel like i'm very lacking in knowledge when it comes to the game still. It's endless fun, and you will not regret giving it a go, aslong as you're willing to put in the hours to make your character succeed!The amazing game that it is, makes up for any issues that there is, ontop of it being F2P, it's just a flat 10 out of 10.

Posted: February 9, 2016
												So I've put a lot of thought into this review and a decent amount of time into the game - over 400 hours - so please don't disqualify this review if you're a longtime supporter of the game.First of all, I have to say that it is extremely enticing and enjoyable for at least a hundred hours of play. That's undeniable, and, to be honest, pretty great for a whopping 0$ required to play.  That's not to download the game - that's in general, period.  You really CAN'T enhance ingame experience much by paying money, and I for one absolutely love that.Here's the problem with the game - and if you're someone who doesn't plan on doing more than having a little fun for a few hours now and then, this probably won't matter to you. But if you're the kind of gamer who really likes endgame content - read on.  The problems that I have with the game are almost 100% related to endgame content, and deep endgame content at that.#1 - The endgame accessibility.It's relatively easy to begin running maps after a maximum of about thirty hours - even if you don't know what you're doing.  When you are running maps, it's fun, challenging, and the content seems new and fresh.  Maps are relatively easy to get - most players will have hundreds of t1s and t2s hanging around. HOWEVER, this is extremely fleeting.  Once you start crafting your maps, they will very quickly become exponentially harder.  If you're an old player reading this, you'll probably laugh my response off because your gear can easily deal with a t2 map with, say, phys reflect and Temporal Chains.  But to new players, this is extremely frustrating because they can't really gain gear or orbs from these maps but also have an extremely difficult time with them.  The better maps you run, the better loot you get - or is it, really? I would contest that maps t1-t7 have generally the same loot reward, and t7s can be extremely difficult for people who don't have access to the loot of higher level maps.  Sure, you could get extremely lucky and get something great - but that's not likely for most of us.#2. The loot.Yes, yes, as with most negative reviews here, I'm going to whine about the loot drop system.  If you're a new player who likes games in the same style as PoE, you'll probably laugh off my condemnation of RNGesus.  Let me explain: If you think you've experienced RNG walls before this, you have not.  Not even CLOSE.  It has nothing to do with luck. It's probably more likely that you'll win Powerball than actually get an item that you're farming for.  Yes, it's possible that you will get something else that you can sell, but this brings me to my third point - the economy.#3. Trading.Pretty quickly into PoE, you'll probably begin to ask this question: ""Why isn't there a public auction house of some sort where I can simply save up orbs and quickly sell and buy loot?""  The answer is that this type of system is extremely dangerous for games such as Path of Exile - and indeed, diablo experienced the repurcussions of incorporating such a system into their game.  The economy is such a huge problem that there have been, since open beta, serious third party clients and websites (Procurement, I'm talking to you) which cater to this demand.  The problem is that there is such a huge volume of loot that it's very, very annoying to scroll through thousands of results for items trying to find out what kind of price the item you're buying should be set at.  And this is a REQUIREMENT FOR ENDGAME CONTENT.  Let me repeat that: it is extremely difficult - or at the very least heavily counterproductive in terms of orb use - to craft your own gear, and it's a requirement to have full tri res gear if you're doing any decent maps.#4. The ability to true create your own build for endgame content.Spoilers! There is no ability for this.  The problem with PoE is that there is a select sect of the population which is SO UNBELIEVABLY GOOD AT THE GAME that all other content scales to them to simply make it interesting - these guys are, of course, the Twitch population.  I'm not talking sour grapes here, I'm quoting GGG - they actually said that ""If we created content that would take streamers weeks to complete rather than days or hours, it would take an average player years to complete it.""  They've created a paradox.  PoE was hailed when it first came out as having a fantastic loot drop system because it allowed players to create unique builds from ""self-found"" items.  And again, that's so great - for the first hundred hours. At the very most.  After that, you better pray you haven't focused a summoning build because you thought it was cool, cause let me tell ya, you're going to need a few dozen ex before you can do any maps with good modifiers.  And, of course, cheap builds that you find online won't stay cheap long.  You cannot genuinely build your own character off your gear because in the long run, all gear is trash unless it has very specific modifiers.  If you're running a niche build rather than a meta build, congrats: you just need slightly different extremely specific modifiers.#5. The devs.Last but far, far from least, I'll address the problem that probably most experienced players have with the game.  Personally, I feel that I haven't gotten to enough of the content to actually have this problem, but I recognize its existence and I feel that I should mention it.  If you ARE a player who has saved up hundreds of ex and perfected their gear, ask yourself these questions: ""What's my favorite build? What do I like the most? What set of mechanics and gear do I like the best?""  The answer to that question is whatever is about to get nerfed next.  Oh, and it won't be a public nerf. That would inspire far too much backlash.  It'll be a nerf that subtly changes the mechanics so that your character will get absolutely terminated all the time.  If you're softcore, that sucks, and if you're hardcore - well, I hope you like softcore, because your character just got sent there for good.  (Again, this isn't sour grapes - I've just heard this story countless times.)So, to sum things up a bit - Path of Exile suffers from a rather unique affliction.  The endgame content is extremely varied and challenging, with lots of depth and ways to modify and improve your experience - but only if you've already spent hundreds and hundreds or thousands of hours playing the game and have the resources to adapt to extremely varied situations.  Getting your own gear from drops is prohibitively difficult, selling your own drops to incrementally obtain said gear is tedious to an extreme and often will result in you getting scammed or at the very least told 'ur a highballer fggt'.  Even without looking at dealing with the varied situations, the basic endgame content itself is so wierdly difficult that it is very hard to understand without large amounts of research.  Turns out that evasion actually kinda sucks, but hey, at least it's not as easy to get one-shot as with armor, right? Better have both! Oh, damn. That gear looks like it's a few dozen exalts.  Bummer.At the end of my Path of Exile run, I felt like I was no longer actually playing the game.  I was grinding in an unusually unpleasant manner for items which ultimately would be basically useless and chosen entirely at random.  I felt that the game itself had huge amounts of promise but eventually did not deliver.  It is grueling at the very least and indescribably frustrating for most of the time.  It got to the point where I simply did not enjoy the game anymore - the choices were either to suicide into unplayable content trying to get gear that would make said content playable or to re-grind endlessly the beginning map content and get no xp or items.Maybe I'll revisit the game at a later point in time, but at the moment I can't imagine wanting to return anytime soon.

TL;DR SUMMARY: 70% modernised Diablo 2, 30% cool new ideas and improvements. A fun, very well-made classic hack'n'slash with good graphics (especially spell/skill effects), great sound and music, dark atmosphere and good story, as well as nicely designed and quite varied locations. Plus of course, the MASSIVE ability tree (which is surprisingly easy to navigate) and a ton of skills/spells to choose from with lots of ways to build your character that actually punishes inexperienced players much less than in most other games. Absolutely worth playing whether you're looking for a few dozen hours of fun or hardcore serious business online gaming, especially that for some reason this game is FREE TO PLAY (and the only purchasable items are cosmetics - lots of them - no pay to win whatsoever).FULL REVIEW: Okay, so it seems most reviews for this game are either ""my turtle left me"" or 5000h played talking about how good the balance is on the endgame maps after you finish the Merciless difficulty, so this is the nub casual review for people who are bored and went ""wat how is this f2p"" like I did upon seeing this game.As said above, this game is MASSIVELY inspired by Diablo 2 - similar dark and gloomy overall atmosphere (and a world - or rather region - which is so screwed they'd rather have an apocalypse), familiar-looking red and blue health and mana spheres, familiar-looking inventory that even includes the I/II weapon switching, familiar-looking scrolling dialogues, familiar-looking ability tr-NO WAIT HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥HOW MASSIVE IS THIS THING THIS IS LIKE ONE MILLION ABILITIESPath of Exile brings some really cool new ideas and improvements to the table - as justifiably praised in nearly every review out there, the passive ability tree here is ENORMOUS, but after the initial ""mind blown"" feeling, it's actually quite easy to navigate. It really is very open though, and although few of the passives make a significant impact on their own, in the long run it gives you lots of options to build your character. If you're just learning the game and making it up as you go, it's also pretty easy to change direction or even refund some points (as you get a refund point every once in a while) if you feel you're missing something, e.g. you've put too much focus into damage and now die too easily.Staying on skills and character development, another change I really like are active skills - instead of being tied to your XP level, they come in gems that are placed in weapons/armour in coloured slots (corresponding to an attribute - strength/dexterity/intelligence), which again means that you can pretty much turn your build almost upside down if you want/need to. An awesome addition to that are ""support"" gems that can be linked to them, which allow for some incredible options and can turn a relatively unimpressive skill into a mind-exploding pocket armageddon. But then, the skills themselves are very diverse and they're mostly both really fun to use and actually useful - there really is something for everyone, and for pretty much any playstyle.You have six although my ninja turtle buddies tell me something about a seventh classes to choose from - three with one primary attribute (Marauder - strength, Ranger - dexterity, Witch - intelligence), and three which are kind of ""hybrid"" (Duelist - strength/dexterity, Templar - strength/intelligence, Shadow - dexterity/intelligence). I have to complain about the character selection screen a bit, as the descriptions are not very helpful and a bit misleading if you're new - e.g. you can get the idea the Witch is something like a necromancer (which she can be), while she's pretty much the closest thing to a typical mage. In reality, with the way the ability tree and skills work in PoE, each class is very flexible and just knowing what attribute they're focused on gives you an idea what to expect and what playstyle they make sense with.Another clever change, in my opinion, is... getting rid of gold. Yep, there's no gold here. The good old portal and identification (here named Scroll of Wisdom) scrolls are the most basic currency, plus a large variety of different ""orbs"" that can modify item properties - you can turn an ordinary sword into a Rare Uber Destruction Weapon of Doom and Annihilation. But wait, that doesn't mean getting your hands on powerful items is easy - you have more options to obtain the kind of equipment you want, but it's not easier, as obviously the more powerful orbs are just as rare (if not rarer) as rare items. And this system gets rid of ""at first you can't afford to buy a dagger but if you do side quests then you can buy half the planet halfway into the game"".The graphics are very nice overall, might not be super-ultra-AAAA-HD-2017 standards, but the game just looks good and as a plus should run smoothly even on not the newest PCs. The combat really looks spectacular and what's very important - not messy and everything is mostly clear even when you're swarmed by enemies or fighting a boss who spams 10 different skills (and this is something that can make or break a game like this). The most disappointing part of graphics is probably... the character selection screen (yep, again), their models don't look very detailed and the first impression wasn't great, but when you get into the actual game, there really is nothing to complain about. The sound is also worth praising - sound effects are satisfying, voice acting is very good and gives personality to characters, and the soundtrack is great and very atmospheric.I personally liked that while PoE does mostly stick to a similar dark and gloomy atmosphere and visuals as Diablo 2, the locations are much more diverse - e.g. some of the forest/jungle locations are actually quite colourful (does not mean they look friendly, though...), but then there are a few places in this game that make Diablo 2 look like My Little Pony. Lunaris Temple. Holy living ♥♥♥♥. Traumatic experience. Plus, the world is a bit more open and there are often several quests to do at the same time which you can complete in any order you like. There are also quite a few side locations, and you can encounter randomly generated ""corrupted"" areas (quite small with unusual monster types and a boss, plus skill gems you can't find elsewhere) and minor side quests from ""masters"" who can provide interesting upgrades if you have enough ""favour"" with them. A minor complaint about locations, though - they are sometimes really quite vast, which means that if you want to explore everything, a) you need to do it in one go as they're semi-randomly generated, b) there can be a lot of mundane running back and forth.The story also deserves a mention - Path of Exile, instead of having just another ""super evil demon dude who is evil because he's always been evil; oh wait did I mention evil"", instead focuses on people with overblown egos and sick ambitions that get way out of hand. It may not be groundbreaking, but it's very cleverly written, in the way that if you don't care, it completely doesn't get in the way, but if you do, it's interesting and makes you want to keep going and kick the asses of those responsible for this. And there is an interesting plot twist or two...So, is this game anything groundbreaking? Not at all. Is it fun to play? HELL YES. Admittedly, it never really gave me a ""OMG WANT TO PLAY POE RIGHT NOW"" feeling, but whenever I launched it, I usually ended up playing for 1-2 hours more than I'd planned. There will probably be a lot more hours than what you see above this review.			"

												Have you ever thought ""Man I love diablo, but 3 kinda sucked compared to 2"" well then this game is for you! It feels so much like diablo it's insane, but has SO much more to offer!Ontop of it being a great mmorpg with tons of people playing, it has character building none of us could have dreamed of. I mean the passive skill tree alone is MASSIVE, easily the biggest i've ever or will ever see. The amount of different character builds and skills you have to mess around with alone will leave you with hours and hours of entertainment. You'll be remaking and creating new characters for months the combinations are endless, on top of the constant updates and expansions this game will consume your very life.What are you waiting for, there's a world in here... and they need your help.

Of course it has some flaws, but they are fixed one by one, day by day.Every 3 months, a new league rises. Set your own goals, plan your build and play in a fresh economy. It doesn't matter if you are a new player or a veteran, as everyone starts with nothing but a set of fists.Also, it's one of the true Free-to-Play games, so there's no excuse for not trying it.I totally recommend it.

												Path of exile is often compared to the Diablo series, and not without reason.The game viewed as the successor of Diablo 2, from some of the same developers that bought you Diablo 2. I am not exactly a fan of RPGs such as this with dps and varied skills,  but I have fallen in love with the game and intend to play alot more in the future.Path of exile is also not pay to win like Diablo 3 with the Auction House to buy and sell gear, but optional microtransactions that in no way assist you in actual gameplay. You cannot buy anything to directly affect your character statistically, but cosmetically. I also appreciate the upfront nature of the Developers, stating the microtransactions such as portal skins, pets, etc are to support the game, and they deserve it. I am now a fan of RPGs thanks to Path of Exile. I can only hope for the best in the community and will definitely watch the continuous game patches closely. If you want to get into the game in a more complicated way, head over to the Path of Exile website[www.pathofexile.com].I implore you to also view the Metacritic[www.metacritic.com] reviews and other Steam Reviews. They really do tl;dr this review.Congratulations Grinding Gear Games for a game that does not seem like a cash grab or false misrepresentation in a recent streak of badly made or terribly received games.

												Very good game.  Its free to play so how cann you go wrong.  Can get somewhat repetitive working your way through the acts multiple times.  SMALL TIP FOR NEW PLAYERS:  Pay attention to your skill tree.  This is very important.  If your skill tree is not optimized properly towards what types of spells and attacks you plan on doing then you will not be able to defeat the higher tier enemys and end up grinding HARD.  Look up some good Path of Exile builds online or on youtube and follow those.You will not just have one character.  And you will not play through the game just once.  Everytime becomes more of a challenge to better your character.10/10 would wash up on a beach again.			"

												Having never played this type of game before (yes I was a CoD only player) It REALLY grabbed me by both hands and shook me out of FPS.It is  COMPLETEY FREE  to play -  ALL of it from start to finish (no if's or but's) you ONLY spend real money if  YOU CHOOSE TO. The game is similar to Neverwinter / Diablo etc. However this is considered  the  pinnicle of them all. I personally believe its quite easy to pick up & understand from your first steps in the game. Any problem with trying to fit a piece of armour / equipment / gem, the game will highlight the 'error(s)' in red. There is an in game global chat that for the most part IS helpful although like any on-line game you will get idiots who give out poor / stupid information etc. There is an awful lot of YouTube stuff out there also to look at.Briefly About the game:-You are an 'Exile' that has been exiled to 'Wraclast' and start your journey to salvation from being washed up ashore. You can first choose 1 of 6 characters, once you have completed the game this unlocks a further 1 more character to choose if you desire. As you travel through each area killing monsters along the way - you gain experience points (XP) this will eventually allow you to level up & 'spend' your XP point, altering your character how you wish to improve him/her. This coupled with the various items that you will find / unlock / win etc. means your character will (hopefully) get better and progress in the game onto harder levels.There is an awful lot of items in this game - some of which you can alter yourself via 'crafting' after playing the game you will get to learn items that will be of use to you etc.Once you reach a certain level within the game you will be able to participate in 'Maps' these are seprate from the main game (again ALL FREE) these can unlock higher level items / rewards etc.Grinding Gear Games also run 'events' at certain times, which you can choose to enter if you wish (again free)The graphics in this game to me are stunning, the effects, the detail, etc this game has it all. Thats why I've donated money when they brought out the new 'Awakening Patch' & paid for lots of footprints/pets/armour/etc. but let me stress I DID NOT have to.Thanks for reading this - I hope it helps make your decision.

												Path of Exile in 2016 holds up. At first I gave the game a postive for it's ""simple start"" I (and many others) called this game the Diablo III game that it should've been. Hence why i gave the game postive. However, as time went on, I felt Path of Exile didn't really phase me as much as it did back then. I believe the game needed some improvements to make the game better. Those did came, however it needed more so much more. Hence the downvote on my second take on the game.Now we come to 2016. After a few years since its launch how does it hold up now? It holds up really well. The community and development team is really involve in making this game fun for the ""vintage Diablo"" fans who like the gritty and horror appeal.Now things seem to be updated in terms of it's combat, magic and rouge gameplay. Daily activites, etc. My only issue is a real ironclad social venue of sorts. It's kind of there but it's a bit clunky and needs a bit of an improvement. If you want a Free-to-Play game with a vintage Diablo apporach. I FULLY recommend this.			"

												After more than 1200 hours in that game, and $150 over the past 3 years, you really want me to write a review, Steam?Ok.This is a fantastic ARPG. We could argue over and over with numbers, and meaningless ""contains hundred of bazilions of thingies that you use to hit other things"", but to be fair, this is not what this game is about.This game is about character building. The Passive Skill tree, the Skill gems, the support gems, the link system, the fact that even a white drop is relevant, the constant support, rework, additions to the game, the incredible random based crafting with the game's currencies; those are the elements that make me spend time playing. Those are the elements that make me think about my current build, about what piece of equipment I will need next, and how it will interact with the Unique objects I used, how they unlock a powerful ability, and how they react in a weird way with this skill or that notable passive keystone.Yes, it's a bit more daunting than a lot of other ARPG.Yes, the online only is sometimes a bit annoying.But damn, I've never spent so much time outside a game obsessing about the game than with PoE.It's free, and the only things you can buy are utilities (stash tabs, for the hoarders) and cosmetic items.If you give it a try, I can't be blamed.

												An excellent game, before you take into consideration the fact that it's completely free. When you add that and the fact that this is a rare free-to-play which isn't pay to win with developpers that have an outstanding work ethic, it becomes amazing.Not only is the game good, but it keeps getting better. It's a bit hard to get into with its daunting passive skill grid and obscure currency system, but the huge and very helpful community makes the introduction a breeze. This is quite simply the best hack & slash arpg I have ever played (and I've spent a lot of time on those since Diablo 1).			"

The Game: If you played Diablo 2, you know what to expect.  Pick a character class and start pointing and clicking until you kill enough things to level up, gain more skills, and get better gear to kill more things!  You build your character around the skills you choose to use, represented as gems that are slotted into your gear.  As you level up, you put points into the massive (and I mean MASSIVE) passive skill tree to customize your character to how you want to play.  The game runs through about level 36, Cruel difficulty to level 54, and Merciless to 68.  The endgame (starting at level 66) consists of ""maps"" that can drop from killing monsters.Pros: Simple to learn, difficult to master.  The enemies are diverse and always challenging, the maps are randomized, the skills are interesting and fun, and the loot system is incredibly well done.  Joining friends is easy and fun.  Did I mention the game is FREE?Cons: The passive skill tree can be incredibly daunting to new players.  There is no ability to respec your skills aside from starting over, so don't plan on your first character reaching the maps.Conclusion: Play this game!  It's simple to pick up and play at your own pace and consistently rewarding you for learning its more complex mechanics.  Plus its free, the developer ONLY sells cosmetic items, so there is no possible way to gain a gameplay advantage by paying money unlike many other ""Free"" to Play games out there (see: Neverwinter).

If you enjoyed Diablo the original or the follow up Diablo II then you will love this game.The leveling is awesome, well balanced & plenty of room to dream up/experiment with your own build ideas.I suggest getting the POE apps for IOS/Droid to help you plan out your builds as you go as the passive skill map is... emense.

												Started playing back in Closed Beta and thought there wasn't a lot to hold my interest. Fast forward 18 months, and I can't get enough of it. Insanely deep skill tree allows for an near-infinite amount of ways to build a character through self-found builds, though these may not work out for beginning players. On the flip side, builds by other players on the official forums are easy to follow and helpful for first-time players. This game is easy to play, hard to master, and very replayable. Rerolling characters in other games, at least for me, is very repetitive and tedious, but not in PoE. Because of the depth and complexity offered by the game, even making a character the same class as your previous one can be drastically different.Currency in PoE is one of key features that sets it apart from other ARPGs. Basic Scrolls of Wisdom allow you to identify Magic/Rare/Unique gear as in other games, but ""Orbs"" are the de facto currency of the game. Not only do they allow you to modify/reroll your gear, they allow you to trade for other gear with other players.Another stand-out feature of PoE are the skill gems. There are hundreds of Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Support gems that are placed into sockets in weapons and equipment that allow players to use them as skills. Different from other ARPGs that just unlock skills the higher level a player is depending on their class. Not so with PoE. The way skill gems can be mixed with each other, especially with support gems, can really affect how the game is played from build to build. In addition to this, skill gems can level up from 1 through 20 and have increasingly more powerful effects as they level up. An item modifier, quality, also affects gems. Quality further increases the effects of a gem and ranges from 1-20%.The gear/loot in PoE is as extensive as the rest of the game. Standard qualities like magic (blue) and rare (yellow) exist as in other ARPGs, but the implicit and explicit mods on these items is what makes the game interesting. There are so many different mods that exist and affect gameplay as much as the way a character is built or the skills that it uses. In addition to these items, sockets are also an integral part of the game. Without sockets, skill gems would be useless, and without certain sockets, important combinations cannot be achieved. Socket colors in PoE are red (strength gems), green (dexterity gems), blue (intelligence gems), and white (any gem). These sockets can be rerolled using Chromatic Orbs as well as linked using Orbs of Fusing. This really changes up how skill gems can be used in conjunction with other gems, especially later in the game.The story/lore of the game is not necessarily an integral part of the experience, but the settings and locales are decent and the overall art direction and visuals have a real dark feel, which do lend themselves to that story. There are three acts in PoE, up from two that the game previously started with. Each increases in monster level until Act III is beaten, upon which the difficulty goes up (Normal -> Cruel -> Merciless) and Act I begins again. I have not reached endgame maps yet, but they add a lot of content to the endgame experience.Speaking of experience, leveling in PoE requires a lot of experience near the end. Leveling from 1-50 takes little time, and then the experience required jumps quickly as one might expect. Even then, leveling is still not too tedious until much later. My main character is only level 56 so I cannot speak to how long it takes, but other players have reached the upper 90s, so it is feasible. Overall, PoE is a great game at a great price tag: FREE. No pay to win aspects here. If you're looking for an fun, deep, replayable ARPG, this is it. GGG does not mind streaming of their game or even monetizing their game. They value feedback and release patches at a decent clip. In addition to this support, they run races that reward rare currencies or items over a season, though winners are usually the same few, especially in party races. Still fun to play, though.I recommend getting this game...now!			"

												It’s not so much the gameplay that is challenging, but your knowledge of the game itself that challenges you. There are many nuances in the game that you have to learn. First the vocabulary. For example: ""5% increased damage"" is very different from ""5% more damage"". And because of this don’t expect to make that perfect char your first go. Especially if you don’t follow a guide. This isn't really a bad thing, but it is not friendly to new players.What is bad are the tags they put on skills. They basically mean nothing. For example ""rain of arrows"" is a skill that has the projectile tag, but a projectile support skill will not affect this skill. Such as “Greater/lesser projectiles” do absolutely nothing to this skill. It's like GGG wants it to be confusing just because they can make it confusing. I don’t see any other reason for it. It’s why a totem skill can have the tag spell, but things that effect spells don’t effect it. So they make the learning curve even more stupid. And if you go post this as a bug on the forums. You just get trolled and yelled at for being an idiot.The point of the game is to make the most OP character you can. I enjoy doing this, and is the reason I started to play the game. However; even if you succeed in making a character work the way you wanted it too. Don’t expect it to last. GGG has been constantly removing build options. The build diversity has gone way down sense the game first released. And you may not even be able to play your character even remotely close to the way you did before. There is way more to this then simply nerfing stuff. If it was a simple nerf and the build still worked I wouldn’t put this in the review.GGG is on a never ending quest to balance the game. As if things HAVE to be balanced. Meaning anything main stream or popular gets nerfed. In 1.3 it was block. In Awakening it was life leach, and auras. And many other things. Anyways; the point of nerfs where to balance things. But there not balancing things. They are removing options. If block just became less OP instead of them removing most of the different ways of getting it. I would have been ok with it. But the truth is they can’t really balance defensive vs offensive skills. If you want an explanation on that read here http://www.diabloii.net/blog/comments/mad-prophecies-2-defensive-skills But in GGG’s quest to balance these, they instead have made it so you need multiple defensive things going instead of one.For example Chaos damage. Chaos damage has its own special rules. It bypasses your energy shield for free. Is the hardest defense of stat to get in the game, and it is very punishing on specific builds. For some builds the only way around it is to hope for a supper rare and expensive item drop. Recently GGG has upped the item’s drop rate. But it doesn’t really help you get the item if your build needs it. As many maps will just give you snakes or something that does Chaos damage. Even after you re-rolled the map just to avoid the mod of poison damage. This means you’re never going to get the item you need without buying it.Patches are big problems for existing characters. For example: Reduce Mana used to work on auras. But in the awakening patch... Reduced Mana changed so it wouldn’t work with auras or similar gems. They then took the enlightened gem and made it do what reduced mana used to do. This is a huge problem for existing builds. The biggest problem being the color of gem changing. Many people might have corrupted their gear, and can’t change the color gem sockets anymore. Meaning your once level 100 character is now all messed up gear and gems. GGG just expects you to level a new guy. And when they mess up your character they don’t let you redo in game key choices. Like the bandit reward choice. They only give you a passive re-spec. And that is only because they change the passive tree so much. It is usually impossible to leave your old tree in tack.That is my biggest gripe of this game. Many people like this. They think it keeps the game fresh. But for many others... GGG is just destroying builds constantly patch after patch. And you as the player you are just expected to deal with it. Builds come and go. I don’t see this changing, and it will just continue be so. Until the least popular build is the only viable one. Meaning any work you put into creating a build will go to waste. Even if the build isn't that good.GGG don’t like specific build so much that they have over tuned their bosses and other things. For example: They didn’t like life leach so much that they made it so bosses can one shot you. There reason for this is because they don’t want you to take a hit and just be able to heal back up for free. So how do players get around this? There are two options. One is make your char supper mobile and avoid the hit all together. Or make your char supper tanky enough to survive the hit and then life steal back up. That’s right in there attempt to punish a specific build they made it pretty much one of the only viable builds. This just goes to show you that the people in charge of balance at GGG have no clue what they are doing.Also patch changes are not announced before they happen either. However; beta/test realm testers get to play with the changes before anyone else. And most of the major changes can be found in the form of rumors. But the actual patch notes come the same day as the patch. Leaving many builds broken in their wake. And forum jerks going around telling people they had plenty of time to prepare. This gives beta testers a big advantages in many different areas of the game. Like what items to buy, or sell based off upcoming nerfs/buffs. Even way before the patch notes, let alone the patch release. But the biggest annoyance is the race events. Right after a huge major patch like the awakening. They will offer prizes. Such as a laptop to the first person to kill the new boss. They highly show favoritism to a few select people. Weather they realize it or not. So if you don't cheat and are not able to play on the test servers. Then don't expect to win anything. EVER!!!Most people will be happy; until the next patch comes out, and your character is completely gutted again. Because of this I don’t recommend picking up any of the bandit rewards. Just kill all 3. It leaves you with more flexibility; for when the next patch does come out. And don’t spend money on the game. It’s not a matter of “if they will” but “when they will” destroy your current character/build. Very few builds survive from patch to patch. One of the patches actually de-leveled your gems for you. (Yep GGG said you know all those corrupted high level gems you had. Well too bad you have to make new ones now.) This is a game where patches are your worst nightmare.Other things to note are: PVP go ranged or loose. Don’t expect to do groups/parties. The reward isn’t worth the penalties that come with it. Don’t ever corrupt stuff except for gems. Because gems change not just in stats, but in color too. Meaning you will most likely be leveling new ones anyways.Also avoid the forums. GGG will lock your game account for what you say in the forums. Not just your forum account if they don’t like what you say. This is 100% true. You don’t have to believe me. Just read there terms of use. They even locked my account for over a year because of this review.			"

												I don't often write reviews for games. But this game needs it. I installed it a long time ago when it released and played 10 hours or so and said ""This game is to indepth for me"" and moved on. I came back a few months ago after being burnt out on games like Diablo 3, Torchlight *insert any ARPG besides Grim dawn*. Path of Exile is extreme, its not noob friendly, its hard, builds take time, currency takes time to get, some builds are only viable upon certain rare items, that you either have to pray to RNG jesus for drops or trade for, and they are expensive. And some takes days if not weeks of farming to obtain. That being said, i've never found a game that offers more build variation and replayability than POE. Its a steep learning curve, but its incredibly worth it. This game destroys any other game in its genre. I've played 60+ hours, not sure what my steam time says atm, and have found only a few rares. In diablo 3, rares rain down upon the noobs. The sense of joy and accomplishment when you get a rare drop is almost drug like. This game has revolutionized the ARPG genre IMO. Its almost perfect.So TLDRIf you can can be patient and look up youtube videos, and how to play guides (Since this game has almost zero tutorial on anything), learn from the forums and reddit, learn from your deaths, you will be rewarded with a incredibly well designed game with almost endless replay value, and a type of atmosphere i've never found in any other game of its kind. If you wanted you could develop your character over year of gameplay just trying to min max things.10/10			"

Those are for casual♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ this is the real♥♥♥♥♥♥Path of Exile has an amazing atmosphere, really diverse enemies and maps, incredible amounts of depth and complex, the biggest talent tree I've seen in any game by far, and thousands of hours of content - all for free! Absolutely no real money required - only cosmetic items, more stash space (which there's enough already, mind you), and more character slots (default 24 - more than enough) can be bought using real money. And the game is so complicated that even after 100h+ of game time I'm still learning tons of new stuff all the time, and I believe I keep learning for the next 500 hours at least!The devs are also god-tier (and by that I don't mean nonexistent, but ♥♥♥♥ing awesome), which is nowadays more important than ever. None of that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t early access, paid DLC, season passes, new sequels coming out each year (Call of Duty I'm watching you), or any other ""modern"" video game industry ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The devs have listened to the playerbase since the very beginning of development, and made the game the way people want it to be. They still update the game very often, and it's not just bugfixes but a lot of new content. They've already released five DLC - which all are completely free, of course, adding hundreds of hours of content. I'm sick of these ♥♥♥♥ing retard developers like No Man's Sky's or ARK's, who don't listen to their players and release some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t DLC while the game is still in early access and they're just lazy little ♥♥♥♥s who don't even develop the game anymore or fix the horrible optimization or bugs, and treat the playerbase like♥♥♥♥♥♥ PoE's developers are on a completely different level - perfect opposite of those piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥developers that nowadays exist way too much.This game should be on ""most played"" or ""top seller"" list - not some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ARK's DLC. ♥♥♥♥ ARK, ♥♥♥♥ its developers. This is 100% honest an awesome game with awesome devs, and I was more than happy to support the developers by buying some cosmetic stuff with real money. Keep up the good work!

TL;DRThis is a great game. Try it out, its free anyway.Review:Path of Exile is a ftp-Action_RPG game, released 2013 and being under continued development since then, having had multiple free expansions, leagues and content updates. It can be played solo or in a party with up to 5 other people on either soft- or hardcore.Pros:-Free to Play, only cosmetical purchases-dark & gritty style fitting the story and lore-insanely deep and varied skill system-smooth leveling experience-expansive and challenging endgame-interesting and unique currency and crafting system-free trading economy-seasonal leagues with their own twists and challenges to keep the game fresh-regular free content patches-big and friendly community-around 5h of soundtrack-nice looking cosmetical microtransactionsCons:-this will eat your time-start of play can be unimpressive-since this is a always online game, connection issues can be a problem-daunting skill tree-through the leveling process you have to play the same story 3 times in increasing difficulty (changed in the future*)*as of now, the new expansion ""Fall of Oriath"" has been announced for mid 2017, adding 6 new acts to the 4 existing ones, therefore eliminating the need to replay the story 3 times. (i have a boner)Conclusion:For anyone interested in the action-rpg genre and disappointed by Diablo 3, look no further than this ftp-gem called Path of Exile. Challenging, rewarding and smooth to play, this appeals to everyone: the casual softcore to the min-maxing hardcore player. There is little as rewarding as building up your own character, theorycrafting, gearing, fighting, struggling and finally concquering everything the game has to offer. And then doing another one, thats complety different. And another one.For someone new to the action-rpg genre, don't get scared by the seemingly endless possibilites and mechanics the game offers you, punch through the somewhat tedious first 2-3 hours of the game and enter the realm of the game that will suck you in and never let you out again.9,5/10			"

												Path of Exile is an amazingly dense experience with robust endgame content, at the cost of being newbie unfriendly. There is no conventional currency in the game, no auction house, and no skill tree. Instead, a huge variety of orbs which modify maps and items are the base currency, the only way to trade is via a third-party website, and skills are handled by linking gems together to maximize synergies with your passive tree.The passive tree is probably the one thing that everyone has heard about from this game, and I can confirm that it is quite ridiculous. As a now-experienced player, it makes a lot more sense to me, but coming in, 1300+ passive nodes to choose from is a little daunting. You can refund points using some currency, and you gain a decent number of points by playing through the quests, but ultimately you will need to start a new character if you want to radically alter your build.Skills are handled via gems, and you link gems together for cool combinations. You can take a regular skill like Fireball, add cold damage and lightning damage, increase the area of effect, and increase your cast speed. Or, you could link together a series of gems to cast defensive skills when you take enough damage. The sheer number of combinations is insane, and when combined with the passive tree, there are literally hundreds of possible builds out there.The game itself is currently split up into four acts and three difficulties. Completing the last difficulty is somewhat optional however, as by then you’ll probably get to the meat of the endgame – mapping. Mapping is one of the best features of PoE, and it makes the endgame experience incredible. You will eventually meet a character who introduces you to a device which lets you generate portals by putting maps into it. Maps drop from high level enemies, and are divided up into 16 tiers with a variety of special unique maps as well. Each tier has higher monster levels. Maps themselves are just as they sound, a map from the game which you can run. You can use currency to modify maps, adding unique modifiers like monsters casting extra curses, or spawning skeletons, or the player having 50% less armor. There are tons of modifiers and I’m really only scratching the surface. You map to grind gear, grind levels, and eventually work your way to the endgame bosses, of which they are insanely difficult and require powerful gear and a well-designed build.The downside of all of this depth is evident by now – it’s tough to start this game out as a newbie. There is a ridiculous amount of information to parse, and the combination of all the exotic gameplay systems makes it really tough to make good decisions. It’s easy to make a mistake like not getting enough defensive nodes on the passive tree, or not getting enough special keystones to carve out your character, or using bad skill links. It’s easy to create a gimped character who can cruise until level 50, limp to level 60, crawl to 70, and then crash and burn sometime after that. When that happens, your only recourse is to create a new character and begin the grind again.The name of the game here is grinding, and the name of the company is appropriately Grinding Gear Games. This is the ultimate ARPG as far as I’m concerned, and since the genre has always been heavy on grinding, I don’t necessarily mind it. I like falling into a trance with some music and some maps for a few hours.Also, all of this content is completely free. This is a free to play game. That is insanity, and you really have nothing to lose by trying it out. Nearly any character can make it through to the end of the game to finish the story, and if you follow a build online, you can definitely make it to the endgame and perhaps even down the endgame bosses on one of your first characters. Make no mistake, this game isn’t for everyone, but if you’re the kind of person who likes to open up a build calculator, make a plan, and then spend 60-70 hours to see if it works, this is definitely your kind of game. If you played a lot of D2 back in the day, I think this game is worth checking out. "

												I'v enever reviewed a game but I was so impressed with it I had to. Below are the top 5 reasons I think you should download Path of Exile. 1) It's Free! 2) Stunningly Beautiful3) In-Depth Character progression, the skill tree is insane 4) Intuitive Gameplay, there's not really a tutorial but after 5-10 minutes in the game its easy to figure out5) Straight Forward, despite it being free the in-game store is labeled ""Microtransaction Store"" so you know exactly what it is. I love this. What's offered there are visual items and pets, things that dont impact the game play. You don't need to buy anything to enjoy or advance in the game. Purchases seem to benefit the continued development and operation of the game.			"

												I've dumped about 13 hours so far into this game, and I am loving it. I came here from Diablo 3, as endgame in D3 got stale and the rewarding feeling of getting epic loot went away for me. Path of Exile's skill system was overwhelming but such a pleasant surprise for me as I LOVE theorycrafting fun builds. The graphics aren't bad and the environments are beautiful and dark and immersive. It also gives you a total sense of freedom and you play how you desire. Some builds are more end-game viable than others but that does not mean you can't have your fun as you level a few chars and learn whats good and whats not. But the realy selling point: IT'S FREE. PLAY THIS GAME. NAOOOO.			"

												Underrated game - needs more publicity.This is one of the best game's I have ever played. Not just because the content is great but because the developers listen, implement and change as the community casts its knowledgable opinion. They use everyone in the community as their non official staff and interact with them respectfully. The fact that all the content in this game is free is a breath of fresh air in the gaming industry.Although this game has a signiifcant skill curve and is not too forgiving for new players I highly advise you give it a good go and buy something from the MTX store to support the best developers in the industry.Pros- Completely F2P- Very challenging content- Developers that listen AND implement change- Hardcore option for people that want to become mentally unstable- Neverending content releases- Endless build possibilitiesCons- Requires research and wiki for new players- Confusing skill tree for new players- Requires you to follow a build on the forums to really shine in the end game- Melee is not balanced in the current state but no doubt the devs are working on itOverall 10/10 my favourite game in this genre and probably all genres. Try it!			"

												Play Diablo 2 for years and years and years. [done]*Play Diablo 3 for ~200h and dump it. [200 painful hours of shiny disappointment]Play Path of Exile for years and years and years [to be achieved].------------------------------------------------Yes, PoE has the nice dark touch I am looking for in a game like this (not the cartoonish bull$hit that is D3). There are numerous ingeniously designed areas such as the Mines in Act IV (how the pocket miners are excavated from the walls of the mine) or the The Ship Graveyard of Act I.The Passive Skill Tree looks impressive but is kind of the same... Well, I still have to explore the full depth of the options presented by the tree. Skill reset points are earned by completing quests so you can do adjustments if required. I find this ""freedom"" to be nice and player-friendly.In the game you level up gems which grant you with passives and active skills. This detour from the other systems is quite nice intro to the genre.The game receives constant updates, new acts, mazes which is a guarantee that you can replay the game numerous times without getting bored. Since I've started following the game closely I haven't seen a single bad update. Just perfect.Another impressive part of the game is the music - the soundtrack must be one of the best OST I've heard in a game and blends nicely to the gaming experience. Some of the tracks are mesmerizing, just turn on the volume and enjoy!Most of all - the game is free. Download it, play it, enjoy it. There are cosmetic microtransactions present. PS.* I just had to say a word or two about D2 and D3 as I do consider Diablo 2 to be a classic in the genre (as Mozart is a classic in the musical genre). Diablo 3 is okish but only the Act V (which comes after purchasing the Reaper of Souls expansion) satisfies my taste. The hero leveling up system is without any depth and after one or 2 play-troughs the grinding losts all it's meaning.My scores for the games:D2: 10/10D3: 5/10PoE: 8.5/10Why 8.5/10 - I do not like how certain items can be traded and how the trading system is implemented. I am reading in the official forums that the devs are working on the issues in the trading system and maybe soon we can enjoy something more structured. TBC			"

												Side Comment:    You are going to hear a lot of people compare this game to the Diablo Series, yet if you have played Diablo, you are going to easily make the same comparison! Have not played Diablo? Then you now have an idea of what Diablo is like. [Congratulations, if you like this you may now just be tempted to buy some of the Diablo games.] Actual Review:    This game has been amazing and it's definatly not like any of your other Free-To-Play Steam Games. As mentioned by the producers, they actually tried to make MADE this game no where close to Pay-To-Play ""if"" at all. There is an option to spend money on some costume/gear but does not effect your stats which I like a lot. So if you are  Sir/Madam Moneybags  who enjoys just tossing money around, there is an option for that. Graphics are very good, I have yet to find a superior glitch that affects game play and the game runs smooth on my computer. However there has been many complaints about a long loading screen when you open up the game, but I have no problem with it as it actually does not take that long. [Sometimes it helps to click around or minimize it then pull it back up.] All n' all everything is great, the gear is fitting, battle is smooth, and the story is really good. Love that their is seperate pieces that you can find and look into. Another thing I tend to enjoy is that you don't have to deal with numerous of players on the maps which usually causes lag as you run through the maps by yourself (Or with friends). Though if you do enjoy seeing other people, you will be able to see them in the towns and you can chat with them through a Global Chat. That annoys me however as most of them are only trying to sell gear or are being utterly ridiculous. If you can happen to ignore it, you will be fine. To the Haters:    It's unfortunate people try to down this game for silly reasons. Those who don't enjoy the game for silly reasons should understand that it could be because of your computer, you are not playing a genre you are familiar with, you are just too damn picky, or you have nothing better to do. Though I do understand if someone has an actualy reason, then I respect that but is there really a true reason to not like this game?			"

												Anyone who liked the old style of diablo games should try this very interesting game, made and maintained by ""Grinding Gear Games"" Studio from New Zealand. You propably never heared of the studio before, but looking at Path of Exile i hope more good stuff is coming from these guys in the future.PoE is a Diablo Style morpg setting place in a medivial/fantasy world. The game design is done with a lot of love, though to some it might look outdated or old fashioned. The top down style that can only zoom but not rotate can be charming though for all those who hoped for a remade Diablo 1/2 style game for years. Getting into the game is not as easy as with Blizzards famous titles though, the way how trading and currencys work seems a bit weird before you got into the system. There is no ingame currency, but a bunch of different orbs that are interchanged for items at different rates between the players. The system works though, and there is various sites on the web to search gear and items with that you can purchase for orbs you found ingame. Kind of normal for a grind&loot title this game can be very time consuming - i would not advice this title for the casual gamer who wishes to try out epic gear quickly. But the game has means of rewarding you permanently for your spent time, and the permanent updates from the developers with new leagues every couple of month make this title a good choice for the determinated long time player.With a well filled wiki, good forum, a nice community and interesting trading system POE has a lot to offer. Endless variations of character trees and builds are possible - the reward for the time it will take to figure out how everything works in Path of Exiles world. The massive skilltree and possible combinations of skill gems can indeed be a bit too much for some, but if you like depth and don´t mind a bit of work to get started you will propably get addicted to Path of Exile soon. The endgame system where you can run a bunch of different maps that can be crafted with modifiers is something remarkable, and although some ideas of the games wherre Blizzards brainchilt, GGG came up with a bunch of own good ideas to revive the concept of the top down hack&slash game, good old Diablo style.

												This game is utterly fantastic and the most striking thing about it is that it's free.  Generally F2P games always have some kind of gimmick or hook that gets players to pay out cash for perks or bonuses but not Path of Exile.  Being a huge fan of Diablo 2 I've been waiting for something to come along that captures what made that game so great back in its time and I've finally found it.I've played other similar titles such as Torchlight 1 and 2 and while both of them are good games in their own right this still trumps them in nearly every way possible.  Enemy variation, item customization via the gem system, skill trees, difficulty, as well as area design this game has it all.  So far I've put in around 15 or so hours and I'm still nowhere near being done yet.If you like these types of games and especially if you have friends to play with online this title is for you.			"

												In my honest opinion, Path of Exile is the true spiritual successor to Diablo 2 | Lord of Destruction.When I originally found PoE in closed beta, I was immediately taken by the team at Grinding Gear Games dedication to their project. I could feel the passion seething from them as I watched videos featuring the Devs expressing their plans for the game and what they aimed to accomplish. As a seasoned PC Gamer who has spent thousands of hours enjoying the Diablo Franchise, as brought to us by Condor, AKA Blizzard North; I was immensely excited for the launch of Diablo 3. In fact, myself, my girlfriend, and two of my friends actually sat outside Futureshop smoking herb and drinking gin (seriously) from about 9PM until the Midnight Launch. We all bought our Collector's Editions (well, I actually bought a box of 6.. knowing how good the extras were and how limited the CE was)... anyways.. we return to our homes excited to begin our journey in the new Diablo... only to find that BlizzTURD and CRAPtivision had fu*ked the doge... and NONE of us could install due to server issues! We literally had to break out Diablo 2 |  LoD to get our fix that night! That was the start to a very very bad launch of Diablo 3... a game that ""lead director"" Jay Wilson completely destroyed. I personally witnessed many people politely and eloquently express their concerns with the game direction (WoWified... shi7 loot systems.. repetative and linear gameplay.. the list goes on..) get PERMANENTLY banned by the forum admins, actually removing their access to the game they had purcahsed, seriously.. should be CRIMINAL what the blizz dev's were doing.. and I specifically remember one of the BlizzTURDs ""Bashiok"" who was relentlessly banning people. The inhuman garbage at Blizz responsible for the turd known as D3 have permanently tarnished both BlizzTURD and CRAPtivision for me personally.. and I'm glad they did... because it helped convince me to invest over 600 USD in supporter packs for PoE... I don't regret one cent.. I only wish I had invested more to had my own unique added to the game!Path of Exile is a magnificently complex game with beautiful artwork and an exceptional story line. Amazing what GGG have managed to accomplish, supporting the entire development with ethical microtransactions (cosmetic only, not pay2win)Solid 10/10 game. Magnificent.			"

												Path of Exile is the best free game there is.  Not free as in ""I got this game for free to review."", just free.  I've never gotten a game free to review, and I don't think I would want to anyway.  I mean, even though people say it has no influence over their review, can that be possible?  Not if you're a parent, that's for sure.Parents will know quite well the feeling.  You kid comes home from kindergarten with a picture they drew.  ""Look, I drew our house!"" they exclaim, holding out a drawing that resembles the house in the way Taco Bell resembles food.  But while you're wondering if it was possible the Zika virus was around when your child was born, you don't tell them that they have the artistic ability of a blind baboon, you simply say ""That's lovely!"" and hang it on the refrigerator next to the twenty other incoherent scribblings they have produced this month.That's the sort of pressure I would feel when reviewing a free copy of a game, but Path of Exile has no need for such shenanigans, it's a totally free ARPG with character customization so detailed that you will just go on the forums and find a build to use.Path of Exile is best summed up as Diablo on steroids, but then it gets banned for using performance-enhancing drugs and goes out and starts its own league, becoming even more successful than it was before.  Well, that's my opinion anyway, and I did get the game for free, but then again, so can you.			"

												For once, free-to-play means free to play. A solid experience that can be completed, and enjoyed, without spending a penny. Above all, a promising community hints at an even more promising future.The world has a grimy, grungy, uncomfortable feel to it that constantly makes the player feel slightly off just for inhabiting it, which is appropriate given what goes on. A very solid ARPG that brings some of the genre's best elements together mashing them up into a melting pot of free to play goodness.			"

												I started playing PoE during open Beta. At first i had my difficulties with the game since i was only playing D3 before. After spenging a couple of hours i started to see the depth of this game and the endless possibilities and choices you are given. The huge passive skilltree combined with your own creativity can produce a powerful and fun build the world has yet not seen. Other like in D3 you can spend time outside of the game to prepare, study skillgem and supportgem combinations and think of new builds.GGG works hard on PoE and its content. New expansions, challenging races, monthly events or 3 month races, it feels like this game is never ending and never becoming boring at all. And the best thing? It's FREE TO PLAY and NOT pay to win.I wouldn't recommend this game to everyone. Do you want to play a game that does all the thinking for you? Do you like high-end visual effects? Do you expect a helping hand from the game after you start playing it? Do you want to create a char and stick with it forever? Well then PoE might not be for you. If you like preparing, thinking and doing research, challenging new leagues and are compfortable with creating new chars and testing new builds and maybe abandon one or another character because of reasons then take a look at PoE and spend some time with it.My personal rating:Gameplay: 9/10Graphics: 7/10Community: 10/10Content/Updates: 10/10 "

												Similar to Diablo 3 at a glance, but not so much. The game goes much deeper and provides the player with much more information about their character and items. A fun game for those who like to imagine their own builds, and really fun for hardcore players who don't mind putting in the hours. The end game doesn't really get stale and feels rewarding. Hardcore is also an intreresting and genuinely difficult challenge, and the game has a fluid campaign that makes creating and leveling new characters not so painful. I would definitely recommend this game to people who are willing to learn a LOT of things in order to fully enjoy it.			"

												Diablo 2's spirtual successor. When it comes to action RPGs, Path of Exile is king. Despite being completely free to play it still recieves big content patches and even full expansions on a fairly regular basis. The developers are really on-top of things. I've played a little here and there since the closed beta back in 2012, so I've really seen the game be improved and polished over the years. Needless to say, it's still going strong. The game has no ""freemium"" or ""pay2win"" aspects, as the microtransactions are almost entirely cosmetics only aside from increased bank size (which is honestly more of a convenience than anything).The gameplay is diablo-esque hack and slash combat, typically you'll have 1 or 2 primary attack skills then an array of support abilities to keep yourself alive and killing things at good speeds.  Bothersome consumable potions from other ARPGs are gone, replaced by convenient flasks that refill as you kill monsters. The actual skills are gems that you can socket into your items, and can be linked together with support gems that can completely alter the ability like ""Multiple Projectiles"" (Spells have more projectiles, such as turning 1 fireball into 3), ""Spell Echo"" (Spells are double-casted), or ""Chain"" (Spells bounce to other targets). Since any class can use any skill gem, the classes instead start on different locations in the gigantic passive skill tree. The passive skill tree, which currently has 1325 nodes to choose from, provides a massive amount of depth to character customization.Items are easily the most in-depth aspects of PoE. Not only does every item have a myriad of stat bonuses and sockets for your skill gems, they can also be modified by ""currency items"". The Orb of Alchemy which turns a normal item into a rare one, giving it several random stat modifiers, or the Chromatic Orb which randomizes the colors of the item's sockets, are just two examples of currency items in PoE. These special items replace gold as the game's primary currency. Whereas gold is boring and just sits in a pile, these items actually have a purpose, and that ensures they have a significant value in-game when it comes to trading with other players. One of the most saught-after currency items, the Exalted Orb, can often be traded for some of the best items in the entire game to other players.The major aspect I'll mention in this review is Path of Exile's late-game. In many other ARPGs there's a finite end to the game's story, causing you to repeatedly grind the same area endlessly if you wish to level up further after you've completed the storyline. PoE's map system is the answer to that. After you complete most of the game's storyline you get to enter a randomly-generated zone by using activating a 1-use map item that can drop anywhere. These map items, much like normal gear, have stats of their own and can even be modified by currency items. Map's stats will change the monsters or terrain when it's generated, such as ""Monsters reflect physical damage"", ""Monsters fire 2 additional Projectiles"", or of course ""Area is inhabited by Skeletons"". However, the more modifiers a map has, the more loot will drop: encouraging players to increase the challenge for themselves by giving maps lots of dangerous mods to deal with. Maps also feature unique bosses and content not seen elsewhere in the storyline. This gives Path of Exile near endless replayability, in my opinion.So basically if you like ARPGs, this game is for you. My only complaint is not having enough time to play it more often, as these games tend to be quite addictive and can soak up your entire day if you let them!Rating: A			"

												Far superior to Diablo 3 in terms of build variety, crafting, end game and graphics, although not really for the casual player and very expensive to fully re-spec at high level so you’ll be starting a new character if you get something majorly wrong with your build(but new characters and new leagues is all part of the fun).Because this game is 100% cheaper and get’s more frequent updates that Diablo 3 I’d say it’s a clear winner.

												If you've played Diablo, you'll definitely like this game. The biggest downside of any mmorpg is pay to win model.While in Path Of Exile you can't buy a powerful armour or an artefact weapon to rekt everybody. You actually have to PLAY a lot. The only thing you can buy in PoE are decorations. This makes it the most balanced mmorpg ever.You might ask, which characteristics are making Path of Exile so good and even unique.- Passive Skill tree. There are HUNDREDS of skills to choose from. Literally. Just google PoE skill tree. I bet you've never seen anything like that.- Hideout. You can create your own home and even decorate it!- Skill gems. In PoE you don't develop active skills, you *buy* gems, which are used as skills. And again, the variety of active skills is enormous!- No money. You don't collect money, slaying monsters around. You don't sell your stuff for money. Instead, PoE uses the barter system. You can exchange loot for precious items.- Leagues. There are special periods in the game, when you can create a new character and get lots of cool stuff which you can't find in Standard league. A league then ends, but you keep your items.- Hero builds. Thanks to the variety of active and passive skills, you are able to create a lot of builds and render your hero UNIQUE! "

												edit: I use ggg's client mostly, on which I have logged most of my hours.As Exalted/Champion/Master/Lunaris Supporter, who greatly admires the ethical business model of GGG and their title Path of Exile, my perspective is simply too biased. I advise you take anything I say with a massive grain of salt.This is just a superb action role playing game. It is not for the faint of heart. It does not hold your hand with a tutorial. It expects you to put in some effort. It will be daunting at first. Very daunting.Now the good news- It is not nearly as bad as it looks. That skill tree that looks ridiculously, gratuitously large and terrifying? Yeah, you'll have your bearings around that in a week or two. Probably less. Okay, so there's no gold, and you don't really get what that means? Neither did I... for two days, THEN you'll be Master of Coin, I promise. Two days, on the dot. Less if you drink energy drinks. Yes Path of Exile is extremely complex. One of the most complex games you can find... but that doesn't mean you need to learn every little detail to become good, and it doesn't mean it's going to take a year for that to happen. Just jump in. It takes effort, sure.  But the effort is fun and enjoyable, and you meet new friends along the way who are eager to help. You're a hardcore gamer, amigo. You just don't know it yet. So come join us!If you do, you will be greatly rewarded.Welcome to the rabbit hole, friend. Now, down down down you fall, like many have before. And what lies ahead of you, I simply cannot summarize in review. But I cannot wait for you to experience like I did. Enjoy.Lostman-Edit: And I'm sure this is already known by readers, but this game is legitly free. There are no Pay2Win aspects. Though I have donated quite a bit to the cause and you may not be in a place to show that kind of support at the moment, I will have no advantage over you in the game other than my hair will be a tad shinier (who cares?).

												Has a atmosphere that is a lot darker than some other ""Hack-n-Slash"" games that are out there right now, like Diablo III and Torchlight 2, and it feels like a spiritual successor to Diablo II. The combat captures the spirit of the good old ""Hack-n-Slash"" games as well, letting you carve a path through hordes of enemies, and it is immensely satisfying. A definite recommend if you ever played Diablo II and loved it.			"

												This game reminds me so much of all the goodness in Diablo 2. So what has this extra to offer?Well, first it's not set in the graphics of the Blizzard universe which makes it quite refreshing, both literally and figuratively speaking. There is no gold and the concept of 'weapon value' has been dropped. So what's important? the gems. They give power and magic and they grow as you advance. They can be resocketed and thereby not lost after first use. The skill tree is very impressive which allows your character to evolve to become very unique. Much of the magic is known but there are plenty new tricks and moves (and totems and prophecies). For a free game very impressive. Monster bashing and fireworks to the max.			"

												I honestly keep forgetting that this game is free. I put more hours into PoE than anything I've ever paid for. I highly recommend trying it. If you don't like it, you're out absolutely nothing. That being said, I actually started buying stuff just because I feel like they deserve it. Any game that I put hundreds of hours into deserves at least a bit of money from me, though I played the game for years without buying anything, and there is definitely no in-game advantage to doing so. Well, extra storage, but I went without it until about a week ago, so definitely not mandatory. Also, note that I played this game since the open Beta, but I just linked my Steam account to it in March of 2016, so the hours played is way below how much time I've actually put into it.Anyway, it's fun, give it a go.

So i tried to find another game which bring something what i really miss, what i want and this game called POE.Your decisions are really important and (okey, you really have to work for it but) you can ruin your character, you can build something which doesn't work after a time but thats why you can really fall in love (like D2) with it, cause it's yours, you make your own way to kill those creatures. You can be ""anything' you want to.The graphics are pretty good, the story is nice, you have to thinking a lil bit about a few things in the game but its not too complicated, you can die - ive just died 9times on a boss- but you still want to do it,The best action rpg what i found in the last 5 years. AND it's absolutely free (you can buy stuffs but you dont have to, its playable all the way without microtransactions).So give it a chance and try it			"

												*Gets handed a Microphone*What...Path of Exile? Wh- NOW!?...Okay...Uhm...It's better than Diablo! 10/10....What more do you want from me at this short no- WE'LL DO IT LIVE! W-WE'LL DO IT LIVE DAMNIT!#I Want Malachais SpikeANYWAY, What's Path of Exile? It's Diablo, done right, pretty much. Yeah I know some of the fanboys are PROBABLY going to downvote me for this, but it's still true. The game is free, and is more dynamic and polished than Diablo ever was. That can be a bad as well as a good thing...With Diablo you don't get in-game stores cause you already paid for it a-...Wait you can buy stuff for it on battlenet?...Well...Uhm...okay!The game's pretty much you picking one of 7 different classes...From brute monster dudes to a creepy witch gal, and then you get pitted against four chapters of various horrifying and SUPER edgy monsters, while being forced to tackle the most INTIMIDATING SKILL TREE THAT YOU WILL EVER EVER SEE FOR AS LONG AS YOU LIVE!!![i.imgur.com]. Seriously, it's flipping mind blowing! There are dozens of different paths to take and things to do and stuff and what have you! It's outrageous! And to add insult to injury: There's no tutorial what so ever! After getting to a certain point in the first playthrough, you unlock a jack of all, ace of none character, named Scion, who's pretty much a blank slate character. Do what you want with type of deal.The graphics are a-okay and it actually gives you a wide range of spec requirements...the recommended is nice and high and lets even the toughest rigs get to make the game into a gorey HD experience, while the minimum are so low that even the worst old crappy laptops(Like my own) can play it with little to no complications!Once you've completed the game on normal difficulty....you...GET TO PLAY THROUGH IT AGAIN!...This time on cruel difficulty, and then merciless!!! Yes, you have to backtrack the same stuff you just did if you want to level past 35-40 -.- Cause thats when you reach the last bit of chapter 4 and the game starts from scratch 1 difficulty level higher.But it's okay cause you'll NEED to know how this stuff works anyway! Normal difficulty is more like a 'let me show you how its done' stage, and cruel difficulty is actually the INTENDED difficulty of the game! Or that's the feeling I got from it, anyway.So now lets do some pros and cons...Pros:It's better than Sakura ClickerYou have the most freedom skill wise than in any other game that I've ever seen.Large assortment of classes to choose from, including one ace of none jack of all character to unlock.Very large community, which is commonly adultThe game is INSANELY gorey and kind of horror based. Lots of impaled corpses and body parts and literal RIVERS of blood. If you're a gorefest lover, you'll ADORE this game!Naked golden statue women with really nice golden asses...BIG plus for that one.PvP is a thing!Crazy difficulty curve...Easy at first, IMPOSSIBLE to solo at the end.A real e-peen fertilizer! You feel you have a boner that could lift your desk when you're wrecking parts of the game that shouldnt be soloable, by yourself!You can raise the dead to fight for you, then make them explode when they die, then raise the dead who just died to your zombie minions...It's AMAZING!!!Cons:The currency system is a complete mess...It's based on 'orbs' and there are literally 15+ different orbs to keep track of, each more valuable than another and WHAT value they exactly are switches from day to day and from person to person, so you might buy something for 10 regal orbs but can only seem to sell it for 5 etc.How good you are is RNG based. When you get a good piece of gear, it might not fit your needs exactly(You might do lightning dmg mainly and the piece has cold dmg!). So you use an orb of chance or whatever it is to change the attributes of it to fit your needs....And you might end up making it WORSE, like putting strength on some mage gloves or something stupid like that! Being good in this game relies a LOT!!! on luck of the draw.Repetitive as all hell.You play through the game...next difficulty...Play through the game...NEXT difficulty...OH there's an event! Make a new character, play through the game, event ends, new character again, new league to get better get...Play through the game, next difficulty, league ends, character gets put in hardcore league....If character died, character's bumped to standard league. Make new character etc. It's the same exact stuff over and over again.Bit of a random storyline.It's kinda hard to follow the lore of the game, as it's all kind of just thrown at you as you go along :\ Unless you sit and waste 30 seconds - 3 minutes reading dialogue from NPCs, you will have NO IDEA whats going on, or why Merveil has to die, or why Malachai is a grade A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, etc.Other than that, the game is, for its few, not super crippling flaws, a really good one, and I do indeed recommend it.

-Quick Review-Path of exile is a free to play dungeon crawler which reverses skill points and abilities, you can always change your abilities, but you are limited in changing skill/trait/build points. Please note, I feel that dungeon crawlers are probably my weakest style to review, because they all start to feel the same to me after awhile, put in a few words, I enjoyed this one the most out of Diablo3, Torchlight 2. -Detailed breakdown review- Story:  Hail Exile, you are on Wraeclast, a bloody and dangerous land full of treasure, loot, monsters, Goatmen, and various other enemies. I just remember Goatmen, because I feel like they're following me around in dungeon crawlers. *looks out window*You won't be playing this game for its story, while the game does provide fully voiced dialogue with the various npc's, my best friend never gave me time to listen to the dialogue, so we just kept dungeon grinding and skipped the conversations. The basic gist of the story is: You're an exile, go get your revenge, got your revenge? Restart! You're an exile, go get your revenge, got your revenge? One more time! You're an Exile, go get your revenge, got your revenge? Yay! Now you need to map grind. Game Play: As with dungeon crawler games you control movement with clicking, you're in the above view watching your exile run all over your screen. additionally you can set various action butons, 1,2,3,4,5 are quick buttons to use flasks. you can bind left, middle or right click to different attacks, as well as several keys on your keyboard.You also face some npc's that are a different color or have a different health bar, indicating they're  cooler than other npc's; if you see these smug npc's be sure to slap them and tell 'em Atratzu sent you. But, on a more serious note, they have different abilities, and attack types, sometimes they can leap, sometimes curse, other times they shoot hyper beam at you. Achievements: there are really two types of achievements, the ones regular people can do, and the ones that will require a commitment to the game. This game is meant to appeal to hardcore gamers, there is also a hardcore mode.  Price:  The game's free, you have no excuse to not at least try it sometime. If you want to look like a badass, then you need to pay real money to get the aesthetics or bank space. But if you are just looking to play a dungeon crawler for a little while, go for it. Conclusion: Story: What story? Why are we killing this guy again? because that random guy said so? Okay! *murders face*. Game Play: Fun, but unforgiving in the skill point tree. Achievements: Mostly challenging grindy or RNG achievements. Price: Free, for everything else... there's Master card.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update April 11, 2015:small grammar, spelling, and punctuation fix			"

												You play as a character who have been exiled to wraeclast. After washing ashore at the twilight strand, your first quest is to make it to Lioneye's Watch.After speaking to every merchant in town, you are missing only one holy artifact that you must obtain in order to conquer wraeclast; pants. This quest is the main goal of Path Of Exile, and it becomes apparent that fulfulling it might be a harder task than you would imagine. Monsters and humans alike, stand in line to get a good stab at you. Your character also levels up, so that the pant-less crusade becomes even more devestating. How many innocents must die at your feet? How far will you go in order to obtain some pants? ...			"

												I never thought I'd love Path of Exile as much as I love Torchlight 2. I love the idea of the huge passive skill tree and Final Fantasy style active skill system. Instead of providing a linear active skill tree, skills in Path of Exile are itemized onto ""Skill Gems"". These gems can be activated by socketing them into your equipment. With the addition of a ""Support-Gem"", you can make your own unique skill. For example a simple fireball gem combined with ""Multiple Projectiles"" gem will turn your fireball skill into multiple fireballs. You can experiment and make your own active skills. There are thousands of combinations of skills and augmentations.The most important thing -- the game is completely free! PoE offers ethical micro-transactions. There is no pay-to-win element. People can buy only cosmetic items for real-world money.If you are going to give this game a try then remember to pre-plan your build or get ready to create new characters many times because ""Math of Exile"" punishes casual players.

												I will let my hours played speak for themselves.Now that they're finally fixing the desync issues (once Awakening hits) there is absolutely nothing wrong with this game in my opinion.  It is (or will be shortly) as close to a perfect ARPG as you can get.  The level of customization is insane and the balance is extremely well done.  Devs are active and engaged with the community.Love the pay model of buying only appearance changes.  Absolutely no way to make it pay to win or even pay for convenience.  I have given them more money than I care to admit.It's amusing to note people say this is what Diablo 3 should've been.  Blizzard seems to have noticed as many of the features that have been rolled in (seasons, rifts, etc) all appear to be directly mirrored off how PoE implemented the same concepts.			"

												Path of Exile won't be for everybody, it's unashamedly hardcore by design, and will take time to learn and master. But it's a better game than the competition, and it's free.Not everybody will enjoy the kind of freedom the character building system gives, and the mistakes it allows, and I'm personally terrible at the overall vision required for constructing a build.Not everybody will enjoy the darkness of the look and feel, or the difficulty and danger faced in progressing through the game, especially in hardcore mode.But for those that do, the loot, skills and character building come together to create something great, in a game that's consistantly fresh with new updates of content and build possibilities.

												It starts of as a pretty nice game, but after you play for 100+ hours you start to understand how this game works.The skill tree is not as impressive as it might seem, all characters end up being the exact same thing, 1 skill linked to support gems on a 6Link for the sole purpose of spamming in AOE. There is no skill, it's all about maxing out your character through gear to spam the same spell over and over again. You can play how you like, but the end game is just that. Every single build will mass AOE spam, there is no alternative. The passive skill tree and every single gem is nullifed because of this, it is all essecially the same thing. Everything ends up being AOE, it doesn't matter if you're melee or a spellcaster. Games like torchlight 2, the combat is more entertaining, you need to rotate multiple spells, its more combat focused. This game lacks major combat enjoyment.			"

												Do you like loot? Do you like the ability to build your character and class almost any way you want? Do you want a game where the only purchasable items in the microtransaction shop are visual effects and won't help a uber rich person ruin the game? How about a very fleshed out damage and defense system? And finally, do like RPG's? Well then, this Free-2-Play Action RPG is for you! You get the ability to create a build that could be super tanky, super DPS oriented, or a mixture of both. There are so many Unique (Legendary) items with interesting stats and mechanics that you can be an adept Spellcaster that has mastered Lightning attacks, or a Berserker that has invested points in Fire and can crush his enemies with a menacing maul! Or maybe a Ranger who could freeze her enemies using her Ice based arrows! Or you could be the support, the one who masters Auras and gives huge buffs to themself and their party members! You can call upon Ancient Totems to do your dirty work, or raise Zombies and Skeletons, and maybe even raise a Ghost of a fallen enemy or two! With this game, the ways you can dispatch enemies is almost limitless, and the fact that this game is F2P is awesome. Path of Exile is constantly updated, and every few months a new content patch is implemented, so you can expect this game to live for a long time to come. The only problems I have with it are the always online DRM. Desync has accounted for many of my deaths, some of them in Races, and that is a giant bummer. If we were able to rely on our internet as little as possible, then I think this game could get a lot better. Trading is also hit and miss, as there is no universal currency. You pick up currency items, which are, for the most part, Orbs and Scrolls, and trade them up and down, depending on how rare they are and what  you need. All Currency is usable in the way that resources in other games such as Minecraft are. A Alchemy Orb will upgrade a normal item to a rare, and thus is worth more than a Transmutaion Orb which only goes to a Blue, etc. Overall, I love this game and will continue to create new builds and characters. I'd give PoE a 8/10 on my scale. EDIT!!!After playing this game for hours, I am dropping the naive rating of 8/10 to 6.5/10, JUST FOR THE ♥♥♥♥ING LAG. ♥♥♥♥ the lag. This game would be 100% more fun if your very life didn't depend on the server's synchronization with your client. 80% of my game deaths have been from a sudden lag surge from 50~ ping to 1000 ping, which occur VERY OFTEN. I really wish they would add in an offline mode or just fix the desynchronization issues, because they REALLY just kill the game after good sessions of wrecking faces in.			"

Path of Exile from Grinding Gear Games (GGG) does offer an complete Free2Play Hack'n'Slay Game that doesn`t have to hide behind Diablo II or even the current Diablo IIIMy first playthrough took me around 38 hours with a Ranger Class. And while I tried to get as deep as I could into the Game and some of it`s skill mechanics it seems that I have so far only seen and understood the tip of the iceberg if it comes to the hole skill-tree stuff in Path of Exile (PoE) or the High-Level End Content..But let`s start at the beginning..The start felt partly rough since storywise if I would compare PoE to Games like Titan Quest, Grim Dawn or Diablo II....PoE missed the chance to have an stronger story-driven entrance over the first chapter. But as soon as I had accepted that and started to look what the Game had otherwise more to offer I came to the conclusion that the Story was just an small part of an bigger picture that was more or less just an layout for everything that might follow afterwards when you are finished with the Game for the first time.Trying to dig myself into the Skill Tree it seem to me that this is actually where POE has it`s biggest strengths if you can accept that the end content of the Game is less story-driven and more about what you do with your skill and character class in the long term.Some might not like that if it comes to PoE but if you are up for some Skill Tree Tweaking and care less about a End Game Story this could be your new homeWatching myself over the last couple of weeks looking more and more about how I would tweak my Ranger differently then I did on my first playthrough so far and where I had done some mistakes became actually an part of the Game on it`s own.Watching countless YouTube PoE Skill Videos, reading Skill Trees Tutorials on the Forum and in the end spending more time outside of the Game then actually InGame made kinda clear to me why so many are willing to buy one of those $400 Supporter Packs of the Game since PoE can really become an huge time sink if you are willing to get the most out of it and are open minded about such a game.Path of Exile makes pretty much everything right if it comes to the F2P Part and as far as I can tell after 38. hours with it the InGame Shop doesn`t offer anything that you must buy to be able to play through the Game.I was honestly suprised when I realized that even with the smaller inventory which was sometimes an issue it still didn`t felt like such an big deal to me that I had to buy the Upgrade on the InGame Store to get myself an bigger Inventory.I knew it was there but in the end I still sold some of the crap that I didn`t needed or wasn`t for my Class before I had even considered using the InGame Story.On the other hand PoE does offer so much in return that I kinda felt bad for not at least buying one of the smaller Supporter PackS ($30/$60) or at lease some of those Account Feature Upgrades. Considering all this and that I had besides only once with the Game technical issues where the latency was really going bad while the rest of the time i had not an single issue with the Game I can`t really say anything bad about the Game at all.Conlusion:Therefore my Rating for Path of Exile from Grinding Gear Games can only point into one direction. Up as high as it can get. Well done GGG!Thumbs Up.That´s it. Thanks for reading and have a great time ;-)			"

												I'm nearing 1000 hours on the Steam version and figure I should add my input about the game.  I don't think I can recommend this anymore after the 2.0 patch.Biggest complaints:Game risk/reward does not exist.  They destroyed player defense and offense, increased monster health and damage across the board, and made the high-end maps drop even less.  So you prepare yourself, make the tankiest / decent character you can, roll the hard mods and then what happens?  You get nothing valuable in the entire run, no map to replenish your stock and are worse off than before you started.Trading/economy is awful.  A literal hellhole.  There are players that scam people all day long for currency, work the market, and create monopolies all over the board; essentially, making it impossible for people to advance in the game depending on your build unless you give them all your currency.  Most of the time?  They're AFK!  Feels like a giant troll cesspool.There is no auction place, the trading utilites are limited (like, one or two external sites that require additional external software to run in conjunction with PoE to properly operate)The racing scene feels impossible to get into.  Not a twitch.tv streamer?  Good luck ever winning non-solo events!Gameplay becomes stale.  After you create enough characters, look at enough builds on the forums, theorycraft your own, etc.  You realize something, you do the same thing for every character and only replace a few skills and links appropriately.  You have auto-casted defensive skills, spam one skill and run around while popping potions.  It's boring.  And this feels like the only way to be successful, not die and continue progressing.  And to really try something out of the norm, you better be rich or one of those people creating the monopoly or you'll just get stuck into a loop of poorly performing budget builds.Last point on negatives: build enabling uniques, div cards, etc. are all too rare still.  They added these div cards to increase diversity and make it possible to farm for unique items or otherwise, but it's still useless.  The individual cards are as rare as the item you're trying to find, making them pointless to exist in the first place!  Seemingly zero influence on the economy of items they exist for.After all that, the game does have good points, though.  It was a fun thousand hours for the majority.  It was worth the few hundred I donated to GGG.  I still play because it is still the best ARPG I've found.  If I had the opportunity to not try in the first place, I probably would take it.  It has been a very frustrating run with all the build nerfs, item nerfs, drop rate nerfs, and almost nothing in the opposite direction to make it feel like everything might not be getting worse.  They had a series called ""Build of the week"" which may as well have been ""nerf of the week"" since they destroyed any build that appeared in it in the patch following the video release.			"

												This is a fun Diablo 2 type game, however, every 4-6 months Grinding Gear Games patches the game so utterly that three times in 1.5 years all of my character classes were botched or totally ruined. For those who have played games like these, leveling up is the easy part...buying gear for the class of character is not. So when my 5 characters hit level 90 finally, GGG actually came out with their new Act 4 expansion which completely ruined each one of my characters to such a high degree that I needed to redo their entire play style...which made all that gear I spent months buying obsolete. This is definitely a game to stay away from. So much fun, free, sociable and simple but the absurb time needed for leveling and gear make it impossible to enjoy knowing that all of your hard work and god-seeki-ness will be undone in as small as a 5MB patch that alters the skill nodes!

												Path of Exile is probably the right game for everyone who thought Diablo 3 was dumbed down too much compared to its predecessor; it's definitely the go-to ARPG for hardcore Hack 'n' Slashers with a crazy amount of possibilities when it comes to item & character builds, a huge skill tree, the freedom to combine active skills with an incredible amount of support skills and many exciting unique items that open up entirely new play styles.It may seem a bit overwhelming at first but it's easy enough to figure out all aspects of the game on the go if you played other ARPGs before. The developers try to keep the replay value high with a constant influx of new leagues, events and content updates.Pros:- Free to play- No pay to win- Active community- Devs listen to feedback- Regular content updates and patches- Great depth- Lots of character build optionsCons:- The depth can be overwhelming for new players- Game mechanics might take some time getting used to			"

												Grinding Gear Games' game design is quite simple: they made a game they themselves want to play. They tend and nurture it with parental-like care. They experiment, extrapolate, temper, and refine; constantly in pursuit of perfection, while having the humility to realize they will never reach it. Path of Exile is an ever-evolving masterpiece... and GGG gives it to us for free... No pay-gates. No tedious time sinks. Free to play in purity. What's the catch then? How do they make money? Well, I like to think of GGG like that friend who offers to help you move or pick you up from the airport without you having need ask. You can't help but want to reward their generosity by buying them beer or pizza or paying for gas.If you're a gaming enthusiast with any interest in the genre, you owe it to yourself to give Path of Exile a try. You quite literally have nothing to lose.			"

The skill tree for the classes are nice, the game looks surpisingly beautful, and it controls like butter. The best part is that it isn't a pay to win with the content provided, all paid content is aesthetic. If you want to feel the nostalgia of Diablo 2 again, check out this game. If you want to play a great RPG crawler, still check out this game. If anything, just check out this game.			"

												This game is one of THE BEST FREE ARPG's you could ask for, the customization is UNREAL, it's FULLY FREE 2 PLAY/ENJOY, NO transactions for better gear, EXP bonuses etc, there's a microtransaction shop ofcourse, but it's ALL cosmetic, well, except if you want more characters/more stash space, but that's beside the point, I might've just contradicted myself, but it's fine, cause I could spend $0 on this game and enjoy it as much as I do now, and I've spend around $60 on it, just for cosmetics and a chiken pet (totally worth it). If I had to compare this game to another I'd say this is a better version of Diablo 3, I mean, it's MUCH better than Diablo 3.I do enjoy the unique medium of exhange this game has to offer, it's not any kind of gold, silver, dough or worthless currency you'd expect, here we trade in usable items and not stuff that just lies around.Ohoho, this game also feels rewarding, you get somewhere by just playing and having fun, this is a game I'd recommend playing with a bunch of friends on a friday night, eat some chips and drink some soda, just enjoy yourselves.This is a game I'm gonna spend countless hours on.

												As a big fan of Diablo 2's visual presentation coupled with great music and a broody, dark and menacing atmosphere I found myself very dissappointed with Diablo 3. That said I was very relieved when I first played the beta to Path of Exile. Although the beta for POE was not as polished and the gameplay abit clunky compared to D3, when POE launched the final version they did so with ""guns ablazing"". The final version is slick, fluid and visually pleasing. And with the FF7 inspired ""MATERIA"" or ""GEMS"" as POE calls them I  find no reason to return to the D3 debauchery that many of us waited so long for. In the end I give POE an 8\10 only falling short a 9\10 because of how short the game is. But I highly recommend POE to anyone who is a fan of action RPG's and Diablo 2.			"

												Many, many others have already said it, but at risk of sounding like a mindless parrot drone - this game is MUCH closer to what most Diablo fans wanted D3 to be (including myself). I won't necessarily say this game is what Diablo 3 should have been, but it's certainly not difficult for me to imagine that most people would have been much happier if it had turned out exactly like PoE has. As it states in the last bullet point in the ""Key Features"" section: ""You cannot gain gameplay advantage by spending real money in Path of Exile."" This alone is such a massive gamechanger, and in a good way. I don't know about you, but I don't particularly tend to enjoy games which incorporate a ""pay to win"" mentality. Sure it isn't absolutely necessary to shell out any additional cash to be sucessful in D3, but just the fact that it is an option eventually helped drive me and many others away. Also, let's be honest - the loot system in D3 was (and still is) horrendous and only serves to further the agenda of Diablo 3's Real Money Auction House (which they are finally going to do away with early next year along with most likely bettering your chances of finding good gear). Go figure that! Anyway I digress, this isn't about D3. I only mention it because if you intend to play an ARPG on the PC, it's probably going to be one of these two. What you need to know is that PoE offers a truly rewarding and deep experience throughout. Character development boasts outstanding flexibility and viability of unique builds with a complex and rich skill-point system coupled with ability gems that allow you to specifically tailor any class in the game to be played the way you prefer. Of course some work better than others, but that's just how it goes. In summation, whether you are tired of D3 and looking for your ARPG fix elsewhere or just plain want a fun new game to play in this genre, do yourself a favor and click ""Play Game."" After all, who needs to be convinced by reviews from strangers when you can experience it yourself for free?			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing. "

												So after FINALLY finishing the tutorial, all i can say is: awesome game! Nah, I´ve been playing since 2012 and after this last update (Ascendancy+perandus league) i feel it is time for me to give this game a quick review.PoE is everything a fan of action-rpg´s and diablo2 player ever wanted:- a highly addicting item and loot system- a extremely large amount of possible (end game viable) builds to play- a developer that cares about their community ( just check reddit )it is hard at the beginning as a noob, but when you first master a whole playthrough to the next difficulty, the addiction WILL kick in.it is completely free to play and has no pay to win features.how can the game survive without pay2win you ask? - because of people like me.ive spend many $$$ on cosmetic stuff over the years just because i am so grateful for this game to exist, and being able to support such a great developer!feel free to contact me with questions. i´m glad to help getting more people into this game!

												I truely respect the developers of Path of Exile. Not only have they made an awesome Diablo 2-esque free to play game. But they continue to release new content and even full fledges expansions without asking for a single dime. Not only that, but everything they have available for purchase is completely cosmetic. There is no pay to win mumbo jumbo in this one folks.I have found many hours of enjoyment in this game and highly recommend it to anybody who enjoys top down games like Diablo & Diablo 2. I mean, might as well give it a shot. It's free, and it's fun.I can't really seem to get into the story very well however. My main character is a witch. She was sentenced to death for you know, being a witch. Stealing peoples children and junk. But she escaped I guess and went into exile... Uh.. and now i'm trying to kill this dude that's responsible.. I don't know. All the bosses seem normal-ish at first, but then they turn into giant monsters. I don't really know what they are or what's going on. But the game is fun so I just roll with it. Guess i'll try and pay attention to the dialogue at some point. The story itself just seems sort of boring. Anyway, none of that♥♥♥♥♥♥matters very much. It's a good game, you'll be too busy leveling your character and building it to care about what's going on anyway.Final Verdict: (4.3 out of 5)			"

												One of my main problems with the Action RPG genre is that they tend to be repetitive and boring, which is something that Path of Exile managed to surprise me with, especially so when you consider it's Free to Play (and not Pay to Win -all in game purchases are vanity purchases or stash spaces). The game can seem a little overwhelming at first with it's enormous and deeply complex skill tree and its myriad of skills. The combination of the two mean that you can make hundreds, even thousands of different combinations of characters and still find fresh and new builds.The game content (storyline) itself is rather short with it being easily possible to move through the story on all three difficulties within 10-15 hours before reaching the endgame content known as Maps. Maps have endless possibilities and are actually item drops much like weapons and armour which can also be enchanted using the various orbs in the game which also double as the currency as Path of Exile relies on a barter trade system rather than gold which is an interesting solution to the currency sink/inflation balance issue that plagues many games which rely on an economy.Path of Exile also has multiple leagues running at once, there are standard and hardcore leagues which are the life-long leagues which will run till the servers shutdown for the game which have economies that never get reset. Along side the two long running leagues there are 'mutation' 4 month leagues which will add a flavour onto the standard gameplay model and also allow players to start in a fresh economy on a regular basis which gives newer players an equal chance to acquire wealth. Once these leagues come to an end the player's wealth will be moved to the respective parent league (standard/hardcore). Further more Path of Exile also challenges players in short term leagues known as races where players will compete to reach the highest level or the furtherest through the content with different modifiers on each short term race, from turbo enemies, to endless monster farming zones ranging anywhere from 30 minutes to 1 week. Players will earn points during these races which get added up over the course of a race season to earn valuable unique items as rewards.That said, the thing that stopped me from playing the game was issues with ping spikes and lagging out, albeit most likely due to my connection, it seemed to be exacerbated by their lag compensation methods with consant desyncs and disconnects something I rarely suffer from in most other games I've played. That aside I would still strong recommend Path of Exile to anyone even remotely interested in ARPGs or looking for something new to play but don't want to spend much money.-----------------------------------------------------tl;dr-F2P not P2W.-Complex and deep. High replayability-Interesting economy.-Lag/internet issues seem to be more noticeable in this game compared to most other games.			"

												TL:DR - It's a very fun game and worth your time if you are a fan of point and click ARPGs. There is a lot of build variety and tons of gear to find. MTXs are fair and there are no PTW aspects. Stash tabs are the only thing that offer an advantage but that's mainly to make things easier for trading and hoarding. You can fully enjoy the game with the base 4 tabs if you manage your invetory as all ARPGs require. Avoid if you expect GGG support to help you in any cases where they may have made a mistake. Great game if you plan on playing for free. Start to spend money on it and pray to God that GGG never screws up an order that you made. Any kind of notice about it to them will result in a long and annoying process of proving you never got your goods and that they either never sent it. Any kind of positive resolution in your favor will most likely result in losing your account as was the case with mine. Bought the highest tier supporter pack they had for ascendancy league. Been supporting this game since closed beta (Steam time shows playtime during Perandus League) and when my signed art pack / T-Shirt never arrived in the mail and I only received half of the points I paid for due to some error with the package upgrades, I contacted GGG support. At first they appeared to be aware of the issue and told me to just wait a few days for them to sort it out. Days turned into weeks and after waiting from 3/13/16 to 4/12/16 I contacted them again. Still the deflection of, ""We're aware and we apologize. Please give us more time and we will make sure to contact you when your goods have been shipped."" I contacted my bank and explained the issue to them. They contacted GGG and GGG never replied. I contacted GGG again letting them know that I didn't want a refund but instead wanted what I paid for. End result, banning my account before a refund was even issued, emails going unanswered, and no shipping information received. So I got my refund and lost 3 years worth of support and effort. The only saving grace is that I managed to get my ascendancy pack refunded in full since terminating my account before any resolution could be reached results in a forfeit of sale.			"

												One perfect example of how F2P games should behave.It created a great diablo-like experience for people who felt that Diablo was lost when D3 was out, maintaining a completely free game save for cosmetic changes for your character, with different servers for different types of gameplay, like Hardcore servers and temporary servers.It's expansions have proven themselves to be top-tier too.If you like ARPGs, diablo-likes and good MMORPGs, go for it. It won't disappoint you.			"

												Path of Exile (PoE) definitely belongs amongst the best action RPGs that are currently out there. It offers a great amount of fun and challenge to players who are willing to spend time and effort in developing their character. There is a nice variety of classes to choose from and there are more than enough character slots available to try out different classes.Player's adventure starts in Normal mode where encounters are quite easy and balanced for new and veteran players. However things start getting rough as the player gradually goes through the acts (there are currently 3 acts, act 4 to be added soon) and difficulty levels (Cruel and Merciless). After completing the game in all available difficulties, players get to experience the many available maps, which are generally used for leveling and farming gear.The most fun thing about PoE is the freedom of choice regarding character development and selection of passive, and active skills. PoE's passive skill tree is extremely detailed and comprehensive. Almost all action RPGs allow for stat and skill allocation based on a character's archetype. However this level of detail is absolutely amazing. It pretty much allows for creating any type of character (mage, rogue, warrior and etc) with any class. Additionally, players are free to acquire and utilize any available skill and subsequently upgrade these (Naturally as long as their basic stats allow it).One thing about PoE that somewhat bothers me is the restriction on respecifying skill points. Players acquire some passive refund points as a reward for certain missions, additionally there are ""Orbs of regret"" that provide 1 passive refund point on use. However a full respec is virtually impossible except after any major patch release. So here's a word of advice to new players; plan ahead, spend your points wisely and don't be shy on reading the class forums. There is much useful knowledge to be gained that could save you a lot of time. I would absolutely recommend this game and invite you to try it. After all, Path of Exile is a free game and it won't cost you anything to experience it. Do try to buy some in-game (fluff)items to support the developers if you get hooked! (they really deserve it). -Sinner			"

												Path of exile Developer: Grinding Gear Games (GGG)Grade 9/10Review updated 3.11.2015 to take into account recent patches and expansionsFirst short review for those too well accustomed to modern hectic society:  Great game, although not flawless. Most importantly Path of exile is one of the most fair free to play games available.  As such there really is no good reason to not to try it.Good/bad:+ One of the most fair free to play games + Gameplay+ Variety of viable character builds+ Graphics+ Economy (from stability point of view)- Legacy items- More content would be appreciated (more coming but slowly)- Trading is difficultFull review:Before going to actual gameplay I want to emphasize the fact how fair this game is for a free to play game. Usually free to play games are more or less pay to win games but Path of exile is almost complete exception to this. Only pay to win feature of Path of exile is that with real money player can buy more stash tabs to which store stuff that can be shared by player’s characters in the same league.The extra stash tabs naturally do give minor advantage but this really starts to have an effect only when the player has played the game for hundreds of hours.  Thus the money grabbing is aimed at those players who already have played and enjoyed the game a lot and thus one could claim that these players ought to pay a little to support such an enjoyable game. Even then the payment is one time as those bought tabs are permanent. Most importantly however the extra stash tabs are definitely not mandatory even after hundreds of hours of gameplay. Next to the game itself. I am not expert when it comes to Action RPG games. As a prime example I never played Diablo 2 for which many people claim Path of exile to be better successor than Diablo 3 (which I haven’t played either). I would however claim Path of exile to be very good game. The main reason for this is the gameplay itself. It feels satiffying and the enemies are difficult but not too impossible. With many different viable builds in the game (more on this on nextt paragraph) can be replayed many times with different experience. with different characters (more on this later. As free game, you can easily go and verify this if you don't believe me.Another good thing is the skill tree, which is identical for all the classes. (classes only have different starting positions in the tree). This allows creating very interesting builds for your characters and actually surprisingly many of them are viable. With viable I mean reaching the end game. Naturally the amount of end game builds is bit smaller but even it is surprisingly large (especially according to what I have heard to be the case in other action RPG games. The different builds also seem to relatively balanced except temporary anomalies created by game updates. These are fixed usually sooner or later.Graphics are great which is always nice. The minimum graphical settings in this game are however quite high so low end PC owners may be in need of upgrade for playing this game (but as free game, try before upgrading)As he last notable good thing (writing more would make this review way too long) I am going to mention economy. All I can personally say is that it seems to work. Why this is important is that I have heard that in many other RPG games the economy does not work but instead for example the inflation of prices becomes ridiculous and starts to affect the game negatively.<The complaints about desynchronisation were here. Now GGG has finally introduced lockstep mode --> By default hit and movement detection works now like in MOBA's and RTS games, which is much much better than the original implementation. Desycnhronization issues are now problem only for those living really far from servers>The main flaw of the game is legacy items in permanent leagues. Legacy items are items that are no longer obtainable other than by trading from other players who already own them (with extremely high price of course). Unfortunately most of the legacy items were created by weakening the normally obtainable versions of these items. As result people who have these legacy versions are in practice equipped with items that are too powerful (balance wise) and obtaining these items is difficult for new players.Legacy items are not a problem in temporary leagues but some people like myself who would like to play in permanent leagues are forced to choose between two bad options: living with legacy items or playing temporary leagues.Second problem of Path of exile is lack story content. At the time of writing this the game has 4 chapters, which player has to pass in three difficulties before the ""end game"". More acts are coming but the progress is painfully slow. It should be noted that the end game is well done and that lessens this problem. When 5th chapter comes I will consider the amount of content acceptable. Third problem is that trading is impractical. The intended way to sell or buy items happens through trade chat, which is horribly flooded and yet very likely the people who would be willing to sell or buy what you want are not there when you are. There however are for example third party websites for listing items which helps a lot but GGG should really do something to fix this in-game.To summarize. The game definitely has some flaws but the good sides very clearly overcome these problems. As a very fair free to play game there is therefore no reason for not trying this game.			"

												Path of Exile > Torchlight 2 & Diablo 3.PoE is quite rare as it's one of the few true free to play games around, yet it offers plenty of content and depth compared to its competition which you have to pay for. Despite this the developers are maintaining a range of dedicated servers so even though you're forced to play online (just like D3), more people are able to have a decent online experience (they're even running an Australian server - something Blizzard has never bothered to do). In terms of visuals PoE might lack some polish, but it's refreshing to see the return of a gritty art style in a dark universe that isn't compromised so that more kiddies are able to play.As it stands PoE is definitely worth a try if you're into dungeon crawlers or just looking for a quick bash at multiplayer with friends.

												An awesome hack & slash game, some say the true Successor of Diablo 2.One of the few f2p games that contains so much content and replayability, it's a wonder it's not a full price retail game.The setting is strongly exotic, New Zealand-like, with many resemblances to Maori culture.The classes are quite definitive, but at the same time the game doesn't throw strict restriction on build paths and it makes for a pretty free selection of roles for your chars.The ""talent tree"" speaks for itself, the jokes about it's vastness are quite the thing amongst hack and slash gamers, but be advised, they are not that far from the truth.The skill system using gems is nice, fresh touch to the genre, the combat is rewarding, occasionally even challenging.Once you get into the game, the numerous temporary events (races and leagues) add one more unique touch to a game that is pretty innovative, even without them.The optimization is quite sufficient, it ran surprisingly smoothly on a kinda old rig.Definite recommendation to any hack & slash fan, or even to those new to the genre.

												This game is alot of fun. I never played diablo 2, but based on all the hype surrounding D3 I bought and played it. I couldnt get into it at all and got bored with it pretty fast. I saw this game got good reviews and was free so figured what the hell. Glad I did because it is great. For one thing, its completly free. No need to buy anything to progress in the game. I love the massive skill tree....it would have been incredible if they had an active skill tree like that as well. But on the flip side you have the skill orbs which adds an amazing amount of depth to the game. The further you go the more cool things you find that allow you to play around with the gem sockets to create some cool power effects. I love having cool spells to cast and the visuals in the game look great. No framerate drops or lagging ever. Beating up on bad guys never gets old and finding those rare peices of loot is always a joy. I have no idea what the story is about and dont really care. I just want to level up and expand on that massive skill tree while creating some killer gear. Highly recommend giving this game a look. You cant go wrong with free. This game could easily get retail value if they wanted. The folks at GGG should be commended for their efforts. Just a fantastic game.			"

												Let me start off by saying this is a fantastic ARPG.  I love the classes, the items, the spells, the customization with the passive skill tree, the viability of many builds.  I love this game.  But this game suffers from a fundamental, glaring, insulting and infuriating flaw (well, flaws, but more about that later).It desyncs constantly.  This may not be a big deal in early levels when mobs are fairly easy and the named/elite champs you fight aren't rocking proximity shields and damage reflection.  But when you're 60+, dealing with a room full of mobs that can literally 2-shot you if they get too close, it's borderline unplayable.  The difficulty factor would be perfect (probably a little too easy for archers) if it wasn't for these sneaky ninja-mobs that just show up and beat the living hell out of you.Another flaw (imo) is the gem system.  In games like Diablo, gems/runes are used to augment abilities or add buffs/bonuses.  In PoE, however, gems are both your skills and your buffs/augments.  On my 61 Ranger I have maybe 13 gems, 6 of which are skills and 3 of which are buffs.  That leaves me with 4 or 5 support gems, not a big deal.  The problem is that in order to upgrade a piece of equipment, I have to find one that is an ilvl upgrade, has a specific number of sockets in specific colors and in a specifically-linked configuration, is a rare or better, and has to have good modifiers.  The alternative is finding a random piece of equipment and burning mats to change the number/color/linkage/quality/attributes/bonuses.  This makes the game feel like a grind-fest.   And even then, I'd forgive this aspect if I didn't constantly desync.I want to love this game.  I've spent quite a lot of time playing, but I simply cannot play it anymore.  The desync issue is out of control, and absolutely breaks this game.			"

												Good:- Awesome game-play mechanics, similar to Diablo 2- Very playable with good re-playability - Awesome visuals and soundBad:- AWFUL community. Probably the worst and most rude players in history of multilayer gaming. For example after finishing the single-player I asked on chat ""How do I join pvp now, as there is no tutorial about it or anything."" As response I was attacked by 20 people calling me troll and idiot. Not even single person with positive attitude! - Super slow loading time, even on machine with 32GB of RAM. Just bad design.- too much ""rare"" items dropping, to the point where your inventory is full every 5 minutes seconds with rare and magical items- Very bad story telling, ruining the storyline.- Forced restarts of map every few minutes, which is super frustrating when you are in city and want to take 10 minute brake and sell the items. When you come back - your previously cleared  map is  restarted and replaced with other, making the progress in the game very slow, as you will be forced to re-do the same maps over and over if you dare to take 10 minute brake or got disconnection...Conclusion:Nice Diablo 2 style game, very playable, but ruined by bad storyline and shockingly rude and immature community. 5/10			"

												Didn't like Diablo III ? Well heres the better Diablo III :P A hack and slay that is free to play but NOT pay to win, and that's the awesome thing about it.The only problem, the weapon skins are way too expensive, so you will just buy one or two in your life xDOther than that, the passive skill tree is ♥♥♥♥ing huge.(Be aware, the whole picture is 16135 × 15300 and may slow down your pc xD)http://www.pathofexile.com/passive-skill-treeYou can basically do whatever you want with each of the 7 classes.You also have skill-gems (like the ones in Final Fantasy 7), that you can put on your armor to level them up and link them together to get better effects.Right now this game has 3 chapters with another possibly on the way.If you are a fan of any hack and slay, please give it a try. It's not the best visually, but it is an improvement over Diablo II, that doesn't look too bad.			"

												This game in a nutshell: Great game, but....It is what Diablo 3 should be, but has the biggest problem of Diablo 3 at release you always need to be connected. That is already a problem itself, but the game has a HUGE problem of desync. You can't move when you are surrounded by mobs or you may risk a desync. You can't use movement skills when near corners or you may risk a desync. That gets really annoying and completely remove some possible builds of the game. Why? You can't go glass cannon and rely in your skill to stay alive when the server can just say it didn't like what you were doing and throw you back 2 secs in the past, a place that now is surrounded by enemies.There's no ""class"". Every character can use all items and skills in the game. In fact skills are actual gems, that you equip in items. Nice idea... but the characters lose identity. Instead of picking the character they should allow you to make your own customization.And what is worse.The game has a clean HUD, BUT it has 0 notification. miss, damage taken, damage done or whatever. You have 0 notifications if your character that is swinging the weapon in the air is missing, got desynced or is just out of range.For what i googled people were complaining since release but the devs want to keep the game ""clean"". Instead of allowing the player to turn notification on and off, they play the game ""daddy know better"" and make a game with alot of potential into something that you end with mixed feelings about.TL:DR The game is good, but there's issues that will make you made. At lower difficulties you will not notice, but later on you will feel and hate it, ALOT.Edit: I forgot a important point.Back into the ""no class"" thing. While it looks nice and all, it kills melee characters. Why? Ranged characters can have the same armor, life, evasion and damage that you while being ranged, there's no mechanic that a melee character can do that one ranged can't do. Add that with Monsters that have skills that kite, blind, freeze, release cloud of poison/fire/ice/lightning or even, in most of the bosses, oneshot your character there's NO reason to play a melee character unless you want to prove something. And i'm serious. Playing melee is at least 3x harder than a ranged character.And again the devs play the ""daddy know better"" game.			"

												Possibly a best Hack and Slash Action RPG game that is free to play without any pay to win things.I have logged lots of hours, played it religiously I am well aware of it's pros and cons without being biased like many of the fans are. I still do believe this game is how Diablo 3 should have been.But it still has few problems and is far from perfection.Game play 7/10-----------------------+ Decision makings are important and need to research a lot about the game+ Skill tree makes you think a lot.+ Orb Trading system+ Variety of skill gems + Free to play+ No pay to win (except stash tabs)-  Legacy items-  Bad economy in permanent leagues-  Balance changes that may destroy your builds.-  Desync related problems that may get fixed later.-  Map system that is too RNG based.-  Frequent Nerfs and balance changes- Act 4 requires reflexes and some mechanics that are unfriendly to newbies.- Overtuned mobs and survivability is more important than Damage to level up or stay in HC ladder. Graphis 7/10------------+ Dark and Gloomy atmosphere for mature players.+ Realistic and not cartoony Graphics like TL2 or Diablo 3.-  Arrows on rocks and do not disappear.- Monsters stay on ground causing clutter.Story 9/10---------------+A story that reminds you of relationship between England and Australia, where protagonist is exiled into a fearsome island named, Wreclast.+Story is still being worked on, but really need to think and read everything in order to understand what is going on with the history of the island.+Dependent on flavor texsts of unique items, npcs, and objects in level, it's more of a game where you have to pick up clues and solve the puzzle.+Dark fantasyOverall its a great game, but you may want to think about builds (if devs like it or not and pay lots of attention to patch notes if you are concerned about nerfs).For a bonus.PoE in Nutshell for pre-2.0---------------------------------------lvl 1-60= build check lvl 60-80= gear check lvl 80-90= luck check lvl 90-100= patience checkPot in Nutshell of 2.0-------------------------------Act 1- Act 3= ez modeAct 4= Farming barrier until next difficulty.GLHF.

												500 hours in and no end in sight, speaks for itself. If you like ARPG, Path of Exile is the must play to end all must plays.ProsEconomic design is intricate and thrivingSkill and character progression has depth beyond measureArt, sound, and animation is beautifulCustomizable player housingPerfect league and ladder designFrequent large content updatesTrue free to play, no pay walls periodConsMy singular issue with the game is how anticheat is handled. The methods used are extremely overbearing. All actions are controlled by a prediction system at the server level, and it is frequently confused. The result feels like lag but is actually the server forcing erronious corrections on your client. This has a large negative impact on the game.Overall, 9/10. If they rethought and redesigned their anticheat system it would be 11/10.Version 2.0 Edit:Thought I'd update this and say they have now greatly improved, if not entirely fixed my concerns with the predictive server syncing. They've improved this from a few different angles. Firstly they've diversified their datacenter locations so you're much more likely to be on a low latency server. Secondly they've added a new primary data sync mode called lockstep which does not desync but only works well on low latency connections. Thirdly they've improved the overall responsiveness and accuracy of the predictive sync mode for high latency players. I was not the only one who felt the old predictive mode stifled this game's quality feel. They've heard our concerns and went to incredible lengths to do right for us. Game is now a serious, solid 11/10.			"

The real sequel to Diablo 2.Diablo was fun. Diablo 2 was amazing, years past it's prime. Median mod brought life back to it as it aged. Diablo 3 was announced and everyone celebrated but as more and more came out about it gamer's hopes were dashed. All the brilliance that Blizzard North had created in the franchise, the things that made Diablo what it was, left the company with the people who originally made it. Thanks to some active, gamer-friendly, chatty developers in New Zealand, Path of Exile is as close as what would have been as crowdfunding and copyrights allow.Pros: Free to play, reasonable system requirements, Diablo 3, wonderous innovations to the genre, very deep, infinite endgame, friendly chat-available developers, great events and leagues.Cons: No classic Diablo story or characters, no offline/LAN play, complex trading economy, higher learning curve than more popular titles. No full tutorial.Other: BRUTAL sometimes offensive and very ""mature"" community in chat. Not a game, nor community for children or people with delicate sensibilities. Remember classic Battle.net? It's like that but ruder and smarter. I entirely prefer the ""free speech"" approach but some, maybe most, may not.I don't think there's anything Diablo 3 got right that Path of Exile got wrong. The only issue I personally have with the game is the complexity of attempting to trade for gear and currency items that I need. WHEN you play the game, make sure to pay close attention to what little instructional help it provides, because you don't get much.			"

												I've been playing this for over 3,000 hours, and I don't think I'll stop anytime soon. Sure, I might take a break to play something else, but Path of Exile has a way of drawing me back in. This is the best of free to play, in that everything you can buy is purely cosmetic (with the exception of extra stash tabs and character slots, but I've yet to hit the default character limit of 24). Having played Diablo 2, years ago, and having gotten tired of a game that I enjoyed being neglected by its developer, Path of Exile makes me happy in ways that game never did, with constant updates, fixes, and new content that continually expand the game and make it feel like there's always something new to try.I won't lie - the learning curve can be steep, and your first character or two will ultimately be ill equipped to handle the highest difficulty level, e.g. the third play through at high level. That's when you have to look up build guides on the forums, for tested builds that can survive the punishment that is Merciless difficulty and thrive. The passive skill tree is enormous and sprawling, and takes time to memorize and navigate, and many mechanics can be confusing until later on.All that said, when you start to get the hang of it, and you've conquered the basics, a whole new level of possibilities open up. It's hard to describe, but I'd like it to learning to ride a bike - once you get the basics, you can experiment with the more advanced stuff.Lastly, the developers are really good at replying to questions and suggestions, whether it's by email or on their forums. I have yet to play another game with this level of support.All in all, this is my favourite ARPG, and will likely remain so for years to come.			"

												Henk Lostsword isn't your average exile.  He's on a path.  Is he on a path of good or of bad?  Well, that's up to you.It's easy to criticize this game for what it is not.  It's not Diablo, despite what others may tell you, and the differences can be a letdown to some.  It's not a first-person shooter, nor is it a side-scrolling beat 'em up.  It's not particularly novel in its handling of top down, hack-slash-and-loot gameplay.  It's not an episode of ""Cheers"" re-recorded on VHS with a two minute portion of ""Scarecrow and Mrs. King"" still left at the beginning that you have to wait through.  It's not a warm buttered scone on a Tuesday morning.  What the game is, is a solid beefsome electronic hoppy experience with a bold hearty finish and a wide variety of gameplay options to delight gamers of any age group or gender identity.You play as one of two types of mystical beings from the Immortal Cube, a land beyond time and space where immaterial aberrations sleep until it is their time to manifest as Daemons in the mortal realm.  One playable Daemon type is the Whiteshadow, who benefits from high Space and low Time; a natural healer and tank, who pulls damage and watches over the party's HP during critical combat encounters.  The other playable Dragoon is Melissa: She's a hacker from a near-future Australia, during a cyberwar that threatens to destroy both Western and Asian infrastructure.  Exiled from her home country as the world is divided into two key factions, she takes refuge on a series of interconnected rogue naval vessels in international waters and plans her digital assault from her ""pirate flotilla"".So here's the deal: Each piece of equipment that the party obtains has ""battle magic slots"", refered to in the game's media as BMS.  Each BMS lets you assign a new battle magic to your mech.  Some of the slots are linked together, allowing for Fusion Magic and other neat ways to upgrade your Core Stats.  Coming up with creative ways to augment and empower your spells is critical to your success, as the game's many different challenges diminish the successes of raw number stacking.  Adaptation Gems, when slotted in the correct gear, can make this task easier, by automatically mutating your battle magic to the necessary Color that will deal the most damage.  I had the most fun using Adaptation Gems and series of low level Fusions, linked together so I didn't have to worry about picking which magic to use.  This allowed me to focus on the dodge and roll techniques crucial to the game's action.  But there's definitely a play style for the calculating tacticians, too, where deliberate decision-making and pre-battle planning can give your mech an unbeatable advantage.Get this♥♥♥♥♥♥The game's level pacing is excellent.  Every fifteen to thirty minutes of gameplay, you increase in level and get to add a new Spirit Sphere to your Mana Web.  Every four of those causes one of your Core Stats to increment, allowing you to hold a new piece of gear associated with that stat.  What starts as a simple game becomes intriguingly complex after just a few hours of gameplay, and those decisions are neatly folded into your gameplay before other considerations arise later on.  But if you make a bad choice early on, don't fret!  Take-Em-Bax, a special Game Token provided in the in-game store, allows you to reassign any one skill that you regret assigning.  Take-Em-Bax cost a mere $0.75 per skill, allowing you to build a fresh new character at level 100 for about $8.  The cosmetics available in the store, however, have price tags that are a little too lofty for my liking.  You Rockafellers out there may disagree.The hacking minigame still needs work, as does the lockpicking drudgery (I found myself using triangle to ""skip action sequence"" at least five separate times), but the other aspects of gameplay fall neatly into place without disrupting the continuous ""movie-like"" quality of the game.  While not the most visually-stunning game of 2014, it has the best audio by far and has committed much of its budget to its all-star cast, including Joan Jett voicing one of the game's more memorable NPCs.All things considered, I give this game 500 value points for art, 800 for gameplay, and another 150 bonus, and 15 points.  Pick this game up if you have some wealth, ♥♥♥♥o.  If not, why not get paid already?  People respect you and they respect your talents.  Just apply what you do here to your career, to your family, to everything you do.  You are important.  But you sell yourself short too often--we all see it.How do you know they won't hire you if you don't try?  Just put out the application and say ""♥♥♥♥ it"" if it doesn't pan out.  You do this five or ten times, you're getting hired somewhere.  No one lands that dream job first thing.  The baby boomer's ideal of the American dream is over.  Jobs are scarce, so learn to make your goals a little more realistic.  Start reasonable and work your way up.  Before you know it, you've got $30 in your pocket--and that's enough to get started on your very own Pathof Exile.			"

												One of the greatest concepts ever. The highly customizable builds makes this game sometimes a bit too much enjoyable actually, beside the fact the desync is a thing since release. Desync is really a thing you need to admit to at this game and if you can't you'll end up ragequitting anyways. Had the most fun I've ever had in a game with a build (Facebreaker Cyclone) which actually 'caused desync quite a bit and it didn't irritated me at all to be honest. The gem system is really worked out well and the replay value of endgame is amazingly high. Don't expect to see other mobs or other maps a lot, but expect to see dangerous and deadly combinations of these two a lot if you wan't to risk it! You need to make this game enjoyable yourself by asking help of others as well, the game is kind of hard to get into but once you're in it's hard to get out. This game is one of the definitions of addiction and dedication but it's totally worth it. I would highly recommend to start the game in a heroic league, the best way to learn is failing in this game!			"

Heres a loot chest with 2000% item rarity you get 2 white items with 2 socets each congrats super rare no no really thats all you get run along now. terrible loot roller and just terribly unfun past the normal difficulty dont waste your time on this game. The trade community is rude and unkind especially to new players. I have given this game many chances and wrote a fairly kind review in the past but i must change my mind in saying this game is terrible and just not at all worth it.			"

												like some sort of horrifying cancer that just won't stay in remission, this game has invaded my life in ways that frighten me, from my 300+ hours on record to my rather disturbing and highly nsfw trollfiction i wrote about it, to making a video of it with what basically amounted to n64 visualsthe game has stolen my soul, for reasons i can't even name, there are better arpgs out there and the problem with poe is that it's basically the grindiest game with the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ""meta"" where most builds you make will probably fall apart around act 3 on cruel, some of the ideas range from ""cool but not really useful"" to ""awful and invasive"" such as the ♥♥♥♥ing over-reliance on trading to get certain items or the ♥♥♥♥ING RNG, with a community so toxic from what i recall that general chat is often left on for me so i can gaze in awe at just how a bunch of sweaty nerds can REALLY start arguing over lol versus dota versus poe for some ♥♥♥♥ing reason even though it's not even a mobaand yet, i find myself drawn to it, because for some reason that same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t meta hasn't stopped me from making some really fun build ideas WORK, the community isn't really needed to interact with, and while most of the items are kinda boring some of the uniques are genuinely entertaining to build characters around, as well as something about wiping out entire groups because of cold aoe damage coupled with crits being infinitely satisfying to mesend help, i can't stop playing no matter how much i try to tear myself awaypleaseedit: OH GOD I WAS WRONG I HAVE 400+ HOURS PLEASE HELP			"

Its got a splash of everything great, little issues and most of all the content updates are out of this world. I would glady pay 60$ for this game rather than D3, I want this game to have my babies. 11/10 would unplug granny for more support packs.			"

												Excellent game with zero pay to win, and a playerbase comprised of cancerous bootlickers. Too bad, the game had so much to offer.If you play this game entirely solo, you will not be able to advance on the hardest difficulty since you have to trade with players to get the best gear using the game's flawed bartering system. And since the playerbase is a huge mass of elitists the higher up and further you progress, the more cancer you will have to deal with.Upvote for anything before the midgame, downvote for anything afterwards, downvote overall since the game's design encourages this kind of interaction.Edit: One other thing. The game has the biggest skill system of all time. It's massive, and it's fun to experiment with. However, there is no way to full reset your entire skill tree, other than by getting extremely rare orbs that only remove a single skill selection that you recently picked at a time. Given how massive the tree is, this means if you plot out a massive map of where all your skills go, but you later find out your plot had a poor selection anywhere near the beginning, you have essentially no way to undo all the way back to the mistake and fix it. Furthermore, if you get bored of one particularly long line of skill progression, you have almost no way to undo back to the beginning and reset your entire tree and re-allocate it.For many in the cancerous community, this is just great! They have no lives and are willing to spend 60 hours getting to max level and then restarting a whole new character just to try out an alternate build. For people like me with a job, this means you will either be perpetually stuck in the first 30-60ish levels of a character build as you reset a whole new character to try a new skill build, or you can only play one character for 85 hours before finding out all your effort was wasted and your character sucks.If Diablo 3 can have a way smaller skill system with the ability to full reset a character, so can this game. I am not buying the playerbase's excuses for the devs reasoning for intentionally leaving this out.			"

												This game is irritatingly addictive.  I spent the weekend I got it playing it, instead of doing work I had intended to do.This is an ARPG, and as such, there's not a whole lot of innovation when it comes to the actualy gameplay.  Overhead view, point a spam your mousebutton, pick up loot.  This isn't to say it doesn't do this well, as I found the experience to be enjoyable.  Intuitive controls, good challenge level (i.e., I'm not throwing my mouse in frustration of how hard it is, but I do sometimes have to think tactically, and retreat to defeat the horde against me).Where this game earns its points is in its passive skill tree, it's gem-based skills (think materia from FFVII), and its in-game economy.The passive skill tree can be a little overwhelming at first, since there is a LOT.  Once you spend a little time perusing it, and understanding how it works, it can start to seem kind of dull (how many times can you get a +10 to dex before you're looking for a little more, though there are other nodes to work with!).  Then, it hits you.  I can completely customize this character, and how it plays.  Want to be a duel-weilding lighning specialist?  Can do.  Fire-based summoner?  Alright, we can do that.  Want to just TANK with a really big axe?  We can do that, too.  The possibilities for different builds are bountiful.Combine the skill tree with experience-gaining leveling skill orbs that can be socketed into items, and you have a great combination for customization.The economy is another place where the devs took a different route than many others.  Money doesn't exist in this game.  Instead, you have barter system.  Normal items give you pieces of Wisdom scrolls (read: identify item), which eventually form into a whole scroll.  Whole scrolls also drop as loot, so this isn't your only means of ID'g an item.  Magical itmes might be worth augmentation shards, or transmutation shards, or other items.  While there is a formula to what the vendors give in exchange for what, it does teach you to think about loot grabs differently than other games.  In Diablo, or Torchlight for example, eventually normal items got left behind for magical, and even those eventaully weren't worth the inventory space.  In PoE, every item gets looked at individually.  Are you in need of ID scrolls?  Start picking up low-space normals.  Are you looking for a specific socket pattern for a weapon you want to try to craft?  Each item could be that thing you want!  Even that normal sword that, in other ARPGs would get left behind!  I personally found this to be a refreshing change of pace.Even the meta-economy gets a little more interesting with no money.  What exactly is that unique piece of armor worth to you?The best part of this game is its price.  Free.  And actually FREE.  Not, ""free to sign up, but in order to beat this boss you need to spend $5 to get this one item you will only use once.""  GGG has made a commitment to makig this game truly free.  While there are microtransactions available, they are purely cosmetic, offer no advantage, and are completely voluntary.  I am more likely to spend money on these, because they aren't forced on me, than I am any ""need to buy to progress"" stuff.  If you are enjoying the game, I suggest grabbing some of this as it helps the devs continue to make great games, and you get nifty effects for your character (like flaming footprints, or glowing blue weapons!) I haven't done any parties or PvP yet, so I can't comment on those mechanics, but I plan to check those out a little more as the time goes on.So far, great game.  The first expansion is being released in a few days from this review, and I can't wait to see what these guys come up with!			"

												The core game is pretty good with lots of character diversity and future potential, however the end game is currently rather lack luster having a high barrier to entry putting you largely at the mercy of the gods of RNG, who are never kind. This game suffers from some of the worst RNG issues i've ever seen, and generally is designed to cater to the super hardcore element. The cosmetic microtransactions which fund the game are extremely expensive however there is no pay to win, unless you count buying extra stash space which to be honest is kind of necessary for any serious player; expect to dump $50-$100 on stash tabs if you get sucked into this game just to have room for your basic needs. The amount of storage space you get for free is rather pitiful; my advice is to wait for a stash tab bundle sale as they seem to happen on average once a month. The biggest thing holding this game back is the antiquated trade system. Because of the bad RNG issue the only way to truely progress into end game is to trade for the things you need, if you try and play only self found you will get no where in end game very slowly. The developer promissed a robust trade system through their website back in beta but have so far failed to deliver and don't seem to have it as a development priority; the game suffers immensely because of this.I'd recommend POE If you were a fan of diablo 2 and thought diablo 3 was terrible, you will probably enjoy this game. If you are the kind of person who can't handle complex character development then you will definately hate this game.			"

												This game is a bit of an oddity... when you begin to play, the content and possibilities are so far beyond comprehension. So you will basically create couple (2 - 5) characters that are completely unplayable because you don't know what you're doing. Eventually you get the idea behind creating characters that should be viable, and then create a couple (2-5) characters that are viable until the late stages of the game and only then become unviable to play... Eventually you get frustrated and go see a tutorial and realize none of your characters actually had any potential because you weren't familiar with aspects such as douple dipping, defences and minmaxing one aspect of the game to its fullest potential. Then you create a recommended character, grind and farm for weeks and then you realize that the freedom you originally thought you had in creating characters was lost somewhere. Having played ~1300 hours of this, I still don't know how to make unique characters that can finish the entire game - that said, maybe I am just a slow learner. Perhaps the next ~1300 hours are the key of understanding...			"

												I have put many hours into this game and will put many more. This game is worth your time and mind, its not your regular MMO-DungeonCrawler-RPG-BirdView-HackAndSlash.. game, it has the most complex passive skill tree i have ever seen, the gameplay mechanics, the graphics(might i add that it is superbly optimized) The game is near perfection and if you have a chance to play it, you definitely should. 91/100 Because while its all awesome you do actually need to put some brains and hard work and farm in meaning its not for exactly everyone.

												Best looking rpg to date. Supports instanced areas for solo pve and co-op. Pvp is limited to arena fights. Has a nice skill gem system and a massive tree of passive buffs and bonuses. Difficulty starts off low but increases fast. I've created dozens of characters over the years with wildly different builds but never got any beyond level 6x.

												I just wanna start by saying Path Of Exile is in my opinion one of the best free to play games available. Hands Down Simple Not even much of an argument. I have hundreds of hours of play time in the game. Not only that but its all completley free. Im going to attempt to list the positive aspetcs of this game 1. NOT Pay to Win2. Micros are actually cool and worth it3. Almost endless possibilites4. Theory crafters dream5. Endless combination6. amazing dev team7. Constant Updates8. Btter than D3 by a landslide9. Free10. free11. Free12. Best dev team13. Trading done rightOnly things I can think of that could use work1. Certain aspetcs of the skill tree are pretty much the same in every build Mainly going CI2. Cast when damage taken setups are like mandatory other than these things which the new player wont experience for a while this game is Hands down amazing			"

												This is a beautifully made game, I have been playing for 3 days now and it is indeed satisfying and thrilling. It does take some time to get used to and the learning curve for the game mechanics is huge but certainly worth the effort to know about. The best thing that me and most of the other gaming community appreciates about this game is it's not Pay 2 Win which basically means money can't fast forward you or change your gaming abilities. I salute the company for keeping gamers' interest  ahead of money making and I think this makes it fun and satisying for both sides in the long run. The only thing one can buy with money are some special effects, extra character slots. etc. which don't alter your actual game play; that's a very good revenue generation model. Thanks to PoE I don't have to worry anymore about  other games and their buy-this and buy-that popups.			"

												From the first time that I played this, I knew I was going to like it. I have made multiple characters and have only completed 2 acts (Very Nooby). This game, THIS GAME...Is fun. Not in a diablo 2 kind of way. It's like diablo had a baby and this is the offspring. Quite a great game to play with your friends if you liked diablo or diablo 2. Interface is pretty sweet. Customization is pretty good as well. Would be sweet if you could dye your armor/clothes though. Armor is great though! You can get rare pieces that can turn your stuff into rare items, passive abilites and much more. The spells is what is really keeping me going here. You can get these gems and socket them into your weapons/armor for more spells and abilites. I highly recommend this game if you are looking for a great f2p game. This game maybe a little old, but it's quite a delight! 9/10 would play again.			"

												Path of Exile is actually one of the BEST MMOs I've ever played. The combat itself isn't really different from any other MMORPG's, but the gem system and how they give you skills is definitely pretty unique. You aren't bombarded by microtransactions, if at all, and I like how it works on an instance system.So far the game hasn't been overly hard, but I've died here and there. There are a few especially hard parts that I really liked, like the final boss of Act 1.The community is definitely a big part of the game. Most people in chat are kind enough to give new players help, and having the trade chat helps people trade stuff for other stuff.What I really love is the flexibility of each character, due to the passive skills. It's totally viable to make your duelist magic-focused, ranged, or even all-around. Graphics-wise, the game looks pretty great. The places in game are beautiful, especially the forest areas in Act 2 and the town in Act 3. It's also pretty aesthetically pleasing, and has a nice vibrant mood to it.The only complaints I have are how long it takes for the game to load up sometimes, but that's probably because of my mediocre laptop. The story is a little negligible and none of the NPCs so far have really been memorable, but they're nice to have around anyways.Overall, yes, you should try this game. It's free to play, so you've got nothing to lose by at least trying it out, but if you like other games like Torchlight or Diablo, then you'll definitely like this game too.			"

												Beautiful but dark (in tone) graphics with nice lighting effects. Excellent for a F2P game.The mechanics are reminiscent of Diablo and Torchlight, but I think it wins over D3 and T2 any time. The passive skill tree is massive and allows you to take your character in totally different directions.Trade is also more realistic, in that there is no gold but you have to trade things for various scrap parts. A refreshing twist.			"

												Diablo 2 has many imitators, but this one is the only worthy successor. Where other titles such as Torchlight and even Diablo 3 were content to dumb down the formula for casual players, Path of Exile retains all the character build complexity of it's inspiration. With custom ladders to keep the item economy fresh, there's always something to do. If you get bored of this game, stop playing ARPGs. It's all downhill from here.			"

The universal skilltree, is likely the best and most open part of the game where you can design any character to be exactly how you want them, and the ability to place any skill-gem on any type of character makes for infinate meta-game.For free, it's a no brainer!

It also is by NO MEANS pay to win.. Which is great, its actually pay to look awesome.. While I must say I feel the micro transaction stuff is a lil pricey i do understand why it must be.. That would be the only ""con"" i can think of. But yeah I really REALLY REALLY recomend this game. It may seem complicated at first, but once you get used to it, it's really not bad. As for the player base, there is a large amount of ppl always playing, and for the most part they are rather nice. Also no gold, the crafting mats. are the currency, that can be a pain but.. meh it could be much worse!!			"

												This game is the true sucsessor to diablo 2. Great asthetic, a unique currency system dependant on the player created economy and a HUGE skill tree to help customize and create your own unique builds and playstyles. So far I am nearing 200 hours in Path of Exile and have yet to reach late game, because I spend my time making new builds and seeing how they fair against each other. It is a really fun ARPG so if you enjoyed diablo 2 3 or any other sort of ARPG like torchlight, give Path of Exile a try, it'll grow on you.			"

												Path of Exile is one of those games that I really wish I would have put a lot more time into sooner. It is one of those rare free to play games that doesn't attempt to cram microtransactions down your throat at every turn. It is also rare in that character building is insanely in-depth. It is actually possible to get lost looking at the skill grid because of how huge it is, and it really leaves you with a great variety of different ways to build each character. Do you want to be a tank? A necromancer that can summon armies of undead? An archer that can fill the screen with arrows? You can do all of that and so much more.A word of warning, however: This game is quite difficult if you are not a veteran of similar games. But if you can adapt to the learning curve, it is definitely a game that will reward you for your efforts and time spent.			"

												This is a great example of a typical hack and slash game. It has its mechanics down very solid and does not try to do things the devs no they can not do well in. Although it may be a little less pretty to some than Diablo it is free and brings a new flavor the genre where most people have only played Diablo and Torchlight. Also speaking of the free it is not a p2w at all. Just like many games in thr MOBA genre the hard currency purchases only give the buyer cosmetic items and no actaul in game. Its free and its a pretty good game, if you have the room on your hardrive download it.			"

												Woops, I didn't write a review on this one?Thus I, too, am to blame this gem didn't/doesn't get the audience it deserves.Yes, I also don't trust Free-to-Play games. I don't like the business model and I don't like the way their gameplay mechanics  function.This, however, is one of the few games which are TRUELY free-to-play. This game is so fair you almost feel bad if you don't pay anything (maybe that's how they get you to spend your money... ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!). The things you can buy are purely decorative except for cheap extra space in your item chest (but it's already so big you don't even need it if you just play through the game once or twice).So yeah, what you get absolutely for free here is a full game and there's nothing that feels cheap about it. It does have a rather classical feel, though. Actually, this is the only other game which gave me that Diablo II feeling. It's not the same and Path of Exile has a lot of good gameplay ideas and a whole fantasy world of its own, so don't expect a clone.It's been a while now that I've played through it and I cannot really point out any details about what I liked especially and what bothered me, but I do remember I had a good time with this and if you liked Diablo II you should really give this one a try. Because it has had some big updates and new content since I've stopped playing I might pick it up again soon. Maybe playing alongside you guys because co-op playing works quite well also :)			"

												*This review was for the ""Sacrifice of Vaal"" It has since been updated (A lot) and I look forward to updating the review*Hello Close friends and strangers of the internet, I'm back from Melbourne and, after 16 hours of gaming in the back seat of my car, feel the need to review the game ""Path of Exile."" Let's get startedI'd like to preface this review by saying that This Game Is Free. You've got nothing to lose by installing it.""Path of Exile"" is a Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (I could have said ""MMO RPG"" but I sound like a legitimate game critic when I say it like that) Which I'm sure is a genre that we've all had our experiences in (Runescape, Rift Ect.) I have to say out of all the games I've played in this genre, this one is done very well. The mechanics are commendable but not overly different, the storyline and variation of the missions, average. The graphics aren't fantastic, but hey, it's a free game. What do you expect? I'm yet to try out the Co-op (Mainly because I have a serious lack of friends) But the duelling system is fairly balanced and fair and overall, games like this are just generally addictingNow, I know your probably losing interest because this is sounding like every other MMO RPG but hold on, I'm getting to the good stuffThe best thing about this game is easily the passive skill tree. I know that sounds underwhelming but trust me, It could take days to plot a good path through this thing, I'm just trying to guess which direction I should head but in reality, this skill tree is so big it doesn't even fit on my computer screen. It's taken me 10 hours to figure out how the class and items work together (shown directly below.)Forgive me if I’ve gotten this wrong, I've only played through the first act as a witch (Yeah, I'm still a noob)I like to think of the class system as a colour wheel. There are 3 primary classes (one focused on intelligence, one on strength and one on dexterity) and 3 secondary classes, each one composed of 2 others (The duellist focuses on Strength and dexterity, the cleric focuses on strength and intelligence and the thief focuses on dexterity and intelligence.) These different classes all dictate where you start on the passive skill tree, shaped like a colour wheel. Most of the powerful items are clearly designed for a certain class as the all require a combination of the three traits (Intelligence, strength and dexterity) One that only requires intelligence is obviously designed for the person who is starts in the middle of the ""Intelligence"" area in the passive skill tree Whereas an item that requires dexterity and strength is made for the class which is a combo of dexterity and strength.Wow, that probably confused the F*ck out of you guys, it's really difficult to explain, it's so complex you could spend hours researching it.The items all have combinations of 3 different traits (Wow, the developers must've really liked the number 3!) Evasion, energy shield and amour. Evasion determines how likely you are to dodge an attack, Amour determines how much of the damage is block and energy shield reminds me a lot of the ""overshield"" from Halo or Mass Effect. It exists and if attacked, the energy shield is drained rather than your health. When the energy shield is depleted, you will have no defences other than your amour and evasion skills. The energy shield will restore after a period of not being attacked. However, your health will regenerate very slowly regardless of which items you wear. Each of the traits the amour has (Evasion, Amour and Energy shield) Link up to the traits the class has (Dexterity for Evasion, Amour for strength and Energy shield for intelligence) This is not a set rule but most items will have a requirement to meet.Are you still following me? If you're not, it's okay. Even If I confused you, you’re probably noticing how in-depth this game is.Finally, slots of amour have different coloured gem slots. There are three different coloured gems (So many ♥♥♥♥ING THREES!) And 3 different coloured gems (AHHHHHHH) which all link up to the 3 traits of the classes (I think I'm developing a ""3"" fetish) The red gems are usually for Melee combat, the green ones are for archery and the blue ones for magic. Some monsters resist certain types of these abilities, some resist fire, frost or lightning. Some monsters also can summon smaller units, perform similar abilities to what the player can perform and some monsters have energy shields.Okay, I'm done. Thanks for reading if you made it this far. Click the like button if you did. I swear, it took ages to write this out and last review I did, not a single person liked it :(. I strongly recommend this game for all people who love a good MMO RPG. I would love to have one of my close friend (Jacob, Brodie, Dom, Josh, Lachlan, Sam, I'm looking at you guys.) to pick up this game so that I wouldn't have to continue this crazily confusing experience alone. All in all, because it's a free game I'm giving it an 8.5/10			"

												There's alot of pro and cons for this game.-Better stat/skill system than the 100s of RPG's I played so far.-True f2p, no pay to win stuff.-Great graphics.-Extremely long-term game, you can probably play for 100 hours+ and still want to try new builds.-Tons of updates and player-made uniques.There's also a few bad things about the game...-You spend more time thinking about builds than playing the game, this is very true if you want a ''perfect'' character, because you need to plan everything or buy regrets orbs/ reset your bandits quest rewards ( Via in game currency. )Overall this game is 100% worth trying, It has a good Diablo feeling and the way trading works is with Orbs/Items trading, there's no gold.Also this game is about to get Act V added to it, I can't wait!

Path of ExilePath of Exile is very good game which is a similar to Diablo III. The game is long and we do not even have to pay to complete main story. Yes, the game is a really hard at the next difficulty however game is not that impossible to finish when we play with friends or some people on servers. We can play on regular mode where we dont lose our items and experience we dont lose that much after our death. Hardcore its much harder because if you die your char placed in the regular mode. We have to choose one of the seven classes like such as duelist, witch, ranger, templar, marauder, schadow and scion. All of this classes use different skills. This game have a really huge skill tree and when we got new level they are give us a points which we can put to various abilities like a faster HP and MP regeneration,an  damage to various weapons and magic. The last thing is a gems thatsthats we can find at our path and use at the armors or weapons to be more effective. Game is a really cool, have a nice sounds and pretty grapic btw... is very well optimized but however can quickly get bored you. Something that makes me worried that my antivirus detect attacks on my computer during strating the game. If you are afraid do not install this game or do that at their own risk if you do not have a antivirus. My rating is a 7/10. "

												*This review was for the ""Sacrifice of Vaal"" It has since been updated (A lot) and I look forward to updating the review*Hello Close friends and strangers of the internet, I'm back from Melbourne and, after 16 hours of gaming in the back seat of my car, feel the need to review the game ""Path of Exile."" Let's get startedI'd like to preface this review by saying that This Game Is Free. You've got nothing to lose by installing it.""Path of Exile"" is a Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (I could have said ""MMO RPG"" but I sound like a legitimate game critic when I say it like that) Which I'm sure is a genre that we've all had our experiences in (Runescape, Rift Ect.) I have to say out of all the games I've played in this genre, this one is done very well. The mechanics are commendable but not overly different, the storyline and variation of the missions, average. The graphics aren't fantastic, but hey, it's a free game. What do you expect? I'm yet to try out the Co-op (Mainly because I have a serious lack of friends) But the duelling system is fairly balanced and fair and overall, games like this are just generally addictingNow, I know your probably losing interest because this is sounding like every other MMO RPG but hold on, I'm getting to the good stuffThe best thing about this game is easily the passive skill tree. I know that sounds underwhelming but trust me, It could take days to plot a good path through this thing, I'm just trying to guess which direction I should head but in reality, this skill tree is so big it doesn't even fit on my computer screen. It's taken me 10 hours to figure out how the class and items work together (shown directly below.)Forgive me if I’ve gotten this wrong, I've only played through the first act as a witch (Yeah, I'm still a noob)I like to think of the class system as a colour wheel. There are 3 primary classes (one focused on intelligence, one on strength and one on dexterity) and 3 secondary classes, each one composed of 2 others (The duellist focuses on Strength and dexterity, the cleric focuses on strength and intelligence and the thief focuses on dexterity and intelligence.) These different classes all dictate where you start on the passive skill tree, shaped like a colour wheel. Most of the powerful items are clearly designed for a certain class as the all require a combination of the three traits (Intelligence, strength and dexterity) One that only requires intelligence is obviously designed for the person who is starts in the middle of the ""Intelligence"" area in the passive skill tree Whereas an item that requires dexterity and strength is made for the class which is a combo of dexterity and strength.Wow, that probably confused the F*ck out of you guys, it's really difficult to explain, it's so complex you could spend hours researching it.The items all have combinations of 3 different traits (Wow, the developers must've really liked the number 3!) Evasion, energy shield and amour. Evasion determines how likely you are to dodge an attack, Amour determines how much of the damage is block and energy shield reminds me a lot of the ""overshield"" from Halo or Mass Effect. It exists and if attacked, the energy shield is drained rather than your health. When the energy shield is depleted, you will have no defences other than your amour and evasion skills. The energy shield will restore after a period of not being attacked. However, your health will regenerate very slowly regardless of which items you wear. Each of the traits the amour has (Evasion, Amour and Energy shield) Link up to the traits the class has (Dexterity for Evasion, Amour for strength and Energy shield for intelligence) This is not a set rule but most items will have a requirement to meet.Are you still following me? If you're not, it's okay. Even If I confused you, you’re probably noticing how in-depth this game is.Finally, slots of amour have different coloured gem slots. There are three different coloured gems (So many ♥♥♥♥ING THREES!) And 3 different coloured gems (AHHHHHHH) which all link up to the 3 traits of the classes (I think I'm developing a ""3"" fetish) The red gems are usually for Melee combat, the green ones are for archery and the blue ones for magic. Some monsters resist certain types of these abilities, some resist fire, frost or lightning. Some monsters also can summon smaller units, perform similar abilities to what the player can perform and some monsters have energy shields.Okay, I'm done. Thanks for reading if you made it this far. Click the like button if you did. I swear, it took ages to write this out and last review I did, not a single person liked it :(. I strongly recommend this game for all people who love a good MMO RPG. I would love to have one of my close friend (Jacob, Brodie, Dom, Josh, Lachlan, Sam, I'm looking at you guys.) to pick up this game so that I wouldn't have to continue this crazily confusing experience alone. All in all, because it's a free game I'm giving it an 8.5/10			"

												Diablo fans rejoice!  Path of Exile is without a doubt the prodigal successor to a franchise that's getting harder to innovate and draw people in every year.  PoE just nails it, all of it!  From the gothic art style and the mood defining music to the near endless list of innovations that make this game so great and really set it apart in an extremely positive way from any other action RPG.  If you haven't gotten yourself lost in Wraeclast, do yourself a favor and install this game immediately.Some of the highlights with this game     - Nearly limitless amount of itemization     - Really unique mana/health replenishment system (Flasks that refill and have special properties)     - Huge amount of skill combinations involving gems that can be linked in nearly limitless ways     - A passive skill tree that has millions (yes millions!) of different useful and interesting combos     - Huge community that is backed by a passionate developer team that even today continues to support and improve gameplay     - Excellent endgame that is still being developed (maps, hideouts, etc.)     - 6 player co-op     - Leagues and race events that can earn you prizes     - hundreds and hundred of useful uniques that change the way you play in a variety of ways...and the list goes on!

												Think of the elements that made Diablo II great, meddle it with Torchlight and add some new stuff: the result is Path of Exile, a game that is far too good to be a free to play game. You don't even need to play anything to become superior to the other players: the microtransactions are moslty cosmetics. There are paid games out there that don't have 10% of PoE's quality. Everything in this game is perfect; only the story is a little confusing and uninspiring, but the lore is pleasant. From the reliable community to the constant patches, this is a very friendly game, both for you and for your low-end PC. Without prolonging this review a lot more, let me just say that it took me about 20 hours to do a single playthough, which is a lot more than some AAA titles present. If you like ARPG, or just RPG, or even just a action game, there is no excuse for not to, at least, try this wonderful game. I give it a 92 out of 100. Best free to play game of 2013 and probably one of the best free to play games out there.			"

												Path Of Exile is the deepest aRPG slasher for me ever made.It features some mechanics that are totally new to this genre.Additionally Path of Exile is a game FREE of charge.No pay to win. Grind to win! The game is polished, every major patch introduces bunch of new thing that make you connected to Wreaclast even more.Developers are constantly tweaking the mechanics, skill tree* and skills, trying to balance the game. To sum everything up:Dedication for Grinding Gear is the thing they live for.P.S.The size of the passive skill tree is a guarantee jaw drop if seen for the first time			"

												Path of Exile is a truly free to play dungeon crawler that will make someone watching a video clip think it is from the ""Diablo"" series. It isn't Diablo but it is in my opinion a better game than the Diablo series. There are six playable characters at the start and once the game has been beaten once and a side mission at the end of the game (that is along the required walking path but is optional) unlocks the seventh class.All skills are based on gems that are tied to either Intelligence (Blue), Strength (Red), or Dexterity (Green). While gems of a certain color do highly favor one syle of gameplay (red = melee attacks most of the time) their are exceptions such as a red gem unlocking a ""Totem"", basically a distraction device skill. Items have sockets to place the gems in. While you can use more than 8 skills, the UI sets up the bindable skill keys to Mouse Left Click, Mouse Middle Click, Mouse Right Click, Q, W, E, R, T keys. So when playing 8 skills are generally available with Mouse Left Click usually being bound to a hybrid of basic weapon melee attack and movement. Gems level up from the same experience your character gains. The gems just level up at different rates from your character class. The gems also have the same type of restrictions that items do such as minimum level and minimum stats (intelligence, strength, and dexterity) in order to equip them. This means that you could play as a Witch (Pure intelligence character build) and socket a red gem for a skill you'll never use. The gem will gain levels but it would be a better choice to stash the red gem for another character to use.Gems/skills are modified by the extensive passive leveling system. Each level up and some quests give points to follow along the giant path available to you. The leveling ""board"" for lack of a better term is the same for all characters but different characters start at different places on the board. Here is a link for the seventh class, the Scion, who starts in the very middle of the board. https://poebuilder.com/character/AAAAAgAA The most interesting part of this game is that it does not have gold as a currency. There are something like 40 different currency items but they are acquired by trading in equipment. So everything you sell will come back as a currency that benefits in game as well as allowing trading with other players to be a lot more varied. Static prices don't really exist and almost all items that can be bought from NPCs are there for a specific reason.This leads to the one flaw in the game, inventory management. Trading with NPC vendors requires knowing some ""recipes"", certain combinations of items that give back the best payment. You start the game with 4 pages in your cross-character ""stash"" and the same inventory size for every character. There is no increasing character inventory size. You can increase your stash size but that does cost real life money. A 4 page stash means making stockpiles to fulfill recipe requirements and frequently selling. With more tabs a user could get better returns on their equipment. I'd like more stash pages but the game doesn't require having 4 to be a good player. It just severally restricts how many items you can horde. Hording wouldn't be a problem if there was any type of inventory sorting but there is not. Unfortunately at latter game interverals art assets get reused so it can be difficult to tell between the low level item you want to trade versus the high level item you've been saving. In conclusion, I recommend the game. Just be sure to learn the economic system of the game before you start playing it.			"

But the more you play this the more you will understand how everything works!But if you plan to play with your friend, this would mean that monsters HP grows making it harder and more challenging to do with your friends, but also much more fun!Lastly the only disadvantage that i have for this game is the map, the map dosent seem that big, but because i completed all ""ACT's"" then i had to start over in ""Corrupt"" world. Corrupt is the same map you play on the normal difficulty, but corrupt is much more harder than normal, and the loot is much more better than in normal world.			"

												Perfect fit for diablo fans, loot ♥♥♥♥♥s and arpg lovers in general. try not to be picky about graphics and animations, since they can't compete with blizzards gigant diablo 3, but this game can offer something what diablo 3 doesn't have - tons of  customization and depth (skill gem  and support gem synergys, item customization in general by improving  quality or increasing rarity, socketing, linking sockets and changing socket colors to increase potential of your build specific skills, not even metion different type of leagues, massive skill tree and fun race events). Basically it has everything what arpg game needs to be fun.  Also game gets fairly challenging later on and if thats not enough then you can go full hardcore and burst in to tears when your high level character dies..forever.			"

												This game has led to alot of moments for me, alot of them being hilarious, whether that was me being a noob or not in the situation is a different story.  I still love playing this game for the fact that there is still a ton of stuff I have yet to try.  Some of my freinds have asked me advice and to be quite honest, even with 1000+ hours, I still feel like a major noob.  The biggest thing I mention is, try out the silliest thing you can think of, getting rid of tradtional thoughts about character steriotypes is important I feel.  I also love how with 1000 hours, the crafting system atleast for me has been always a touch out of my reach, for the challange leagues I mean.  Would deffinetly reccomend to arpg fans.			"

												12/15/2013 - This is a great action RPG that I consider to be on the same level as genre epics like Diablo, Torchlight, and Titan Quest in regards to gameplay, fun, design, and visuals.  I'm sure you'll find the same praise in most of the Steam and online reviews.  However, I cannot wholly recommend the game because of the continuous problems with lag or as the community often refers to it:  desync.  No, it's not a problem with my computer or connection.  It's widespread and encountered often.  I've lost 2 hardcore characters to desync; it's not fun when all the time you invested into your character is thrown away due to lag.  The problem is that everything has to run online through their server (no offline play), and due to how well they developed the game, there are too many people playing on the server resources currently in place.  If they made it so that you could play a character offline or seriously revamped the network code and server resources, this would be a perfect game.  In its current state, as good as the game is, I find it too frustrating to consistently enjoy.  The devs are very good about listening to the community and improving/updating the game, so hopefully it's only a matter of time before the desync issues are fixed.			"

To change my email address I had to first provide them with...- The account name, date, time and location the account was created- The IP address you created the account from, or if this is not possible, the IP address you last played from... odd requests to begin with for an email address change.  I was actually able to provide these things...Follow-up- Can you please let us know whether you have made any purchases on the account from the online store.I have not...Follow-up- Could you please create a throwaway account (preferably using another email address), create a character on it and start the first level, then provide us with the account name or email address that you used?- Could you also please send us your client.txt file? It can be found under the Path of Exile\logs directory, and you may have to .zip it as it can be quite large.I could not perform this request without downloading a non-steam version.  Continuing to play this game was not worth this effort to me.  I believe they were starting to send me on a run around as I have not purchased anything from them.--- As for the game in GeneralPros:The game was generally fun.The talent tree is huge, and allows for super customization, which may actually be a con for any casual player.  Cons:The graphics are not great by any means.  You cant tab out and back in while in fullscreen mode without the game crashing, as far as I know that has been an issue for years.  Here is a thread from 2013...https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/654101You can eventually reach a Hard stop where you character cannot progress any further.  This does not seem to be as much of an issue in rival games like Diablo 3 or Torchlight 2.  In addition to this, there is no good respec option if you surpass a certain level.  You can only back out one point at a time with a rather rare item drop.			"

												I wish there was an option between ""recommended"" and ""not recommended"" because that's the choice I would pick. After weighing all the pros and cons I have to ""not recommend"" this game in the end. Anyway, let's get into some details.ARPGs are something I love to spend countless hours in. I love the grind and getting those sweet loot drops and then repeating this process over and over again until every slot is GG/BiS gear. I love trying different builds and min/maxing my stats as much as possible. All of this is possible in PoE. In fact, PoE is one of the most hardcore ARPGs out there. Many people have compared it favorably to D2. The build diversity in this game is absolutely insane due to the passive tree and skill gems, along with how these skill gems interact with each other by linking them in armor and weapons. If you want depth you absolutely will find it in this game - in fact at first I was quite overwhelmed. For example, when discussing ""crits"" in this game you need to keep in mind the difference between local critical chance on weapon attacks, critical chance on spells, global critical chance, and critical damage multipliers (which I guess can be both local and global and can either be on attacks and/or spells). It is not like D3 in which critical chance is a flat additive percentage for everything. Anyway, this is only one example. The game is very nuanced and Google is your best friend if you don't understand something.So yeah, I love all the depth in the game, so why am I not recommending this? Simple. The endgame trading is absolutely horrendous. I reached the beginning of endgame (level 70) and I should just grind low level maps or areas like merciless Dried Lake for loot and currency. Well...that doesn't really work. In order to get the best items for your build you NEED to trade. But since there's no gold in the game it's difficult to judge whether an item is worth 1 Chaos or 2 Chaos or whatever other currency. This is especially true for new players like me who want to get started in trading but the entire buisness is already monopolized by the streamers and other ""pro players"". The loot drops are terrible - the chance of finding a rare or unique that's worth a few Chaos or Exalted is extremely low. Maybe if you do a pure MF build it'll be better, but my point is, I just want to use my build and farm enemies and find good endgame gear. There would be no point in build diversity if you have to use a MF build just to have a chance of finding some BiS stuff.So here I am, at endgame with a few Chaos orbs and zero Exalted. I want to buy some items by using poe.trade (community trade site) but most people are not online and/or they are fake accounts. Using trade chat is a joke - just full of spammers and people trying to lowball you for profit. And how am I suppose to sell anything? Use poe.trade? Set up a shop on the forums? Very tedious and troublesome because not only do I have to jump through hoops to do it, there's no gurantee anyone will buy my stuff or offer fair prices. I want to play an ARPG not ""trade simulator extreme edition"".tl;dr - The biggest turn off for me is the endgame trading. It's absolutely garbage and DAS (dumb as♥♥♥♥♥♥. The rest of the game is quite good and I did enjoy it. But we all know for games like this the endgame will either make or break the game. I hope the developers will add in a streamlined in-game trading system in the near future, but until then, I will not be coming back.			"

												This game used to be fun. It used to be my favorite game and I never thought I would write a negative review for this game. Too many of the changes they made in 2.0 basically just made the game impossible to enjoy anymore. They gutted life leech, player defenses, then gave INSANE boosts to monster damage. A build I used to play and rarely ever die on I can barely take 5 steps into a map without dying or coming very close. Then the map system change, yeah ♥♥♥♥ you GGG. They do not want you to play endgame maps. RNG gated endgame layered under multiple RNG gates IS NOT FUN. FFS I just want to enjoy the game not punch my monitor every time I launch it because GGG wants to make this the hardest game ever.Bravo GGG, you are quickly becoming the next Blizzturd, hope you enjoy the few hundred dollars I spent on this game because you are not ever going to see another dime out of me again. ♥♥♥♥ you guys.

												skills are interesting. tree is nice-ish. i find end game is very unbalanced.  put hours in to get good gear with really disapointing results.Edit: i simply dont recommend this game its not that its a bad or aweful game that should be avoided i do play from time to time, not sure how to explain it. I'm not one to ramble and complain look at my time played, i did all end game content as it was released, i've done several seasons, races and played standard off and on while boredunique items at this point are so disapointing very few are worth using some are being changed, theres not uniques that make skills stand out they are more generic which seems like a good idea but most skills dont compare to what would be ""tier 1 skills"" *ramble*ramble* thats not to say all builds cant be used up to a certain point, like low - mid tier maping. or your meta pathfinder + vinktars(that should have been nerfed long ago) can with proper gear let you simply out leech end-game hits with the skills people dont userun and repeat maps over and over.maybe the 3.0 update will be a game changer.

												This game is fantastic! It reminds a lot the gameplay of Diablo franchise, being a classic point & click action-RPG. If you're a fan of Diablo, you should definitely play it.As a low point of the game, the history is not as enganging as Diablo was. I still remember the first time I played it, the felling of going down to Hell to kill Diablo itself kept me going on. Do not expect something that remarkable on Path of Exile.The are some innovation on this game. The first is the fact that your potions replenish as you kill enemies. This saves you to keep returning to town to buy extra health/mana potions and make the game more dynamic. Also, you don't have money/gold in this game. The game currency are the items that you use to improve your weaponry/armory (as orbs or scrolls of identify). So, you need to decide between using the items to buy new weapons/armors or to improve the ones you already have.In conclusion, this game is a must play for fans of hack and slash action-RPG, like myself. But being a free-to-play game, I recommend everybody to give it a try. I'm sure you're going to enjoy it.			"

												This is the first game that satisfies all of my cravings to replay Diablo II. Do not let its Free to Play status scare you away. This feels like a full game right from the first second of gameplay and does not hide a single feature, item, or area behind a pay wall. I haven't looked through all of the games microtransaction options yet (which so far seem to be all cosmetic) because I have been too busy crushing hordes of enemies and customizing my character. It combines the itemization of Diablo II with the Materia system of Final Fantasy VII and the Sphere Grid of Final Fantasy X.If you liked Diablo II or were disappointed by the mess that was Diablo III, I absolutely cannot recommend checking out this game enough.

												So i see it's not enough for a review to say the game is good, when it clearly is. But i will ellaborate my thought.So this game is my day to day grinding simulator for when i just wanna chill and listen to some sweet music. Since i'm not a big fan of diablo 3 and diablo has kinda outlived it's era and passed on, to the forgotten but not forgotens hall of fame.I'm not comparing this game to diablo in anyway, and thats why i think it's good, it is another game.It has a lot of interesting very well made lore, tons of spells attacks and different ways to defend yourself, using all kinds of gems, that can freely be socket in and out of it's colour matched socket in your armor or weapon.The game has a certain difficulty, it's not a beginner frendly game in itself, it has a good introduction to wreaclast. But it's the community that makes that part great, theres tons of guides and videos on how to play the game, i myself have watched the streamer and youtuber ziggyD to get a feeling for patches and new items.the above have been almost only positive. But Path of exile have some downsides, and not just two but a bunch.A few big to mention are:the constant unsteadyness in the server. You will never know when the server suddenly decides to spike out, and there have been period where the lag have been almost character destroying ;) But it seems to have gotten alot better.It's repetetive, like there are 4 acts with different areas and a tons of different maps. But it all boil down to running from one end to another killing all in your way with a little sidequesting and master missions.The rng, if you arn't used to not get your way or just have really bad luck and can't take it when you lose, then this game is probably not for you, since it's system, thought it is possible to find out what areas to grind for certain items, it's 50% chance, a big part of the game is skill based , but if don't get the items you need your not gonna get far and almost everytime, give up on the character to start a new and see if that goes better or if some better items will drop. ofcourse on counter to that, there is a market for trading, so if you got coin community got ware.7/10for being the best grinding game for listing to music :D Love			"

												You probably thought this would be another pros and cons review. Well, you were right, but first, let me tell you some general things and I'll end with my opinion at the end of the review.PoE is a hack and slash ARPG that has an incredible amount of depth. It has so much depth that it was the main reason for me to switch from Diablo 3 to PoE. Apart from the many, many uniques there is a huge passive tree, so extensive that it gives you nearly endless possibilites to customise and direct your character build. It is responsive in terms of casting abilites, skills, attacking, moving, etc, much like Diablo 3. The graphics are great in my opinion, the game uses less bright colors compared to diablo 3 and is less prone to giving you epileptic seizures.Let's first get rid of the cons:-inconcsistent FPS --> really demanding game in terms of requirements, it will run smoothly and then some cluster♥♥♥♥ of spells and abilities will produce an fps drop (maybe it's just me though, but I think I have a pretty good pc)-server crashes sometimes appear, altough it's not that often to really undermine the game. It's rare but it's there-if you are playing on an EU server it is possible to enter groups with NA players (for example) that will switch you to their server and consequently increase your ping to ~500ms-the start of the game is really slow, meaning that you will not have that start as in Diablo 3 for example where you start hacking and slashing furiously at lvl1, PoE requires higher attack speed/cast speed to achieve that level of speed/responsivnes. Meaning you will have the fast game in the late game.-it's a grinding gameNow for the pros:-free to play (not pay to win, don't worry, all microtransactions are merely cosmetic apart from the stash extentions)-huge depth: a really high number of different builds that are all viable in some way and customisation of everything (from your gear and hideouts to the maps that you will be tackling on in late game)-responsivnes-a massive amount of late game content-races where you can earn unique rewards-fun leagues with unique rules that last for 3 months each: new economy, fresh start and rewards-permanent leagues-it's hard as ♥♥♥♥ to reach lvl100-it's a grinding gameAll in all I recommend this game. Why? Because you have stuff to do. Yes it's grindy but at least you have the satisfactory soul fulfiling skills/abillities that destroy enemies to your hearts content in many more ways than one. My point is you will never get bored because you can always make a unique build that you will enjoy. A build tailored for you, by you, not by external sites. My only recommendation is that you plan and learn in advance. Well, those are my main reasons why I switched to this game. It's excellent, really, and I would recommend you try it, after all, it's free to play. I'd rate this game 9/10.			"

												Path of Exile is a hack and slash game with one of the most unique customization system. Active skills are not required by leveling up, but as items dropped by enemies and acquired from completing quests that need to be put into an equipment socket to work. Different classes also share the same passive skill tree which means you can build your character however you like it-sorcerer barbarian and melee wizard? sure why not? (corresponding classes in the game are actually not called barbarian and wizard but you know what I mean)These unique settings truly makes combatting and looting really fun. As a F2P title Path of Exile is simply huge with its solid gameplay, great graphics (comparable to D3) and unique system. Anyone interested in hack and slash or rpg in general should check it out.

												In my opinion, Path of Exile is the best action RPG ever made, and the best FTP game, and most certainly the best game ever made in New Zealand.If you know NZ, it's a pretty small place, and not a place where you'd think an epic game could be made. I knew one of the lead devs before this game was created. When I heard he was trying to make a game similar to Diablo II, I was shocked at the idea of it. I didn't think it would be possible to make an indy game in New Zealand that could possibly rival the king of action RPGs. Well ... the king was dethroned, long live the new king of action RPGs! PoE is simply an awesomely epic game that I will no doubt be playing for many years.I have been playing since closed beta and I love how PoE keeps getting more great content. The community is active and the devs pay attention to feedback. I say that having witnessed it many times after feedback was given during beta.I was a big Diablo fan and a massive Diablo II fan. After Diablo II, there was  a void left in my gaming life, until PoE came along that is.The creators of this game are gamers too, and took the best parts of some games, added a cool story, and meshed it all into this amazing game. They did some things that are really unique, and a massive change from most aRPGs. For example, there is no gold! Instead, scrolls and orbs are the currency that PoE uses. It makes sense, too; what use is gold to an exile who is fighting for their life?The modest system requirements and the fact that this game is Free to Play lets almost anyone play the game. There are no ""Pay to Win"" options, which keeps everyone on a level playing field. Many of the options available for purchase are cosmetic options, like the ability to make your favourite gear look different. Other options allow you to purchase more tabs in your shared stash, more for your guild, and similar things. The only in-game benefits you will get is the ability to store more items, or sometimes more light radius that can help out a little when you're in a dark place.This game works well with both multiplayer and single player. It's a hard game, but very rewarding. The skill tree is simply massive, and can be overwhelming at first. But the skill tree is what makes so many interesting builds possible.The atmosphere of this game is amazing. The graphics are beautiful, the soundtrack is great, and the extra sounds were very well done. The first time I heard the screams in one particular area, I got chills up and down my spine. If you liked other action RPGs, you will most likely love PoE. Give it a go, there's nothing to lose other than a bit of your time and a few gigs to download.			"

												'loot-based' at its core.... all this game is about is loot. Loot... Sweet... precious... looot!  Having ups and downs as it fares.  Ups being, i was not having this much fun identifying stull I loot since Ultima Online.  No matter what item you pick, it can be utter crap or godly priceless piece of equip.  Downs obviously is, RNG is our god.  With thousands of combinations of properties of items, you are on the wrong side of chance drops will be what you need.  Or what you can sell :).  Crafting is another notable area, here the currency, orbs, is what you use for crafting too.  With few exceptions, crafting is same RNG (maybe even less forgiving one than the loot drop RNG).  That means, not everybody has same purple stuff on him/her, not everyone wants same purple stuff, and everyone must think carefully, whether to use currency for crafing, or actual buying from other players.Last interesting area is build variability.  Not going into details, skill tree is HUGE (read in font 24, bold and red).  Your creativity will get some food for thought here... Just be aware: inefficient builds are no exception and quite punishing end game.   Considering my playtime, I guess the number alone gives 10/10 :).			"

												Diablo 2 + FF7 Materia system.Solid ARPG with a very fun early game full of experimentation and discovery, and a brilliant end game with great features. A lot of the space between can REALLY REALLY suck though, as you bottleneck your build at the gear level, needing very specific number, color, and connection schemes of slots, and needing those setups on items with decent stats as well.Highly recommended for the most hardcore, and the most casual. Normal players may find themselves bored and leaving in the mid game, or playing a large number of characters and fighting with stash space.			"

												After 2,000 hours of playing this game, I still can't get enough. GGG has to be one of the best, if not the best game developers out there. They've done such a great job with this game. If you like grinding games for better loot, this is for you. If you're new to this genre, you're gonna have to take some time to fully understand the concepts of the game. It's definitely a lot to take in as a new player, but once you've figured it out it becomes so addicting. There's new leagaues implemeneted every 3-4 months, which allows for fresh economies/new aspects to the game. It's my favorite part. The devs are constantly updating/rebalancing the passive tree (which is freaking amazing), so you shouldn't get to in love with any given play style/skill/build. If you're new, definitely follow some of the big streamers so you can stay up to date on decent builds to use for new leagues. There's tons more I can say, but I'll leave it here. Download poe, and have fun grinding!			"

												Now Path of Exile is a game that I have followed since it's early closed beta days and I've played since then too. This is one of the best Hack 'n Slash Action RPG games that you will find this year and what's more it is entirely free to play (yes a real free to play the only thing you pay real money for are cosmetics like extra gore, different skin on items so that you look a little unique, pets that do nothing but follow you or more warehouse slots etc). The gameplay it self is pretty much Diablo 2 style. One amazing thing about the game to note is the skill tree and the way you can develop it... the possibilities are endless! Basically the skill tree is just passive skills while the spells and similar that you use to fight are ""gems"" which you have to embed in your weapons/armors, what's more is that there are no class bound items so basically you can make a Ranger use staffs and use magic, a Marauder use bow and a Witch use a giant sword and that's not all, every single class has the same skill tree with the class being just the way you character looks and the starting possition in the skill tree. The skills in this game are amazing. To use a skill you have to find a gem with that skill, meet the level and stat requerments and put it inside a gem slow in your weapon/armor. Each weapon/armor can have up to 4/6 slots with 3 different color and skill gems also have 3 different color types (based on Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence) and those slots on the weapon can be linked together so you can merge 2 or 3 different skills effects (using support gems with normal skills gems) to add new type of effects to your skills and make them even stronger.The crafting and currency systems in the game are really unique and awesome the normal currency used in other games like gold for example is totally removed and everything revolves around trading items and the currency items are the same as upgrade items (adding new options to you armor/weapons, socketing, changing their type from normal, magic, rare ..etc)PoE is definitely my favorite Hack 'n Slash game together with the classic Diablo 2. It's a must try game for RPG fans and I would recomend it to all of you ;).			"

												Completely surprised by how much more fun Path of Exile is than Diablo III.  I completely agree with those who call this ""what Diablo III should have been"", it's a fun modern take on the Diablo motif with some interesting iterations on class and skill development.  Seriously, if you liked Diablo II, give PoE a shot.  It costs absolutely nothing to do so and you'll want to give the developers some money afterwards.			"

												This is a game with some great ideas: the skill system is deep, many of the unique items are genuinely interesting and build-enabling, and the commodity currency system is an awesome feature in theory.  Unfortunately, high-variance RNG mechanics screw everything up in the endgame.  Item hunting, crafting, and even maintaining access to high end content are all punishing tasks without being skill-based, and at a certain point you'll have to ask yourself, ""Why am I doing this?""  I'd recommend playing until you hit that point, lamenting what could have been, and moving on.			"

												I read about this game in a review about Torchlight 2, and I highly agree with that reviewer who said, why play any other game that's like Diablo 2, when there is this game Path of Exile. I only played a very short time, but my first impression of the game was that it was like Diablo 3, maybe just not as fluent movement and graphics aren't as touched up. But for a free game it's 100% worth the download time/space. There are microtransactions in the game, but it doesn't make you feel like you need them to enjoy or compete in this game. This game is free when I would have payed money for it, and that's a huge draw. A FREE GAME, with a massive levelling system, pretty good graphics, large world, multiple ways to play (coop, pvp etc..) even the subtlety to detail... after I killed a zombie with my bow, his leg came off, had an arrow stuck in it and was twitching for a bit. Big thumbs up to Grinding Gear Games.			"

												Hands down, one of the best ARPG titles I've ever had the pleasure to play.  And I didn't have to pay a dime.  Didn't stop me from doing so, as the cosmetics are awesome, and often times come down in price during big holidays and season based sales.The game itself features one of the more robust skill creation systems I have ever had the pleasure of playing with, and likely is no where near done making new ways to let players battle foes.  The gear is solid, and the grind isn't too bad up to what is considered the end game.  There is always a stronger fight waiting for you around the corner as well.The music, I HAVE to talk about the music.  Some of the best stuff out there right now, with boss fights being wonderful, and several areas having the grim, dark, and creepy music you would expect from a game such as this.  But even the more sacred tracks, such as the crypt, aka Church Dungeon, sees love, even though its a side area, and man, I could sit there for hours listening.			"

												I bought and played Diablo 3 but I really wanted Path Of Exile.Skill gems and the shared passive skill LANDSCAPE (not tree) make character builds and gearing a more involved and personal experience, making the game replayable in a way that truly matters--not that the truly randomly-generated levels and endgame Maps don't keep you on your toes even when you're at full power.Playing as a newbie can be intimidating, but there's a joy to be had in doing your own research and owning your builds. Don't pay attention to the hardcore players; if you're looking for a good, rough dungeon romp as you make the best of your gear, this game delivers in spades.EDIT: I've spent 40 hours on POE in just two weeks.

I HIGHLY reccomend this game to anyone willing to give the time and effort to level a character, and/or play with friends who can also get this.

												You probably thought this would be another pros and cons review. Well, you were right, but first, let me tell you some general things and I'll end with my opinion at the end of the review.PoE is a hack and slash ARPG that has an incredible amount of depth. It has so much depth that it was the main reason for me to switch from Diablo 3 to PoE. Apart from the many, many uniques there is a huge passive tree, so extensive that it gives you nearly endless possibilites to customise and direct your character build. It is responsive in terms of casting abilites, skills, attacking, moving, etc, much like Diablo 3. The graphics are great in my opinion, the game uses less bright colors compared to diablo 3 and is less prone to giving you epileptic seizures.Let's first get rid of the cons:-inconcsistent FPS --> really demanding game in terms of requirements, it will run smoothly and then some cluster♥♥♥♥ of spells and abilities will produce an fps drop (maybe it's just me though, but I think I have a pretty good pc)-server crashes sometimes appear, altough it's not that often to really undermine the game. It's rare but it's there-if you are playing on an EU server it is possible to enter groups with NA players (for example) that will switch you to their server and consequently increase your ping to ~500ms-the start of the game is really slow, meaning that you will not have that start as in Diablo 3 for example where you start hacking and slashing furiously at lvl1, PoE requires higher attack speed/cast speed to achieve that level of speed/responsivnes. Meaning you will have the fast game in the late game.-it's a grinding gameNow for the pros:-free to play (not pay to win, don't worry, all microtransactions are merely cosmetic apart from the stash extentions)-huge depth: a really high number of different builds that are all viable in some way and customisation of everything (from your gear and hideouts to the maps that you will be tackling on in late game)-responsivnes-a massive amount of late game content-races where you can earn unique rewards-fun leagues with unique rules that last for 3 months each: new economy, fresh start and rewards-permanent leagues-it's hard as ♥♥♥♥ to reach lvl100-it's a grinding gameAll in all I recommend this game. Why? Because you have stuff to do. Yes it's grindy but at least you have the satisfactory soul fulfiling skills/abillities that destroy enemies to your hearts content in many more ways than one. My point is you will never get bored because you can always make a unique build that you will enjoy. A build tailored for you, by you, not by external sites. My only recommendation is that you plan and learn in advance. Well, those are my main reasons why I switched to this game. It's excellent, really, and I would recommend you try it, after all, it's free to play. I'd rate this game 9/10.			"

												So i see it's not enough for a review to say the game is good, when it clearly is. But i will ellaborate my thought.So this game is my day to day grinding simulator for when i just wanna chill and listen to some sweet music. Since i'm not a big fan of diablo 3 and diablo has kinda outlived it's era and passed on, to the forgotten but not forgotens hall of fame.I'm not comparing this game to diablo in anyway, and thats why i think it's good, it is another game.It has a lot of interesting very well made lore, tons of spells attacks and different ways to defend yourself, using all kinds of gems, that can freely be socket in and out of it's colour matched socket in your armor or weapon.The game has a certain difficulty, it's not a beginner frendly game in itself, it has a good introduction to wreaclast. But it's the community that makes that part great, theres tons of guides and videos on how to play the game, i myself have watched the streamer and youtuber ziggyD to get a feeling for patches and new items.the above have been almost only positive. But Path of exile have some downsides, and not just two but a bunch.A few big to mention are:the constant unsteadyness in the server. You will never know when the server suddenly decides to spike out, and there have been period where the lag have been almost character destroying ;) But it seems to have gotten alot better.It's repetetive, like there are 4 acts with different areas and a tons of different maps. But it all boil down to running from one end to another killing all in your way with a little sidequesting and master missions.The rng, if you arn't used to not get your way or just have really bad luck and can't take it when you lose, then this game is probably not for you, since it's system, thought it is possible to find out what areas to grind for certain items, it's 50% chance, a big part of the game is skill based , but if don't get the items you need your not gonna get far and almost everytime, give up on the character to start a new and see if that goes better or if some better items will drop. ofcourse on counter to that, there is a market for trading, so if you got coin community got ware.7/10for being the best grinding game for listing to music :D Love			"

												Poor man's (free to play) Diablo. The gem/skill system is interesting, which is reminicent of Final Fantasy 7's materia system. The graphics are decent enough and there's plenty of loot to be had and depth in combining skills by linking slots together (ala support materia in FF7). However...The always-online aspect of this game is not so great, though. Rubberbanding is fairly consistent, even with a low ping. The game itself is the gatekeeper for your fun, dictating how viable you are by not only gear drops, but what skills you have access to. The time-sink basis of the game is a bit of a turn off. Expect to carefully plan a character and have it nerfed to bejesus, thereby ending your character as many have been so vocal about online, since resetting a character's skills is basically impossible. The currency system favors NPCs at every level, and the loot system is a free-for-all grabfest, so play with people you trust.If you play this game, play with a group. Play with friends. Solo I can imagine is a nightmare considering how tempermental drops can be, but crushing things in a group and splitting loot means there's fun times for those seeking them.			"

												Path of Exile is a hack and slash game with one of the most unique customization system. Active skills are not required by leveling up, but as items dropped by enemies and acquired from completing quests that need to be put into an equipment socket to work. Different classes also share the same passive skill tree which means you can build your character however you like it-sorcerer barbarian and melee wizard? sure why not? (corresponding classes in the game are actually not called barbarian and wizard but you know what I mean)These unique settings truly makes combatting and looting really fun. As a F2P title Path of Exile is simply huge with its solid gameplay, great graphics (comparable to D3) and unique system. Anyone interested in hack and slash or rpg in general should check it out.

												Long story short, this is one of the most engaging games I've played in many years. Path of Exile is a nearly perfect blend of intelligent complexity and mass destruction. It's probably not so intricate that a disinterested player wouldn't be able to find enjoyment, but it's certainly geared toward those who are inclined to plan, research, experiment, and occasionally fail in order to really flesh out their experience with the game.And, as you've probably noticed, Path of Exile is completely free with no strings attached; the download is free, there's no subscription, expansions and patches are free (and frequent), and will remain so until the Earth burns up in a few billion years. The only things you can possibly buy with real money are almost exclusively cosmetic features, such as different visual effects for certain spells, visual affects for your character/gear, passive pets, etc. The only two non-cosmetic exceptions I can think of are increased and customizeable storage space in your ""stash"" that's shared between characters (you start with four pages in the stash, which is not at all restrictive), and extra character slots (I don't even know how many character slots you start with, but I think I have eight characters and haven't yet seen the cap). If there were ever a situation where you get to ""vote with your money,"" it's this. Ever bought a game and been disappointed but you already spent your cash? Ever wish you could have just played for hours on end without paying a dime just to see if the game is worth your time? This is part of what I love about Grinding Gear Games and their Path of Exile. Now that I've played a significant portion of the game I'm completely in love, and I'm fully justified in paying for some of the cosmetic features just so that I can help support the game and the dev team. I actually WANT to hand them my money at this point. And the best part is that I can pay however much I want, anything from $5 on up in exchange for microtransaction currency/coins, and even still get something extra for that money, like a mohawk made of spiked daggers or a crazy new look for my primary spell. Play for free, completely, forever, and if you do ever decide to give them some money you'll still be getting bonus stuff for a game you already love. It's simply amazing.The passive skill tree can be a little daunting even after a serious investment in the game, but it also becomes rather intuitive and you just get a sense for how to operate within it. Grinding Gear Games' Path of Exile website has the complete interactive skill tree on it so that you can play around and experiment without having to risk your character to do so, though you will have to (really easily) copy-paste the link to a seperate website to get a list of how it all translates in terms of your hp, increased damage, resistances, and so on.To describe the systems far more simply, and probably more boringly, than they deserve, Path of Exile essentially works like so, from my perspective. 1) Pick a class.Classes only differ in terms of their appearances, their starting stats, and where within the web of the passive skill tree they start, but not in terms of what abilities they can acquire or what parts of the skill tree they can reach.2) Work the Skill Tree.This passive skill tree seems to be a pretty significant divergence from your standard fare where one would usually expect to be able to specialize by putting points into certain abilities; instead, as you level up you put your points into qualities and abilities that work in the background of your character. Most of these passives are individually fairly mundane, but many of them can single-handedly change the way your character will function.3) Use your skills.Your abilities come in the form of specialty items that you can acquire through quests, random drops, or player trades, just like your equipment, and there are tons of them. Further, these ability items (gems) get placed on your armor essentially in sequences of your choosing such that they can have their effects altered.4) Horde, and use, your currency.There's no gold in this game, which also means you won't find any gold farmers. The items that get used as currency are all things that you can actually use in the game to do stuff, not just a medium for transactions like gold would be. Each currency item does something different; among others, some of the currencies (orbs) can be used to upgrade a common item to a rare item, reroll the stats on a rare item, change the socket colors or socket links on an item, improve item quality, and so forth. These currencies are random drops as well as acquired by selling your gear or trading other currency items to NPC vendors, as well as by trading with players.4) Rock your gear.The equipment is far more interesting than most any game I've played for two reasons. First, you can change any item in any way, though doing some of this can be quite difficult to achieve, such that you can take a perfectly common item and turn it into an amazing piece of equipment with your currency orbs; this significantly changes the standard ""farm until it drops"" scenario that these types of games usually run into. Second, the ability gems have specific colors and they go into the same color sockets on armor such that blue gems go into blue sockets, green into green, and red into red (there are only three color types); the number, color, and connections between the sockets can do everything from simply allowing you to use multiple skills to significantly changing the way one or many skills operate. Equipment also has all the normal stuff you'd expect in a game like this, like various defensive or offensive stat bonuses, the occasional skill bonus, or whatever else. And, again, you get to alter all of the elements of your items, like taking a common item that has the sockets you want and upgrading it from a common item to a rare item, then if you don't like the random stats on your new rare item you can reroll the stats, or change the colors and orientations of the sockets, and so on. You're never, ever just stuck with whatever equipment happens to be dropping for you. Putting these qualities together makes for the least boring gearing system I've seen.Now you roll all this stuff into one game and you get a really complex and compelling experience with a massive amount of customizability and replayability. Each aspect influences the others and there are absolutely no restricting ways to play your character. Spread yourself across the passive skill tree, then put abilities on your gear to compliment your spec; or find abilities you really want to use and then spec in the skill tree to augment or alter how they work. Define the type of character you're going to play ahead of time and restrict yourself to just those types of items, abilities, and passive skills; or flow through the game and define yourself as you go. There are definitely many specific paths that some people prefer, or some that are easier, or more defensive, or more offensive, pet based, supporting, etc., but you will find absolutely no shortage of wild and crazy speculative or even wildly divergent safe/noob-friendly specs on the forums or elsewhere online.But all of these intricacies mean that you'll get the most out of Path of Exile by spending some time researching, whether it's scouring the forums or just watching some YouTube vids of people playing and explaining their particular character build. The more you learn, the more the game opens up and starts to seem even more and more exciting. I've put over 100 hours in at this point and, no matter how much I think I know, I search for something I'm uncertain about and find a whole new aspect of the game that I hadn't even considered yet. I see myself playing Path of Exile far into the future, and will support the game and the dev team with my money by choice, at my own			"

												A little difficult to learn at first due to the new implementation of ""sockets"" and ""connecting sockets"".  However, much better than Diablo 3 in my opinion, game function and story are around the same, rubberbanding or desyncing whatever you want to call.  I enjoy the late game portion, due to its infinite possibilities.  It's like you can't beat this game unless you have no life lol.			"

												In my opinion, Path of Exile is the best action RPG ever made, and the best FTP game, and most certainly the best game ever made in New Zealand.If you know NZ, it's a pretty small place, and not a place where you'd think an epic game could be made. I knew one of the lead devs before this game was created. When I heard he was trying to make a game similar to Diablo II, I was shocked at the idea of it. I didn't think it would be possible to make an indy game in New Zealand that could possibly rival the king of action RPGs. Well ... the king was dethroned, long live the new king of action RPGs! PoE is simply an awesomely epic game that I will no doubt be playing for many years.I have been playing since closed beta and I love how PoE keeps getting more great content. The community is active and the devs pay attention to feedback. I say that having witnessed it many times after feedback was given during beta.I was a big Diablo fan and a massive Diablo II fan. After Diablo II, there was  a void left in my gaming life, until PoE came along that is.The creators of this game are gamers too, and took the best parts of some games, added a cool story, and meshed it all into this amazing game. They did some things that are really unique, and a massive change from most aRPGs. For example, there is no gold! Instead, scrolls and orbs are the currency that PoE uses. It makes sense, too; what use is gold to an exile who is fighting for their life?The modest system requirements and the fact that this game is Free to Play lets almost anyone play the game. There are no ""Pay to Win"" options, which keeps everyone on a level playing field. Many of the options available for purchase are cosmetic options, like the ability to make your favourite gear look different. Other options allow you to purchase more tabs in your shared stash, more for your guild, and similar things. The only in-game benefits you will get is the ability to store more items, or sometimes more light radius that can help out a little when you're in a dark place.This game works well with both multiplayer and single player. It's a hard game, but very rewarding. The skill tree is simply massive, and can be overwhelming at first. But the skill tree is what makes so many interesting builds possible.The atmosphere of this game is amazing. The graphics are beautiful, the soundtrack is great, and the extra sounds were very well done. The first time I heard the screams in one particular area, I got chills up and down my spine. If you liked other action RPGs, you will most likely love PoE. Give it a go, there's nothing to lose other than a bit of your time and a few gigs to download.			"

												Long story short, this is one of the most engaging games I've played in many years. Path of Exile is a nearly perfect blend of intelligent complexity and mass destruction. It's probably not so intricate that a disinterested player wouldn't be able to find enjoyment, but it's certainly geared toward those who are inclined to plan, research, experiment, and occasionally fail in order to really flesh out their experience with the game.And, as you've probably noticed, Path of Exile is completely free with no strings attached; the download is free, there's no subscription, expansions and patches are free (and frequent), and will remain so until the Earth burns up in a few billion years. The only things you can possibly buy with real money are almost exclusively cosmetic features, such as different visual effects for certain spells, visual affects for your character/gear, passive pets, etc. The only two non-cosmetic exceptions I can think of are increased and customizeable storage space in your ""stash"" that's shared between characters (you start with four pages in the stash, which is not at all restrictive), and extra character slots (I don't even know how many character slots you start with, but I think I have eight characters and haven't yet seen the cap). If there were ever a situation where you get to ""vote with your money,"" it's this. Ever bought a game and been disappointed but you already spent your cash? Ever wish you could have just played for hours on end without paying a dime just to see if the game is worth your time? This is part of what I love about Grinding Gear Games and their Path of Exile. Now that I've played a significant portion of the game I'm completely in love, and I'm fully justified in paying for some of the cosmetic features just so that I can help support the game and the dev team. I actually WANT to hand them my money at this point. And the best part is that I can pay however much I want, anything from $5 on up in exchange for microtransaction currency/coins, and even still get something extra for that money, like a mohawk made of spiked daggers or a crazy new look for my primary spell. Play for free, completely, forever, and if you do ever decide to give them some money you'll still be getting bonus stuff for a game you already love. It's simply amazing.The passive skill tree can be a little daunting even after a serious investment in the game, but it also becomes rather intuitive and you just get a sense for how to operate within it. Grinding Gear Games' Path of Exile website has the complete interactive skill tree on it so that you can play around and experiment without having to risk your character to do so, though you will have to (really easily) copy-paste the link to a seperate website to get a list of how it all translates in terms of your hp, increased damage, resistances, and so on.To describe the systems far more simply, and probably more boringly, than they deserve, Path of Exile essentially works like so, from my perspective. 1) Pick a class.Classes only differ in terms of their appearances, their starting stats, and where within the web of the passive skill tree they start, but not in terms of what abilities they can acquire or what parts of the skill tree they can reach.2) Work the Skill Tree.This passive skill tree seems to be a pretty significant divergence from your standard fare where one would usually expect to be able to specialize by putting points into certain abilities; instead, as you level up you put your points into qualities and abilities that work in the background of your character. Most of these passives are individually fairly mundane, but many of them can single-handedly change the way your character will function.3) Use your skills.Your abilities come in the form of specialty items that you can acquire through quests, random drops, or player trades, just like your equipment, and there are tons of them. Further, these ability items (gems) get placed on your armor essentially in sequences of your choosing such that they can have their effects altered.4) Horde, and use, your currency.There's no gold in this game, which also means you won't find any gold farmers. The items that get used as currency are all things that you can actually use in the game to do stuff, not just a medium for transactions like gold would be. Each currency item does something different; among others, some of the currencies (orbs) can be used to upgrade a common item to a rare item, reroll the stats on a rare item, change the socket colors or socket links on an item, improve item quality, and so forth. These currencies are random drops as well as acquired by selling your gear or trading other currency items to NPC vendors, as well as by trading with players.4) Rock your gear.The equipment is far more interesting than most any game I've played for two reasons. First, you can change any item in any way, though doing some of this can be quite difficult to achieve, such that you can take a perfectly common item and turn it into an amazing piece of equipment with your currency orbs; this significantly changes the standard ""farm until it drops"" scenario that these types of games usually run into. Second, the ability gems have specific colors and they go into the same color sockets on armor such that blue gems go into blue sockets, green into green, and red into red (there are only three color types); the number, color, and connections between the sockets can do everything from simply allowing you to use multiple skills to significantly changing the way one or many skills operate. Equipment also has all the normal stuff you'd expect in a game like this, like various defensive or offensive stat bonuses, the occasional skill bonus, or whatever else. And, again, you get to alter all of the elements of your items, like taking a common item that has the sockets you want and upgrading it from a common item to a rare item, then if you don't like the random stats on your new rare item you can reroll the stats, or change the colors and orientations of the sockets, and so on. You're never, ever just stuck with whatever equipment happens to be dropping for you. Putting these qualities together makes for the least boring gearing system I've seen.Now you roll all this stuff into one game and you get a really complex and compelling experience with a massive amount of customizability and replayability. Each aspect influences the others and there are absolutely no restricting ways to play your character. Spread yourself across the passive skill tree, then put abilities on your gear to compliment your spec; or find abilities you really want to use and then spec in the skill tree to augment or alter how they work. Define the type of character you're going to play ahead of time and restrict yourself to just those types of items, abilities, and passive skills; or flow through the game and define yourself as you go. There are definitely many specific paths that some people prefer, or some that are easier, or more defensive, or more offensive, pet based, supporting, etc., but you will find absolutely no shortage of wild and crazy speculative or even wildly divergent safe/noob-friendly specs on the forums or elsewhere online.But all of these intricacies mean that you'll get the most out of Path of Exile by spending some time researching, whether it's scouring the forums or just watching some YouTube vids of people playing and explaining their particular character build. The more you learn, the more the game opens up and starts to seem even more and more exciting. I've put over 100 hours in at this point and, no matter how much I think I know, I search for something I'm uncertain about and find a whole new aspect of the game that I hadn't even considered yet. I see myself playing Path of Exile far into the future, and will support the game and the dev team with my money by choice, at my own			"

												This game is just...everything I want in a Diablo styled Action RPG.  The unique skill gem system, the amazing stat tree, everything is just so well put together.  The tree is so large that almost every character in the game is unique, and there are what seems like an endless amount of combinations.  The support gems are also nice.  For example, the Spark gem with a fork support gem would cause the spark to split off into 3 directions.  Or the Life Leech support, which leeches life on a hit as long as you use the supported skill.  The loot system is also fantastic.  Unique items are difficult, yet not impossible to find, and if you find something good for a different character, you can just stash it for them.  All in all, it's a very unique game and many things it does, it does well.			"

												I played this game in the open beta phase in 2012. I must say i somehow didn't really get excited by it. I played it through once and just forgot about it. But now that it launched i picked it up again and i must say that its a good game. If you really want the most authentic diablo 2 game that is not diablo 2, this is it. Torchlight is fun but its more based on humour and bright graphics. And even though i enjoyed diablo 3 more than i should have, path of exile is the superior game. And it has the most fair free to play business model in the history of gaming, i would say. I am really excited to see what future holds for this little gaming company, and especially this game. So if you are a fan of the genre PICK THIS GAME UP, you will NOT be dissapointed. 4,5/5Game of the year 2013			"

But mostly it is an AWESOME game.It has tons of content and a huge skill tree( passive stuff ). And also this is a free game so no money los t if you don't really like this.

This game is old school, and anyone who grew up playing video games in the 90's is probably going to love it.The only negative that I can find, is a social chat that lowers your IQ at best, and makes you want to put the live end of a power cord in your mouth at worst.

												Path of Exile is one of the best games of it's genre and by far one of the best free games out there. Seriously, this should be a paid game because the amount of free content you get is pretty ridiculous. All story, class related and gameplay related parts of the game are accessible to everyone, and there is absolutely no element of ""pay to win"". Yes, there are microtransactions, but these are all for either cosmetic things like weapon effects or skins, or stash tabs which means you can store items. The story itself is pretty decent, but the depth of gameplay is where it shines. The passive tree is huge, and opens up a ton of different build ideas based on passives. The uniqueness of these builds are further enhanced by the large number of skills and support gems that go with them, with gems adding different effects to each skills in order to change their role or strengthen them. Skills and support gems can be switched up any time, encouraging a lot of customisation, and while there are no full respec items (although usually the devs hand out full respecs when the passive tree changes), there are items which enable the respeccing of passives, point-by point.I havent actually needed to use the support for the game yet, but I hear it's pretty good with the devs responding relatively quickly. I do know however that they do keep good contact with the community and do strive to improve the game as muh as they can.There are however, two minor problems with this game. One is that you can have an infinite number of particles on screen at any given time, which means that when the spells start flying around, certain builds can get laggy fast. Second of all, is the desync that you get sometimes. It can be quite frustrating to die due to desync, and unfortunately we don't know when/if this problem will be fixed Overall, if you enjoy the ARPG genre, or games such as Diablo II and Torchlight II, this is a must play. It is not only fully free for you to try, but it has a level of customisation that surpasses that of even some paid games.EDIT 13/3/17: After playing this game fow a few hundred more hours, I can say that this game has only continued to go from strength to strength over the course of the last few years. A lot of the desync problems have been fixed and the game has run much more smoothly for me after various performance updates they've dished out. The content has continually been expanding, with a whole 6 new acts coming soon!. This is well and truly one of my favourite games to play and easily my favourite of the genre			"

												Playing the game since open beta, much more before Steam release. Real ""Free to play"", forgot pay to win stuff. After months of playing i can assure you it is the best action RPG i have ever played. A lot of people will compare it with Diablo but for me its much more. First of all game have amazing community and developers who are patching and fixing all issues on a regular base. To be honest i never saw a company ready to listen the community. Before you start playing for real you should definitely register at official forums, check out guides about game mechanics, builds and gameplay tips. You should also drop a look at offical forum shops for gear trade threads, deals between players.One thing that makes this game unique is customization. Passive and active skills can be combined in thousand different ways to make your character exactly as you want him to be, no strict classes. Every single active skill can be modified to work the way you want and match your passive skill setup.Since there is no standard currency like gold or cash, developers decided to implement very interesting currency type - orbs, many different orbs. Each orb type have its primary use for crafting gear mods, thats the main reason people started to use them as a currency.After great community and customization options i would like to point out trade and bargain as a second most important thing in Path Of Exile. To gear up your character fast and build immortal god of hack and slash you should follow the trade chat and official forum trade threads, learn how to buy and sell, dont hesitate to bargain and earn profit. Work on your bargain skills and you will progress much faster.I could really say a lot about it since game content is huge and nicely polished. These first few lines i mentioned was something that really impressed me. Its something that makes a difference between huge, deep games like this one that are obviously made for action RPG community and all other games released exclusivley for building up the company profit.This is one of those games made for community. From gamers for gamersHave fun!			"

												To be serious for one of my reviews, I think this is a very good game.Only it feels a bit singelplayer(unless you do guilds, trading and public parties).It would be better if multiplayer was some sort of a feature and offline mode would be possible( something like Torchlight ). But mostly it is an AWESOME game.It has tons of content and a huge skill tree( passive stuff ). And also this is a free game so no money los t if you don't really like this. And( for as long as I have played ) every skill is avaible for everyone.9/10 Very GUT			"

												This game is just...everything I want in a Diablo styled Action RPG.  The unique skill gem system, the amazing stat tree, everything is just so well put together.  The tree is so large that almost every character in the game is unique, and there are what seems like an endless amount of combinations.  The support gems are also nice.  For example, the Spark gem with a fork support gem would cause the spark to split off into 3 directions.  Or the Life Leech support, which leeches life on a hit as long as you use the supported skill.  The loot system is also fantastic.  Unique items are difficult, yet not impossible to find, and if you find something good for a different character, you can just stash it for them.  All in all, it's a very unique game and many things it does, it does well.			"

												If you enjoy action rpgs - especially Diablo 1 and 2, then you must give Path of Exile a try. I have been a gamer all my life, and Diablo 2 was the game I have regularly played the longest (I think around 3 years).I was very happy with PoE when I started earlier in June - it really is a spiritual successor for Diablo 2. You can play through it by yourself, although it can get pretty difficult that way. If you like Arpg's with A LOT of depth, I would highly recommend it. I would also highly recommend NOT playing it, if you value your time - as it can become supremely addicting. The nice thing about the online component is that there are leagues, like Standard and Hardcore, and even then there isn't any ""true"" permadeath, as dying in Hardcore league will simply transfer your character to the Standard one. You share your loot among ALL characters in the SAME league.There are also Ambush and Invasion leagues. Ambush is considered softcore because it's actually a lot easier - there are ""strongboxes"" that usually contain better loot but are guarded by stronger enemies. Invasion is hardcore, enemies and bosses from other areas (called ""instances"") will come into your current area periodically. Death in Invasion puts your character into Standard league.The nice thing about these leagues is that it only runs for 4 months. After that, your characters are put into standard league. This usually results in ""junk"" loot, where your standard chest will have hoards of loot. This also resets the economy, maintaining a constant level-playing field for newcomers.The PASSIVE skill map...oh dear. If you've played Final Fantasy 10, it's similar to the sphere grid. The customization of skills is absolutely ridiculous. That being said, the skill map is fantastic in that it is accessible to ALL classes. The only difference is that each class starts off in a different section of the map. For example, the Witch (mage) will be closer to intelligence-related nodes, while the templar will be close to the intelligence and strength ones (which also are elemental dmg/res and staff nodes). Near the end of the game, you will unlock the Scion, who starts off at the center of the map. In this sense, you can even have a Ranger summoner who uses a Templar staff, but it would be much less viable and efficient in terms of maximizing your area of the grid. The nice thing about your character resetting to Standard league is you get FULL respec points, so you can change up your build and experiment. There is also official (and unofficial) skill maps that let you play with the nodes and give you good feedback on how your character will look on pen and paper.Once you get a general feel for the game, focusing on one skill is very accurate - best advice for new people is to research the skills (available on the website) and decide which one you'd like to use. There are unlocked active skills when you level up, instead, all active skills come in the form of skill gems. Most equipment have skill gem sockets, and there are items that allow you to reforge/add skill gems. So, a Witch summoner would have blue gems inserted into blue sockets. There are also support gems that will affect any gems in linked sockets, for example multiple projectiles linked to fireball so you shoot 2-3 instead of 1. These also level up while you level up (dont have to keep using it), so a common technique is to equip gems you also want to level up (but not necessarily use) into your 2nd equipment swap because they still gain exp. Just like the passive skill tree, any class can equip any gem, so long as you meet the requirements (level and intelligence/strength/dex depending on the type of gem).It is totally possible to beat the game playing casually and not worrying about both the passive tree and skill gems too much, but after that, the next two difficulties will probably be next to impossible (especially if you're running solo). Players can only join your instance if you are partied up, so you don't have to worry about people coming to your game and aggro-ing you suddenly.EVERYONE will make a mistake on their first character. The goal is to experiment and see how you like to play. My good friend that introduced me to this quit on his level 60+ character because he realized he screwed up. I really, really love planning out my skill trees and deciding which one to use.Storywise. . .I'll be honest - I only have a vague idea of what was going on, and I've beaten the game. Granted, PoE was originally a 2 chapter game with 4 difficulties - now it is a 3 chapter game with 3 difficulties. The story seems very tacked on, and the flavor comes in the form of these stones that you can find throughout the game and read. There have been suggestions to let the lore read aloud as you move around (ala Diablo 2 {unless I'm remembering incorrectly}), but instead you have to stand still and read it (or not). Not the best, engaging story IMO.Races. Omg races. I have stayed up til 2am just to see what the next sales on steam will be. I have also stayed up til 2am just to participate in a race. A race is a short game where you make a character and try to complete goals (most commonly attaining a certain level tier), before the time (ex: 1 hour) is up. You get points, and after receiving enough points, you unlock an item that can be retreived by any character in any league (once). I'm saving all of mine for the next Ambush league (ends and restarts in July).The gameplay - very, very fun. Reminds me so much of D2. The aesthetics are very good, armor is cool to see. Not at all P2W, all microtransactions are completely aesthetic, although you will probably want to buy more tabs for the chest.Definitely recommend!			"

												Now Path of Exile is a game that I have followed since it's early closed beta days and I've played since then too. This is one of the best Hack 'n Slash Action RPG games that you will find this year and what's more it is entirely free to play (yes a real free to play the only thing you pay real money for are cosmetics like extra gore, different skin on items so that you look a little unique, pets that do nothing but follow you or more warehouse slots etc). The gameplay it self is pretty much Diablo 2 style. One amazing thing about the game to note is the skill tree and the way you can develop it... the possibilities are endless! Basically the skill tree is just passive skills while the spells and similar that you use to fight are ""gems"" which you have to embed in your weapons/armors, what's more is that there are no class bound items so basically you can make a Ranger use staffs and use magic, a Marauder use bow and a Witch use a giant sword and that's not all, every single class has the same skill tree with the class being just the way you character looks and the starting possition in the skill tree. The skills in this game are amazing. To use a skill you have to find a gem with that skill, meet the level and stat requerments and put it inside a gem slow in your weapon/armor. Each weapon/armor can have up to 4/6 slots with 3 different color and skill gems also have 3 different color types (based on Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence) and those slots on the weapon can be linked together so you can merge 2 or 3 different skills effects (using support gems with normal skills gems) to add new type of effects to your skills and make them even stronger.The crafting and currency systems in the game are really unique and awesome the normal currency used in other games like gold for example is totally removed and everything revolves around trading items and the currency items are the same as upgrade items (adding new options to you armor/weapons, socketing, changing their type from normal, magic, rare ..etc)PoE is definitely my favorite Hack 'n Slash game together with the classic Diablo 2. It's a must try game for RPG fans and I would recomend it to all of you ;).			"

												Completely surprised by how much more fun Path of Exile is than Diablo III.  I completely agree with those who call this ""what Diablo III should have been"", it's a fun modern take on the Diablo motif with some interesting iterations on class and skill development.  Seriously, if you liked Diablo II, give PoE a shot.  It costs absolutely nothing to do so and you'll want to give the developers some money afterwards.			"

												Love this game. Fast paced, action, diablo-esque but better than D3. The barter system used for trade is interesting and different and way more realistic than bags of gold falling out everyone's rears while exiled on Wraeclast. Haha! The areas are varied, the loot plentiful and the challenge while at first seems a bit tame gets much more challenging as you go. Best of all, it's free to play. The cash shop sells cosmetic items and stash tabs, nothing that is pay to win at all. Highly recommended. "

												For a F2P game, I am more than impressed.  This can easily compete with AAA titles in terms of gameplay, fun, graphics, sound, and story.  The main campaign itself took me 40+ hours which is quite impressive!  Though you can purchase items in-game, this is in no way a pay-to-win game as the items for purchase are all vanity items.  You obtain everything you need to actually play the game by guess what?  PLAYING.  THE.  GAME.  Take note, other supposed F2P releases: I will buy items for this game.  Not because they're required to finish it or make it significantly easier, but because the devs deserve my support for creating a fun, immersive, addictive game.  For free.  As to the gameplay itself, it's a pretty typical action adventure RPG a la Diablo with a complex and satisfying talent grid.  It looks overwhelming at first, but it's fairly easy to pick up after a little study.  It reminds me of the sphere grid from FFX, and is a system I personally like a lot.  It's possible to create just about any build with any class, which is fantastic.  My biggest complaint is that the classes have set genders; I would prefer to create a female marauder or duelist.  Multiple difficulty levels and distinct differences in the classes make this quite replayable.  Of course multiplayer is always fun and the challenges are a nice touch.			"

												As a long time fan of Diablo 2, Path of Exile feels more like a sequel to D2 than Diablo 3 does, with regards to both character progression and the overall mood of the game (dark and dirty). There are pretty much endless combinations of ways to grow your character. The story seems fine, though I paid about as much attention to it as I did other ARPGs--not too much. The soundtrack is good, and the voice acting is great (the Witch!) The vendor currency system is something I haven't seen in another game. Basically, there is none, and you trade consumables for other items. It takes some getting used to, but I liked it.If I had a complaint, it would be with regards to the graphics. Again, I think the dark grittiness of the graphics are a plus, but the lack of vibrant colors makes it difficult for any particular thing to stand out. I often lose track of what's going on when there are too many enemies on the screen, and have had issues avoiding certain AOE attacks.Overall, by far one of the best free games I've played. Tala moana!			"

												Enjoyable, especially with a buddy. Expansive skill trees, combined with slotting gems that lvl up with you, make for a very different experience on different plays. Only real gripe is the town portal system -- I either need to constantly port to town, every 5 mins or less, or leave loads of treasure laying around. Would prefer portals to stay open and not collapse after use, but this is a pretty minor gripe. Overall, very enjoyable.			"

												Path of Exile is clearly a labour of love. It's a wonderful game with some fresh ideas and good mechanics that breaths some more life into the traditional ARPG format.It is similar to Diablo 3, Torchlight 2 and Titan Quest in general gameplay. All your standard things such as levelling up, loot, random levels and monster slaying are here. Where it differs from the aforementioned games is the skill and level-up system, which is an interesting change. As you level up, you gain passive skill points to spend on things such as damage, armour, critical chance etc. You gain your active skills from a variety of different gems, which can be freely plopped into items you find - and taken out without a fuss. This allows you to quickly swap skills in and out - completely changing your play-style in a matter of seconds. These gems also level-up with you and become more powerful. You can create powerful combos by linking support gems with active skills to augment your favourites.This balance between ""permanent"" passive skills and changeable active skills is actually really good and works well together. You can still build a character to exactly what you want - and the passive skill ""tree"" is absolutely huge.Different classes start the game at different points in the skill tree, meaning they can gain access to abilities that suit them best earlier than other classes, but it also means, with a bit of work, you can turn pretty much any class in the game to do something different. It's unique and very well rounded.As a free-to-play game, it's a must try for anyone that likes the format. It's a great game, made even better by being free to play. At no point does it feel like you *have* to pay to get the most out of it, like some other FTP games I have tried in the past.Go on, give it a whirl, it's free!Jimbo Rating: 7.5/10			"

												This is among the most fun f2p games i've ever owned, and the only hack and slash that I truly enjoy. TL;DR: A very fun game with amazing developers and community that's full of content and gets updated regularlyPros:-Truly Free to Play model: I'm sick of all of the f2p games that ended up costing money to get somewhere, and I thought this would be another one of those, but surprisingly it wasn't, you don't need any money to do anything important in the game. All you can buy with money is cosmetic items. I love games that do this.-Abundant content: There is no lack of things to do in this game, you can play it for 1000's of hours and not get bored, and the multiplayer aspect just adds to it (more on that later)-Multiplayer: This game has an amazing multiplayer scene, and it grows more and more every day, I have little doubt this will be one of the biggest ARPG's every if it isn't already, and the PVP and Party systems work really well, and I love how the noticeboards (places to recruit party members) are implemented.-Community: This is one of the few games on steam that doesn't have an incredibly toxic community, the people i've met have all been very helpful and hackers might as well not exist because they are so hard to find, I have yet to find one.-Developers: The developers of this game are the thing that surprised me the most, they constantly update the game with free content and are very good at upkeeping the game, good devs are almost impossible to find nowadays.-Atmosphere: The atmosphere of this game is very dark and gritty and it fits the story very well, not to mention the 5 hour soundtrack that is very well done, I like to spend many hours of this game just walking around-Leagues: Every season the game gets updated with a new league to keep it new and exciting, not much to explain here but it's one of the main reason why you can spend so much time in this game.-Runs well on minimal specs: self explanatory-Trading system: The trading system of this game is very fast and efficient, and the trading economy is very much alive.-Skill tree: The skill tree in this game is very large and there are no lack of new things to learn for your character, the skill tree is massive and you can go down any route you want based on what your character is.Cons:-Eats up your free time-Guilt from the fact the game is free-Giant learning curve-Skill tree can be scary for new players-Lack of mod support (that I know of) Final score:	 9/10, The only thing stopping it from being a solid 10 is the learning curveAll in all i'd say that this is a very good game and one of the best games on steam. Every minute of playing it was extremely fun and I would recommend it to anyone. It's free so why wouldn't you try it! "

Also they have great customer service, some of the best I've ever seen.AAA game from a AAA Company			"

												I'll make this short and rambling.   I'd score this game a 9.5/10If you like or have even thought about trying an Action RPG, get Path Of Exile.  With all honesty, you have NOTHING to loose except the hassle of downloading it.  You don't even need Steam, though the Steam version provided Steam Achievments and Trading Cards if you make the choice of linking your Steam account to the game.Path of Exile (PoE) is truly FREE TO PLAY.  No gimmicks, 99% spam free and NEVER pay to win.  Read all the other positive and negative reviews, as there are some good ones and then just try the game.I play this game in a very casual manner, yet the game can be just as complicated or strategic (in character builds) as I would want it to be.  It has a massive skills system.The Devs are active with the community and updated almost weekly.  Significant content & story update on March 5th.Not going to rehash a review of the game with pros/cons/graphics/sound and all that.  It has already been done and done well.Give it a go and enjoy.  :)			"

The enormous skill tree, the fact that your attack skills and spells are gems instead of class abilities, the barter economy, the gritty style: this is what Diablo III should be. A game for people who aren't afraid to think and experiment.			"

												Path of Legends is another great indie game to add to EA's records of acheivement. You start of with a selection from various characters, these include lulu the dark witch, taric the holy one, and lastly master yi the forgoten avanger. I myself played as yi and the story is great although it does have a few plot holes here and there. In any case you find yourself on a beach after the summer cruise ship you were on got assaulted by the deadswamp pirates. Yi was engaged to be married and had all of his family onboard the cruise at the time. unfortunately the pirates were ruthless and slayed every man woman and child. Yi tried to resist but was overpowerd by a surge of lightening on the stormy night that accompanied the deadswamp pirate assault. Amongst the wreckage of the ship he eventually floated to the island in which you start the game. Theres nothing much to it at first, you are lying face planted in the dirt. You learn to survive as you craft with various tools. Immersion breaks here because you cut down trees with your bare hands, but i suppose this could be attributed to Yi being a badass and so it can be justified.Eventually you can build yourself a nice hut, and after you do some rather grindy farming you can establish a good forward outpost. You get promted mid game to purchase station cash from the soney online entertainment website to speed things up, but i never was a fan of DLC so i dont support EA's decision to monetise indie games like this. After you build the foward outpost you get to fight the first boss, a giant enemy crab which is symbolic of Yi's personal struggles from his japanese heritage. the crab is symbolic of real historical battles in ancient china and for the little historian in all of us i found this quite compelling as a plot twist. beating the crab allows you to advance to the next section, where you meet rico from just cause 2.    Rico gives you the grappleing hook as he too was on the cruise ship but took a bullet to the hip and just cant do what he did in the previous game. Fortunately for us, Yi gets to swing around the area pretty quickly. the hook allows you to make it to the central island, where the plot thickens once Yi discovers theres an american military base centred in the area that has been testing equipment. Yi appraoches the base in a freindly manner, but is instantly gunned down and escapes within an inch of his life. The game turns toward gurrilla warfare fromt his point on. You need to take out key military instillations over the island (such as propaganda stations and fuel depots) to try and win over the local populus. Once youve garnered enough strength you can take the military hq head on to liberate panaoa from the terrorist organisation that has rooted itself in the heart of the island.THe final stages of the game involve strolling the halls of the HQ, which span deep underground. Yi uncovers the secrets this place holds. the organisation were responsible for the pirate attack on the ship, hired mercinaries trying to obtain a rare artifact being transported on the cruise that nobody knew about. This clearly explaines why rico was onboard and this was certainly no ordinary cruise. The artifact was being used to reanimate flesh to create necromongers to satisfy some weird cult called zoology established by Tom ultman. From this point on Yi knew what he had to do and where he needed to go... space... THe game ends with Yi having a choise to destroy the evil facility, or instead render it inert for future research by the alliance which hope to harness this power against the bretheren moons. Once you make your choice you can hitch  a ride on the ebon normandy, a test vehicle in the hanger which is fully developed and primed for space flight. YOu can take with you some local aquaintances you met on the island, or just go solo. In any case, you leave the island and make your way to eden prime, and this is the basis for the second installment of league of exiles which we here at indieholic ardently await to get our greasy little hands on.until next time, stay snazzy gamerz!

												What the hell Blizzard? A F2P indie game is better than the multimillion dollar disaster that was Diablo 3? I'm not sure how to rate this because IMO it's far better than any of its competition, and it's FREE. While I'm still not a big fan of these types of games and can never seem to get addicted, I don't really know what to complain about. The cash shop is all cosmetic crap. The multiplayer runs decently and is simple to play with friends. The combat is much better than Torchlight 2's IMO. It's not a huge change from the old dungeon crawler loot genre, but I'll be damned if it's not a great game that's FREE and can be played solo. As someone who isn't a fan of this genre I want to give it an 8/10. As someone who has seen all the trash that HAS been released in this genre lately, I got to go with 10/10. If you like this type of game, give this a go.			"

												So, after almost 1,300 hours im writing a review, i've played many ARPG games in the past, starting from Diablo 2, to torchlight 2, and diablo 3, but none of them was as near as fun as Path of Exile, when i tried Diablo 3 I played only 20 minutes and got bored, went back to Path of Exile. This game is perfect in any way possible, the Performance is flawless (unless you cast on crit), after 2.0 deployed Desync is fixed, still back in 1.3 it was fun to R.I.P to some desync, the endless build choices is the thing that stands out for me, you literally have no limits. I also love the fact that is completely free, you cant be better than someone, just because you've put more money in PoE. So i'd give it 10/10, no doubt, i will play it untill im dead or something, not stopping soon. ;) Thanks GGG for taking my life :( <3			"

												Best ARPG out there at the moment. So many choises for customization with your build and constant updates adding more content that you will never run out of things to do. New leagues every three months let the new players have a fresh start on bar with old players outside of standard league where end game gear price is absurd.			"

YouTube™ Video: Steam Review E12 Path of Exile 

			Views: 1,378		

			Grinding Gear Games have done a fantastic service to lovers of action RPGs. Path of Exile is a great piece of the genre and everything a great ARPG should aspire to be.		

Path of Exile: An action RPG similar to style and feel of great titles like Diablo 2. Path of Exile is a true marvel in its approach and achievement. Everything in the game is solid and simple but with a lot of its own ideas to make it different from most other ARPGs. From the colossal sized skill tree and open ended character building to skill gems and support gems and to the land of Wraeclast itself, it’s a unique enough experience that I haven’t encountered anything quite like Path of Exile before. Its non-standard approach is a nice breather from typical tropes of ARPGs and the fact that it works so well is a great achievement.  The game not only looks great but its sound design and overall ambiance is dark and dreary and very fitting of the setting. The story and lore of Wraeclast is quite disturbing and is quite interesting to unravel although, like most ARPGs its story is more akin to a movie rather than a true role-playing experience, where you make hard decisions and live out consequences of those choices. The game also suffers a bit with regards to its own character system, in that each character can potentially be the same, it loses its replay-ability a bit when compared to other ARPGs where characters are a class unto themselves with their own unique skills and spells and the skill tree in general will take a lot of careful planning and getting used to. Overall the experience of Path of Exile is solid and fun with the most frustration coming from the fact that it is an online game and with that comes some technical issues such as lag and issues from other players themselves. Personally, I would have gladly had paid whatever the asking price for this game, for it to be single player and online as optional. As a free-to-play title it does come with its own store which thankfully I can report does not have any content within it that feels like it has to be purchased in order to enjoy the game. Items in the are generally either cosmetic items, purely for looks or things like stash or character expansions, but they give you so many to start out with that these won’t feel like immediate needs or purchases ever. Path of Exile is a great ARPG, everyone can enjoy this game and it is simple and easy to get into and play and it at least offers 20+ of content for a first time through the entire game and it’s all completely free without any extra game content being behind a paywall. -Double Thumbs up from RoyialVideo Reviews can be found at: www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork "

												Diablo III done right. Wayyyy more class customization, wayyyy more class options, custom spells, customizable weapons. What more could you want? The leveling system is similar to final Fantasty XIII, in which you get points and rank up different stats in a web. Not to mention the web has over 1,000 different options to choose from. Incredibly enjoyable to play with your best friends. There is infinite replayability. The levels randomly regenerate when you revisit them and the graphics are incredibly detailed. So much enjoyment was felt whilst playing this game.Diablo III done right.... and did I mention that it's free?10/10 With the launch of this game just emerging on steam, the sky is the limit with how much potential this game has.Imagine Diablo 2 + Materia system from FFVII + Skill tree from Witcher 2 (20x bigger).Now add Ironman difficulty and no gold.

												A quality Free To Play Action RPG. It has a skill system similar to Final Fantasy VII's materia system, where you put a skill gem in a piece of equipment to gain access to new abilities, or passive bonuses that can link to other skill gems in the same piece of equipment that has linked slots. As well as getting 1 passive skill point per level up to spend in a skilltree reminiscent of Final Fantasy X's system, minus killing enemies for AP.You get to play through a well made campaign with several acts without paying a dime. If you're a fan of games like Diablo II, Torchlight, etc, you should definitely give this game a try sometime.			"

And it is still free to pay!!I play, I pay and I rejoice in this forsaken ghost land.p.s.

												Very good, but beware! This game is not n00b-friendly at all (things could do with a lot more explanation).In PoE, you play an Exile who just landed on the coast of Wraeclast. From there, you will fight your way across the continent and find what's behind the corruption of the land. To do this, you use skill gems that you can socket into your equipment, different kinds of orbs that enchant your stuff and spend points in a massive passive skill tree. The skill tree in this game provides very few skills, because the majority is available as skill gems (that you can swap in/out at a moment's notice).I didn't try to use the global chat (too noisy), so can't really tell if the online aspect is good or not.

												I've been playing Path of Exile since its Beta release, and i have pretty much nothing but positive reviews for this game. Infact, this game is so geniusly built i would actually be proud to say this is what Diablo III Should have been. (Sorry Blizzard, comming from a huge Blizzard game supporter in my past) The customization and variations of this game are so vast beyond anyones wildest dreams, I absolutely love it. Your currency system is GENIUS as well, its exactly what a game like Diablo lacked. Gold became really useless in late Diablo 2 gameplay, even in D3. It was really sad. Your currency system designed here keeps every currency in demand. No matter how far into the game you are.Ontop of this overwhelmingly amazingly positive review, you keep releasing more and more things that will keep this game alive for years to come and that truely takes talent.Leagues- BrilliantMore Skill gems!!! WOW EVEN MORE CUSTOMIZATION TO YOUR TALENT TREE BUILDS!!!!Reward incentives.And yet again, if you could put anymore cherries ontop of this wonderful cake that you already have, the game is FREE! Yet again, your genius plan works. Microtransaction is the way of the future! You keep huge respect for your games F2P Scene but yet if a player wants to spend a little money to customize their Character, they can by choice.MY ONLY COMPLAINTS about this game  (Which is extremely hard to fix) is your rubber banding system. I dont know if it is because of lack of servers around the world or not, but it has adressed me some serious problems when playing Hardcore mode in your game. And i know that is disheartening to any gamer. My other complaint, which really isnt even a complaint, is this games graphics. Its not a deal breaker by any means, but  feel like it could use some improvement.All in all I would rate Path of Exile a 9/10 since you seem to keep improving this game further and further.  You have my highest respects, one of the best RPGs to date.			"

												My favourite Clicking-On-Monsters-Loot-Bingo pastime. After being out for about five-ish years and after about five-ish expansions it's got tons of content and it works well.Even if you're a diehard supporter of Other Brands of Carpal Tunnel Clicking, it's hard to argue with the price of COMPLETELY FREE. This game still hasn't gone pay-to-win, using eurobucks just gets you slightly more fashionable murderhoboes (and supports the developers).Downsides would be that the first act is still just boring caves and rocks and the first 20 levels of a character are limited in their skill variations. It gets a lot better after those.Oh, and some people probably hate the grimdark setting because everything is rusty and gory and vile. No cute high fantasy here. The story takes you through some pretty sinister and nasty places. I consider it a big bonus.			"

												At the time of the review I have about 700 hours logged on steam version. Path of Exile is  a hardcore action RPG with a lot of depth. It will most likely take a while to get in to and it is not suited for quite a lot of gamers. However, this game is absolutely fantastic. Pros and cons can be subjective, so I'll just point out main points.-Hardcore. Can be a heaven for hardcore gamers and a nightmare for casuals. Not recommended for your first ARPG.-Free-to-play but not pay-to-win. GGG's microtransaction system is very fair. Almost everything is cosmetics and nothing in microtransaction store gives anyone an advantage.-Realistic gritty graphics. I personally love the graphic and art style, but it is highly subjective.-Music varies from ""meh"" to absolute blasts. From boring lullabies to beautiful symphonies. -Sound design is pretty solid. Good voice acting and realistic sounds.-Support is great and quick. I personally had great time using it.-Game has classes, however, the class only changes how your character looks and from where he/she starts from the skill tree.-Characters can use any skills or items if they have required stats. Skills are skill gems that can be socketed in to items.-Ridiculously flexible and huge skill tree. You can make thousands or possibly even millions of builds with the tree provided. Skill tree consists of little upgrades (For example, 0.3% life regeneration or 12% more physical damage.)Some people don't like this, but those small upgrades stack fast, I personally love the freedom of the skill tree.-Game is based on leagues, so there will be different leagues where you can create a new character and try new things.-Lot of equipment variance, you can find, buy or craft items perfect for your build or even multiple ones.-Trading is decent but should be worked on. You either need to yell to chat or use 3rd party websites to make trades. Game has no auction houses or player shops in-game.-Leveling can be quick or slow, depending on build and skill. Max level is 100 and you can reach level 70 in 10-15 hours.-The game has 3 difficulties, Normal, Cruel and Merciless. You will move to the next difficulty after completing storyline. Story currently is composed of 3 acts (4th one is coming soon) and you complete those acts in each difficulty. This can be very boring, since it can feel like the game is repeating.-The endgame is a map system. You can craft mods in to your maps to make them fit your build or your needs. I personally love this system, since it offers a lot of variance, varying difficulties and different experiences.-The D-sync (Should be fixed in the Awakening expansion). Basically, you will be off sync from the game and you might in a different position than your character seems to be on your screen. This can and probably will cause a lot of deaths and frustration, but should be getting fixed soon. (Only thing that has really caused me frustration in the game. Glad to see it going)I might have forgotten some main points...Overall, I think Path of Exile is a fantastic game by a fantastic company and I recommend it whole heartedly.Edit: Now at over 3k total and the Atlas of Worlds expansion is fantastic.

												Current state : if you can get pass the performance issues it's a great game, i still wouldn't recommend it until they fixed that side2016 update:i wanted to write a full breakdown of changes between the last 2 years but i don't have enough space so i'll go fast on each point :1) desync fixed2) performance still sucks3) the last expansion was released too early full of bugs4) challenges can be completed with less farming and got improved5)trading got improved a bit , but idd still love a Self Found League6) balance : powercreep is of the charts expecting changes in next league7) no one cares about PvP so they aren't gonna focus on it anymore, not surprised here------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------original review:First thing i should mention is that this review doesn't takle what Path of Exile does best, but what a released game should be and shouldn't.   -> 1) Desync there is no need argue about it's presence in-game, we know it's in the game on a daily presence and that it will affect your gameplay.     ->* skills that will make you desync : flicker strike , cyclone; since you move when you use these skills usage of ""shift""(to stop you from moving on server/client side) will not help       ->* gameplay that will make you desync : even though it's present overall in the game the most desync part of the game is Dominus fight especially his first part, if you try to kite and move behind cover you will desync at least once per fight , it won't kill you in 90% of the cases but nevertheless is still annoying as hell . Desync is responsable for many hardcore deaths every day     ->* server side problems combined with desync, last time this happened 4/6 players died from a hardcore party, one of them was level 90 ->2) Performance :    ->*depending on your playstyle:      ->**if you play alone : in town, eternal laboratory or any other empty place i manage to get 170+ fps when you start playing the game it will go to 60-70, if you are doing a end game map with some special mods it will drop to 30-50       ->** if you play in a party: the performance will be lower because there is more stuff going on but some times it will go to ""1"" when certain skills are used   ->* Death animation will make you drops fps if you kill large packs of monsters   ->* range attacks and spells : discharge, lightning arrow, fireball, freezing pulse, ice spear, poison arrow... will lower your framerate but only in end-game or when used in a combination with cast on crit   ->* the game will just not work properly if you have a "" creative sound card""    ->* cpu bound : changing your graphics options will  not make a big difference in fps gain or loss during fights, even if you have 1 fps the game will not use more than 30-40% of your graphics card (depending on how powerfull it is)  ->3) Bugs: yes we know that every game has bugs but     ->* in a end game focus on map drops you should work on fixing them first :      ->** monsters stuck behind walls and cannot be reached : this happens a lot on Shipyard map (level 77 top tier map, 1 level below max map level) and if you didn't kill last 5-10 monsters you might just not get a map drop, when you didn't get any map last few monster have a good chance of droping 1 or even more maps      ->** you are kicked from the server and cannot join the map again, these happened twice in a almost half year period     ->* every patch is plagued with game breaking bugs, last time they had to roll back because more than 1000 chars died on hardcore. Even the devs will tell you not to play soon after a patch is released especially on Hardcore  ->4)Challenge system and how it affect the gameplay and drops :   ->* since they added the ""challenge system"" we saw a change on where the unique item required to complete a specific challenge drops : you have Kaom's heart and shavronne's dropping only from level 76+ maps, before you could get them by just farming level 66-67 content for a few months, the price was also lower.    ->* the only reason they added map only unique item drop is because they had 61 people completing challenges before so they wanted to lower that number    ->* only challenge in getting 8 out of 8 challenges completed is getting all the unique items, to get them all you will need at least 250 exalted orbs, let's say you are playing like 7 hours a day 7/7 days a week even you make 10 exalted orbs a week it will take you at least 25 weeks (keep in mind that the first few weeks you will invest most of your currency in upgrading your gear and progressing rather than storing it)   ->*this is not something skill based, if you speak about skill it's not even rewarded in or outside the game. Chris will go and interview ""popular"" streamers instead of ""skilled"" even though they are pretty popular in the Path of Exile scene, not even when we had the first player reaching level 100 (max in Path of exile)   ->* there is a frequent joke made on forums that the only hard part of this game is the Magic Find slider, how much can you get without big drawbacks  ->5) Trading :  ->* you hated action house in other games? well you will hate this trading system even more, there is no proper way to search on forums, both forums and trade channel is filled with spam , people just stay in town and buy/sell both currency or items, this is the same problem Diablo 3 had where people played ""the action house"" instead of the game because it was the best way to get best gear in-game ->6)Balance :   ->* the new monsters hit harder compared to older monsters even though they use the same skill: a monster made before does 5% the monster does 20-40%   ->* moba style of balance changes to skills    ->* even though it was promised in different interviews that there will not be nerfs when someone found a cool builds, that does seem the case, and it went as far removing a skill from in-game (Phase Run) even though it's still on the webpage and a  flask , which was later added back with a nerfed version   ->* at the release 9 unique items were nerfed    ->* every new unique item or skill gem has a drawback, you can say that unique items have at least 2 drawbacks now   ->7) Promises for the release:  ->* we where promised that they will take feedback from players on their forums , but the respond more on Reddit rather than on the main forum, and even with all the feedback they still will do whatever they want, making you just waste your time, it's not just me saying this there are a lot of people that playes  this game since Closed Beta and have the same opinion ->*Private leagues : still waiting on news , it seems they completly forgot about it ->* PvP : might be delivered in next patch , was promised in the release patch like it was for Diablo 3 ->* Trading system revamp : again pushed back to god knows when ->* Act IV : pushed back to march 2014 ->* weekly updates : now updates will be made every 2 weeks ->* optimization : still waiting on it ->* Clans/guilds : you have a guild tag and a chest that lags every time you put or take something out of it, there is actually no reason to have a guild chest unless you want to troll people with the most worthless items you can find in-game . there is no guild banner or shirt or any customization whatsoever to it ->* custom rogue exile through steam workshop : again no news about itAt the current state of the game i wouldn't recommend it, maybe in 1-2 years it will be better but until then my journey in Path of Exile			"

												It's perfect game for every Hack and slash fans. In my opinion this game have everything what Diablo 3 doesn't have. Plot are a little bit short but for me it was exciting . There are a few drawbacks like graphic or music which becomes tiresome and game play is a little bit hard for new players  but we can expect everything from free too play game. I recommend this game only for advanced players. I really enjoy this title and i think a lot of people will agree with me.			"

It makes me happy when free to play games do not introduce pay to win. Frequent updates and procedurally generated content is a recipe for ultimate (re)playability.			"

												If you like gear based grinding games then this one is for you.  Let me start out by saying that I enjoy a hard challenge and have to play on hardcore, where you only die once and then you drop down to standard mode (softcore).  Any character that drops down like this is dead to me, never to be played again.   I wasn't sold on this game at first as I got sick of dying at lot :) .  Lately been playing it a lot and more and now I understand the boss mechanics accept that I will die at some point but it's just a matter of how long I can last.With a massive skill tree where you can spend 120 skill points from 1350 skill nodes there is a large amount of replayability.  Even though there is a lot of repetition in replaying the same maps over and over (until you beat Merciless difficulty and move into endgame randomised ""maps"") it's the character customisation that keeps me coming back.  Give it a shot, I think it's worth it. "

												I truly consider this the great sequel to Diablo II . Being free-to-play is even greater ( but DO NOT compare this game with Diablo III, for they are different games. Diablo III is a game in its own right, it deserves the attention for it is very polished and well conceived ).Path of Exile has the exact style of Diablo II and although I don't agree with the spamming trade system, complicated class skill tree and inability to re-roll skill points easily, I do praise the developers for starting the game and continuing Diablo II's dark legacy in a different lore and graphic engine.Deserves a 10/10 from a Diablo fan like myself.

												Basically this excellent game is a free to play Diablo 2 with a character improvement system that is QUITE REMINISCENT to the Sphere Grid  from Final Fantasy  X. Except that the grid itself is... ridiculously big. And if you are just playing casually, you can use it to develop your character in ways you want.But if you are fairly serious, you will need to find out  ways to actually build effective and efficient characters, having entire trees planned beforehand.And then you will need to get quite lucky or trade successfully, because skills are not bound to a character. That is both the game's greatest strength and greatest weakness, in my opinion. The skill system is  INCREDIBLY flexible, being more similar to FF7's materia system than anything else. Skills come in the form of ""virtue gems"", which you get to slot into items with the appropriate colored slots.Said gems mostly come in rare, random drops. You either need to trade for them (easier now since there are vendors that do sell some useful gems now), win  many of them on quests, or trade with the community.Extremely flexible, and if diablo 2 gameplay mixed with FF7 skill systems and FFX sphere grid character growth sounds interesting, you will probably devote many many hours in this title.The ingame shop is only for cosmetic items, storage space and character slots, as far as I know, so there is no such thing as a pay to win scheme in this game.EXTREMELY recommended.

												Stunning visuals, addictive mechanics, and neat functions. Path of Exile, at first, is a solid experience, especially since the game doesn't cost a dime, and sports ethical microtransactions. No pay to win here, which is a big plus in my book. Path of Exile was meant to be the Diablo 2 successor that I've always dreamed of... but is it?The first playthrough, as previously stated, was solid. The character progression tree is intimidating at first, but can be mastered over time. Skill gems offer a neat twist to the tried and true ""Diablo"" formula. There's plenty of strategy to implement here. I thoroughly enjoyed the standard difficulty.But where did it all go wrong?The second you beat the first playthrough, it all goes downhill. ""Cruel"" difficulty is terribly unbalanced. You will breeze through regular enemies, but once a rare or unique enemy appears, you are promptly one-shot-killed. Heck, even a select few normal enemies can one or two shot kill you. Regardless of how you die, you will lose 5% of your experience on this difficulty. This function is archaic, and fundamentally flawed, completely and totally. Diablo 2 did this, except the game is 15 years old, and 15 years is enough time for game developers to realize ""yes, players hate this, and it kills progression, and thus, the entire gameplay experience"". Grinding Gear Games didn't get the memo, it seems. Regardless, once this penalty kicks in, the game becomes a sluggish, boring grindfest where you struggle to level up in the face of unbalanced enemies and ""cruel"" penalties. My desire to play was crushed once I was met with this awful formula. As an insult to injury, your elemental resistances are reduced by 20%, which makes one-shot deaths even easier.Due to this massive difficulty boost, you REQUIRE a build to survive. There is no free reign to design your character anymore; you must now look to the net to guide you. Unlike the first playthrough, progression is limited to this, and the experience is totally drained out and dried up because of it. Progression is a massive part of what makes this game and others like it fun, and with this unnecessary and poorly implemented slippery slope added, it becomes entirely tedious and stale.... a grindfest (and it isn't even a traditional MMO). It essentially becomes a game like Dark Souls - a game for masochists. A game where you have to throw an unnecessary amount of time, effort, and research into it to enjoy the bare basics of the game. To even scrape by.These are the reasons why I do not recommend this game. The beginning showed LOTS of promise, but once your first playthrough is up, there's no point in continuing. There's no compelling story, no memorable characters, and the first playthrough,the Dark Souls-like gameplay is mediocre at best, and rage-inducing at worst.Thankfully, I didn't spend a dime on this gameplay-flawed package. I hope you don't spend any on it as well.			"

												Path of Exile is a game that I have been happily playing on and off ever since the closed beta, and I don’t regret a minute of it. The game has a fantastic atmosphere and solid gameplay with a ton, ton of depth. If you are looking for an action RPG where you can make vastly different characters, this is going to be it. I can confidently say Path of Exile is the most enjoyable action RPG on the market right now, better yet it is completely free-to-play with what is probably the best free-to-play model in a long time.

												The best thing you can say about this game is that its free and when I say free its 100% free in no way will not spending hold you back at all.That being said why play a free game if its no fun? The game as most of its type is grindy but thats fine if the story is good or the dungeons varied. In Path Of Exile the story as far as I got was well not a story rather just a few npcs who would make a funeral more depressing and you keep finding yourself skipping the text before you fall asleep.The Dungeons are no better, maybe the lead dungeon designer got bored after making three types (underground, forest, coast) and thought no-one would notice.The lvling up system is quite interesting using a final fantasy type spider system allowing millions of different combinations which would allow for hundreds of styles of play but in reality only a few will work for every character, so caution is required as making a mistake on your leveling pathway could mean you end up with a dud many hours later.Expect for that it really is just a standard ARPG with poor graphics that even free is not recommand over Van Helsing or Torchlight.

												The game is good, but has some problems:·Huge FPS drops.·LOOOOOONG patching times with the steam client. This can get really annoying when, after a big update, come the little 1mb bug fixess at quiet a fast pace..... (5' or more for patching 1mb....... -_-)·Massive amounts of desync for people playing far away from any of the gateways -.-! wich makes any content/build/whatever that requires finesse, unpleasant, if not impossible to play. And this sole point is why i would not recommend the game.			"

												I thought ""The Awakening"" Expansion would bring some new ideas. Nope. It´s the same repetitive and tedious grind like always. Heavily RNG based items. You either get lucky or circle around in one Spot for days and wait for progression.It´s not one of my favorite games anymore. While this was in Beta and waited for Release, I found other games, that handle it better.			"

												This game used to be good but it's become pay2win after the last patch.  I played for thousands of hours, and i regret all of them.  The lead developers are awful, the GMs are awful, and the playerbase is constantly being harassed.  This game USED to be fun, but now it's just awful.edit:  I just got muted in game for 8 hours for even discussing their pay to win ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  I was talking in the global chat about how premium tabs are pay to win, and how poe sells itself as an ""ethical free2play"" and a mod muted me and told me to contact their support if I had any concerns to voice.  SCREW THIS GAME, SCREW PATH OF EXILE, IT'S PAY2WIN GARBAGE.  I regret every moment spent playing.			"

												Unlike some ""free to play"" games here on Steam this one is actually 100% free. The game is huge and using real money on microtransactions offers no gameplay advantages. No pay-2-not-grind ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t here. This alone makes Path of Exile worth checking out.Rise, why are you giving this game a negative review then? Excellent question. To start with, the game took five minutes to start up every time. My friend's game took around 2-3 minutes and his PC is top notch. So you're looking at very high startup times unless you're running an SSD. Also, changing graphic settings might freeze or crash the game. This happened when trying to use windowed fullscreen or turning anti-aliasing on. I ended up having to play just plaing old windowed mode. High startup times are a problem for this type of game.The game itself is like Diablo 2 on shrooms. The combat felt slow and unresponsive, and the animations were clunky. Not something you'd expect from an Action RPG. The enemies are your classic goatmen, skellingtons, zombies and swarmy bugs. Sometimes the enemies are rare or unique. Even The Butcher made an appearance (only he was called Brutus but I know he was The Butcher), The setting is grimdark, as it should be.By the way, the graphics are amazing. Makes you wanna kill Blizzard for selling that PoS D3+expansion for 80 euros still.Now about that passive skill tree. One look at that tree and you know if you're staying or not. There is no way to know what passives are useful, no way to fully respec and I seriously doubt anyone truly knows whats going on with that skill tree. Like, come on people. There is no need to have something like that. Give me a few straight lines and I work it out from there.Overall not a very rousing experience. Check it out though since its free.			"

And its free to play, you cant ask for more.If you want to support the game you can buy supporter packs or cosmetic items. There is nothing you can buy to have advantage over someone who didnt spend anything.It can be complicated for a beginner, just google and find some popular and easy build on their forum and you are good to go! :)			"

												I already reviewed this game a year or two ago, saying how good it was. I started playing it again not too long ago, and decided to come back and give it a new review, in order to help keep reviews fresh and relevant.So now at the end of 2016, almost 2017, how is it holding up to the test of time?In my opinion this game is still the golden standard of how a free to play game should be run. While the game has microtransactions, the only things you can buy are cosmetic things to change how you look. There is absolutely nothing you can buy that would give you an unfair advantage over others, and there is absolutely nothing you need to buy in order to play the full game. You can play the whole game beginning to end, with every character, as many times as you like for free. There is no catch whatsoever.In terms of graphics. While graphics have come a long way in the last few years, and there are some amazing looking games out there, I still find the graphics in Path Of Exile to be more than satisfactory. The visuals are more than enough to make you feel alone and scared, as well as excited, safe, or in trouble. Leading to an immersive experience.The game has also seen significant imrpovements from what I can tell. I could be mistaken, or may have just forgotten, but there seems to be way more cool items and new loot in the game compared to before. There are also new town characters with side quests, that if you complete, allows you to buy cooler and cooler things the more you level up your relationship with them.Back in the day, the game had issues with connexion from time to time, but that too seems to have been improved, with the game playing much smoother. I have not noticed any lag so far. It could be down to there being less people playing, but I don't think that is the case because it still seems like loads of people are playing on a regular basis.The game is really good, a solid 10 out of 10 for me. If this game had launched on the first day for 60 bucks it would have been worth it, and even today I still think it is worth a good 50 to 60 bucks. Considering it is totally free, you really can't complain.All in all I would say the game is just as good as it used to be if not better.So, what can you actually do in the game?You play as an exile that has been just abandoned and left to die on a monster infested island. You then fight your way through the levels, until becoming a god-like all powerful warrior.The game has loads of powerful items to help make yourself even more powerful, as well as a skill tree that seems to offer almost infinite options on how you want to build your character.While the main missions are a little short, you can play them on many difficulties. Also the game has a very good set of end game missions, that make up for how short the main missions are.I would compare it to Diablo 2, or Titan Quest, it is one of those kinds of games, but more modern and comprehensive versions, with a few unique twists.well worth a look if you like magic, action, RPG, MMO, epic adventures, or any combination.

												Path of Exile is definitely the highest point an ARPG can achieve , it has the build diversity, the difficulty that can make you go mad, the real end game that can be only achieved by really putting the time and hard work on your character, and so much more.GGG is a great company and a model to follow, the game has the best Free To Play model i have ever seen, with constant 3 month updates, nothing you can buy will make you better in the game which is a very important thing, no content needs to be bought which is an even more important thing in a game.The only bad thing i find that is important is, the game is hard to run on shity PC's (my PC is 10 years old  XD) but they have improved that aspect a lot recently and the other thing is the Microtransaction prices, i think for example instead of 50 points for 5$ it should be 80-100, but if they made it that way they must have their reasons.With all that said, the game is awesome and definitely the best ARPG and i'm not seeing anyone doing it better.

Yes you can use micro-transactions, however these are not pay-to-win in ANY way. It's completely free, the graphics are nice, gameplay is fluid, etc.The community features some very friendly people, and raiding together is a ton of fun and easy to do.Classes are genderlocked, but if you want to play a male ranger, you can just slap on a bow on another class and play him ranged, it doesn't matter that much.If you like action-RPGs and dungeon-crawlers, you should get this game.

												Path of Exile is worthy of any action-RPG's fan's attention - especially since the game is free.  If one wishes to support the game developers, money can be spent for cosmetic changes and to increase your stash size, but neither are required to play the game.While the passive skill tree is enormous, it does require a bit of thought and planning to be utilized effectively.  Active skills are socketed to items, allowing unique combinations and a large amount of variety to gameplay (although, some options are far more effective than others).  Skills are leveled through experience that your character gains as they are socketed in an equipped item.Disadvantages...two in my experience: descynchronization from the required servers, even with ample internet capability; the targeting system is frustrating for melee type characters.  Both are irritating and exacerbate each other, often leading to character deaths.  As with Diablo 3 (the only other ARPG game that I have played with a server connection requirement), this has kept me from playing hardcore characters.  It's a shame, because I enjoy the challenge.Overall, I will wholeheartedly recommend the game, despite the above-mentioned flaws.  The developer seems committed and responsive to the fans / supporters, which is a nice bonus and will hopefully ensure future changes which allow for better, more reliable gameplay.  Additionally, the amount of variety and different gameplay options (races, ladder servers, etc.) should keep long term players' attention.			"

												As a Beta backer, I'm very happy with what GGG have done with this game over the years, Well polished and a really great replacement for Diablo 2. When you start, it can be a bit daunting to look at that huge passive tree before you, but after a time it becomes easier and easier to travel around the tree. Look at guides online, it's completely fine too, see what you can do to tweek it, your first build will always be horrible if you do not get help, but when you do make that one magical build that destroys everything it's extremely rewarding.The Currency in this game is what made me play it for so long, it's so complex but at the same time simple. The haggle game is real and it's so ALIVE, always moving, don't believe that one guy with the fixed prices because this game is ALL about Supply and Demand.This game has no pants, does not matter, you still look like the dog's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ towards the endgame with full bodied armour huggin dem thighs tight.Need more Help? Visit Path of Exiles forums, it's full of info. And use poe.xyz to buy stuff. it's a time saver. ;)Addictive!9/10 Corrupted Tabula Rasas!			"

												DO YOU LIKE FREE GAMES? DO YOU LIKE CARNAGE? DO YOU LIKE GORE? DO YOU LIKE A HELLISH GRITTY DARK STYLE GAME WITH TONS TO DO? Then look no further cheap skate this is the game for you....A game with constant updates to always allow new things in the game, newer armor, higher levels, and accessories to make your character look devilishly good. Here's the catch... that's right the game is completely free, it has micro transactions with in the game but nothing that makes it pay to win. You join in and create a character and bam. You're all set. You can pick character classes and emerse yourself in a skill tree so vast and huge that you wont know what the F*** to do with it. It has such a vast array of skills and abilities you'll get lost in it. So why do i recommend this game? WHY YOU ASK? Well simply... Its a free to play game, structured like a classic game that's brought enjoyment to millions of people, with stylish graphics and emersive gameplay. Pull up a chair and start collecting some loot, make your character amazing!.			"

												One of the better F2P entries on the market for certain. The devs take such an anti-P2W stance that I'm actually really amazed and tempted to spend money since the game's not a black hole vortex for it like most F2P.ARPGs have really been done to death and most really aren't that different from one another but I feel Path of Exile really stands out due to a number of innovative approaches to old problems. Levelling and screwing yourself and worthless currencies in particular. I can genuinely say that I like character progression better than Diablo II. It's still doesn't capture the holy crap moments of Diablo II loot or have the presenation of the gold standard either, but it sure as hell does both of those better than the cancer that is Diablo 3.Only thing I hate is server lag. The fanboy crew irrationally blame people's internet but it's clearly the game's server. It only happens occasionally, but when it does it's at a level high enough to be quite frustrating.			"

I cant tell, this is a atter of taste only.theres no money in this game, there is Useful stuff you have to use as a currency. (Crafting items)As of one of the last patches, early game got WAY easier. But i still think this is the Dark souls of the Hack n slay genre.MASSIVE Skilltree, MASSIVE Amount of Crafting items, Uniques, Skills, and whatnot.7Character classes, each with 3 or so Prestige Classes.The PAYABLE Content is Purely Cosmetic or more Shared Stash Space. If You Are willing to make Mules - Not much of a Problem.Youre a Diablo 2 Veteran and hate all that other ""Hack & Slay"" crap?

												I did once a review of this game, but I have played much more since then and I feel that I have to change that review.Is a ""Diablo style"" game, so you don´t need to read more if you did not like at all Diablo. Is nicely done. The graphics are ok, and there is a huge variety of possiblilities about leveling your character. So many that you can experiment and replay the game many times with differents characters and differents skills. That was one of the reasons why I expent more than 230 hours playing. The other reason, a feature called ""Hardcore leagues"". When you create a new character you can select this league. Is a permanent death style and I love that. I played Diablo that way and I know that is just a matter of quit the game when you die, but I like much that this is included as a part of the game. Sometimes the smallest details make a big difference, and the developers have done a really good job with this game. They are also active improving the game and there are no tricks or pay to win, the game is free. You can buy cosmetic things such a flame texture for your weapon, a new texture for a pice or armor, a pet, etc.If you liked once Diablo, try this. If you have never played Diablo or any other ""hack and slash"" game and want to give a chance to the genre, this is a good one.			"

												My game of choice when it comes to the top-down action RPG genre!It acts like a true spiritual successor to Diablo 2, when I started playing I was so pleased at how the game handled and looked. It's gritty and grimey and it feels like a slog through the legions of hell.Where the game really shines is the character creation and theorycraft aspects. You can spend a good hour or so deciding what kind of build you want and what sort of weapons and attacks you're going to use before even clicking that create a new character button. Thinking about how your passive stats and combination of attacks are all going to synergise with each other is all part of the fun. And yet if you don't want to do that it's fairly obvious where to go and what to get to make a successful build anyway (after a bit of practice)Highly recommended if you're a fan of the Diablo games, and even with the whole PoE vs D3 e-war I'd still try both and see what suits you, they are inherently different games. (this one is a whole lot cheaper though)			"

												One of the best games of 2013 if not the best. With a very deep learning curve that doesn't really make it unplayable but makes it hard to master. If diablo 3 is the ""arcade"" dungeon crawler this should be a ""simulator"". A few things that other developer could learn from:- free to play done right: no pay to win, cosmetic purchases, if you want to support developers- endgame: there is a endgame that is more that just item grinding- the most important: listening developersTo summarize if you are in to the genre then it is a must to try if you are not then you should try as this is one of the top games of 2013.

												Amazing game. I'll try to keep it short and explain why. As someone that didn't like Diablo 3 (sorry for the never-ending comparison) that much because of the pay-to-win, this game is amazing and fair on all fronts. Yes you can use micro-transactions, however these are not pay-to-win in ANY way. It's completely free, the graphics are nice, gameplay is fluid, etc.The community features some very friendly people, and raiding together is a ton of fun and easy to do.Classes are genderlocked, but if you want to play a male ranger, you can just slap on a bow on another class and play him ranged, it doesn't matter that much.If you like action-RPGs and dungeon-crawlers, you should get this game. Now.Go get it right away.			"

												There are many excellent reasons to play this game and they are all covered in other reviews. Here are the things people forget to talk about.The team behind the game, GGG, updates regularly and in fun ways. A lot of players, like me, rejoin the game when new content comes out. We play two, three months and then go play something else. We know we'll be back since twice a year a whole new league with new rules will be offered for the players.But what if I'm an hardcore gamer and I don't want to stop playing, I want to be the king (or queen) of the game! Well lucky you, Endgame is perfect in Path of Exile. You can do races to gain point and unique items. You can use the same character and do the ""maps"". Those are random area that are pretty hard and fun. You could also start a new character since there's a lot (like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) of builds, and new skills / items are regularly added to the game to offer new possibilities. For all the hack and slash people out there, it's a must try game. You will feel powerfull in this game. You will enjoy the loot. You will strategize fights and you will play with friends in a positive way. And did I say it's free! Free for everything!!! All content is free! So stop wasting time reading review and try it for yourself.			"

The quests and dungeons are really fun and the leveling system is unique and you can reach high levels withoug having to reach into your wallet. The only real negative thing I can say about it is the fact that some areas are a bit harder to find and get to since there is a lack of a local map for specific areas. One last thing I should mention is that you get to fight cannibals that shoot fire at you 11/10			"

												It's been touted by some as what you actually wanted from Diablo 3. After playing it, I'm kind of inclined to agree. Active skills are attached to gems which you can socket/unsocket from gear at will, which can force decisions between skills and better stats when your new piece of gear doesn't have the right slots. There are passive skills awarded upon each level up that look a lot like the FFX sphere grid. It's possible to build almost any way you want using this, but each class has passive skills which you're meant to specialize in (i.e. are easier to access). Microtransactions exist, of course, but have no real impact on the game, unless you count extended stash space. Also, has perhaps the most unique health potion system I've seen which I'd like to see done elsewhere. Your potions have X charges and use a set amount of charges per use of the potion. These charges replenish as you kill enemies. Furthermore, these potions are stored in their own separate inventory.Basically, if you're interested in this style of game and have the hard drive space, there's not much reason to not AT LEAST try it out. Afterall, if you don't like it, you're out nothing but your own time. Only complaint at the moment is that like Diablo 3, it is online only, which means the servers aren't local and it's possible to run into bits of lag here and there, even with fairly good internet speeds.

												This game is awesome.I played Diablo II religiously for a little over a decade (a few breaks here and there..) but I had to quit after bots just COMPLETELY INFESTED Battlenet. I bought Diablo III and wish I didn't spend $60 on it ...I will never play it again. I thought my days of playing Action RPGs were over ......until I found Path Of Exile. Its like the ......spiritual successor to Diablo2 but with enough twists and a few drastic differences (THE SKILL TREE) to keep me hooked. The icing on the cake is that this game is FREE. LOVE IT.Regardless, I highly recommend this game if you are into ARPGs, like Torchlight..or if you are a fan of classic Diablo games. It takes a little bit of time to get used to how the ""currency""/skill tree/item socket systems work but once you get the hang of it ...you'll see the genius behind it. I just dont have enough time to play this game ...or any of my games for that matter D:9/10			"

												Do you like action RPGS like Diablo 2, Torchlight, and Titan Quest? Yes? Then look no futher than Path of Exile.  This game is free to play in every sense of the word.  All money you can potentially spend is on cosmetics and such.  If you like it, it is worth supporting them as they have made an enjoyable game that never hounds you to spend money.  One playthrough will take around 20-25 hours, but you will likey want to go back and choose a new character to play with.The biggest difference with this game as opposed to other action RPGS is that the skill you have are tied to gems that you pick up and then slot into armor/weapons.  These gems level up by you using them.  You can unslot them and then reslot other gems as you see fit (they maintain their levels).  This allows you to really experiment with builds while not being restricted to specific skills or armor.Just give it a go. You will like it!			"

												What do you get when you cross-breed Final Fantasy VII's materia system with Diablo 2? You get Path of Exile, a game which demands a great deal of theorycrafting and immense build diversity the likes of which you will never see in many ARPGs.Pros:+ Free to play+ No pay-to-win, all microtransactions are aesthetic.+ Vast build diversity+ All skills are available to use by any class+ Helpful, active community+ New take on currency and how it affects trading+ Massive, comprehensive skill tree.+ (Personal interest) Competant summoning and minion featuresCons:- Always online- Trade chat is poorly implemented- Game has terrible problems with desync- Standard league economy is horribly inflated- Not for casual gaming, requires a great deal of time and effort to get to the real fun parts of the gamePros explained:The first thing that attracted me to this game the most was the summoning system. Diablo 2 had spoiled me rotten with the necromancer, nothing was more fun for me than running around with a large army of skeletons at my back, ready to charge forward to engage the enemy. Not many ARPGs can pull off a good summoning mechanic, but when they do, its always amazing. Path of Exile not only lets you raise hordes of zombies that fight until they die, but also allows you to summon skeletons that offer support and come in larger numbers. The best part of summoning, however, comes in the form of raising spectres. Imagine fighting a monster that is very proficient at wiping out your minions, and then turning that monster into your own minion to fight for you! And there's more, from summoning flaming skulls that bypass enemies and small obstacles to animating weapons to animating a full-blown suit of armor!The next big feature I loved about this game is how they handle currency. Most games just give you basic currency like gold which you use to buy or sell things. Not in this game! Currency comes in the form of special orbs which also provide useful functions. One orb can be used to give you respecs to your passive tree for example, another can be used to turn a mundane (white) item into a rare quality item. There's lots of orbs and each orb is valued differently between each other based on rarity on usefulness. If you can find the 'mirror of kalandra', you've officially become a rich player, but good luck finding it!There are no direct skills to speak of when leveling up, but they are passive improvements. When it comes to Path of Exile, it doesn't give you a skill tree, it gives you a passive skill jungle! Those who have played Final Fantasy X will know what I'm talking about. The passive skill tree is what allows for such an amazing build diversity. Its very complicating for new players, but thankfully the forum has many build guides you can use to teach you how to build yourself. I highly recommend you try and make your own build first to understand the passive skill tree before reading a build guide.Ah, but the greatest feature of all about this game lies in the actual skills themselves. This game offers a myriad of abilities that are accessible to every player, so long as they can meet the stat requirements for them. Want to throw a fireball? Sure. How about raining fire on the enemy? Why not! Want to throw a spectral copy of your weapon at an enemy and watch it fly back to you? You can get it. The fun doesn't stop there, no. You can also augment your abilities with support gems to make them more powerful! Want to shoot more fireballs at once, or to make them split on impact? There's support gems for that! Want your arrows to bounce between multiple enemies or pierce right through them? That's possible. Want your melee attacks to attack multiple times in one cast, or to make your melee do AoE damage? You can do that. There's infinite possibilities when using skills, you just need to know what works best!Cons explained:However, this game does have some downsides you will have to deal with. The first and perhaps biggest issue this game suffers from is desync. For those who don't know what desync is, the simplest way to describe it is that the client isn't in sync with the server. For instance, you're trying to escape from some enemies in a hall and while you think you have escaped, you're still taking damage and when you die, you wind up back where the enemies were. Rubberbanding is the best way to describe desync and you will be experiencing this a lot. If you play on the hardcore leagues, its IMPORTANT that you play carefully and utilize the '/oos' command in chat to resync.This game is also not friendly to the more casual of gamers. Between build diversity, a complicated skill tree and a heavily inflated economy in the parent standard and hardcore leagues, this game demands a great deal of time and effort be invest before the game gets any fun. If you're not prepared to really sink your teeth into this game and hang on for dear life, you might want to consider playing something else.But hey, this game is free. Free, and without pay-to-win microtransactions. There are microtransactions in this game, but they are all cosmetic and designed purely to make your character stand out from the rest. There are also pets you can buy as a microtransaction, but they are also purely for visual appeal and will not give you an advantage to combat. You will never have to worry about other players buying their way to greatness, everyone is on even ground here!I really suggest you give this game a try, especially if you were a fan of Diablo 2!Helpful resources:http://www.poe.xyz.isThis site is great if you're looking to find an item in the game that you need.

												Path of Exile is everything we've come to expect from decades of ARPG progress. Near infinite character customization. A deep and rewarding loot & crafting system. A bleak and oppresive atmosphere. All toped off with fantastic support and community interaction from developers GGG. I simply can't reccomend this game highly enough.			"

												What do you get when you cross-breed Final Fantasy VII's materia system with Diablo 2? You get Path of Exile, a game which demands a great deal of theorycrafting and immense build diversity the likes of which you will never see in many ARPGs.Pros:+ Free to play+ No pay-to-win, all microtransactions are aesthetic.+ Vast build diversity+ All skills are available to use by any class+ Helpful, active community+ New take on currency and how it affects trading+ Massive, comprehensive skill tree.+ (Personal interest) Competant summoning and minion featuresCons:- Always online- Trade chat is poorly implemented- Game has terrible problems with desync- Standard league economy is horribly inflated- Not for casual gaming, requires a great deal of time and effort to get to the real fun parts of the gamePros explained:The first thing that attracted me to this game the most was the summoning system. Diablo 2 had spoiled me rotten with the necromancer, nothing was more fun for me than running around with a large army of skeletons at my back, ready to charge forward to engage the enemy. Not many ARPGs can pull off a good summoning mechanic, but when they do, its always amazing. Path of Exile not only lets you raise hordes of zombies that fight until they die, but also allows you to summon skeletons that offer support and come in larger numbers. The best part of summoning, however, comes in the form of raising spectres. Imagine fighting a monster that is very proficient at wiping out your minions, and then turning that monster into your own minion to fight for you! And there's more, from summoning flaming skulls that bypass enemies and small obstacles to animating weapons to animating a full-blown suit of armor!The next big feature I loved about this game is how they handle currency.

												My game of choice when it comes to the top-down action RPG genre!It acts like a true spiritual successor to Diablo 2, when I started playing I was so pleased at how the game handled and looked. It's gritty and grimey and it feels like a slog through the legions of hell.Where the game really shines is the character creation and theorycraft aspects. You can spend a good hour or so deciding what kind of build you want and what sort of weapons and attacks you're going to use before even clicking that create a new character button. Thinking about how your passive stats and combination of attacks are all going to synergise with each other is all part of the fun. And yet if you don't want to do that it's fairly obvious where to go and what to get to make a successful build anyway (after a bit of practice)Highly recommended if you're a fan of the Diablo games, and even with the whole PoE vs D3 e-war I'd still try both and see what suits you, they are inherently different games. (this one is a whole lot cheaper though)			"

												A Diablo style game that seems to have made a ton of fun design decisions. I vote it best in class. There are many game varieties and I recommend that everyone race as often as you can (it's a game!). The achievements are challenging. No matter which level you are playing, something great could drop at any moment. A TON of character build variety. You can find a basic item and turn it into an incredibly better item with innovative game currency (and relatively cheaply). Easy to group when you are in the mood. The game is frequently updated and the developers are active in the community. Truly Free to Play. Support is responsive.The in-game armor and weapon visual effects that you can buy are more expensive than I would like (30ish dollars US in some cases).update: I deleted the bit about lag being a problem. If you have good internet then the newly added lock-step improvements make the gameplay super smooth and responsive. So many great changes with the recenly released version 2.0 (The Awakening). One of the few companies that is continually giving the community what they request.			"

												(I am not native English speaker, but i will do my best)Would you like this game? If you dont like ARPG genre, then this will be waste of your time. But if you like slaying tons of monsters in order to get loot. If you are happy as a little child, when you find, or craft a good item. If you like sorting items, perfecting your character, preciselly craft him as a diamond (Your character once ugly stone, can became after signifficant effort a ""diamond"") When you dont mind spending lot of your time theorycrafting, then you can pick Path of Exile.Here, i just sumarize good and bad things about it, I played game since Open Beta and i have played more than 300 hours (outside of Steam)If you dont like reading, here is summary: Its a great game, but YOU need to come to it, game does not came to you easily (and you can also play with your friends, or established guild)Cons-Server lag, desync: This is bane of Path of Exile, but you need to build around it, or just have it in mind when playing. -No direct lore: You need to find lore and piece of story in game. But killing is more fun than reading text, there should be at least few cutscenes-Not friendly to new players, or newbies to this genre: Builds can really shine end or lategame, but player can be bored, and definitelly will be if he/she is unaware of this fact. I will personally add some stage, when game will give you endgame character to play with,for few minutes. Maybe in some intro part, before you find yourself lying in water, stranded on a beach.-Trading: Hard to get into, there is allready community made player shop indexers, but this feature shoud be integrated.-PVP: Well, it is hard to balance it.Pros-Sheer size of possibilities-Skill gem system: Passive tree is huge, but its not that complicated at all, but combining active skills and support skills into various combination is thing, that i like the most-Fair f2p system: Ok, stash tabs can be considered as pay2win element, but you can make new characters and store your loot  in their inventories.-Frequent patches and temporary leagues: Its good, that devs want to cooperate with community, and keep their game fresh.-End game: End game map system.

												Path of Exile is undoubtedly one of the best free-to-play titles in recent years. If you're a fan of eerie & spine chilling, fantasy hack 'n' slash games where fighting huge mobs of ghastly creatures and ominous soldiers are the norm, Path of Exile is for you. As many have said already, this game has a very similar feel to the Diablo series and takes a large amount of influence from it (i.e. how the game is set into Acts and once you have completed them you can move onto harder difficulties), but also adds something of it's own into the mix such as having no currency in the game. Path of Exile is what Diablo 3 should have been and totally takes the cake between the two. The amount of content in the game is astounding and sometimes I can't believe that this game is free-to-play. Of course, you have your proverbial microtransactions but unlike other games, Path of Exile offers mostly non-competitive items for sale such as more character slots and guild options. Player vs. Player is another great element to the game and from what I have seen it contains 1 vs 1, 3 vs 3 and 6 vs 6 arenas though the matchmaking is a bit buggy when joining a queue. So, if you are looking for an overly addicting, loot driven, online hack 'n' slash game with tons of gore and brutality, download this game now! You won't regret it!			"

												One of the best free games out there. It's a Point and click style online Action RPG right up there with Diablo - and unlike Diablo III it isn't a sell out: no pay to win.It has the largest (and yet very well balenced) skill tree you're likely to ever see and is generally quite flashed out.It takes many interesting new approaches to alot of things that are generally kept unchanged across the genre - like a deep barter system instead of the usual coin and flasks that refill as you kill mobs instead of having to craete new potions every few minutes.The makers are a ""small independent team of hardcore gamers based in New Zealand"" and they ""created Path of Exile as the game that we'd want to play ourselves.""And it really does play like that - a game a gamer would want to play, and not one that some AAA company decides that they should.I can only say: give it a try, you'll be hooked - it's free anyways.9.5/10			"

												If you like ARPGs and loved Diablo 2, but didn't like Torchlight, then this would definitely satisfy your need for a D2 style game. All active skills are based on resocketable gems, making you're character build your own, and the passive talent system is very reminscent of the sphere grid/tree/maze in FFX, which gives you even more lattitude in determining how you want to create your character over the long run.Some downsides:- Online only. This will cause you to have desync issues so you'll get some moments where you or monsters will teleport.- Bit of a learning curve. You'll need to check a wiki to see how to get the most out of the merchants and how to use support gems).- No character customization for appearance.You really have nothing to lose by playing this game, so give it a few hours and get a feel for it.

												Everything that Diablo in the modern age should be.  It's a great combination of a very massive skill development tree, hack 'n' slash gameplay, a non-gold currency system and it hints at Final Fantasy 7 with gems similar or almost exactly like Materia.I've already logged several hours and I know i'll be logging much more in the coming months.  It's a good game AND FREE!(Microtransactions don't influence the gameplay and are mostly graphical and allow more space to stash items)			"

												Path of Exile is worthy of any action-RPG's fan's attention - especially since the game is free.  If one wishes to support the game developers, money can be spent for cosmetic changes and to increase your stash size, but neither are required to play the game.While the passive skill tree is enormous, it does require a bit of thought and planning to be utilized effectively.  Active skills are socketed to items, allowing unique combinations and a large amount of variety to gameplay (although, some options are far more effective than others).  Skills are leveled through experience that your character gains as they are socketed in an equipped item.Disadvantages...two in my experience: descynchronization from the required servers, even with ample internet capability; the targeting system is frustrating for melee type characters.  Both are irritating and exacerbate each other, often leading to character deaths.  As with Diablo 3 (the only other ARPG game that I have played with a server connection requirement), this has kept me from playing hardcore characters.  It's a shame, because I enjoy the challenge.Overall, I will wholeheartedly recommend the game, despite the above-mentioned flaws.  The developer seems committed and responsive to the fans / supporters, which is a nice bonus and will hopefully ensure future changes which allow for better, more reliable gameplay.  Additionally, the amount of variety and different gameplay options (races, ladder servers, etc.) should keep long term players' attention.			"

												I thought this game deserved a further review considering the hours I tanked into it recently.(My original review is still at the bottom)Path of Exile is amazing, comparing it to diablo dosen't do it any justice, it's an ARPG and borrows some fundementals set by the old style games, but gives you so much more to work with. When you start the game you choose a class (starting place on the talent tree) and you are dumped on a beach, and you go from there. What skills you use, what gear you wear, however you want to roleplay is upto the player.\PoE has near infinite hours of replayability, new builds, challenge leagues, races and PVP, freedom is the name of the game. It's open.If you like the sound of creating a build from the huge range of options or like deleting hoards of goatmen, or want to spend all day trading, or want to measure your e-peen on one of the ladders. PoE has something that'll hook you.GGG, to me, seem like one of the best games developers I've seen, and they do a tremendous job bringing new content to the player-base... for free! Microtransactions are free, there are no pay-to-win features at all, cosmetics and storage space are most of what you can find. It's refreshing to see microtransations not being shoved down your throat, they are expensive enough that they are not all that common, but still affordable, while making the game profitable for GGG.=======================================================================I dont use the steam client because the official one is more my style. (Thats why it says I only have 11 hours)Great ARPG. So many ways to play this game. Can't recommend it enough if you are looking for a timekiller that dosent require too much effort.It's also has a very fair free-to-play model, based off buying storage space, character slots and cosmetics, all the people complaining about having to get more storage etc, should take a look at how much goes into this game, and consider the price-tag.

												This is the game Diablo 3 should have been.  If you enjoyed the Diablo series, or are even curious about playing an Action Role-Playing Game (ARPG), definitely give this a try.It's Free to Play, and don't let that dissuade you as some cheesy pay-to-win or trial scenario.  You can absolutely experience the full game without paying a cent.  When I first started playing in the Beta, though, I definitely saw the value here and gave them some money (for some cool cosmetic and account-based benefits), and you probably will want to, as well!Grinding Gear Games does a great job supporting the game.  Nearly every week there is a new patch or update.This is without a doubt my favorite game release of 2013.  What have you got to lose?  Try it!			"

												As a Beta backer, I'm very happy with what GGG have done with this game over the years, Well polished and a really great replacement for Diablo 2. When you start, it can be a bit daunting to look at that huge passive tree before you, but after a time it becomes easier and easier to travel around the tree. Look at guides online, it's completely fine too, see what you can do to tweek it, your first build will always be horrible if you do not get help, but when you do make that one magical build that destroys everything it's extremely rewarding.The Currency in this game is what made me play it for so long, it's so complex but at the same time simple. The haggle game is real and it's so ALIVE, always moving, don't believe that one guy with the fixed prices because this game is ALL about Supply and Demand.This game has no pants, does not matter, you still look like the dog's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ towards the endgame with full bodied armour huggin dem thighs tight.Need more Help? Visit Path of Exiles forums, it's full of info. And use poe.xyz to buy stuff. it's a time saver. ;)Addictive!9/10 Corrupted Tabula Rasas!			"

												TL;DR sum-up of PoE:  FTP Diablo 2.PoE is a FTP Diablo 2 knock off and I mean that in the most lovingly way possible.  Honestly, I'm surprised Blizzard hasn't gone after their asses.  From the character choices, graphics, minions (goat-men!!), hell, even the music, anyone who has played D2 will know immediately what I'm talking about. I, like many others, was crushed by what D3 turned into.  Looking for what D3 should have been?  Here's your answer.Is it really FTP?  yes.  The only, and I mean ONLY, things you can buy are cosmetic enhancements. Yay, glowing swords....Did I tell you there are almost daily competitions and races?  Well there are.  Examples:    Who can run the fastest through the game only using melee?  Oh you're a witch?  Well, better get swinging!    Unique dungeon crawls where you can't go home and fix your boo-boos or buy better equipment.  Use what you find, son!And don't worry, the playing field is leveled for this:  to do a race you must start with a brand new character.  Only your wits will help you prevail!  ...And lucky loot drops.I recommend this game, and for those nostalgic for D2; the first goat-bleat will warm your soul.  Happy left-button smashing!			"

												Great Game, probably the best game i played so far.I don't usually enjoy games that use instances, but the construction and the plot of the game is just amazing.Standart D3 graphics and gameplay. But what got me going when playing the game was the plot of the game.The quests are refreshing and chalenging and the map system is amazing.The skill tree is just over the top, complex but simple at the same time. Giving that u have big nodes that u aim for, but still have lots of ways u can get there, therefor, u have a lot of build diversification.Another thing that got me going was the irl money shop. The mtx's are incredible and extremelly well done, although the price is quite high its a great way to make a non P2W game.I give the game a solid 10/10 and recommend the game to people that like grinding type games.

												Path of Exile is the most faithful successor to Diablo 2 that you'll find, including Diablo 3. While D3 took the approach of World of Warcraft's evolution, focusing on becoming more streamlined and more accessible than its predecessor, Path of Exile leans in the opposite direction. It's difficult, it's technical, and it's awesome. Truly, if feels as if everything that Diablo 3 did wrong, Path of Exile does right.The one area that PoE really diverges from the classic Diablo formula is in the active skill system. Active skills are granted by gem items. Skill gems gain experience and level up independantly of your character, and by combining active skill gems with ""support gems"" in equipment with appropriately-linked sockets, the combinations are vast.And that's what's really great about this game. The enormous scope of build variety and character customization. PoE's passive skill tree has hundreds and hundreds of nodes, and over the course of your character's career you'll have over 100 passive skill points to allocate in any direction and combination you see fit. Want to build a huge, muscle-bound Marauder that casts spells and holds wands? Want to create a Witch or Ranger that uses a Cyclone melee attack with a two-handed axe? Go for it. If you enjoy theorycrafting, you're bound to love this game.It's the most technical hack-and-slash ARPG out there, and likely the most unforgiving. The path to 100 is a long, long road, and once you're on the second and third difficulties you'll start losing experience with each death. It might get frustrating, but this is not a bad thing. The challenge and longevity this game presents is a breath of fresh air.And, somehow, the game is entirely free. There is -zero- ""pay to win"" here. You can buy extra stash tabs (though it's not at all necessary, they start you with four for free), but all the rest of the offered microtransactions are for purely cosmetic items. There is no way to get any sort of in-game boost or mechanical advantage by spending money.As a huge fan of the genre, PoE really feels like the most compelling offering as of right now.			"

												Amazing high-quality action RPG with stellar graphics and a very dark and realistic artistic style. A major upgrade from the cookie cutter action RPGs on the market now... and this one is FREE.How Grinding Gear Games can release such a big-budget-production level game for free is a complete mystery to me. But I would gladly pay $20-$30 for such a robust and replayable game. The use of gems as skills and spells, combined with the unique barter system instead of gold, make this a completely different kind of RPG than has come before. And if you are a Christian (I am), then may I also point out that the primary religion in the game is based on one single ""God"" and you are often told that ""God has a plan for you."" Maybe that's not a big deal to some, but to those of us who get annoyed at how religion is portrayed in some games, this is a huge selling point.But regardless, this is not a game to miss ESPECIALLY since it's free. Go install now and you will see what I mean!			"

												I love this little game. It brings much to the genre and really rewards the player. It lacks an Epic feel to most encounters that Diablo 3 delivers and the story is rather poor and cliched. But it plays well and the skill tree is very impressive indeed. Value for money is off the scale.. Get it			"

												Path of Exile is a complex and engaging free to play action RPG set in the grim world of Wraeclast. The atmosphere is very dark and interesting. Players slowly uncover the secrets behind their exile and Wraeclast. The lore is scattered throughout the game world and really adds to the immersion.The passive tree is absolutely massive and extremely diverse, allowing for almost any playstyle imaginable. Skills can be augmented with ""Support Gems"" to significantly modify what they do and to create some truly outrageous combinations. The amazing unique items in the game only add to the already overwhelming amount of character customization. The result is a theorycrafter's wet dream. Another major feature is that there is no ""gold"" as a form of currency. Instead there are numerous items of varying rarity that modify almost every aspect of items you find. These currency items allow players to custom tailor their gear while simultaneously combating inflation of the economy since they are consumed on use.The game also features ""Races"", which are timed competitve events ranging from a few minutes to a couple hours. Races can have many additional features and restrictions to make them more fun and challenging. Some races are designed to be almost an entire different game mode than the base game. Races are separated by Seasons, allowing players to earn points and win limited time alternate art unique items.On top of all this, Grinding Gear Games is one of the most communicative developers I have ever experienced. They are very active in the community and take all suggestions and feedback seriously. Lastly, the game features a completely non pay to win microtransaction model. All game content is available right from the start. Real money will only buy you cosmetic effects to make your character look awesome and a few account features for convenience. I highly recommend trying out Path of Exile if you have even the slightest bit of interest in the genre.			"

												This game is the true spiritual successor to Diablo II. It has amazing complexity, and though it's not flawless, it's a great gameplay experience. If you want to use 2H axe as a ranger, go for it. If you want to shoot bows with a massive hulking marauder, do it. The game lets you play the way you want to play, but with some limitations that make the builds challenging and unique.The economy is also done properly, with no gold, but with usable currency that are used for item modification. Keeps the economy in check and you don't end up with a stock pile of gold that has no real use other than Auction House and the like. 5/5. Simply awesome.			"

												TL:DR – A fun, free, online, click, click, click RPG that’s light on story with enough things to do that will keep all but the most hardcore player interested (for a bit, at least).I’ll just start with the greatest selling point of Path of Exile—no selling point. Free helps as most of the flaws don’t seem quite so harsh at that price. You’ll click on wave after wave of bad guy as you roll the loot piñata dice in hopes that this time the Staff of Iwin drops. Path of Exile is a fun little game that you’ll find yourself loading up from time to time to kill a couple of waves of bad guys before your wrist starts to hurt. 7/10.The Good—Free: Only costs bandwidth and time to download.Characters: Lots of character classes.Items: Lots of stuffs with skills being placed on gem drops to make the game different. Grinding: Now with 10% less hamster wheel.Online Community: Friends need only apply. Leagues: Lots of different events and contests for frequent players.Updates: Fairly often with new expansions and drastic changes to gameplay to keep the game interesting.The Bad—Repetitive: You better like killing snakes in the forest zone, because you’ll do lots of it.Graphics: Not bad, but worse than the competition. Much worse.Online: People who are not your friend will annoy you. Greatly.In Game Purchases: Currently, this isn’t bad but things could easily be changed to bad and make the game not worth running.

												POE is like no other dungeon crawler I've ever played. The passive tree and skill gems are such unique character building mechanics that they became my favorite part of the game. The currency system has been excellently designed too; each unit of value is not only  valuable because it is money but because currency itself is expendable for varying magical effects on your items, transportation etc. The graphics are beautiful and controls are easy to pick up/remappable.  Some monsters, especially dungeon bosses can be very challenging (not to mention on higher difficulties - Cruel, Merciless) and take multiple tries to beat. The game lets you spawn back into the dungeon with damage you've already dealt persisting on the bosses so eventually you can brute force it if that's what you want to do, unless you are on Hardcore, in which case - Permadeath. Home building is mainly a neat distraction and hub for the Masters you can use to more easily craft powerful gear. My only complaint is that progressing through the whole life of a character to the end game requires that you do the same quest/storyline several times in a sort of new game plus style. The storyline is not bad by any means, in fact the world lore and theme is pretty cool but it can start to get repetitive. One of the best things about it, I've never spent a single dime and I get the same gameplay that anyone else who spends money on it does, because the majority of purchases available, other than more stash room (not necessary they give you plenty) are cosmetic only.Highly highly recommend to anyone who enjoys dungeon crawlers, and to anyone who hasn't tried one before, why not give it a shot? Free-2-Play after all.			"

												I was surprised that I did not have a review written for PoE, I have 2300+ hours played on the game. Let me preface this review by stating that if you know anything about the ARPG genre then you are probably already playing this game, but if you don't this review is for you. With all my experience I hope I can help you make the decision if this is the right game for you. So without further delay lets jump right in.The pros:- This game has a lot of content, more than most free to play games I have played. The developers actively and in a timely manner release new content, items and game mechanics on a 2~3 month cycle. They diligently pay attention to the continued existance of their game, I respect them for that.- The game is hard, especially for a new player. Don' listen to people who write in their reviews that the game has lost all challenge, these are usually people with thousands of hours played using the most expensive builds in the game to trivialize content like those builds are meant to. In this experience you can really fine tune how challenging the game is if you are after that.- The game has a very deep level of customization for builds, you can pick it up and play it no matter what you build, but don't expect your first build to carry you far. This game is most of all a learning experience, knowledge here really is power.- The visual design and music score are great, they really work to bring the world to life. There is plenty of lore hidden in item descriptions and places around the world. You can also build your own hideout from different items that the master NPCs in the game offer if you are into that like me.- This game is truly free, no content is held behind a pay wall. Crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥I know, but don't expect it to be given to you on a silver platter. However, no matter what you do every moment you sink into the game is worthwhile, everything you pick up no matter how incrementally leads to you reaching your goals. That is something that I can not say for most the experiences on the market.The cons:- The game is hard and unforgiving. You will die to random things while playing and have to piece back together what you did wrong if you don't want to die again. Do not get discouraged, it happens to literally everyone.- Trading is an essential skill you need to learn to get ahead in the game, but the trading community is very toxic. People trying to make a profit constantly prey on new players so learn how to use poe.trade and check it to make purchases and sales. Know what something is worth before you sell or buy.- The learning curve is steep, but there are plenty of resources to prepare you for it. You tube guides, the game forums and the amazing wiki have everything you could ever need to get started. Do not ask people in game to explain a nebulous concept to you, most of the game mechanics require several paragraphs to explain, use those other resources and feel free to ask specific questions about what you want to know.- The gap between the rich players and the poor players is truly vast, bridging it is impossible without a lot of effort. You can't pay to win and if you do to one of the illegal bots expect to get banned, the developers stay on top of that.In my opinion this is the best ARPG on the market and it keeps evolving to stay that way. I enjoy playing and supporting a game made by people who convey a level of professionalism one expects from people running a business and not just working on their game ""hobby"".			"

												10/10This is the diablo-like with the most depth and design complexity I've ever played. There's so much character development possibilities, the game is amazing at giving tools to create the most crazy and ambitious builds and to make it incredibly rewarding. From the gigantic passive tree, to the crazy combination of gems you can make or how certain unique items completely change how some skill works... It's so amazing at letting you be creative and come up with ways to grow your character! And then the world of wreaclast is just amazing to explore, lots of lore and a very grim and dark setting reminding of the best parts of diablo 1. The soundtrack is incredible as well.Hand down my favorite diablo like and one of my fave games of all time, and it's truly free (money only gives cosmetics and inventory management help). The few cons - you cant turn the camera, meaning its best to attack enemies from the south when you're a long range hero. -Self Founds will have a hard time progressing in the end game.- Act 2 is unfortunately pretty boring compared to the rest of the game.

A lot of freedom and thinking over.A lot of consideration on the skill's and gears.Unique valuta system keeping inflation in check compared to a game like diablo.this is a in my opinion a Treuly Free to play game. All content is free and your level up system is not nerfed or requiring you to buy XP boosts. its not even available :)Game is being maintanced and updated in a good pace.There is place for both casual and hardcore players, enough competition events that can get you intresting loot.The only con i can tink off is that it will cost your time..

												Although I'm no huge fan of hack'n'slash RPGs, PoE was the first game of this genre since long ago (since D2 I bet) which managed to keep me playing for longer than just a few hours. Sure, I played D3 through but rather forcing myself than with relish, and I absolutely agree with the opinion that PoE is a way better match for the Diablo franchise than D3 itself. At least, it features the right look & feel, proper dark atmoshere, tons of customizable loot, much more interesting character development, and last but not least - appropriate size and length. And on top of all that it's completely free! ""Free to play"" but not ""pay to win"", so you can enjoy it to the full without spending a single cent.The downsides? Yeah, they exist too, but I'd describe them to be minor and inessential. Permanent connection to the server in a single-player game (but that's commonplace nowadays), somewhat bad placement of waypoints across locations which eventually forces you to replay certain (quite large) locations twice or even more times, rather sophisticated skill tree (not necessarily a bad thing). But the rich core gameplay pays it all off, I must say.In any case, I strongly recommend this brilliant game to all RPG fans and to anyone who loves good games no matter what genre they are. Despite some minor flaws, it is fully capable to carry you off the reality for some considerable time and give you bright and memorable experiences.			"

I bought Diablo III and wish I didn't spend $60 on it ...I will never play it again. I thought my days of playing Action RPGs were over ......until I found Path Of Exile. Its like the ......spiritual successor to Diablo2 but with enough twists and a few drastic differences (THE SKILL TREE) to keep me hooked. The icing on the cake is that this game is FREE. LOVE IT.Regardless, I highly recommend this game if you are into ARPGs, like Torchlight..or if you are a fan of classic Diablo games. It takes a little bit of time to get used to how the ""currency""/skill tree/item socket systems work but once you get the hang of it ...you'll see the genius behind it. I just dont have enough time to play this game ...or any of my games for that matter D:9/10			"

												I am old as dirt, have played this game 4k+ hrs. It still fells new with every new char, every new challenge league. Our guild now has 28 members, spread over the whole world (of which I am the humble leader). Play it with friends, new or old, preferably over Skype or Teamspeak.Join a guild if your old friends don't get it, or make your own guild and invite people you find nice in the game.  The community is mostly very nice. Immature (not young-age has nothing to do with it) or cocky players tend to quit, cause the learning treshold is quite high. Be nice ingame, and you will get all the help you need. Global chat can be a way to meet other players (or get trolled if you are unlucky), or just throw in some questions if you trade.To summarise: PoE is a game that never gets old. Frustrating as hell sometimes, for sure, but never boring.			"

												After not enjoying the Closed Beta and early Open Beta (after climbing to level 36, and 29 in each) I decided that the game was sluggish and ""Not For Me"" while admiring the dark Diablo 1 and Diablo 2 style Art Design and attempted feel, along with the best ARPG graphic engine and shadows to be displayed in a ARPG title yet.Luckily GGC has been able to pull off an amazing development cycle since that point, I read up on it finally being released after 7 years &decided to give it another shot! I am glad I did, as all issues I had with the game are not only fixed, but changed in a way that feels perfect in all aspects - I do not see any area that they could have improved on further from the point I started playing at to the release; with that in mind some of these aspeccts and more will be altered further making the title even better. After only 22 levels as a Shadow going for a unique twist on the Dual Spike Armor/HP/Regen/HealthMana Leeching builds out there (I allocated 75 points that I thought seemed perfect; 85  ""In case I grind that much out"" 100 as ""Pipe Dream Build"" The developers stated that Magic The Gathering was the main inspiration for the Skill Web allowing any class to ""Break the Rules"" tactically and come up with their own vision of a build that developers may not have assumed would ""Work"" as cited by GGC for MTG how endless players such as I made decks in the standard rotation that nobody thought of doing as it seemed unconventional; every tournament and magic event I went to with my most recent deck right prior to Theros being released shook my hand even if I took the loss of the set stating ""Thats the most interesting"" or ""That is one of the most amazing decks I've seen"" ""or Played against"" - Nothing feels better than building ideas on your own with a vision of HOW it should be executed.PoE allows this My shadow is going to turn many heads and just as I ""Broke"" the way ""WoW's Burning Crusade"" end game worked (as stated by Mod on a Forum Post) by allocating a skill tree never displayed prior online (or until 3-4 months of using it, then I personally posted it so other Hunters could try it) along with a Mixture of PVP Arena Gear and Raid gear to keep the #1 DPS spot in Raids; while without switching abilities or gear be top of any battleground Leaderboard with (for example 24 Kills, 11 assists and 3 deaths.) - With that mindset...PoE allows you to not have to depend on just gear or just a build ; aside from the endless web of skills and attribute boosts that makes FFX look like Diablo 3 in ""Scope, Scale and Staggering Size"" The gems being socketed into gear that you alter with interconnecting slots to have multiple abilities chained with multiple support (such as three elements per Double Strike or Multi-strike with a Crit Damage Support Gem alongside the Double Strike (depending on how the sockets are connected)  New Players will feel at home but may need to check how the skill trees differentiate or do not differentiate each class. Along with how a Common item drop may end up being one of the most devestating pieces of gear you find depending on how you alter it after using an unhealthy amount of Armor or Weapon Quality Upgrades; which then allows the Gem Socket change gem to have higher % chance of adding more sockets (I was able to get a 5 socketed claw at level 22 due to this method upgraded to yellow; with stats that are mind blowing). It shows that the user is really in control.I cannot reccommend this game enough giving it an honest solid 9.1/10 *my rating scale is very very ""this game needs to be perfect to be perfect* as seeon my IGN profile reviews for each title I own. - I deducted .1 points due to a rather insane 9 dollars per card drop for steam cards or else it would be a 9.2; if it was 9 dollars to initiate all card drops the score would remain the same.That's a solid 9.1/10 PLAY IT. NOW.			"

												Path of Exile is worthy of any action-RPG's fan's attention - especially since the game is free.  If one wishes to support the game developers, money can be spent for cosmetic changes and to increase your stash size, but neither are required to play the game.While the passive skill tree is enormous, it does require a bit of thought and planning to be utilized effectively.  Active skills are socketed to items, allowing unique combinations and a large amount of variety to gameplay (although, some options are far more effective than others).  Skills are leveled through experience that your character gains as they are socketed in an equipped item.Disadvantages...two in my experience: descynchronization from the required servers, even with ample internet capability; the targeting system is frustrating for melee type characters.  Both are irritating and exacerbate each other, often leading to character deaths.  As with Diablo 3 (the only other ARPG game that I have played with a server connection requirement), this has kept me from playing hardcore characters.  It's a shame, because I enjoy the challenge.Overall, I will wholeheartedly recommend the game, despite the above-mentioned flaws.  The developer seems committed and responsive to the fans / supporters, which is a nice bonus and will hopefully ensure future changes which allow for better, more reliable gameplay.  Additionally, the amount of variety and different gameplay options (races, ladder servers, etc.) should keep long term players' attention.			"

												Path of Exile is undoubtedly one of the best free-to-play titles in recent years. If you're a fan of eerie & spine chilling, fantasy hack 'n' slash games where fighting huge mobs of ghastly creatures and ominous soldiers are the norm, Path of Exile is for you. As many have said already, this game has a very similar feel to the Diablo series and takes a large amount of influence from it (i.e. how the game is set into Acts and once you have completed them you can move onto harder difficulties), but also adds something of it's own into the mix such as having no currency in the game. Path of Exile is what Diablo 3 should have been and totally takes the cake between the two. The amount of content in the game is astounding and sometimes I can't believe that this game is free-to-play. Of course, you have your proverbial microtransactions but unlike other games, Path of Exile offers mostly non-competitive items for sale such as more character slots and guild options. Player vs. Player is another great element to the game and from what I have seen it contains 1 vs 1, 3 vs 3 and 6 vs 6 arenas though the matchmaking is a bit buggy when joining a queue. So, if you are looking for an overly addicting, loot driven, online hack 'n' slash game with tons of gore and brutality, download this game now! You won't regret it!			"

												I am old as dirt, have played this game 4k+ hrs. It still fells new with every new char, every new challenge league. Our guild now has 28 members, spread over the whole world (of which I am the humble leader). Play it with friends, new or old, preferably over Skype or Teamspeak.Join a guild if your old friends don't get it, or make your own guild and invite people you find nice in the game.  The community is mostly very nice. Immature (not young-age has nothing to do with it) or cocky players tend to quit, cause the learning treshold is quite high. Be nice ingame, and you will get all the help you need. Global chat can be a way to meet other players (or get trolled if you are unlucky), or just throw in some questions if you trade.To summarise: PoE is a game that never gets old. Frustrating as hell sometimes, for sure, but never boring.			"

												Up to Act 2, this game is really awesome. Even tho I'm not an hardcore fan of genre I still did like it. Hardness added as you progress is really amazing as well, every enemy has interesting mechanic that will make you think if you don't want to die. This also doesn't mind the levels. If your stats are bad or you try to rush in group of them, you will find yourself dying even if you are couple of levels above the enemy. That's amazing but even more awesome is talent tree that is realy huge. I don't know will I be able to reset those later (there is refund for couple) but I'm quite sure I wont make the best out of it in my first play through. Sure, there is room for some improvements that will make gameplay experience even better, but this game is really alright and it managed to leave good impression on me.			"

												A diablo clone that has done a good job of keeping all the goods things and avoiding all the bad things. You will still be excited to find rare items, but given a lot of flexibility to change them. THe skill tree is large, but likely only portions of the grid work for certain characters. There is some room to take back skill points and add them elsewhere. Gems and sockets are a nice touch on how they can be combined and work together. The game revolves partly around crafting, but its not clunky like many games make it.			"

												Do you like action RPGS like Diablo 2, Torchlight, and Titan Quest? Yes? Then look no futher than Path of Exile.  This game is free to play in every sense of the word.  All money you can potentially spend is on cosmetics and such.  If you like it, it is worth supporting them as they have made an enjoyable game that never hounds you to spend money.  One playthrough will take around 20-25 hours, but you will likey want to go back and choose a new character to play with.The biggest difference with this game as opposed to other action RPGS is that the skill you have are tied to gems that you pick up and then slot into armor/weapons.  These gems level up by you using them.  You can unslot them and then reslot other gems as you see fit (they maintain their levels).  This allows you to really experiment with builds while not being restricted to specific skills or armor.Just give it a go. You will like it!			"

												After not enjoying the Closed Beta and early Open Beta (after climbing to level 36, and 29 in each) I decided that the game was sluggish and ""Not For Me"" while admiring the dark Diablo 1 and Diablo 2 style Art Design and attempted feel, along with the best ARPG graphic engine and shadows to be displayed in a ARPG title yet.Luckily GGC has been able to pull off an amazing development cycle since that point, I read up on it finally being released after 7 years &decided to give it another shot! I am glad I did, as all issues I had with the game are not only fixed, but changed in a way that feels perfect in all aspects - I do not see any area that they could have improved on further from the point I started playing at to the release; with that in mind some of these aspeccts and more will be altered further making the title even better. After only 22 levels as a Shadow going for a unique twist on the Dual Spike Armor/HP/Regen/HealthMana Leeching builds out there (I allocated 75 points that I thought seemed perfect; 85  ""In case I grind that much out"" 100 as ""Pipe Dream Build"" The developers stated that Magic The Gathering was the main inspiration for the Skill Web allowing any class to ""Break the Rules"" tactically and come up with their own vision of a build that developers may not have assumed would ""Work"" as cited by GGC for MTG how endless players such as I made decks in the standard rotation that nobody thought of doing as it seemed unconventional; every tournament and magic event I went to with my most recent deck right prior to Theros being released shook my hand even if I took the loss of the set stating ""Thats the most interesting"" or ""That is one of the most amazing decks I've seen"" ""or Played against"" - Nothing feels better than building ideas on your own with a vision of HOW it should be executed.PoE allows this My shadow is going to turn many heads and just as I ""Broke"" the way ""WoW's Burning Crusade"" end game worked (as stated by Mod on a Forum Post) by allocating a skill tree never displayed prior online (or until 3-4 months of using it, then I personally posted it so other Hunters could try it) along with a Mixture of PVP Arena Gear and Raid gear to keep the #1 DPS spot in Raids; while without switching abilities or gear be top of any battleground Leaderboard with (for example 24 Kills, 11 assists and 3 deaths.) - With that mindset...PoE allows you to not have to depend on just gear or just a build ; aside from the endless web of skills and attribute boosts that makes FFX look like Diablo 3 in ""Scope, Scale and Staggering Size"" The gems being socketed into gear that you alter with interconnecting slots to have multiple abilities chained with multiple support (such as three elements per Double Strike or Multi-strike with a Crit Damage Support Gem alongside the Double Strike (depending on how the sockets are connected)  New Players will feel at home but may need to check how the skill trees differentiate or do not differentiate each class. Along with how a Common item drop may end up being one of the most devestating pieces of gear you find depending on how you alter it after using an unhealthy amount of Armor or Weapon Quality Upgrades; which then allows the Gem Socket change gem to have higher % chance of adding more sockets (I was able to get a 5 socketed claw at level 22 due to this method upgraded to yellow; with stats that are mind blowing). It shows that the user is really in control.I cannot reccommend this game enough giving it an honest solid 9.1/10 *my rating scale is very very ""this game needs to be perfect to be perfect* as seeon my IGN profile reviews for each title I own. - I deducted .1 points due to a rather insane 9 dollars per card drop for steam cards or else it would be a 9.2; if it was 9 dollars to initiate all card drops the score would remain the same.That's a solid 9.1/10 PLAY IT. NOW.			"

												The only ARPG that makes me continually come back for me. The fact that the skill tree resembles the FFX of old and encourages you to plan/think ahead is amazing. Combine that with an addictive end-game (if you ever get there on Hardcore), an open but fun crafting system and continual improvement & releases and you have a real winner!			"

												Easily the best game of the genre. Easily amongst the greatest F2P models. Easily the most deep and creative ways to build your character. Easily a must-play for everyone.Pros- FANTASTIC free to play model. You get the entire game right off the bat. There's really no 'except' or 'but' to this, you seriously just straight up get the entirety of the game. All the things you can spend $ on are things such as cosmetics for your character, pets, decorative set pieces for your hideout, and other petty stuff along those lines.- The game features perhaps the deepest way to create a character's build in video gaming history. You see, the game has a passives tree with over 1,000 nodes to invest in. The class you pick merely determines where in the tree you'll start. For example, The Duelist class starts on the bottom, where strength and dexterity meet.  Here is a picture [i.imgur.com] of the current passives tree. This massive tree combined with the strange way you mix skill gems with support gems to bend your spells to do exatecly what you want. For example, you can attach a fireball (skill gem) with Lesser Multiple Projectiles (a support gem). Now instead of 1 fireball, you now shoot 3. Or perhaps you want to summon a totem to shoot the fireballs for you? Or maybe your fireballs fork into two more fireballs when they hit an enemy. On top of that, ""unique"" items in the game can bend the normal rules for your character, to allow for even more creativity and possibilites present. - Three month leagues with special rules or permanent leagues. A multitude of various races to start a character at level 1 and reach the furthest in the game in a certain time under certain rules running every day. Softcore or hardcore. There's a lot of variety present in the game which is sure to find your niche.- Amazing developers deliver content on the regular. I took a break from the game (after about 1,200 hours) for 3 months and when I came back there were 14 new support gems, 7 new skills, a new master system, personal hideouts, and more bugfixes/quality of life changes than I cared to read in one session. Cons- *...cough...- JK, there is a learning curve. It may take you a few hours to get a real feel for the game. For people like me, that's actually a Pro, but may be a bit off putting to some.I give the game 10/10, and award it 'Best Indie Game', 'Best Crowdfunded Game', and 'Best ARPG'go play it u doofus			"

												This game is, in many ways, the true successor to Diablo II. That's not intended as a diss of D3 - plenty of fun to be had there. But Path of Exile takes the ground laid by D2 and extends it with a skill-crafting system that stands as one of the great accomplishments of the genre. The level of customization that is potentially open to a long-term player of PoE borders on the absurd, and we're not talking about cosmetics here. You craft your *abilities*, and if that notion strikes a chord with you, then you should get started playing this thing ASAP.It's far from perfect. PoE suffers from an unfriendly new-player experience, a looooong on-ramp to The Awesome, and constant trouble with lag spikes leading to player deaths (yes, the game is 100% server-driven). But these annoyances will not interfere with the genre afficianado being entranced by how thoroughly this game has shown what a bit of creativity and hard work can do for a well-established genre.

Yes, the whole game is free to play.  This makes me want to spend actual cash in the cash shop on vanity items.  Generosity of this kind should be rewarded!

												Amazing high-quality action RPG with stellar graphics and a very dark and realistic artistic style. A major upgrade from the cookie cutter action RPGs on the market now... and this one is FREE.How Grinding Gear Games can release such a big-budget-production level game for free is a complete mystery to me. But I would gladly pay $20-$30 for such a robust and replayable game. The use of gems as skills and spells, combined with the unique barter system instead of gold, make this a completely different kind of RPG than has come before. And if you are a Christian (I am), then may I also point out that the primary religion in the game is based on one single ""God"" and you are often told that ""God has a plan for you."" Maybe that's not a big deal to some, but to those of us who get annoyed at how religion is portrayed in some games, this is a huge selling point.But regardless, this is not a game to miss ESPECIALLY since it's free. Go install now and you will see what I mean!			"

												This game...Holy crap guys, let me tell you about its majesty.  Do you remember the days of Diablo 2?  The days where every choice from every level mattered.  Where each class had an amazing number of possibilities of gameplay?  Do you remember waiting a decade for Blizzard to make Diablo 3, only to be let down when the developers decided to do away with the part of the game you cared about the most: endless possibilities in decision making.  I sure do.  Enter Path of Exile.  This game takes character creation to the level of depth that you have always craved for.  7 character classes, ~1500 passive skills to choose, dozens of active skills to pick from with new ones being added periodically, and mini-expansion content every 4 months, well....its really a no-brainer.

I've run through the game once and not dropped a cent, even though I've been tempted with all of the things they've been adding.  The story is there, for those who want to find it, and all of the classes are suitably distinct from each other.  The skill tree is huge and all-encompasing, fully rewarding any play-style you prefer.I strongly recommend at least trying this game, it can't hurt, being free and all.			"

												This is one of the best games ever made, and when played on hardcore it is one of the most difficult, challenging and rewarding games of the modern era, a triumph over most games of this generation, and a callback to times when every player had to learn the game they were playing in order to succeed, rather than being catered to and handheld. Except this time you have an interactive community to help you along the way, as the game features trading, partying, player housing, and an 'interesting' global chat. And what a journey it will be, the atmosphere of this game feels like a blend of Dark Souls meets Diablo. Despite the graphics being pretty simple there's a ton of heart and fantastic art direction+flavour paving every step of the way. There's literally thousands upon thousands of ways to build your character. (Despite this 90%* of the community just plays CoC builds) *hyperboleThe best part? The game is free, aside from some purely aesthetic microtransactions which look very nice. No pay2win here. (Until you need more stash tabs i.e storage space) The community is one of the most diverse (for better & for worse) communities I've ever encountered, and the depth of this game is greater than most MMORPG's, despite this genre being an online ARPG. The difficulty scales to an absurd extent, you can never truly ""Faceroll"" every aspect of this game,(Unless you play CoC, in which case please uninstall--you're not a good player, stop uploading twinned boss map clear videos to Reddit, nobody cares--except for other CoC players) and there's just so much depth and replayable value to this game that I really can't recommend it enough. The endgame, on hardcore, is insanely fun and often times heartracing, with immense risk and reward being omnipresent throughout the experience. The more you play this game, the more you want to play it, and that is a surefire sign of both an addictive problem and a masterpiece. On the negative side of things, the early portion of this game is a total, unintuitive mess--if you're unfamiliar with the ARPG genre, or even if you're somewhat familiar with it, the game will likely feel far too overwhelming to bother with, it doesn't even bother trying to tutorialize you, and while the exploratory independence the game gives you is ultimately empowering, it's a little too vacuous for genuinely new players. Several of the game's mechanics & character features are amazingly in depth and customizable once you begin to grasp them, but unfortunately they also come off as very hard to understand initially, and even once you begin to understand them you'll likely fail to fully realize what you can do with them for quite some time. None of this is necessarily ""bad"", but it could certainly be offputting to a large demographic. The pace of the game is also painfully slow early on, this is especially true if you have no gear and if you're new to the game-most new players and even several veteran players don't know how to level efficiently, and waste a lot of excess time doing certain pointless side quests, picking up every useless item, killing every mob, doing irrelevant side areas, etc. Bluntly put, combat will not feel satisfying for a while, but when your build starts to come together and the enemies start to possess actually significant mechanics, boy oh boy does the world ever turn upside down. On top of that, the ""true"" game doesn't kick off until merciless difficulty, by which point you'll already have ""beaten the campaign"" twice, and this is presently very unintuitive to newer players, so a significant portion of the ""playerbase"" ends up ""beating"" the game (in their eyes) on normal and then never returning, even though the real experience hasn't even begun yet (Although regardless, at least these people get to experience the boss fight ""Malachai"", which is something you'll probably not soon forget). However, I'd still implore anyone who might turn away from the game because of these reasons to *just trudge through it* because, come merciless difficulty, come MAPS, it'll all prove to be deeply worth it. Once you get your first good unique item, once you 5 link or 6 link your first item, etc. etc., you'll have nowhere to go but up. That is, until your character dies and you angrily uninstall or reroll a CoC build. Screw CoC builds they're killing the game and trivializing the content, alright GGG you caught me this was all really an elaborate ruse with the actual intent of this review being nothing more than a rant about CoC builds. CoC builds are utterly faceroll and negate all strategic thought, difficulty, mechanics, and build variety involved in this game. Also nerf lightning coil and blade vortex. GOTY.			"

												For a  F2P game, I've felt absolutely no barries in playing Path of Exile.  I've run through the game once and not dropped a cent, even though I've been tempted with all of the things they've been adding.  The story is there, for those who want to find it, and all of the classes are suitably distinct from each other.  The skill tree is huge and all-encompasing, fully rewarding any play-style you prefer.I strongly recommend at least trying this game, it can't hurt, being free and all.			"

												Free to Play.   Anything you choose to buy for the most part is purely cosmetic stuff.   It is not a Pay to Win game.   It is very high quality, and much more enjoyable than Diablo 3 (I am not a fan), and is darker and grittier than Torchlight 1 or 2.   I've read reviews saying this game is like the spiritual successor to Diablo II.   I believe it hit much closer to the mark than Diablo III.   It is a great game with some interesting new mechanics for this type of game.  If you like Action RPGs I definitely recommend this game.			"

These gems level independently of your character, can be traded with others, and can be augmented with support gems to fundementally change how they operate. Creative use of these gems is essential; for example, linking a ""fireball"" gem with a ""lesser multiple projectiles"" gem to turn your single fireball into a flurry of firey damage.Developer interaction with the community is notably strong: Grinding Gear Games are open and engaged developers who listen to community feedback and evolve their game with players in mind. Content updates and patches are regular and significant, with new unique items being introduced at frequent intervals, along with new skill gems.

												Imagine they stripped the drawn out story and fluff pieces from a Diablo title and made it all about the dungeon crawl.  Spells and abilities in this game are customizable in many more creative ways than Diablo ever had to offer, and I feel like there are always unique things to try out and discover.As for the biggest selling point, I'm incredibly fond of the league system in place.  There are many temporary leagues that span from a few minutes to multiple months.  This means that you can always find a brand new environment to start playing in and not feel punished for being months behind other players like one continuous world would.With that said, I'd warn against picking this game up if you have a midterm or finals week approaching within the next month.

												TL:DR – A fun, free, online, click, click, click RPG that’s light on story with enough things to do that will keep all but the most hardcore player interested (for a bit, at least).I’ll just start with the greatest selling point of Path of Exile—no selling point. Free helps as most of the flaws don’t seem quite so harsh at that price. You’ll click on wave after wave of bad guy as you roll the loot piñata dice in hopes that this time the Staff of Iwin drops. Path of Exile is a fun little game that you’ll find yourself loading up from time to time to kill a couple of waves of bad guys before your wrist starts to hurt. 7/10.The Good—Free: Only costs bandwidth and time to download.Characters: Lots of character classes.Items: Lots of stuffs with skills being placed on gem drops to make the game different. Grinding: Now with 10% less hamster wheel.Online Community: Friends need only apply. Leagues: Lots of different events and contests for frequent players.Updates: Fairly often with new expansions and drastic changes to gameplay to keep the game interesting.The Bad—Repetitive: You better like killing snakes in the forest zone, because you’ll do lots of it.Graphics: Not bad, but worse than the competition. Much worse.Online: People who are not your friend will annoy you. Greatly.In Game Purchases: Currently, this isn’t bad but things could easily be changed to bad and make the game not worth running.

												It's been touted by some as what you actually wanted from Diablo 3. After playing it, I'm kind of inclined to agree. Active skills are attached to gems which you can socket/unsocket from gear at will, which can force decisions between skills and better stats when your new piece of gear doesn't have the right slots. There are passive skills awarded upon each level up that look a lot like the FFX sphere grid. It's possible to build almost any way you want using this, but each class has passive skills which you're meant to specialize in (i.e. are easier to access). Microtransactions exist, of course, but have no real impact on the game, unless you count extended stash space. Also, has perhaps the most unique health potion system I've seen which I'd like to see done elsewhere. Your potions have X charges and use a set amount of charges per use of the potion. These charges replenish as you kill enemies. Furthermore, these potions are stored in their own separate inventory.Basically, if you're interested in this style of game and have the hard drive space, there's not much reason to not AT LEAST try it out. Afterall, if you don't like it, you're out nothing but your own time. Only complaint at the moment is that like Diablo 3, it is online only, which means the servers aren't local and it's possible to run into bits of lag here and there, even with fairly good internet speeds.

												What do you get when you cross-breed Final Fantasy VII's materia system with Diablo 2? You get Path of Exile, a game which demands a great deal of theorycrafting and immense build diversity the likes of which you will never see in many ARPGs.Pros:+ Free to play+ No pay-to-win, all microtransactions are aesthetic.+ Vast build diversity+ All skills are available to use by any class+ Helpful, active community+ New take on currency and how it affects trading+ Massive, comprehensive skill tree.+ (Personal interest) Competant summoning and minion featuresCons:- Always online- Trade chat is poorly implemented- Game has terrible problems with desync- Standard league economy is horribly inflated- Not for casual gaming, requires a great deal of time and effort to get to the real fun parts of the gamePros explained:The first thing that attracted me to this game the most was the summoning system. Diablo 2 had spoiled me rotten with the necromancer, nothing was more fun for me than running around with a large army of skeletons at my back, ready to charge forward to engage the enemy. Not many ARPGs can pull off a good summoning mechanic, but when they do, its always amazing. Path of Exile not only lets you raise hordes of zombies that fight until they die, but also allows you to summon skeletons that offer support and come in larger numbers. The best part of summoning, however, comes in the form of raising spectres. Imagine fighting a monster that is very proficient at wiping out your minions, and then turning that monster into your own minion to fight for you! And there's more, from summoning flaming skulls that bypass enemies and small obstacles to animating weapons to animating a full-blown suit of armor!The next big feature I loved about this game is how they handle currency. Most games just give you basic currency like gold which you use to buy or sell things. Not in this game! Currency comes in the form of special orbs which also provide useful functions. One orb can be used to give you respecs to your passive tree for example, another can be used to turn a mundane (white) item into a rare quality item. There's lots of orbs and each orb is valued differently between each other based on rarity on usefulness. If you can find the 'mirror of kalandra', you've officially become a rich player, but good luck finding it!There are no direct skills to speak of when leveling up, but they are passive improvements. When it comes to Path of Exile, it doesn't give you a skill tree, it gives you a passive skill jungle! Those who have played Final Fantasy X will know what I'm talking about. The passive skill tree is what allows for such an amazing build diversity. Its very complicating for new players, but thankfully the forum has many build guides you can use to teach you how to build yourself. I highly recommend you try and make your own build first to understand the passive skill tree before reading a build guide.Ah, but the greatest feature of all about this game lies in the actual skills themselves. This game offers a myriad of abilities that are accessible to every player, so long as they can meet the stat requirements for them. Want to throw a fireball? Sure. How about raining fire on the enemy? Why not! Want to throw a spectral copy of your weapon at an enemy and watch it fly back to you? You can get it. The fun doesn't stop there, no. You can also augment your abilities with support gems to make them more powerful! Want to shoot more fireballs at once, or to make them split on impact? There's support gems for that! Want your arrows to bounce between multiple enemies or pierce right through them? That's possible. Want your melee attacks to attack multiple times in one cast, or to make your melee do AoE damage? You can do that. There's infinite possibilities when using skills, you just need to know what works best!Cons explained:However, this game does have some downsides you will have to deal with. The first and perhaps biggest issue this game suffers from is desync. For those who don't know what desync is, the simplest way to describe it is that the client isn't in sync with the server. For instance, you're trying to escape from some enemies in a hall and while you think you have escaped, you're still taking damage and when you die, you wind up back where the enemies were. Rubberbanding is the best way to describe desync and you will be experiencing this a lot. If you play on the hardcore leagues, its IMPORTANT that you play carefully and utilize the '/oos' command in chat to resync.This game is also not friendly to the more casual of gamers. Between build diversity, a complicated skill tree and a heavily inflated economy in the parent standard and hardcore leagues, this game demands a great deal of time and effort be invest before the game gets any fun. If you're not prepared to really sink your teeth into this game and hang on for dear life, you might want to consider playing something else.But hey, this game is free. Free, and without pay-to-win microtransactions. There are microtransactions in this game, but they are all cosmetic and designed purely to make your character stand out from the rest. There are also pets you can buy as a microtransaction, but they are also purely for visual appeal and will not give you an advantage to combat. You will never have to worry about other players buying their way to greatness, everyone is on even ground here!I really suggest you give this game a try, especially if you were a fan of Diablo 2!Helpful resources:http://www.poe.xyz.isThis site is great if you're looking to find an item in the game that you need. The site pulls information from the trade forum on the official site and if it finds a match, it will list all the items that meet your criteria. Clicking the item's name will take you straight to the player's trade thread on the forum!http://www.pathofexile.gamepedia.comThis is the wiki for Path of Exile. Everything you will ever need to know about the game can be found here. This site is very active and updates immediately when new content is released.

There's just that much depth to it. Don't let the depth throw you off though. The wiki pages are very helpful and the community is more than willing to help.

												Having an *ahem* history with Diablo 2 LoD, I was preparing very hard to be disappointed here. I'm very specific about what I enjoy in aRPG's, but this definitely delivers on all the fronts that I've come to like. The maps are repetitive but random (this is a good thing) and there is an obscene amount of loot to find. The currency system is different, but better (I remember vividly how useless gold was in D2 - no more). The passive tree isn't very intuitive (if you want a competitive character, that is), but it does offer a lot of potential for theorycrafting if that is what you enjoy. As far as I can tell the classic aRPG class niches have all been nicely filled. If you don't feel like theorycrafting, there's an active forum community (official forums, obviously - not the steam ones) that probably has a guide for the thing that you want to play somewhere. If you're looking for Diablo 2, but not Diablo 2 itself, you will like this.			"

This is catagorically and apsolutly the best ARPG ever created! and by the way the game has been continuously developed with a heavy bias towards community I have no doubt at all that it will be for years to come. 900 hours on steam, must be over 7000 hours out of steam AT LEAST. I dont buy any games and have spent about £40 a month on this one game for the last 4 1/2 years, what does it get me? Nothing that someone who paid £0 would (apart from quality of life stash tabs which is catagorically not pay to win). I have however designed and created 2 unique items ingame and obtained all the pets, armours, skill affects, hideout decorations (yes you have your own base to create and customise) I can get my hands on!!!!! Not to mention various T-Shirts, artwork and the comics. Ignore everything after D2 upto Path of Exile and ignore everything after Path of Exile after Path of Exile, you wont be disappointed i garentee it. GG GGG			"

												My game of choice when it comes to the top-down action RPG genre!It acts like a true spiritual successor to Diablo 2, when I started playing I was so pleased at how the game handled and looked. It's gritty and grimey and it feels like a slog through the legions of hell.Where the game really shines is the character creation and theorycraft aspects. You can spend a good hour or so deciding what kind of build you want and what sort of weapons and attacks you're going to use before even clicking that create a new character button. Thinking about how your passive stats and combination of attacks are all going to synergise with each other is all part of the fun. And yet if you don't want to do that it's fairly obvious where to go and what to get to make a successful build anyway (after a bit of practice)Highly recommended if you're a fan of the Diablo games, and even with the whole PoE vs D3 e-war I'd still try both and see what suits you, they are inherently different games. (this one is a whole lot cheaper though)			"

From it's rediculously huge passive skill tree which allowed you to build any character in a plethora of different ways to it's ingenius gem system for abilities it shows it's stuff as one of the best online RPG games I've ever played. I highly recommend it to everyone looking for an awesome, and epic experience. Also the game has some really awesome atmosphere to it. It's really good. Play it. Thanks. <3			"

												One of the most addicting and rewarding Action Role Playing games to date. It features an extensive passive tree with over hundreds of possibilities with extreme character progression and builds.The game features 7 different classes each with their own unique abilities and play styles which caters to any individuals type of play-through, whether you are a brute tank (The Marauder) or a necromancer witch who can use arcane magic and call upon the dead for help.The best feature of the game is that it is free to play! There are in-game purchases but they're merely cosmetic items which don't effect the balancing of the game as the developers have been strict on making a fair game.You will almost certainly have a good time leveling up with your friends.  As there is no gold in this game, You may get turned off by the extreme reliance on trading that is a consequence of the frustratingly unrewarding item drops and PoE's annoyingly random orb system The game itself looks rather nice, even if it isn't up to par with the AAA games out there, it is a free to play and not 60$.All in all, I'd say pick this one up! It's free after all and if you enjoy ARPG's then you'll enjoy this one!			"

												Path of Exile is one of the best games I've ever played. PoE is a free to play game, but unlilke most other f2p games out there, there is absolutely no way to gain any bonuses or anything by paying money. The only thing you get by paying money is cool skins for your gear. It doesn't have have any effect on the actual gameplay. The game is quite complicated, but that is what keeps me coming back for more, as there is a near-infinite amount of combinations of skills and character builds, most of them with significantly different playstyles. While the campaign does get a little old after a while, (on one character, you have to repeat the campaign 3 times on different difficulties), Grinding Gear Games has said that they have more content in the works that will eliminate this, with a new act scheduled for release in early 2015. Overall, I would rate PoE 10/10, a must-play.			"

												Awesome game. Feels like the true successor to Diablo 2, as it still has a massive amount of customization you can do to a character (unlike Diablo 3's kid-friendly stat system).The skill system is ripped straight from Final Fantasy VII's Materia system. Your skills are slotted into your gear and can only be used if they are slotted. I think it's a fantastic use of the system that works great in an ARPG. This increases the customization because any class can use any skill, assuming you have the stats to back it up. It allows for some crazy cross-class builds. Combine that with the MASSIVE passive skill tree (Google it and see for yourself) and you'll be theorycrafting your perfect build for a long, long time.To top it off, the microtransactions are purely aesthetic, so the game is not even remotely pay to win or pay to get epic loot quick. You still have to earn your gear, levels, and skills.This is the perfect successor to Diablo 2.			"

Posted: January 10, 2014
												I thought I would try and write up a few words about this game, as I really enjoy the ARPG games and played through most of them (Diablo I & II, Titan Quest & IT, Torchlight I & II, Van Helsing, and only don't have D3 due to cost - though this may change when the patch comes) and for me, the Daddy of them all has been Titan Quest. I probably sunk 200+ hrs in that and Immortal Throne (they don't show on my Steam games as I had them pre-steam and loved the game so much I rebought them on Steam) and played through the game on all three difficulty ratings. So how does Path of Exile square up to these other great ARPG's? Bloody good actually. Really bloody good.Graphics The effects on everything are superb, the gem levelling, the elemental attacks, the frozen or burning mob/player effects, the animations for mobs blinking, tunnelling, dissolving, ghosting, all of it. The backdrops for locations (towns, villages, caves, forests, battlegrounds) are lush with a huge amount of detail, the characters look excellent, with a large amount of clothing variants.Maps Excellent. How many ways can you actually put dead ends into a seemingly open ended area? You will be surprised, and they do it very well. With some much detail, the minimap adds yellow 'corridors' to show connecting areas in case the foliage or camera angle is in your way, and there are plenty of variations - cave textures are repeated more often than not, but I suppose its quite hard to come up with new ways to portray rocks, so I will let them off that.Mobs A Huge amount of variation with the usual casters, fighters and ranged mobs, and then mixed abilities, casting, teleporting, swarms, etc. There is a nice mix of normal and yellow bosses, and then end of act bosses. I think I would have liked to see more 'bigger than yellow but less than end of act bosses' like in TQ, but other than that, jolly good indeed.Skill Tree & Classes Ah, the bread and butter of all ARPG's, the skill tree. This is where PoE fails, as it has no skill tree at all! Instead, it has a freaking skill WEB. No mere tree for this game, but a spiders web that depending on class, your start point changes. You gain skill points per level and for completing some quests and you can customise your (one of 6) classes to a stupid amount of variations. I thought TQ ability to combine two classes and then pick and choose from their respective trees brilliantly varied, but this is something else.Loot Ah, the loot. You want to pour of the minute of the items found, min/maxing to gain resists/hp/regen/dps? You will spend hours doing so. You want the ability to create and improve items? You will spend hours doing so. You want to take your item as you like the look of it, wipe it, and new stats, add sockets and reforge links? You will spend hours doing so. Like most other ARPGs, you never seem to find the right item for your class, but this only makes you want to farm and then replay the whole game again on the next difficulty. There are sockets to add spells and effects to your attacks, and gems to improve the quality of the items - so the combinations of items available is staggering.Overall So add them all together and what have you got? A cracking game, and even diehard 'nothing will beat Titan Quest' ARPGers will admit that this is fantastic. The game itself is free, and you really do not need to spend a penny to enjoy it - I may drop some money on it to say thanks rather than any real need to want a shiny effect on my hat or glowing footprints (even though they do look smart) A fourth act or more locations per act may have tipped it over the edge, but this is right up there, surpassing both Torchlights and Van Helsing, and right on the tailcoats of TQ. There is simply not an excuse to not download this on Steam right now.			"

												This game is amazing.""That's great,"" you say. ""Another ARPG. So what?""So let me get this out from the start: I am not someone who usually likes ARPGs. I liked Diablo II quite a bit back when it was new. Torchlight was good. Torchlight II was good. Titan Quest was good. But I got bored of all of them before I hit the ten hour mark; some less than that. For the latter few games, I only lasted that long because I had friends to co-op with. I have played around 180 hours of Path of Exile. Half of that was solo. I find myself playing this over games I've actually paid for - all 200+ of them.To me, this game has streamlined the process of playing an ARPG:- Clear desirable attributes for items and the ability to socket and unsocket gems at will eliminates the tedium of sorting out loot while you're in town, allowing you to quickly get back to the business of killing everything that moves or looks at you funny.- Unique currency-barter system- The community is helpful.- The devs are active.- The gameplay is challenging but not too difficult.- This game is free-to-play powered by microtransactions so unobtrusive you would be forgiven for forgetting they were there at all.I'm trying to think of some complaints here. Something to say ""this could be improved by such and such"" and honestly nothing immediately comes to mind. There are no major bugs that ruin the game. Each class is viable, though some are more effective than others.All in all, if you're looking to find something to play without paying a cent, and the idea of being able to leave a trail of destruction behind you in the quest for more items and power sounds appealing, it's hard to do better.5/5			"

												First of all let me say that i totally recommend this game to everybody who played Diablo III and got utterly disappointed by it. Path of Exile is comparable to older Diablo titles in its atmosphere and skill level and it is of course free to play. I always use PoE as an example for one of the best f2p titles out there since there is not a single pay to win aspect in the game. All you can buy with real life money are cosmetic changes to your character or more stash tabs to store items (not to be confused with your actually relevant character inventory!). Path of Exile offers  the standard action RPG game style with serveral  acts and several playthroughs, one a little harder then the other. For the first few characters that system never gets boring, but it lacks a bit of long time motivation, especially since the late game aspect of the game (maps you can find and replay zones on a higher level through them) gets boring after some time, too. PoE has something to offer for every kind of ARPG player. Those who simply want to play a hack and slay game can do so, but also players who like to think a lot about optimizing their build will be satisfied thanks to the unique and massive skill tree.There really is no reason not to check out Path of Exile, especially since it is totally free!

												An excellent action RPG for all Diablo 2 fans out there. For me Diablo 3 was kind of a disappointment, long story short: the loot didn't feel exciting. In Path of Exile I actually expect to find useful items. I constantly find myself getting excited over a rare item dropping and even some basic white items for crafting.Another thing I disliked about Diablo 3 was the auction house, it just ruined the trading aspect for me since it completely removed any and all interaction with other people. Maybe I'm weird but I enjoy discussing prices with other people and actually doing the trading. Even with most people setting up a semi-automated shop via the use of ""Procurement"", you still get to interact with other people and there's bartering to be done.PoE has a microtransaction shop where you can buy cosmetic effects (armor skins, effects for your weapons, pets etc.) and stash tabs. You could argue the stash tabs affect the game in a way that could be interpreted as pay-to-win but I disagree. You can play the game just fine with the free 4 tabs you get by default, you just have to pay inventory tetris a bit more and choose what items you wish to keep more carefully. The skins you buy for your armor/weapons are also transferrable between items and characters, so you don't have to buy another one to apply the effect to another item.The skill tree and skill gem systems allow for a wide variety of builds and I find it nicely flexible to fit whatever I want out of a build at the time. It's more than just unlocking a fireball; you can divide that fireball to several fireballs each dealing a bit less damage but that way gaining more AoE, you can then add other types of damage to it or even make it a damage-over-time focused fireball instead of explosions, if you so wish.In conclusion I wholeheartedly recommend this game for anyone looking for a good ARPG experience. It starts out a bit slow but trust me, it's worth it.			"

You want to shoot a bow, summon zombies, and use several different auras? Sure thing! There are nearly endless builds to have fun with! A single campaign that you can join a party or invite your friends can be experienced in several different difficulties. Rewards change and moster gather their strength as the difficulty increases!

												Best action RPG out there right now, but not without its problems:PoE requires too much dedication for hard working students and people with jobs or a family who want to maintain a healthy lifestyle. If you don't have a lot of time on your hands, you're better off playing some other game because you won't get much out of PoE.The skill tree doesn't offer as much freedom as it first appears to. While the overall selection does greatly affect how your character works under the hood, they are still passive skills, most of which are just tiny percentage buffs and seriously underwhelming on their own.I'm not a fan of D3, but the active skills in PoE do not satisfy like D3's do. There aren't any active skills that really make me want to build a PoE character.In PoE you tend to build a character around one attack and spam that single one until you're blue in the face. Other action RPGs typically offer combined use of more active skills.PoE is a thinking person's game, challenging, huge depth in its mechanics. It takes a long time and a lot of reading to learn how to create strong characters and it takes forever to get characters to a high level. The learning process is a joy, but respeccing isn't really doable.The game changes a lot. If you leave the game and return after some months, you'll need to relearn wat makes a strong character, and all your character's passive skill trees will have been reset because the game's skill tree was likely updated. Your characters won't function until you reinvest those skillpoints. After returning to the game you likely won't know the current trade value of items.The game doesn't comfortably let you take a few months off and then come back.They went too crazy with the socket colours and linked sockets. While fun at first, the impossibly low odds of getting the right sockets and links on your gear become an annoying limiting factor to how you build your character. Specifically, part of the problem is that the type of defence stat (armor, energy shield, or evasion) on a gear item determines what socket colour is most likely to show up on it. Active kills are gems that need to be socketed before you can use them, and they will only fit in sockets of the matching colour. This effectively forces you to focus on a specific defence type based on what active skills you want to use, severely restricting the endless freedom that the passive skill tree initially appears to provide.

Damage/HP/Mana balance is pretty good.+ Level design is OK. Game lenght is nice for players who seek a good campaign.+ And the best; everything above is completely free. Not a single balance-destroying microtransaction. So there is almost nothing to complain.			"

												Addicted. That is all I would say if I was trying to sum this up in a few words.This game is absolutely amazing, my mate messaged me on steam saying ""Yo man, I found this game, you should check it out, its an RPG with like mages and stuff"" Usually I don't take much interest to games like this, but boy am I glad I took a chance with this game.The first hour of gametime I was feeling a bit like ""eh, this game is alright, its free cant get any better than what this is""If I could go back in time, I would go back and slap myself and say it is one of the best games I will ever play. Then after a few hours, I got better gear, better stats, and the longer I played it, the more I loved it.So here I am, finished the game on Normal Difficulty, and just heading into Act II on Cruel Difficulty, and I am loving it even more, it is so satisfying when you get even better gear because its so rare to find something that is better than the last when you have awesome magic attributes on your gear.Overall: Awesome game, if you haven't downloaded it yet, played it yet, or you don't really find these sort of games entertaining, download it right now, I promise you, coming from a guy who loves FPS Games this is completely different and I love it to bits.I have 1 issue with the game but it is understandable why it is the way it is. And the issue is the price of the Microtransations, but since the game is free they gotta make some of that $$$ somehow :D			"

												If you are a fan of Dungeon crawlers this is a great free to play version. They just released Forsaken Masters, so there is more new content.

												One of the most addicting and rewarding Action Role Playing games to date. It features an extensive passive tree with over hundreds of possibilities with extreme character progression and builds.The game features 7 different classes each with their own unique abilities and play styles which caters to any individuals type of play-through, whether you are a brute tank (The Marauder) or a necromancer witch who can use arcane magic and call upon the dead for help.The best feature of the game is that it is free to play! There are in-game purchases but they're merely cosmetic items which don't effect the balancing of the game as the developers have been strict on making a fair game.You will almost certainly have a good time leveling up with your friends.  As there is no gold in this game, You may get turned off by the extreme reliance on trading that is a consequence of the frustratingly unrewarding item drops and PoE's annoyingly random orb system The game itself looks rather nice, even if it isn't up to par with the AAA games out there, it is a free to play and not 60$.All in all, I'd say pick this one up! It's free after all and if you enjoy ARPG's then you'll enjoy this one!			"

												If you ever liked ANY Action RPG, this is for you.   PoE has an INCREDIBLY versatile skilltree and offers a great deal of freedom, so you can really do whatever you want (Bow-Mage? Check! Backstabby guy with a twohanded sword? Check! Tank with minions? Check!), to the point that the devs encouraged the players to find overpowered builds.This may very well be my favourite Action RPG.

												The first legit free to play game i have ever seen. There is nothing you need to buy that will make you a better player. Its straight up trade and exploring and finding your own equipment that will make you better. On top of its true free to play style, it has good graphics, an entertaining story line, and expanding content. Im gonna sound like a broken record here but seriously, this is the first game that ive seen developers actually care about it with out a monthy subscription or getting people to pay for stuff to be effective at the end game. 10/10 from me. Give the game a try. If you like diablo 1 and 2 then you will like Path of Exile.			"

												Hardcore action rpg fans will love this game. If you're new to the action rpg scene(like i was), conquering this game may prove extremely difficult. The graphics are above average for a free to play game, providing a very dark world with creepy crawlers (lots of spiders) and catastrophobic caverns (lots of undead). The story is almost non existent with the game but it does try its best to add some lore. The game offers deep customisation in how you build your character, issuing one of the largest passive skill (yes passive) trees i have encountered in an action rpg (i have only played three). You can choose from 7 characters (1 is unlocked throughout the game), each differing in lore, sex and appearance. Path of exile lends it self to very deep builds and theorycrafting, which hardcore players will adore. Skills are collected from the world either from quests, drops or from trading with players. These skills are called ""skill gems"" and begin as your fundamental action rpg spells. You will later acquire support gems which will provide unqiue abilites to the skill gems resulting in some nice effects adding to the games fluid combat. The game offers an in game store, however this is purely cosmetics based and storage space extensions which is initially huge anyway, offering no ""pay to win"" bonuses. After a few run throughs (i did about three messing up all three characters after and before release) and starting a new character today, i felt the repetitive nature of the story and dungeons, and caverns overwhelm me. This is purely point subjective and will differ within the community. 11 hours of gameplay plus about 5-6hours during beta is nowhere near enough to fully enjoy and experience this game to its fullest. But i feel thats all this game will get out of me, which is a shame because i really do want to support the developers for their efforts.Path of exile is an above average free to play action rpg fans of the original diablo games will enjoy. Get your pens, papers, mathematics ready, this game's going to need it.			"

I promise, you won't be disapointed with Path of Exile; it is everything you could want in the ""Hack & Slash / Dungeon Crawl"" game.Update:The game takes place on the continent of Wraeclast. You are an exile that will embark on a journey, slowly becoming more powerful. The talent tree is impressive/colossal. Skills and armour can be customised; incredible lighting in this game too. Is a bit of a 'Monkey Button' at times.Jei's rating: 7/10			"

												Path of Exile is a very deep ARPG with a rather unusual currency mechanic and a massive skill tree. It has a steep learning curve and can be somewhat punishing, but that's also what makes winning feel so rewarding.The devs have kept their promise of making the game truly free. Most microtransactions confer cosmetic changes. The only microtransaction that actually affects gameplay is unlocking additional stash tabs (bank storage space). I found that when I only had one character, it was pretty easy to stay within the limits of the default 4 tabs. After a hundred hours of gameplay, I felt like a small payment to be able to hoard more items was more than justifiable (and a bit more to make my new character look super cool!).The game is also kept interesting by regular challenge leagues where you start a new character in a separate game world with a fresh economy and different gameplay rules. At a low low price of free, it's definitely worth a go!			"

												An amazing ARPG with great developers who are passionate about the game. At first the game will likely feel a bit overwhelming with the enormous skill tree and endless options for builds and skills to use. My advice for first time players is to just play and make up a build as you go, don't overthink it at first.If you like Diablo 2 then you owe it to yourself to give this a try, it's free to play. The game is monetized by players paying for cosmetics and extra storage space for items beyond the generous space you get for free, no devious methods of separating players from their money as you see in so many other free to play games.

												I played the hell out of Diablo 2. Slapping people with a shield while I had a perfectly good sword, and playing as undead midget necromancers with armies of summons were some of my favorite past-times. Diablo 3 was a mess. I wanted nothing to do with it, when eventually a friend reccomended Path of Exile to me. PoE takes those silly moments of experimentation and turns it up to 11. You can make totems that cast spells for you, fill the screen with chain-lightning effect spells and arrows, convert enemies to fight for you, and raise an army of flying swords, tapestries and skulls as well as the undead. You can even re-create Touhou with fireballs.Definitely worth a try if you're into point-and-click hack-n-slash insanity, it definitely takes it in a new direction.			"

												In a world where free titles either A) try to force you into microtransactions to win, or B) just plain suck, Path of Exile breaks the mold and is, well, neither. Every aspect of this game is polished. With the exception of some sporadic server issues, I can't find much of anything to dislike about this ARPG. You've got the whole package: highly customizable (and good) graphics, good OST for that dark ambience, tons of voice acting that isn't cheesy, online play (though it's required of course), and really fun skill customization. Think Final Fantasy 7's materia system (the skill orbs you put on your gear) and Final Fantasy 10's skill tree system (a huge web of connected orbs that give you a clear route as to what playstyle you want to go with). As for microtransactions, your instinct probably tells you this could potentially be pay-to-win. But fear not! All of the items purchased from the shop are purely cosmetic (with the exception of extra bank and character slots for those REALLY hardcore players). To me, this says the developers are confident that you might support them in the future for making such a killer game and just giving it away.Overall, PoE takes a fresh spin on a tired genre and gives it to you for free. If nothing else, just download this and keep it for a rainy day when you wanna scratch that ARPG itch.			"

												Path of Exile is a video game of the massively multiplayer RPG genre similar to Diablo 3 (in fact the game was basically designed as a response to what the developers didn't like about D3). It's free-to-play with lots of things for sale in an in-game marketplace.Let's look at the pros and cons.Pros:  Free-to-play Endless customization Cool monsters and environments Passive Skill Tree is Huge Very good atmosphere thanks to great soundtracksCons:  Sometimes it can be difficult to play solo (especially if you wanna kill boss) Absence of the option to compare equipped items with the items in shopsI definitely give it a thumbs up and if developers focus on shortcomings, they have a great game, here!﻿Overall rating:  9/10  "

												The best available F2P game in the market, constant updates and new content every 3 months, great devs and user support,   tons of depth and skill variety (even with meta present). The kind of game in which you want to spend money on MTX just to support the devs. Must play for any ARPG fan.			"

												Very fun game if you like games like Diablo. The game has a  complex skill tree with tons of possible character builds you can make. I currently play the leagues and end game has been a blast finding maps and working on achievements. Don't have to buy anything to progress in game but if you like costumes or pets there are some cool ones, Only thing i did want to purchase was a few extra inventory tabs because i'm a loot hoarder.    : )			"

												Such a great game -- I cannot believe this is free! Better than D3 and Torchlight 2, this is a truly immersive action RPG. It combines talent customization from both FFVII and FFX which allows you to make any character that you want. The only content that does cost money is cosmetic items, which only add very little to the experience. Everyone should play this game. There is absolutley no reason to not give it a shot.			"

												I have been playing this game since Λlpha; it is good to see this game released. I'm proud of Griding Gear Games and the product they have created. I promise, you won't be disapointed with Path of Exile; it is everything you could want in the ""Hack & Slash / Dungeon Crawl"" game.Update:The game takes place on the continent of Wraeclast. You are an exile that will embark on a journey, slowly becoming more powerful. The talent tree is impressive/colossal. Skills and armour can be customised; incredible lighting in this game too. Is a bit of a 'Monkey Button' at times.Jei's rating: 7/10			"

												The first legit free to play game i have ever seen. There is nothing you need to buy that will make you a better player. Its straight up trade and exploring and finding your own equipment that will make you better. On top of its true free to play style, it has good graphics, an entertaining story line, and expanding content. Im gonna sound like a broken record here but seriously, this is the first game that ive seen developers actually care about it with out a monthy subscription or getting people to pay for stuff to be effective at the end game. 10/10 from me. Give the game a try. If you like diablo 1 and 2 then you will like Path of Exile.			"

												I extremely love this game. I really can't believe this game gives away expansions for free. To be honest, I never got bored of this game because there are always new things you can try out. The characters also depend on how you create them. The hardest thing about this game though is the build you want to make. I really like how there's skills that you can choose, there's pretty much a variety of them and you just start off from scratch. If you're pretty much a beginner and just started, I'd recommend just playing the game and if you have trouble, remember there are always guides, builds, and tips to help you. Just keep in mind that you should be careful about the skill tree. If you mess up and add the skills you don't like which completely makes your character so weak and not pass on through the higher levels, you're going to have wait for a full passive reset. I've had this happen to me like multiple times because I really suck at making builds and just play for fun. Just don't be like me when adding nodes you know because you should decide what you want your build to be and see the sparks fly!So far after playing for 2 years, Path Of Exile has always kept me excited and happy to be honest. I've always loved how a free - to- play game this awesome can add new items, uniques, expansions just for free.			"

												Close your eyes and go back to the year 2000 and remember the amazing times you had in Diablo 2 and open your eyes and wake back up in a beautiful modern take on that gritty ARPG you once loved.Path of Exile offers an incredible amount of flexibility the skill tree overwhelms many at first glance but once you tame that beast the freedom it gives you is unparalleled, it will honestly ruin all other ARPG's for you making you feel claustrophobic and want to escape back to the freedom that PoE gives you.Most communities are pretty toxic online and you might presume this to be the same but crack that hard outer shell and most people are willing to take the time to discuss their builds give you advice if you are stuck and sometimes even give you a hand killing a boss you are stuck/scared to take on or even give you some gear to help you move on.Not only does it crush all other ARPG's currently on the market it keeps evolving as well.The developers respond minutes within issues with the servers and listen to the community (not just the ones that whine the most), they consistently update the ""meta"" and have always tried to push the boundaries with adding various mechanics and adding new content whether it is new unique weapons or fresh mechanics and bosses.It's a game I've thoroughly enjoyed investing over 1000 hours into and I'm sure I will continue to invest 1000's more.

												10/10This is the diablo-like with the most depth and design complexity I've ever played. There's so much character development possibilities, the game is amazing at giving tools to create the most crazy and ambitious builds and to make it incredibly rewarding. From the gigantic passive tree, to the crazy combination of gems you can make or how certain unique items completely change how some skill works... It's so amazing at letting you be creative and come up with ways to grow your character! And then the world of wreaclast is just amazing to explore, lots of lore and a very grim and dark setting reminding of the best parts of diablo 1. The soundtrack is incredible as well.Hand down my favorite diablo like and one of my fave games of all time, and it's truly free (money only gives cosmetics and inventory management help). The few cons - you cant turn the camera, meaning its best to attack enemies from the south when you're a long range hero. -Self Founds will have a hard time progressing in the end game.- Act 2 is unfortunately pretty boring compared to the rest of the game.

												A great MMO with a dark atmosphere throughout. Similar to Diablo in many ways but the differences are there that set the two apart. The game's difficulty makes you want to keep playing and leaves you feeling rewarded. There are several different classes to choose from, however, any class can learn any of the game's skills and spells through a skill gem system. Although, certain classes are recommended to use certain skill types; I found that i was using certain melee skills more often as a ranger than projectile skills. Lots of fun and will keep you playing more.			"

												You're wasting your time.You're most likely going to look at the skill tree and get excited and make a 120 points build and then make your first character, probably in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ league and then kill yourself after the first 10 levels then go to some poe discussion site asking what you did wrong expecting them to spoonfeed you.They'll tell you to ♥♥♥♥ off and just play the game like the rest of them, you will, you'll make a new build and try something new. You'll get to level 30 or something, get bored and ask when does the game get fun. You'll eventually link your first items in the site asking questions like how to determine the price, we'll tell you use google and ♥♥♥♥ off again. You'll say ""wah wah haters from hardcore"" and continue playing, you'll hit level 60 and realize this game is just a grind so you can start another grind, you'll complain about this here and they'll say ""it's a game made by GRINDING GEAR GAMES you ♥♥♥♥♥♥"", a game in which you grind for gear.Enjoy, you ♥♥♥♥ing retard.

												 Has a slow ramp up, but a good skill cieling.  The game is heavy on the theorycrafting so expect to spend a few hours on the web looking at builds if you want to get the most out of your character.   Respecs are done through rare ingame loot, it is not practical to respec most characters, so expect to create multiple characters over time.After a hundred or so hours of playtime it becomes necessary to spend a few bucks on inventory/character expansion slots.  If you find yourself spending more time, you can expect to spend $20 to $30 for quality of life improvements.   Other than that microtransactions are pay to cool not pay to win.There are full price AAA titles that provide less entertainment, absolutley no reason not to give this game a go.			"

Customization is better than ever now that we have Ascendancy classes (huge subclasses bonuses) and the end game is about to get an overhaul with the next Atlas of Worlds expantion.Still a ""Must Try"" title.Also, don't lose hope/interest if you don't defeat the almighty Hillock, Brutus and/or Merveil ;)Just keep trying and you will find a great game that will make your wife leave you.

 IntroductionPath Of Exile is an Action RPG Hack and Slash game that is true gem within its genre. Nobody should ever pass the opportunity to try the game if they are into Hardcore games with learning curves that come out of game experience. The game offers a gigantic Passive Skill tree that will enable any sort of build you might come up with. This game will please alot of thinkers as long as they are willing to understand the rules of the game but at the same time can also please the most casual of the players that just want to be there for the action.The Pros: The Combat System: Path of Exile has a unique way of combining gems. Gems represent castable skills that can either be buffing auras , statuses , combat spells , multipliers and so on. Those gems can be equiped into sockets that your gear has, combining those spells if met said requirements can make them more powerful, for example you can add a gem that allows you to fire more projectiles with your main combat ability , or you can make the projectiles have a chain effect on the enemies. This allows for insane theory crafting and build creations and cycling through many skills you can find what you truly want to play by testing it yourself or simply following guides of other experienced players on the official forums which is what I would recommend for newcommers!  Replay Value: The game offers 4 Acts Of Story , 3 Difficulties and Endgame Maps , Races that last from hours to weeks and can reward you with Permanent Items/Skins. Two Core leagues for both Casual and Hardcore players Hardcore being the one with Permanent death as result. And season leagues that last for 3 months in which you start-over with everybody else and they have their own unique mods that change the gameplay. With the Passive Tree system and the way that Skills work you can made infinite builds on any character you like , either make your own builds or test the shared ones which you can find at the official forums of the game. Refreshing Gameplay Elements: The 3 Month League system is a great feature that more games should use. Giving the original gameplay a new taste every now and then and reseting the ladders allowing people to re-compete from ground 0 is a great way to make people enjoy the game and the better part is that if you are not interested in such a thing you can always stick with Permanent leagues. This gives a further meaning to the infinite builds you can already create because in different scenarios they may work better or worse. Aside from all this, these leagues have achievements of their own which by completion you can recieve awards at the end that you would otherwise need to pay real money for. Developer relationship with Community: If Grinding Gear Games has done anything right aside from their game itself is listening to the community and delivering. Their plan is to do a content update every 6 months and an expansion one the next cycle. The game is F2P and has no P2W elements at all , yet it works really well for them. That is a phenomenom rarely seen in the F2P market nowdays and is certainely honourable.The Cons:Difficulty Curve and Player Taste: While this is not necessarily a negative feature of the game its worth noting that the game is really punishing. That can be either the beauty of the game for some , or their breaking point to quit the game and move on to the next one. While the game can be played casually , if you are seeking to play in a Hardcore league you better get ready to die, LOTS of times and then find yourself knowing the limits of your character and the strengths of certain monsters.Monotonic Visual theme and Soundtracks: While the game itself looks gorgeous in many ways and has a decent ammount of soundtracks. If you find yourself becoming a veteran you may feel a sense of dullness because the dark theme around the game starts to feel very monotonic over many hours played. With that being said at first glance you will certainely love the game if you are into the dark theme and wont have a problem, but if you end up playing alot you will notice that in the gameplay. Aside from that, specificly for soundtracks. They fit thematically really well but I cannot personally say that anything really stands out.Co-Op cross Continent can be brutal: The game offers a big selection of servers with realtime ping check before entering in and no borders in between (Meaning you can swap to any server at anytime and keep your progress) , the grouping system makes the Leader of the Group the host of the instance so if you are planning to play with friends from a different continent (on a game like this which death could be a matter of half a second) having low and stable ping is really important , it can be really troublesome.ConclussionI do recommend this game for both the casual and the hardcore gamers. The game offers huge ammount of unique playtime whether you plan on sticking around for long and being active or hopping in the game here and there. If you are a fan to the genre this is a welcoming game as it has many elements from many popular games such as Diablo and Torchlight which has taken direct inspiration from. This is one of the games that have to be in your ""Must Try"" collection so if you decide on playing , best of luck to you , Exile.			"

												Path of Exile is not for everyone. It's pretty much Diablo 2 with a watered down color palette, a less immersive setting, and a super intense skill tree... oh the skill tree! It deserved to be in a better game. It's beautiful!http://www.pathofexile.com/passive-skill-treeThat web page contains everything you need to know about Path of Exile. Judge it and you judge the game.I love the tree. I loved tinkering with possible builds on that website. I loved mapping out the path of my new Templar. I hated trudging through all the bland grind required to carry out the plan. For me, screwing around with the skill tree on their website was actually more fun than playing the game.Their forums hint at an active community and substantial end-game content. If you have the patience to make it pay off, I'm certain you'll greatly enjoy PoE. But after 8 hours I'm uninstalling and not looking back. Thumbs up for its small target audience.			"

												Decent game that can be fun at times and be a good way to kill some time. Stays interesting as the game is frequently updated and their are many possible builds along with many skill points, though most of them being passive is very good and allows many playthroughs of the game. Very similar to Diablo 2 and 3, can rival both of them which is amazing and suprising due to Path of Exile being a free to play. I recommend this game and think it is good, apart from sometimes it can be boring and dull as some of the levels can get confusing and feel like a massive maze, this can add to the game at times aswell though, but some of the game's other features make up for this.

												Do you happen to be a fan of the diabl0 franchise or just someone that enjoys action rpgs? Well then, this is a game you will have to try sooner or later. In-depth and near endless character customization and build variation like you've never seen it done before: dozens of primary skills to make those left ( or right, your call) clicks hurt your foes while you slowly but steadily strengthen them through supportive abilities and a ton more to go through before you decide you've seen enough of the game. I could go on for a very long while but I'll cut short to just two words. Try this.			"

												The only aRPG to rule them all. Can be a fairly hard learning curve. When you first start this game you either hate it or love it. It all really depends what kind of person you are. Your first character will practically ALWAYS fail, and 2 things can happen. You either get overwhelmed and can't get yourself to try again, or you can accept what happened and start up another character.(Perhaps the same build tweaked or another one entirely) For strategists and rpg enthuisests this game is  gold, over 1100 passive skill points to choose from with 7 different classes on the same tree. Meaning that there is no ""right class"" or ""right build"".(although some builds can be much easier/harder then others). A very unique skill system with an equally unique crafting system only makes characters more diverse with every player. If your skeptical, why not go ahead and try it, it's free and has no Pay2Win BS being shoved down your throat. If you love the game then you can buy microtransactions for cosmetic items, but isn't necassary at all. :)			"

												Pros:- There is enough customization within the skill tree to let your imagination run wild and create a build that can be as fun and interactive as you want it to be.- Constantly being updated and improved by the Grinding Gear Games team. I started playing during the beta and since then they have added many features including; Act 4, Lockstep, Dominus, Hideouts, and many skill gems and unique items.Cons:- The trade system needs to be looked at in the near future, I should not have to go to a third party site, and look through the listings people submitted using another third party application, either work in some sort of player market or auction house system and let people trade items without alt tabbing out of the game to do so.- Diablo 3 looks and plays a lot more fluidly then PoE, if i drop a few packets in Path of Exile my client will freeze up for a few frames and then play catch up and the game will play in fast forward to catch up to where I should be. This is one reason I will never play on the Hardcore leagues.Conclusion:All in all I would recommend this game to everyone who enjoyed Diablo 2 and is seeking a little extra something after playing Diablo 3.

												Really fun game! Gorgeous levels, fun skills (and even more fun skill tree, if you happen to like Final Fantasy 10), and totally free. You can support the game with microtransactions, which you may really be compelled to do after realizing this game's replayability.There are points in the game where you're going to have to rush into rooms full of like 30 glowing, pumped up monsters cosplaying as rich TF2 players to take away their buffs which are hiding SOMEWHERE and that is totally terrifying, but fun, and even more fun if you're playing with multiple people so you can portal right back. One of the levels straight up made me miserable that I couldn't call in a tactical air strike and just wipe it out, though.			"

												Path of Exile is a FREE 2 PLAY!! action roleplaying hack and slash game comparable to the likes of Diablo 2 and the Dungeon Siege games. You play as an exile facing the harshness of the continent of Wraeclast, fighting enemies and exploring the land but mostly HOARDING items. The game allows to experience the story through 6 classes from the start plus another one that is unlocked by completing the storyline. It uses a third person or an overhead view and combat is lucid and unstiff. The world of Wraeclast is really beautiful, the dark artstyle compliments the tone. The skill tree is very diverse allowing vast customization of your character. The weapons are very diverse through different modifiers and items are tradable amongst players. The game has a PvP and Co-op options which allows you to interact with others or your friends through your journey across Wraeclast. Let's talk about the free2play model, it is not Pay2Win. Everything that you can purchase is cosmetics or stash space which does not affect the game. The game is regularly updated and devs seem very dedicated to the game. Rating: 92/100			"

This means that half of my life in that time period was dedicated to this beast of a game; with the remaining 12 hours consisting of school, sleep, bathroom breaks, and food.)

Posted: April 25, 2015
												Time to write a proper review this time. WARNING - LONG :) TL:DR at the bottom.Path of Exile is a hardcore ARPG produced by Grinding Gear Games (GGG). The game has 7 different classes, one of which can only be unlocked further on in the story. Don't let that put you off though. The classes simply determine where you start on the gigantic passive skill tree (more on that later) and what your base attributes are. Attributes consist of strength (red), dexterity (green) and intelligence (blue). Items and skills have attribute requirements that must be met before the item can be equipped or used, with higher level items requiring a higher attribute level. Once again, don't worry if you are a witch and need more strength to equip that one item as you can get attributes from several places (again, explained later).PoE centres around chopping, smashing, shooting, burning, freezing, shocking or poisoning your way throughout an expansive storymode campaign consisting of four Acts with three difficulties: Normal, Cruel and Merciless. Normal is a nice introduction to game mechanics and build theorycrafting and creation. Enemies are easy enough to kill and you level your character reasonably quickly. Once you have completed Act 4, you can take a portal to Cruel difficulty and start again from Act 1 with your current character. Cruel begins to test the defences of your build sich as your resistances to elemental and physical damage. Merciless is where things get tough. Even your standard skeleton WILL kill you if you let your guard down or go AFK in a dungeon (seriously, don't do this). There are literally thousands of possible build ideas to centre around and either follow or diversify. Your build however will focus primarily on a specific set of skills.Skills in PoE are your abilities. The attacks, curses, auras and spells you use to decimate your foes. They take the form of coloured gems that you socket into your equipment. Skill gems have attribute requirements. For example, red gems need mainly strength. Attack skills use base stats from your weapon(s) and likely deal a % of your base damage as either physical or elemental, sometimes both. Curses are debuffs you apply to enemies (simple enough). Auras are powerful buffs that ""reserve"" a defined % of your maximum mana. And spells have a flat damage that scales with % modifiers from gear, usually completely ignoring a weapons base damage. Skill gems gain experience as you do, and they will eventually level up, drastically increasing their power but also increasing their attribute requirements. Gems can be added and removed at any time, even in the middle of a boss fight (if you absolutely must). A useful piece of knowledge: At level 20 (max level for gems), it will need 155 of a specific attribute. So keep that in mind. There are also support gems. These augment your active skills to give them a massive damage boost while also increasing their mana cost. Support gems only apply if they are linked to an active gem. Links are the little golden bars between sockets on gear. For a skill to be as powerful as you can get, a 5 link or 6 link will be reccomended, but not required. These are generally quite expensive but can be bought fairly cheaply for a plain white item with no modifiers. You can then craft the item with a selection of orbs and currency items.This is where the in-game monetary part of PoE must be explained because it can be confusing for new players. There is no single currency, i.e - gold. Instead there are 24 different types of orbs and scrolls that all have different values are rarities. To save me from typing them all, here is a link to the forum page explaining what they all do. https://www.pathofexile.com/item-data/currencyYou use these orbs to change attributes on your gear, making them (hopefully) more powerful and beneficial to your character. You can also trade these with other players for items. The two trading orbs are almost always Chaos orbs (fairly easy to get) and Exalted orbs (a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to get. You have a 0.055% to get an Exalt from a monster). Get a lot of orbs and you are considered ""rich"". Please note, in almost 350 hours of playing I have found about 40 chaos orbs, 2 divine orbs and 1 exalted orb. Don't expect to get rich quickly unless you are the living embodiment of good RNG.This is most likely a lot to take in. There are many, many, MANY more aspects of the game, however they will need to be explained by someone else or discovered on your own as my fingers hurt from all this typing. Play the game, get stuck in and you WILL gain wealth and power. Try as many different builds as you want, or stick with one character to pour all your orbz into. TL:DR - Amazingly complex and addictive gameplay and a robust and rewarding economy. And you wanna know the best part? Everything is free. All the storyline is free. No hidden paywalls to unlock high level items. Free expansions. Free endgame. The devs are so non-greedy it is almost staggering, that they would put a game of this quality for everyone to enjoy. There is a cash shop containing cosmetics, skill skins and extra stash tabs (for the loot hoarders), and never once is it advertised with a huge banner ad plastered across your screen. Or even a tiny one in the top corner. I almost felt obliged to buy some extra stash tabs (I'm definitely a hoarder) and a few skins and I still feel like I robbed GGG, like I pirated a costly game.Overall rating: 10/10 - best ARPG ever released (along with Diablo II of course)			"

												First it was a Diablo II on steroids (at least the feel of it). After a few years the game is in the category of its own. My first advice to new players - do not fear the passives tree :)			"

												Downloaded on a whim, Absolutely fantastic, if u were disapointed with diablo 3 download this now,  if ur like me someone who has played some diablo (played the first 2 a little, mostly 3 not much tho), and torchlight 2 but cant get into it completely for whatever reason and always end up not coming back to it, this is the game for u, yes i just downloaded today, yes ive only played 5 hours, but for me downloading this with no real hope for it, i was extraordinarily delighted to find myself playing a game i could see my self playing next year, or the year after that. It is simply put, Fantastic, the creature design, the voice acting and the visuals are all on par (or succeed) the big games (torchlight, diablo(yee im talking u deckard cain), etc) by far. The way u earn abilities and equip them is one of the most original and inovative ways ive ever seen a game go about it, any class can use any weapon (as far as im aware so far on my adventure :P) now the question is (the question that may or may not be preventing u from downloading this game) is it pay to win? drum roll..... curtains open... NOPE, and for once its completely true,u wanna spend 50 bucks on some really good gear that will make u 10x better than any one else, well to bad mofo not gonna happen, anything in the game u buy with real money is purely cosmetic (except pets? not sure havent got one or played with anyone yet who has, so if u know please leave a comment) or for upgrades to your account (extra item tabs, extra character slots etc). anyway in conclusion if u are a fan (or like me not, but waiting for the right one) of these types of rpg action games, then download it now, its free so why not :P and it has definitely become my favorite game in this genre.

												You bloody kiwis, you've done it. This is the best thing that came out of NZ, since Peter Jackson. Yes, the very famous description of Path of Exile is pretty accurate. This game IS what Diablo 3 should have been. Simply because Grinding Gear made some very brave decisions that Blizzard was too afraid to make. Skill runes was on the table for D3 for a long time but Blizzard didn't go through with it. GG did and it paid off. It works perfectly and brings another dimension to looting. It's rewarding enough to make you stick with a set of skills and flexible enough to get you to try different things. Concept of linking gems is almost perfect and I love experimenting with it. Removal of gold and the barter system is a very bold decision. A big name studio wouldn't have considered this because it makes the game too complicated for noobs and people who would want to buy their way through obstacles. It breaks the cycle of loot/sell and forces you to think about what you're going to do with your loot. I mean you can trade your Orb of Chances for an item you like or you can use them to get something better. It's a quite exciting concept for a purist looter. Another bold decision which makes this game a little complicated for a newbie is the colossal passive skill tree. I think this decision is a clear indication of who GG's target audience for PoE. To be succesful, you have to study the whole skill tree and plan your route. You can't just randomly allocate points and hope to survive. Not many games nowadays, encourages players to actually ""think"" and ""plan"". These words are considered ""out of fashion"" and ""bad for business"" in today's gaming world. Yeah, these are pretty brave decisions but what is bolder than giving your precious game free and having only cosmetic microtransactions in it? As if the guys in Grinding Gear tried to do opposite of everything Blizzard did with D3. ""Blizzard put a $70 price tag on the game and tried to suck even more money out of the games with their RMAH. Alright, let's make PoE free and have no way of buying success in this game."" This is truly a noble strategy and because of this, first time I finished PoE during public beta, I felt that I owed these guys something. I bought cosmetic improvements for the first time in my gaming life and it felt bloody good. I will do it again as long as I keep playing the game. The game is all round well polished and very skillfully executed. All the bold decisions I mentioned above made PoE truly a great game. But unfortunately, I wouldn't give it a 10/10. There's one decision prevents me calling this game ""perfect"" and it's decision that doomed D3 from the start: Having to be online to play a single player campaign. You can give me the logical reasons behind this decision but none of them would be convincing enough to change my mind about this. I understand that it's a richer experience with a party and multiplayer is well integrated to the game, but, I simply do not want lag during a single player campaign session. It's not so much of an issue at the start but once you make it to 60+ maps, lag/loss turns into your biggest enemy. I mean, it doesn't make it unplayable but it's quite annoying when I lose 15 mins of experience because of 1 second of lag. I can't see why this game cannot have an offline single player campaign and my rating will stay at 9/10 until this becomes the reality.			"

												 Has a slow ramp up, but a good skill cieling.  The game is heavy on the theorycrafting so expect to spend a few hours on the web looking at builds if you want to get the most out of your character.   Respecs are done through rare ingame loot, it is not practical to respec most characters, so expect to create multiple characters over time.After a hundred or so hours of playtime it becomes necessary to spend a few bucks on inventory/character expansion slots.  If you find yourself spending more time, you can expect to spend $20 to $30 for quality of life improvements.   Other than that microtransactions are pay to cool not pay to win.There are full price AAA titles that provide less entertainment, absolutley no reason not to give this game a go.			"

												My old reviews have way too outdated information.This game has grown so much over 3 or so years after release and I have seen it longer than that since I was in early Open Beta.The game DOES give you more resources for damage and defenses making it easier to make those crazy♥♥♥♥♥builds that were not possible in the past. Customization is better than ever now that we have Ascendancy classes (huge subclasses bonuses) and the end game is about to get an overhaul with the next Atlas of Worlds expantion.Still a ""Must Try"" title.Also, don't lose hope/interest if you don't defeat the almighty Hillock, Brutus and/or Merveil ;)Just keep trying and you will find a great game that will make your wife leave you.

												Let me start by saying: this game is far superior to Diablo or any game of that kind. But if you just want a Diablo-like game to play for a little bit, then Path of Exile isn't for you. This game is really hard and requires a lot of time investment. However, if you can invest a lot of time to learn how to correctly build a character and level it up, then you will have a great time. The developers also release new content regularly for free.If you want to spend some money, you can purchase cosmetic items, which are completely optional, but also a little bit expensive (a full cosmetic armor set can cost around 20$). But since you can play absolutely for free, this sn't that big of a problem.			"

 IntroductionPath Of Exile is an Action RPG Hack and Slash game that is true gem within its genre. Nobody should ever pass the opportunity to try the game if they are into Hardcore games with learning curves that come out of game experience. The game offers a gigantic Passive Skill tree that will enable any sort of build you might come up with. This game will please alot of thinkers as long as they are willing to understand the rules of the game but at the same time can also please the most casual of the players that just want to be there for the action.The Pros: The Combat System: Path of Exile has a unique way of combining gems. Gems represent castable skills that can either be buffing auras , statuses , combat spells , multipliers and so on. Those gems can be equiped into sockets that your gear has, combining those spells if met said requirements can make them more powerful, for example you can add a gem that allows you to fire more projectiles with your main combat ability , or you can make the projectiles have a chain effect on the enemies. This allows for insane theory crafting and build creations and cycling through many skills you can find what you truly want to play by testing it yourself or simply following guides of other experienced players on the official forums which is what I would recommend for newcommers!  Replay Value: The game offers 4 Acts Of Story , 3 Difficulties and Endgame Maps , Races that last from hours to weeks and can reward you with Permanent Items/Skins. Two Core leagues for both Casual and Hardcore players Hardcore being the one with Permanent death as result. And season leagues that last for 3 months in which you start-over with everybody else and they have their own unique mods that change the gameplay. With the Passive Tree system and the way that Skills work you can made infinite builds on any character you like , either make your own builds or test the shared ones which you can find at the official forums of the game. Refreshing Gameplay Elements: The 3 Month League system is a great feature that more games should use. Giving the original gameplay a new taste every now and then and reseting the ladders allowing people to re-compete from ground 0 is a great way to make people enjoy the game and the better part is that if you are not interested in such a thing you can always stick with Permanent leagues. This gives a further meaning to the infinite builds you can already create because in different scenarios they may work better or worse. Aside from all this, these leagues have achievements of their own which by completion you can recieve awards at the end that you would otherwise need to pay real money for. Developer relationship with Community: If Grinding Gear Games has done anything right aside from their game itself is listening to the community and delivering. Their plan is to do a content update every 6 months and an expansion one the next cycle. The game is F2P and has no P2W elements at all , yet it works really well for them. That is a phenomenom rarely seen in the F2P market nowdays and is certainely honourable.The Cons:Difficulty Curve and Player Taste: While this is not necessarily a negative feature of the game its worth noting that the game is really punishing. That can be either the beauty of the game for some , or their breaking point to quit the game and move on to the next one. While the game can be played casually , if you are seeking to play in a Hardcore league you better get ready to die, LOTS of times and then find yourself knowing the limits of your character and the strengths of certain monsters.Monotonic Visual theme and Soundtracks: While the game itself looks gorgeous in many ways and has a decent ammount of soundtracks. If you find yourself becoming a veteran you may feel a sense of dullness because the dark theme around the game starts to feel very monotonic over many hours played. With that being said at first glance you will certainely love the game if you are into the dark theme and wont have a problem, but if you end up playing alot you will notice that in the gameplay. Aside from that, specificly for soundtracks. They fit thematically really well but I cannot personally say that anything really stands out.Co-Op cross Continent can be brutal: The game offers a big selection of servers with realtime ping check before entering in and no borders in between (Meaning you can swap to any server at anytime and keep your progress) , the grouping system makes the Leader of the Group the host of the instance so if you are planning to play with friends from a different continent (on a game like this which death could be a matter of half a second) having low and stable ping is really important , it can be really troublesome.ConclussionI do recommend this game for both the casual and the hardcore gamers. The game offers huge ammount of unique playtime whether you plan on sticking around for long and being active or hopping in the game here and there. If you are a fan to the genre this is a welcoming game as it has many elements from many popular games such as Diablo and Torchlight which has taken direct inspiration from. This is one of the games that have to be in your ""Must Try"" collection so if you decide on playing , best of luck to you , Exile.			"

												Huh... This game is AWESOME!!! And why? Firstly this game is as like as a Diablo 3, but there is a lot of differences, too. I don't play so much, but in this shrot time while I played with this game, I can tell my opinion about the game. So, the first thig, what I like very much the system of the game. Great graphics, everything is in it's place, just sometimes lagging or bugging the game. The secound thing, what I like, the big (REALLY BIG) passive skill tree and the skill gems for your active skills! There isn't a same character, because of the passive skill tree. In the YT and in the Google there're a lot of builds! Just type your play style and which weps do you like and finish! I think the different difficulty maps aren't boring! Moreover, when you start the game the quests are difficult a little bit (for me :) ) but when you get the other difficult maps you know what should you do. So, there're a lot of classes and everyone can find his/her class! I started this game with a templar (he's lvl 53) and I like that class so much, but I like the ranger, scion, too! You can play in a party this game and that's so fun!!! Don't worry, if you don't understand something because the veteran players can help you, or there's a forum and the original PoE page or the YT. So, I think this is a very good game (really) and I recommend for everyone who likes MMOs, like me. The one thing what I don't like this game (but not a big mistake) the prizes of skins. Okey, I know how this is a good game and it was hard to made it even for a professional game maker company, but... Anyway if you have any more question or just you want to play with me for fun (or not) just send me a message to this name: MarkFranklin. Have a good game and bye!			"

												I have put  over 700+ hours on this game over the last year and a half. I have thoroughly enjoyed it and I am always keeping up with the changes that GGG are making to their game. It does have its faults, the crafting system is not rewarding to casual players and the LFG message board has turned into a trade board. GGG have stated they are wanting to address this in the near future and unlike many companies who say ""the near future"", I believe them. After everything is said and done, if you like personalization in all aspects of your ARPGS, nothing on the market comes close to Path of Exile.Edit, 11/26/2016: 2.6k hours and it's even better now and it just keeps getting better.

												The true heir to the Diablo II throne, this game keeps getting better and better over time.  The level of complexity in building your character is amazing.  At the time of this writing Act 4 is still a brutally tough adjustment, the game is a lot harder than it used to be.  But player skills continue to evolve.  And, well, it is a AAA title for free, that doesn't require microtransactions to advance.... it is truly free.  I highly recommend this game.			"

												When I first entered the game, I was expecting the worst. I honestly didn't expect what I was about to see in this wonderful game.The good:God damn the skilltrees are absolutely MASSIVE. I mean literally my entire screen is filled with buttons and different paths to many different places, and I'm not exaggerating in the slightest!The graphics are fine, the blood is great! The game looks great!It reminds me heavily of Diablo.It's FREE. Like, literally 100% free, sure there are microtransactions in game but that's just to make you look good and to buy more stash space, really, it doesn't give people an advantage.The questline is enjoyable and I'm only just starting out in it.The gem system in which gems give you special abilities is really cool and I think it fits perfectly.The bad:The animations for the attacks could do with a bit more... Oomph, they don't feel very powerful at the moment. (Disclaimer: The abilities are not weak, it is just they look weak)The entrances to places need to look better (The white box that appears over the entrances blocks what is there to be seen, it's intruding on the atmosphere of the game!)The map is pretty bad looking, it needs a graphical update (It works, but it looks bad)In short: I would highly recommend this game, I'm beginning to like it more than Diablo 3 at the moment, and I've only played it for a bit.Definitely get this game, it's free and it's great fun, what else do you need in a game?!

Posted: October 21, 2015
												Overview: Path of ExileThis game is technically an MMO, but you will seldom encounter other players unless you choose to invite them to a squad with you. If it weren't for global chat, you may or may not realize that anyone else even owns the game while you're not in a major city. The gameplay is very dungeon-crawler(esque) with a good deal of lootfest and skill tree elements. Storyline: lol didn't read it, nobody has time for that (doubting anyone has time to read reviews either, but these devs deserve the time it took to give the review). Difficulty: initially there is only a normal difficulty, but a character can access a higher difficulty (cruel, the merciless) after beating the quest line on their current difficulty. Additionally, you can create normal or hardcore characters, the difference being that hardcore characters recieve better loot, but on death, they convert to standard characters, and all their gear becomes standard gear (and cannot be traded back to a hardcore character).Pros: 1) Microtransactions aren't needed for late game.. in fact, there is nothing you can buy with money that results in an in-game advantage beyond a larger storage chest. 2) Character Balance and Variety. There are nearly infinite amounts of viable character builds and skills, not just 2-3 ""use these or always lose"" web builds for ""op classes"" - from what I've seen, the classes are surprisingly well balanced.3) Community. There are usually a lot of people chatting in global, and many people are willing to provide help either in-game or just give advice on items if you're inclined to ask. As always on the internet, there's a healthy amount of salt, and a few trolls, but such is the price we pay for gaming with other people.4) Audio. The ambient sounds and the soundtracks for the game are both excellent, and the character attack sound effects manage to avoid being irritating although you end up hearing the same ones hundreds of times in the course of an hour.5) Details. The devs clearly spent enough time in other games to understand what's annoying in an mmo, and they did their best to remove those elements. Most notably, potions don't clutter your inventory - instead, you can carry up to 5 potions, which refill as you slay enemies. The game doesn't have currency, instead players trade with chaos/fusing orbs, materials which can actually be used to upgrade items, rather than exclusively be used for buying and selling.Cons:1) Repetition. Although the creatures and attacks change, but essentially every level plays out the same. It's quite grind-heavy in that even if you progress through new areas as soon as you finish the quests, the actual gameplay remains redundant.2) Actually.. being bored by the redundancy of combat is my only complaint. Although boredom is a death sentence in most games, I think I'll still keep playing this one... and even if you do quit if you become bored, there's easily 20 hours of early-game content which you'll probably complete before reaching that point.

Path of ExileOnce you start playing this, you wont regret a single minute playing this game, Storyline -  Awesome! Story line is divided into 4 Acts, each act has unique boss (or bosses), once you finish all 4 acts you can start over again in higher difficulty (Normal -> Cruel -> Merciless) ...

												Beautiful game, it is what Diablo 3 should have been and so much more, having played since open beta, I am happy to see it on steam! The gameplay is wonderful, if a bit desync prone. It boasts a massive passive skill tree, one that would take studying to even comprehend, and a wide varierty of mixable skills, mind boggling amounts noting the randomized drops and active skill links! The only downside to this game really, is its tendency to desync during heavy amounts of combat and when theres plenty of mobs on your screen.3 Year Update: So, this game has gotten so much better over the past three years, in that time problems have come and gone, and currently, I have nothing but praise for this game, it's a masterpiece of an ARPG, my hours on Steam do not reflect my hours on it, because I play it frequently at a friend's house using her computer, I would whole heartedly recommend this, all prior praise holds true, and since then, more content has been created and added, if you like ARPGs, play this, and thank us all later.

												Holy crap this game is addictive. If you like anything about the Diablo series, this is the game for you. While it is free to play and has microtransactions for support, most of them are only for cosmetic and convienience items. You can pick up silly stuff like visual effects for your weapons and footprints or even a pet to follow you around. The only really beneficial purchases I found were inventory expansions that would probably be boderline necessary in the later game. Speaking of late game, be prepared to dedicate a lot of time to grinding and exploring before you are anywhere near leveled up or powerful. While its farly easy to outpace the starting areas, the game has a ton of content and it wil take a huge ammount of time to level up a single character to 80. And while we are forwarning, its also not one of those hold your hand and guide you through everything kind of games. It will giive you general directions and show you the basics of controls then you are on your own. Want to know how a spell or weapon works? Read the detail screens then put it on and try it out. There is no real explination to anything aside form short decriptive texts on items and abilities. Be prepared to work to learn this game, while its not as brutal as Dark Souls, it will not hold your hand and tell you when to hit ""A"".Overall, this is a fantastic game but will devour your free time if you let it. I've had to cut back recently because I know that if I start a game I will feel the need to continue for hours before I find a reasonable stopping point. Absolutly worth the time though, so go try it.			"

5/5 ::::: Essential PlayI've never played Diablo 3, but this game makes me not mind. Surely the best action RPG on the market, and it's free. How can you not give it a try? If you preferred the skill trees of Diablo II over the third entry's approach, you have to check out Path of Exile: certainly one of the most enormous and complex skill trees I've ever encountered in a game, though I've heard the meta is apparently much more simple.There's a fairly crazy amount of depth to this game. Passive skills are earned on the skill tree, but active skills are found in the form of gems, items that are socketed (and unsocketed) into your equipment. There seems to be a lot of complexity to the system and I've barely scratched the surface myself. Beginners will definitely want to research good builds online at some point. Then there's the player hideout which you can customize to your hearts' content, and a whole world of upper-level play I haven't reached yet; you could say that the game hasn't really even begun on your first playthrough.It plays like a single player game, but it's online. I haven't grouped into any parties or traded yet, so the most noticeable online feature for me is the global chat. The one significant edit I'm bothering to make in this review after investing 100+ hours is to say: chat is addicting, but the community is pretty toxic. Channel 1 is the worst, but every channel is full of your typical Internet nihilists. This being one of my first online games, I have no idea if this is to be expected. Luckily, there is the incredible feature to turn global chat OFF. It completely transforms the game, I recommend giving it a try! Difficulty is challenging throughout; players may well breeze through earlier sections, but find themselves needing to rethink things once the difficulty ramps up at various points, especially with the relatively recently-added fourth act. Finally, did I mention it's free? Give it a try; you may just find your new obsession.			"

												Path of Exile is a very interesting game. With heavy emphasis on mirroring a big portion of Diablo II's successes, Path of Exile presents itself as a serviceable and even downright appealing in a truly Free-to-Play game focusing on the idea of ""Ethical Microtransactions.""As an action-RPG, it naturally gets compared to the likes of Diablo III, with a lot of players touting the oft-uttered ""This is what Diablo III should have been"" among forumgoers. The comparison is hard to avoid since the game has similar mechanics but with a stronger emphasis on having choices with consequence.Visually, the game's aesthetic is much more dark. In line with it's inspiration for gothic architecture and a lot of depressing atmospheres. Proper use of lighting to provide contrast in dark places in junction with lighting reduction as you're damaged really brings in the sense of dread when you are outnumbered and it becomes a matter of seconds before you die.The game's soundtrack is absolutely stunning. They blend well with the environments without sounding far too similar to that of it's inspiration.  Ambient audio also adds another line of what sounds like a full range of what belongs in each stage.The passive skill tree is daunting at first, but once you manage to realize it's merely a presentation that can overwhelm you and that everything goes from point-to-point, it becomes fairly simple to figure out how to use it. Each class starts in a position and moves along the ""rails"" one by one as they gain levels and skill points.  Choices are fairly permanent, which is quite refreshing in an age where games continually make such decisions meaningless by offering people a chance to try again with no dedication.Active skills could be compared to things like Final Fantasy VII's materia system. Each piece of gear will have a slot, which is color-coded for gem type. Green, Blue, Red, or elusive Whites. Some are support gems that enhance active abilities. Some are trigger gems, ones that cause an effect when triggered by play.  All of which gain XP and level up when you use them.Despite being a Free to Play game, Path of Exile manages to hold fairly fast to it's ""Ethical Microtransactions"" platform which is to say that none of their purchasable items are to give any mechanical benefit. While people can argue that character slots (of which you start with 24) and stash tabs (of which you start with 4, and can be fine with) are a mechanical advantage, the game is very much ""Free to Play"" in the literal sense.  Gear drop rates are not based on cash spent. Drop quality is not based on cash spent. You can't buy better gear, and you can't buy experience potions.So, Path of Exile has so far proven itself tremendously. It does a great job keeping itself reigned in, shying away from the easy-money route that other Free-to-Play games do, while providing an experience that even the bigger powerhouses in the market failed to provide.Play this game. If you loved Diablo II, you'll be hard pressed to not enjoy this.			"

												If you loved Diablo II and haven't been satisfied with an aRPG since, this is the game for you. Now, I've enjoyed a few (wrote a review a couple of months back for Titan Quest which I still think is a great game), but this one is by far the most reminiscant of the greatest of them all.Where this game surpasses all others is flexibility. With the enormous passive tree and the skill gem and linking system the possibilities are nearly endless. and these possibilities exist for each class.Now I must also add, the one weakness of the game is also in its flexibility. It's entirely possible to build a character that will become useless past a certain difficulty. It can be very hard to get the correct gear in combination with skill gems that will fit in that gear. But these challenges just increase the reward when you get something that works, rather than guaranteeing you with a functional build from the get go by boxing you into a very specific path (a la Diablo 3... and no hate for D3 it's just an entirely different beast)btw... this is FREE. So even if the good only sounds okay and the bad sounds really rough, it's still worth it.			"

												Really good for casual gamers, that if they die a few times thought it was the game to be difficult. In addition to the known problems of desync&lag, there are other aspects of this game that I did not like. The trading system, for example, is not supported by an adequate storage/throw out system. The story isn't engaging and the characters are not sufficiently characterized (lack of charisma). The overall game is not polished as well as many animations are not cared. I really liked the system of micro-transactions, to support developers without turning the game into a P2W; but they should pay me to play this stuff.It's free, you can give it a chance if you have time to spare :) "

												A billion reviews for this already so I'll make it short. PoE starts off slow, seems unpolished in comparison to D3 (of course, they're not Blizzard), but quickly makes up for it in the endgame. There is a very long way you can push your character in PoE if you have the time.			"

												This game is pretty awesome.  It's up there with Diablo 2 as far as gameplay and entertainment value. No cinematics though but that doesn't really take away from Path of Exile's story telling at all, by any means. Game is free to play and the only things that  you can buy via micro transactions are cosmetics items similar to Dota 2 and TF2. Which I thought was amazing. I thought it was going to be like Diablo's 3 auction house and you had to pay for that game. But Path of Exile delivers where Diablo 3 failed. You should try this game highly enjoyable, especially if you were let down by Diablo 3.			"

												This game is so ridiculously good.  I started playing it in beta before it was on Steam after a friend introduced me to it, and the game has grown so much since then.  It has so many unique things to offer.  For those who want to know more...I will attempt to explain some of the things you will need to know from the start.  It may sound daunting, but it isn't as difficult to pick up as it sounds.A quick sidenote.  Yes, it's free.  No, it's not pay to win.  There isn't a single thing in the store that gives an advantage over other players.  It's filled with a ton of cosmetics, bank tabs, and character slots.  None of which you will actually need, they're just nice to have.For starters, there is the incredibly large passive skill tree with over 1300 passives on it.  All 7 characters are positioned in different spots on this skill tree.  The ""pure"" characters are positioned on the passive skill tree directly within the three core attributes.  The Marauder with strength, the Ranger with dexterity, and the Witch (my personal favorite) with intelligence.  The ""hybrid"" characters are the Duelist with strength/dexterity, the Templar with strength/intelligence, the Shadow with dexterity/intelligence, and the Scion (who isn't unlocked until later in the game) with strength/dexterity/intelligence.  There are also jewels which can be socketed into the passive skill tree, that grant various buffs and abilities and sometimes alter other passives within a certain radius.Next is your equipment.  Weapons, armor, accessories, and flasks.  There's a ton of possible stats you can get, and every weapon and armor piece will have a random amount of colored sockets on them, some linked together and some not (I will explain that more later as it ties in with your active skills).  As for the flasks, you can have up to five equipped and those are what you use to replenish your health and mana.  There's also some with a more niche purpose.Your active skills come in the form of skill gems.  These gems come in three colors: red, blue, and green.  And what colors are those sockets on your weapons and armor?  Red, blue, and green.  You get skill gems as drops and quest rewards, and then socket them in the apropriately colored slot on your equipment.  A piece of equipment can have anywhere from one to six sockets on it, depending on a number of factors.  And if multiple sockets are linked together, then the gems in those sockets can work together.  For example, you could have a skill gem that lets you raise a zombie, and then another one linked to that which makes your zombie do more damage.The story is great, the soundtrack is cool, the NPCs are awesome.  The game has full voice acting.  Overall things have a really dark and gritty theme to it, and it's done very well.  The enemies and bosses and even the areas get progressively more and more creepy.  There's currently a total of four acts, each with their own unique things to offer.There is so much more I could talk about, I've barely scratched the surface.  The Forsaken Masters, corrupted areas, Divination cards, hideouts, leagues/events, the barter system (no actual currency in the game), all the items that can be used to alter your equipment, plus the special maps for endgame...but you can learn it for yourself when you play.

												Since this game is free, I will recommend it to anyone who have enjoyed these kinds of games in the past (Diablo, Torchlight, etc. etc.), as I have myself, I will say give it a go, knock yourself out.Personally I grew tired of it fast (maybe it is a personal taste thing), even before finishing the main story the first time, the story is almost non-existant, and the gameplay is the same old Diablo-2-styled hack'n'slash with a few twists. As it is known for, it does a lot of things right that Diablo 3 for example did not, and that is why it has merit to be played.As said, if you have enjoyed these kinds of games in the past, give Path of Exile a try. It is, however, not innovating the genre.			"

												It was the summer of 1997, i was 11 years old; one night, at some friends of friends house, in a dark room, a bright monitor enlighted me the path, a wierd music attracted me to the PC; there i saw Diablo for the first time. I feel in love with it at first sight. When a friend told me they were making a sequel, i actually started useing internet for the first time; i never had a reason to connect before, now i was seeking every piece of information about Diablo II. It was summer, it was hot, and in my hands i had a copy of Diablo II, i was one of the most happy nerdfag ever seen. I don't know why but i started playing on-line as first experience (the phone bill was bad that summer, very bad); after that, i played for other 4-5 years that harsh evil game called Diablo II, both in soft and hard-core. It was around 2008 when i saw the website of Diablo III, a brief video of a Barbarian smashing enemies, with havok, sparkles and all. Couldn't wait so i started playing D2 again, and again until 2012, when Diablo III came out. With all my friends we were there, ready to have it. We were there, on team speak, playing hard, but the feel was kinda different, we couldn't tell what was it; we were playing the new chapter, the last piece of the story, with new mechanics and all; but something wasn't there, i played hundreds of hours but couldn't find it anywhere in it; it was passion. The passion to make every detail matter, every little piece of the puzzle match the greater design. This is Path of Exile, an artistic passionate song to a game genre that was dying; Grinding Gear Games picked their favourite game, which i guess is Diablo II, and from its ashes, they made something truly new and innovative.(I don't play PoE on steam, i play it on their original Launcher, got many chars above 85, some also HC)			"

												Only thing u need to do for passive points is to get the health notes in that stupid tree, even keep the same in the mid-late game if u want to go Chaos Inoculation, only less than 20% passive points are what you can ""really"" choose, which stated that 80% of level up means nothing to you    and they just keep make it worse, I started to play the game when u need at least 3.5k hp for safe farming, now they just made u need 5k hp to save u from 1 shot!!!    lets not even talking about the lag, every time I lag I lost 30% exp, its something I cant even do about, I dont understand how this game could be so much more lag than LOL or SC II     Developers may feel that dying is not frustrate enough for players which do get a death count on the character, that they have to let player lose 30% exp to MOCKING them, no matter if they got bad luck for MF or laggy, I am playing a game for fun not a time drill !!    and the worst part is THE INTERNET MAKES NO DIFFERENT FOR THIS GAME!!!! most people just play by themselves and this game require 100% internet connection of the whole time!! what is the point? what was I flying all around the map for?   Gem linking system is the most good part of the game but the skills balance is just bad, few skills are clearly better than others, they did a lot change but some time just make it worse, wasted so much potential    I dont mind pay for the game but I mind for those over priced meaningless stuff in the store, nothing really improve my game experience   I had such hope for this game that make me played 300 hrs more but still couldn't see even the slight chance of change coming			"

												Looking for a good hack and slash that doesn't have cartoony graphics like Torchlight or doesn't have the mistakes that Diablo 3 made on release? Look no further! Path of Exile is just that. Path of Exile by no means is a perfect game, but it is a good ""more modern"" take on the original Diablo.The CombatThe combat is great! It is very meaty and I can ""feel"" the impact. All the spells have good graphical and sounds assets to them. You are also constnatly getting mobbed left and right by monsters, so you will never  have a lack of monsters to smash in the face. However one thing that does hurt their combat a bit is the latency. Most games when played on around 100 ping doesn't make a big difference, however in this game when the server decides to start running slow (which happens more frequently than I want it to), you end up getting a lot of warping monsters. This gets especially annoying when the monsters you are fighting can blink or leap everywhere. It does seems like hit detection have lag compensation, because I have managed to kill a few mobs that are no where near me due to lag with melee attacks a few times.The Graphics With all my settings on max, the graphics isn't all that great. This is mainly due to graphics on characters and monster models. They are a bit outdated. The actual terrain textures, and the graphics of the environment is ""beautiful"" (cause calling anything beautiful in this game would just be outrageous). The player can really see the game's doom and gloom artistic direction. Like mentioned in the combat section of the review, the special effects from skills and abilities are great.The Game MechanicsThis is hard to judge. If you are a ""core"" gamer, there is definately an appeal to the way passive skill tree works, and the way the vending/trading system works. However with that said, these systems do have their flaws. Selling things to vendors is essentially a horadric cube. There are crafting recipes you need to consider when selling things so that you can get the best payment for the items you get. What a bunch of scroll of identification? Sell the vendor any non-magical or rare item that is not peiced into a recipe properly. However that skill gem you don't use, or that iron ring you don't use that you just sold for scroll fragments could have properly be sold to make something much more valuable. Meaning, for people that doesn't what to wiki their way through the game, the trading can be very fustrating when you found out later on you just got jipped by the vendor. Talking about being jipped by the vendor, buying things from vendors are utterly useless. Most of the currency items you use to buy the gear with is more useful to be just used upgrading a random white superior gear that you pick off on the ground. The only time I ever find myself every buying things from vendors is when I need to convert 1 type of currency to another. Or when I have 1 really underleveled gear that I simply couldn't find a good replacement for, because I either never get a magical/rare version of that item type of the right level, or I don't have the currency items to upgrade a white version of it. The passive skill tree is massive! At first glance it seems like a core player's wet dream. Unlimited possibilities. Your OWN custom build that fits your play style. Well... that might not be COMPLETELY true. I love it because its innovative (kinda), but it have some major flaws. The shear size of the skill tree will turn average players away. There are people out there that isn't playing in hardcore league and they just want to play a hack and slash to enjoy themselves. Most of the passive skills on the tree are boring and redudant. Majority of the tree is just a flat base stats increase or flat damage increase. The amount of skills that does anything interesting is no different then that of any other passive skill tree you find in any other video games.  Also there is a ""one true build"" mentality within the community when you play certain subtypes of a class. So placing skill points wherever you think that seems nice? Not possible if you wish to party with pubs at higher levels. Though they don't see your build, but they will complain about you not being completely optimized.  QuestingThe questing in this game is awesome. Storywise it is really no different from any other hack and slash, but the fact that a lot of side quests needs to be ""discovered"" is a pretty good addition to the game. ConclusionI love this game. I definately would recommend it. It does have a few problems, but in all honesty most of it is just more because of fustration then anything else.However a word of warning. Casuals should stay away from this game, because the game hates you. The way that the health pots and mana pots work in this game may seem like a good thing for casuals initially, however because you are constantly swamped by mobs, it balances it back out to become a relatively hard game. Despite all the negatives I brought up in this review. Remember, THIS IS A FREE TO PLAY. Complaining about things that can only be fixed with a higher budget only goes to show your insensitivity. For example, a lot of people complain about lag, I even did to. However in my review I was questioning why we get warping at 100 ping (which isn't bad), instead of just simply complaining general lag, which requires money to fix. Another example is character animation. People complain that there are bad character animations. To be perfectly honest I can barely see that over all the FUN I am having. I am impressed that Grinding Gear Games is able to create a nearly triple A quality product as a free to play game.			"

												This is a complete head-scratcher.  It's been around too long to not have a succesful business model, but I'm astonished at how ethical the microtransactions are in this F2P Diablo-alike.No, no hyperbole, I'm truly astonished.  I mean, it's almost hard to find the microtransactions, and they come in three flavors: Extra character slots, extra equipment tabs, and cosmetic appearances.I don't know how many character slots PoE has, because playing one character is dozens of hours of playtime.  Playing two (it's nice to have a ""solo"" character and a ""co-op"" character, which you can do without paying anything) is easily over 100 hours of playtime.I still have enough stash tabs to organize my stuff into appropriate tabs.  I might need more tabs some 200 hours into the game.  Maybe?And there's a huge amount of things to upgrade.  Weapons and armor that has slots for skill gems, but also ""currency"" items to buy items from vendors (no gold?  Yes, no gold) that also affects your items.  This helps the ""trash loot"" and ""RNG gods"" problems so much.  If you find an item with great slots, but not enough else,  you can enchant, disenchant, renchant, add more enchantments, craft on more enchantments, etc.  If you find a great item with poor numbers of slots, you can reroll slot, reroll links, etc.  How do you get these items in this Free-To-Play game, you ask? ...from Grinding Gear Games, the answer is ""NOT by paying money.  Ever.""  You want those items, you find them or you trade for them.  But wait, doesn't that create a third-party economy that might sell stuff out of channel?  Maybe, but GGG resfuses to compromise the quality and feel of a game the depth of Diablo II to try and skim some profits.The skill tree (web, really) is just bananas, too, in a great way.  The selection of passive skills and abilities mixed with the equipment in this game encourages, again, Diablo II leves of creative character building, with a shocking amount of high-end viable oddball creations.  (Just be aware of the vastly larger phase-space of useless characters you can make along the way, and assume you won't get your first character right.  Really, it's okay).The difficulty level make for a fun experience for those looking for a fun ARPG romp, but challenging theorycrafting challenges at the higher levels for hardcore players.Best game I've played all year?  Maybe.  Most?  Hands down.			"

												★★★☆☆A classic-style ARPG, with deep playstyle customization.  + Potion depth+ Upgrade items+ Fitting graphics+ Leagues and races+ FF7 Materia-esq system+ FF10 Sphere Grid-esq system+- Endless junk loot+- Weird currency system+- Classes only effect your starting position on the Sphere Grid+- Highly customizable loot filter, that requires editing an external script file+- While most microtransactions are vanity-only, there are a few pay2win things, like stash tabs+- Playstyle is super customizable, but can't easily be changed, without creating a new character- Is there a story?- No damage numbers- Meaningless text walls- Ugly loading screen with no animation- Attacks have a stupid high chance to miss- Classes are gender locked and not-customizable- No transmogs, probably because vanity cash shop- Leveling abilities increases their mana cost, often making it pointless- Can't easily join other players, and coop doesn't work very well in general- Balance issues.  Entire screens of enemies die in a single hit.  Abilities vary from worthless to madness.  Bosses that 1shot you, after an entire dungeon of enemies that did 0 damage.			"

												This game has great gameplay and over all IS a good game. The reason that I do not recomend it is that they frequantly reset your skill tree making you have to redo your whole build this can make you forget your old build (the exacts are very important) and ruin your toon. 2nd when there is a patch they may change the level needed to equip a peice of gear or spell modifer witch once again can ruin everything if you have a carefuly planed loadout. Over all it is a great game but the lack of care on these issues makes it so that people like me get angry and never come back ever agin.			"

Product received for free
												Path of Exile is an Free to Play online action role-playing game.  The player controls a single character from an overhead perspective and explores large outdoor areas and underground caves or dungeons, battling monsters and fulfilling quests from NPCs to gain experience points and equipment. All areas aside from the central encampments are randomly generated for increased re-playability. While all players on a single server can freely mingle in encampments, gameplay outside of encampments is highly instanced, providing every player or party with an isolated map to freely explore.  The game borrows heavily from the Diablo series, particularly Diablo II.   The graphics, sound, gameplay looks pretty good.  For more info:

												Nice game played the non Steam version. Like the atmosphere of game and how it evolved constantly. A truly remarkable master piece starting to become of this title. Only thing I lack is better immersion on boss fights (Diablo is ahead of POE in that still), if you class/spec/gear is good for the boss you kill it very fast, if not you die 1 shot easy. Melee is still subpar compared ranged specs, even in much better gear.I think for trading formulas should be a guide in game for new players (especially when they are changing).The lack of it results many 'lucky' new players being ripped off on valuable orbs.Also in an item hunting/crafting game like this, some kind of more advanced trade options than spamming forums, chat would be very useful.Extra storage tabs still mean advantage, but as f2p title its at the acceptable range. (especially after they made chaos orbs crafting so much harder introducing many item names)			"

												Daybreak. The first rays of sunlight claw their way through the dawn and glint off my monitor like shards of glass, mocking me. I briefly see my reflection, haggard and inhuman, before I whip the curtains closed. I do not know how long I've been here; the passage of time means little to me now. My friends and family have stopped calling, their pleading voices falling harshly on my ears like a horrible, otherworldly tongue. I haven't spoken in so long that I've forgotten how to form the words. Crit chance and dexterity, skill gems and passive points. These are the only things I value. I have created a new instance in life, destroying the old. This is what I've become. This is my exile.			"

												So, while this game is amazing...it can be overwhelming for a casual gamer. The skill tree is outrageous(which is both good and bad). I love customization...but the leveling is punishing. Overall I would not recommend this game for people who like to play games purely for fun...if you want to have to learn and potentially waste time leveling only to find out you picked the wrong class for your style go ahead.

												The best ARPG on the market today, and it's FREE! No pay-to-win BS, either; all you can buy are cosmetic effects for spells and equipment, more stash space for hoarding items, and character slots. Most people won't even need to buy the latter, though, because you start with 24 slots for free. Endless character builds to try out, regular content updates and free expansions planned, on-going series of race events where you can compete and earn limited edition prizes... If you're a fan of the genre, there's no reason not to be playing this.My only complaint with this game is the de-sync. They had to make the game always-online to prevent cheating, but then to accomodate the fast-paced, highly reactive and tactical combat, they're constantly syncing game state between your client and the server... Which, when their servers are overloaded by the huge influx of players on Steam, can often mean rubber-banding or lag in performing actions. It's most frustrating when playing hardcore, and a half-second delay can be the difference between life and death. They've been working hard to alleviate such problems, so hopefully they can make it better soon.			"

												Path of exile is as some would say, the true successor to Diablo 2. While in reality thats not a fair comparrison as they are two very different games.Path of exile is a refreshing take on a very common genre.::Pros::HUGE Passive treeLittle to no Gear limitationsLarge RNG factorDecent graphicsGGG Updates often mixing the meta up.::Cons::Trading system ( will explain below )Support ( will explain below )Forums ( Will explain below )No end-game contentNo real reason to level past 78Flooded Economy (Will explain below )==========The Pros Explanation============--Huge passive tree-- Huge doesnt really do it justice. and Currently ( pre ascendency patch ) you have fully open class choice allowing for pretty sweet combinations of classes, Tanky casters, Squishy meat shields. etc etc. You name it, you can do it.  Note- This is said to change after ascendency is dropped. They will be adding 'Sub Class' which will extremely hamper your ability to make fun and interesting builds and will churn out cookie cutter builds. If you want to have an effective X-Skill, you have to play the class that has access to X-Subclass. IMO ruining a HUGE portion of this games uniqueness.--Gear Limitations -- Gear is purely based on STR/Dex/INT and Level. no specific class restrictions.--Large RNG-- Meaning X Weapon isnt the best because it can rolled badly or be completely missing stats. Making the game have nice replayability.--Graphics --  THey're pretty good, little dated. but they update it occasionally--GGG Mixup-- They change stats vastly, So what works today, maynot work tomorrow. which some people hate. but every day is a gamble.==========THE CONS EXPLANATION=========-- Trading system -- So, the trading system. The Trading system is how the old school gaming trades use to take place. Meet up face to face, you throw your item in, they throw thier item in and you both hit accept and the trade is done. Yay!, Now where is the problem you ask? Its the process of FINDING that buyer or FINDING that seller. You have a few Options. 1), use Trade chat : 2), Use a Thirdparty websiteDue to the limitations of trade chat ( being very little ),  there are piles of bots that sit there and spam trade chat making it scroll faster then the wheels on a slot machine. Making finding a specific piece of gear nearly impossible.Using a third party website is the best possible alternative. which creates a rough 'Item Search' if you know exactly what it is you need. which is usually priced 20 or 30% over in-game value.(side rant), If you DO by the graces of god find someone selling the item you need in Trade chat. When you ask how much he wants for it, he will respond with "" Offer "". There is NO right answer to respond to this. If you offer the appropriate value, He will haggle you or insult you for whatever reason. If you undercut him, he will get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off, tell you "" NOOB THIS IS WORTH (X) "" very clearly telling you he knew what he wants for his item and is waiting for someone to Overpay and rip them off.-- Support --Support for this game is just as bad as dealing with the @$$hole trying to price his crap. If your account is stolen, Tough luck, they dont care and will not assist you in any way.  If your account is hacked and all ur stuff is gone? Too bad, They will send you a link on how they think you can do better at not getting your account stolen.  Did your Hardcore Charecter die because thier servers all of a suddon crashed?   Oh well your ♥♥♥♥ed, under no circumstances will they reinstate them even if the fault is accepted by GGG's staff.-- Forums --The forum Mods will move our thread as they see fit, For whatever reason they decide to get thier jollies for. And if you inquire as to the move or request it to be adjusted, you will either get banned from the forums, Muted for a period of time or threatened with account deletion for questioning a mod. There is No set rules for Muting or Banning in this game. If they feel like they dont like what you said. Banned/Muted. If the aforementioned trade guy verbally assaults you and you respond with "" Jesus calm down "" and he reports you for harrasment ( right click, Report - is all it takes ) You will be muted for a fairly random length of time, ranging from a minute to days. Saying any keywords no matter the context, Such as ""Hitler"" even in a line as "" Hitler did terrible things "" will result in a ban if someone so much as hits the report button. (Side rant) If you are trying to sell an item and the Trade Chat is going to fast, simply right click and submit for 'Spam' on each person that tries to list thier items. They will drop like flys and you can post your stuff. Untill your muted too that is.---End game content --They sort-of recently added thier attempt at end-game content which consists of a few bossfights. While the fight itself is ok and sorta appealing, The items that are needed to access this content are very rare, and due to the rarity, are expensive to purchase from other players. Meaning you can do maybe 1 or 2 runs a day, If you have the money to buy them. Or, you have to find the items yourself which is a extremely rare drop, from a rare random spawn location within a map. Ive personally found 2 of these items in the 300 Hours ive played since they were released. One of which i just found today. So what do you do for end-game content between those? You grind your face against maps that are WAY under ur level getting♥♥♥♥♥♥experience hoping for currency drops to pile up to eventually be able to do that content again, that will take you 20 minutes to complete. to then farm again for a day or two.-- Leveling past 80 -- No gear is past lvl 75 i believe currently, So leveling past that is merely for personal pleasure or a few passive points which isnt worth the mind numbing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ exp wall.-- Flooded Economy -- The game has many leagues/seasons/races/etc etc that all lead into standard, these leagues offer increased drop rates or spawn rates which vastly increases loot, which all get sshuffled into the already increased economy, Everything is stupid expensive, currency value is garbage.TLDR: Fun game to pass time a while, dont invest too much and dont cause urself to need support. Good game, 7/10, But wont reccomend it in its current state.			"

												GGG made this game far more complicated then it needs to be. Very comprehensive game and for FREE, huge plus. Fun for a while, but for every hour I spent playing I had to do an hour of research. Haphazard mechanics and many spells and passive specs are poorly worded. If you want to really master this game, prepare for it to be like a college course. Questions continally arise like ""how does that work?"" and ""what does this even mean?"".. the prefixx suffix system and use of orbs in this game is very very messy.			"

												When you start playing, the game seems nicely made, and lot of nice ideas and discovering are there, but it wont last...- They limited the tabs to 4, knowing that people who get involved on this game will quickly need more.Just look at the transaction store, the most popular buys are extra tabs. People are not 'supporting' the game, they are forced to buy more tabs to play without being constantly annoyed by the limited space of storage.So, the game is free for who don't care about the game, the others will have to drop the money,And do not expect nice prices, everything on the store is overpriced. Want 6 more basic tabs ? +-14€Want a cosmetic skin that looks cool? Don't be surprised if most of them costs like 20€...- Remember the bumblegums that were containing stickers to collect? The makers were making one of the sticker extremely rare to find, on purpose, to push kids to buy more and more bubblegum, wasting their money, until they gave up since the missing sticker was almost never found.The authors of this game are doing the same BS here, all items SEEMS to drop randomly, but there are some internal rules that will make some drop EXTREMELY RARE, making the game frustrating and never ending quest to the desired item. Some items are so rare that they totally lost the purpose of being there...Some little examples:* There are items that are so ridiculously rare, that you will never dare to use them (exalted orb for instance, I found ONLY 1 after 350h)* After 350 hours of game, I NEVER  find any 5 linked socket item, and ofc 6 linked remains an unreasonable dream. And if you want to link 5 or 6 sockets. Good luck, you will need it (and a LOT of orb of fusings, which are also extremely rare to find) One way to make this easier, is to farm... farm and farm forever (you can trade to some merchants). Once you got what you wanted, after thousand of hours playing this, will it worth keep playing even more? That is the worst aspect of this game. You may eventually the stuff you need only once all the battles are behind... Seriously...* (trying to not spoil here) you will need 4 items to collect to activate it (Sacrifice of X), but the 4th part is extremely rare compared the others, which means you will have to play a lot to find it (I never found it myself)- The difficulty: I ended the game after dying like 300x at the boss of act4 Merciless. My little witch with her 1500hp and her commons and spectres could not do anything, and it took ages to kill the guy (1M hp or what ??)Maybe they expect the game to be played for years by people, but for the first run, the game feels just dumb and the difficulty badly set (walk in the park the whole game, rarely dying, even getting boring, since its just basing hack  nslash, then suddently bosses from Apocalypse that can kill you in 1 hit...)- Read popular negative reviews for more details. No need here to repeat other cons here.I could write more, but got enough of this game. After 350 hours, still dont get the point of the game. Maybe its just not for me...- Maybe ill return and will keep playing again some other year, since the game does not have really an ending. But too much BS for now.			"

												The only game i know with no pay to win at all. The first playthrough is very rough and a rewarding challenge. Every three months there is a hard reset with a free mini expansion in form of a new league where everyone starts with nothing. After the 3 months all items and characters get transfered to the standard realm, which is permanent. We also get almost instant reply on support tickets, they work 24/7 and are always friendly. Its the only game which cares about their players and dont focus on making money. They even interact with them on for example Reddit.You can play a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of builds not like in diablo 3 where each class has one top build which is the only one u can play. Its hard to get into the game and to understand everything since its kinda complex but its completely worth it, I think i can say this after more then 3.000 hours played and still enjoying it like at day one :D Its almost like getting a free addon every 3 months and free big expansion every 6 months to 1year in form of an actual expansion. In games like d3 you need to pay for additional things like this.			"

The game is FREE TO PLAY !!! If you want to help the developers there are cosmetic things that can be purchased. Forget Diablo 3 and let yourself be exiled to the continent of Wraeclast.			"

												Well, It's been 2 years and 600 hours later since I wrote my last review for this.  The game has changed a lot since 1.6.  Ascendancy came out in 2.0, and with it, a truck load of changes with it.  Classes can now do something called ""Ascend"" which is like a job change in other games.  The Shadow can become a Trickster, Assassin etc.  The game is still very fun, and VERY customizable in how you play a class.  A Witch can still Facebreaker Ice Crash if she so wanted to, and a Maurader can become a Mage.			"

 Read this one its like classic diablo with updated graphics. its not pay to win ether (loosing does exist deal with it). the store isnt pushed on you at all (none of that wanna start playing, gimme credit noms), and you only need to use it if you want to peacock (look at my shexy plumage also this useless pet that wont fight, just rolls over constantly) to other players (like mmo hipsters). the story ( killing why ...  beacuse they are monsters. the end... ) is ok . its good alone (the loot is all mine muhuhahahaha) or with friends (no no no not half 70-40). ............      the spiders are creepy as f##k.

												I immediately fell on love with this game! I'll break it down into pros and cons. But the cons really aren't enough to make it not worth playing.==PROS==- First off, it's FREE! And the things in game you do pay for are all aesthetic. So there is no Pay-to-win here.- LOOT!! Loads of loot that is satisfying to find- It looks fantastic! Lot's of gore too- The passive skill tree is amazing- Heaps of nostalgic feelings. If you loved Diablo 2, then play this!- The new potion system is somewhere between classic potions and health globes. But the ability to find ""magic"" potions makes it fantastic- Skill gems are weird, but it's grown on me- The corpses of monsters staying piled up is gruesome and satisfying==CONS=- Some of the animations are funky. Running looks odd. And there isn't always a lot of oomph to attacking- Can sometimes be lag, where hit's take a second to register (not often though)- I like the removal of gold, but sometimes the bartering system can be super annoying- I wish there were more acheivements. They seem too few and far between			"

Once you get a deeper understanding of how the skill gems and passive tree work you can really start to make your character the way you want it. Enjoy endless possibilities and playstyles while trying to reach end game content. Warning may make you lose track of time!			"

												I'm playing PoE now one Month,not very active but pretty often,for the first i was thought it's a Diablo 3 clone and i HATED3,but i was giving this game a chance and started to play,well maybe it's kinda similar to D3 based on the ""Hack n' Slay""Gameplay.But it's more like that,you need to find your way like you want to play,so literally find your path with a large skilltree and Equip Combos/Customize.That means you need to think about every step,what are you do,to be sucessful ect.i could now type more about that,but at all is PoE in my opinion an awesome casual game,if you are disapointed by D3 try PoE there you will find what you was missing.So that game is it worth at least to be tested,for fresh players in this gerne. :) Greeetz TittenGerd			"

												Are you crazy about ARPGs? Did you spend counteless hours playing Diablo 1 and 2? have you tried any other ARPG out there just to find that one that hits the spot just like Diablo did? If the answers to those questions is yes, then you have found your game.Called, by many people, the true Diablo 3, although I have not played the 3rd, from what I have seen I tend to agree with those people.So what is it about? Same as any other ARPG, kill♥♥♥♥♥♥and get loot. But unlike the other ones this one has a few twists. Features: 7 character ""classes"", and I use quotation marks because the classes are only defined by their starting point on the huge passive skill ""tree"". which brings us to our nest part, the huge♥♥♥♥♥Skill ""Tree"", or web, or galaxy, whatever it is it is not a tree >.>. The ""Skildrassil"" as it is often called, consists of a thousand and something (can't remember the exact number) passives, ALL PASSIVES.Active skills in form of socketable gems. You basically take a skill you like and put it in your equipment, with the ability to add supports to it moddifying it according to your taste.Hard♥♥♥♥♥game, yes this is a feature. Hard, somewhat difficult to learn, and extremely hard to master. And this is where most peiople that play it find the appeal.And it's FREE TO PLAY. Only cosmetic MTX available. Best F2P model you'll ever encounter. The game is soo good you'll want to pay, not feel forced to do it, you'll be the devs to take your money.And finally the ""bad parts"". Desync, yeah it sucks at times, although I haven't had major problems with it. Also some people hate that it's too RNG focused, but I think it's needed for replayability. And it's too damn hard at times, some people find that as a minus.In conclusion, if this review has piqued your interest, and you're a fan of ARPGs, you have no excuse of not playing this one. It's FREE anyway so might as well try it.Update: 10/10Update 2: 2000 hours after; would sell kidney for more.			"

												Fun game, really fun game. A little repetitive after the first couple times you make a character and eventually die (hardcore only because standard league is for little babies like you, the person reading this) and have to start over from the beginning, even though the story is exactly the same for every character. The skill system is amazing and you can play a big scary black skrillex and shoot little baby arrows, or a little pale white girl who can wield a two handed axe and cut you in half while flying through the air. The game itself is very fun and pretty optimized, however if you have a less than moderate pc, you might get some FPS lag. Also, macros for the game are basically standard.

Huge skill tree makes a ton of builds possible - seems overwhelming at first, but is surprisingly intuitive once you master the game. Currency system is a huge step forward for trading and makes the process easier while still providing value and the ability to adjust the game's economy if need be. Overall a great game and for a free one - you should absolutely give it a go.			"

												I have played this since 2011, and I cannot recommend it enough. If you liked Diablo 2 and other games like it, I don't think you will be dissapointed with this game, and since its free to play I don't see any reason why you shouldn't at least try it. There is a permanent softcore league, permanent hardcore league. There is a 4 month softcore league, a 4 month hardcore league if you want ladder resets like in D2. And on top of that there are several race leagues daily if you want to compete on a very hardcore level.You are very free in how you want to shape your character. The passive tree is gigantic and you can go anywhere you want on it. The only restriction to the class you choose is where you start on the passive tree. The builds are almost limitless, but if you want to do well in end-game you need to think about what you're doing.This F2P game is actually F2P. There is no P2W or anything like that in this game. The shop consists of almost only cosmetic items. There is ONE thing in the shop that could ""help"" you or at least make your time go a bit smoother, but again, it is not ""NEEDED"" to play the game. The item I'm talking about is Stash tabs. Yes, you have an in-game stash much like in D2/D3. The stash consists of 4 tabs, but you can buy as many tabs as you want from the shop. So if you are a hoarder like me, you probably want to buy a lot of tabs.The good thing though, is that the game is go good that I doubt you will think twice about buying some tabs and at the same time give them some support for making this awesome game. They are also expanding the game with content patches, new acts, new gems, items and what not on a regular basis.Again, I can't recommend this game enough, I urge you to at least try the game out if you tend to like these kind of games.

												a dungeon crawler like diablo yet so very different. the mechanics of this game are very complex and the versatiliy of each class is very vast. there are so many different ways to build each class the possibilities are endless. how it works is you get all of your abilities through socketing skill gems into your gear. there is no penalty for removing gems from your gear though, all you have to do is right click the gem. the passive skill tree is very large and confusing at first and can be very overwhelming but once you understand the basic mechanics of the game it's fairly easy to understand. the idea is to have your skill gems, passive skills, and support gems all working together in synergy to unlock the full potential of your build and your character's abilities. i recommend for your first character play something tanky or maybe a summoner witch. playing a glass cannon as your first character really is not the best idea.

												This game is just the best Co-op MMO i have ever seen!!! It is just like Diablo in a sense of unrealistic RPG aspects. The skill tree is, and im pretty sure, the biggest skill tree in RPG history currently. The storyline is beautiful, going from an exile that shipwrecked onto an unknown island to one of the most powerful characters in the game. The trading system is very unique including the inventory slots. The spells and weapons are all RG (randomly generated) and you will never know what special effects you will get on that weapon that you just found from killing a boss/ mini-boss. Have fun with this amazing Co-op MMO and bring some friends along to experience the true meaning of becoming an Exile.			"

												This is hands down the best Jew/Trading simulator out there. Definitely beats Recettear by a long shot. What makes it different from other Jew/Trading simulators out there is how there's no in-game money. Everything is valued in orbs, and the focus of the game is to get as many Chaos and Exalted Orbs as possible within a 4-month league. Sure, you can simply say, ""but in that case, gold is basically chaos!"" and you wouldn't be too far off. However, the items you trade in-game have no fixed value, can be negotiated for fractions of a Chaos/Exalt(which exist as other currencies), are negotiated by the players. Oh yeah, did I mention you trade with other players? That also makes it vastly different from Recettear.It's kind of hard to explain the nature of this game, you just have to trade to figure it out. 90% of unique items are valued at 1 chaos, which is pretty much as low as you'll want to go. Different currencies are available to split Chaos and Exalts, but pretty much do not have a set value themselves, aside from 8 Chance = 2 Scouring = 1 Regret and 8 Alteration = 4 Jeweler's = 1 Fusing. Again, the point of the game is to convert these currencies to Chaos, and eventually Exalts. Pro-tip: Convert your Exalts to Chaos within the first 2 months of a league, then buy Exalts within the last month/last 2 weeks.The Jew/Trading Simulator involves an ARPG minigame, but its not really worth noting compared to the depth of the Trading game. It's basically mind-numbing, ""attach main attack/spell skill to a button, attach debuff(curse) to another button, spam both buttons"" gameplay. This is due to the fact that BiS items such as Kaom's Heart and Bringer of Rain effectively drop the amount of usable skills by 1. Not only that, but gemslots and links also severely limit your amount of effective usable skills. Focusing on 1 skill is mandatory if you want effective DPS. The ARPG minigame gameplay focuses mostly on passive effects, so its not really that great. The drop rates for gaining items are terrible, so to succeed in this game, you buy good items at really low prices from players desperate to beat the gearchecks of the ARPG minigame, and you sell them for as high as people are willing to buy them.tl;dr 9.5/10, definitely worth your time. Best Jew/Trading simulator of all time.			"

												I've played POE for a few years on and off.  It is a fine game with very well thought out mechanics, skill trees and visuals.  The developer really knows what they are doing for the most part.  They also know that unlike D3, they need to be stingy with the drops so you don't run out of stuff to do.Anyway, I spent $20ish in extra stash tabs which is absolutely necessary if you want to play the game ""semi-seriously"" and it isn't a bad ""donation"" to the fine folks at Grinding Gear Games.  I do wish they would cave and put in a non cash auction house so I wouldn't have to dicker with the idiots, but the trading is far less painless then it used to be with most folks using POE trade which is a nice 3rd party site.All together I enjoy it more than D3.  I'd say that D3 is smoother running, slightly better graphics.  Path of Exile is a thinking person's game, I am very impressed with how the developer really thinks about the small things and is always trying to make the game better.  I highly recommend this game if you like the Diablo sort of play.  If you are going to try it I recommend giving POE a reasonable try since it is a slow starter and really only kicks in when you ""invest"" time and increase your knowledge base.			"

												For a free to play game this is one of the best you'll find.  The replayability is through the roof and the graphics are pretty good.  I have played quite a few hours of the game and I'm not bored.  The class system is nice, but the perk system has almost unlimited potential.  I would recommend this game to anyone looking for an RPG to play alone or with friends.  The one minor quirk is that in multiplayer sometimes it gets a bit laggy.  Still, for free it is pretty awesome and there is no pay to win feature here.			"

												This game is everything Diablo 3 should have been. Deep costumozation that will have you rerolling new characters over and over. Also the addition of Races and League resets will have you coming back to Wraeclast several times. Also the ingame store will not give you an advantage over the other exiles but is solely based on the looks of your character. This makes for one of the fairest business models.TL;DR Everything Diablo 3 wasnt while being free. 9.5/10.			"

												UPDATE: I'm quickly finding out that Diablo-style games are not my thing and I'm uninstalling this. I will however, make the review less crap.Pros:This game is the most free F2P game I've ever played.If you're into Diablo, this is on par with 2 from what I've played of both.The skill tree is MASSIVE. You could literally make two of the same class and they'd never be the same unless you MADE them the same.The currency system this game uses is kinda cool.Cons:If you're not into Diablo-style games....this is one of them. Dunno what to say.This was on the Pro side but I can see it being a con for some: THE SKILL TREE IS MASSIVE AND CONFUSING. If you're unwilling to wrap your head around that system, uninstall. It doesn't get easier to read.The click-to-do-everything style of play can lead to some major derp-deaths if you're not precise with your clicking.TL;DR: This game is perfect for those wanting a new Diablo-style but are unwilling to pay for one. You can't really go wrong unless you don't like the genre.			"

												After having played path of exile for over 300 hours on many characters I have come to love this game. The depth of it's character and item customization is phenomenal. I find myself spending time outside of the game planning builds and discussing ideas with friends.I started playing the game in softcore leagues. I was too afraid of dying and losing all of the work I had done in the league. After I became comfortable with the game and started to improve my skills I moved into hardcore leagues and haven't looked back. At the time of this review my current character is level 67 and just getting ready to move into doing maps.Path of Exile's passive skill tree can be very daunting for a new player. It seems like you will never figure out what to do and feel overwhelmed. Many players use a guide on the forums from other players to learn how to play a certain build for a character and how to progress throughout the passive tree. Some people may say that having to look up how to play is bad but in my opinion it gets players to get more involved in the forums as well as into researching more about the game rather than just diving in and getting frustrated about not knowing what to do.The economy of the game is kept balanced through the fact that the currencies commonly used for trading are also used by players to try and upgrade their items. This keeps the game from flooding with currency and having tons of inflation. Hardcore leagues tend to have a better economy since players dying takes items out of the league and puts it into standard. Causing the number of items that are good in standard to rise constantly, hurting it's economy some.Even though Path of Exile has a limited number of classes and only 3 acts that are repeated multiple times per character and on every character, the passive tree, skill gem customization, and items cause people to want to keep playing the game and make new characters.My advice to new players is to not give up too fast because you feel overwhelmed. Take a few minutes to browse the forums or watch videos to learn about a build or how to play the game well. If you put in the time to learn about the game you will be glad you did and enjoy the game. There may be desync issues which can be frustrating but they are being worked on and they are not as bad as people make them out to be. You can easily play the game with those small issues and be fine.I am willing to help out new players with the game or questions they have about the game. Feel free to add me on steam or in game using xHamsterHunter.			"

												IF YOU ARE NEW TO THE GAME AND WANT TO LEARN MORE, below is a link to a basic mechanics and beginners guide to Path of Exile.-----------------------http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=188353339-----------------------Absolutely fantastic. I can't speak anything but good words about this game and it's developer. GrindingGearGames is constantly adding new content, fixing bugs, and balancing the game. They communicate really well with their playerbase through the official forums as well as player-created communities like the Path of Exile subreddit.I find the game incredibly addicting. It always feels like there is more to do, more to explore, and new thins to try. With the immense skill tree, accessable by any class, I find that there is always new things for me to discover. The skill tree, which some might call a forest, allows for an extreme amount of customization and an insane variety in builds.The skill system is ingenius as well. Skills are obtained by putting a Skill Gem in sockets on your gear, so skills aren't limited by class, further diversifying the build possibilities. Wanna run a 2h Mace Ground Slam Witch? Go for it. Wanna make a Power Siphon wand Marauder? Have fun. There are so many options, and that isn't even taking support gems into the calculations.Then there's the end game to consider. After you've beaten Act 3 Merciless, you reach the ultimate end-game goal; MAPS. Maps are items that are dropped by monsters, and you can use them to generate instances where you can fight monstors of higher levels and get sweet sweet loot. There are many levels of maps, starting at level 66, and continue to scale in level and difficulty. To make these maps interesting, you can enchant them with most currency items to roll Mods on your maps, which increases the Item Quantity generated by mobs, or the number of items dropped meaning better loot. These mods, however, work against you and serve to make it harder for you. Some mods include more monster life, higher damage, multiple projectiles, -max resists, etc. These mods make people band together to do harder maps, which is why you'll usually see people doing maps in parties. GGG has found a solution to something that I've always had a problem with in ARPGs, which is end game content. In most ARPGs (Torchlight 2, Diablo 3) after you reach a certain point, there ceases to be any reason to keep playing and farming. Maps also adress the issue of a lack of social interaction in a game, which has proven to be a problem in recent titles. Maps encourage people to work together.Overall this is a fantastic game, although it isn't perfect. It's really hard to get into, with so many nuances that I can see how it would be really hard for a casual player to immerse themselves. The game also doesn't have the best optimization, and desync is a major issue, but it definitely has its good points.If you were (or still are, who nows?) an avid fan of Diablo 2 or are just a hardcore ARPG fan, then this is a great option for you. If you're looking for a hardcore game, look no further for you have found one. If you want a more casual experience, Diablo 3 might be more to your tastes. However, Path of Exile is a FREE TO PLAY game, so you might as well try it out and see what you think!I myself have sunk over 500-600 hours into this game (I only have ~220 hours logged on steam, but I spent a lot of time playing it during open beta before it was on Steam. I imagine I have around 300-400 hours on that.) and I'm sure that I will play more for quite a long time.			"

												Brings me back to the times of Diablo and Diablo II, where RPG games such as this are dark, brooding, full of sorrow and fear, not bright and colorful and cartoonish. POE instills fear in your journey through the various places and dungeons, drags you through the fiery hell of unreleting combat against waves and waves of hordes of demons and creatures that at times, are much more powerful than you can handle. Dying and trying again may be your only choice, but when you succeed without dying, the joy is pure bliss!			"

Build a character the way you want.Passive skill tree is huge; but it is unique to the game, i've not seen one like it before. The character starts at a specific place in it, but you can go where ever you want in it...Gems: These can be put in any kind of socketed item of the same colour and offer skills (or bonuses to linked gems)			"

POE gives plenty of options to build your character the way that you want.  There are endless builds which are viable and able to be played through the highest levels.  The game designers are hugely active in updates as well as game improvement and additions.  Overall a very immersing experience.			"

The in game currency mechanics, as far as no gold is concerned, are awesome; The currency is all in items. Give this game a few runs through, read a few guides, and soon enough you find yourself having already played 50+ hours.

												Just as Din's Curse fills the role as an inferior clone of Diablo II, Path of Exile is actually a superior version. It's not often that a game comes along that I will skip sleep for. Especially on a work night, but PoE is one of them. Just like its Blizzard-created cousins, it is an ARPG (Action Role Playing Game) that has an isometric view of the world. The graphics are the usual 3D rendered artifacts - allowing that bit greater resolution and naturalness to the character's animation.The depth of the game is phenomenal for a free title. It almost begs the question of what exactly is its creator's (Grinding Gear Games of New Zealand) business model. How can they make money on something that is free? During the first few weeks, I suspected that they would bring out some of the usual products for those cash-rich, time-poor players who prefer to buy high level items - a la World of Warcraft. This hasn't occurred yet. Most of the upgrades from the store are merely visual enhancements that make your character look cooler. The player community is much better than a few other free-to-play's out there. They are helpful, and there are many tutorials and guides for the cautious player that prefers to know what is coming up. The economy is fairly stable too. Gone are the usual gold, silver and bronze monetary units. Instead it is magical scrolls and items that vendors pay players with. The most common payment is a Scroll of Wisdom - used to identify any magical, rare, or unique items found. Most non-magical items will get you a twentieth of SoW - called a Scrap of Parchment. Another welcome addition to this game is the use of item experience - similar to the style found in Guild Wars 2 - except here it is only applied to gemstones, that can attached to any socketed weapons or armour found. These will grant you spells or abilities.The character progression in this games is much more simplified than many games these days. Instead of having a dozen attributes to manage, there is just three. These are intelligence, dexterity, and strength. These can be increased through character accessories, or using certain abilities in your Passive Skills section tree. Conversely to the character attributes, the Passive Skills appear incredibily complicated. You gain a point to spend here every time you level up, and more can be earned from completing certain quests. Only neighbouring skills on the tree can be activated, and it is this controlled incremental improvement that will have send most people shrieking from the game to Google for access to the all-important Wiki's out there.At the moment, the game is still in early release and this means lots of patches. Each patch will gank, nerf and buff different passive skills. This means that certain builds that are over-powered leviathans one day, become mewling kittens the next. It can be frustrating, especially as there is a definite lack of ways to re-spec your build.It's a small price to pay for this gem of a game. I've a few Steam games in my collection, and it is with some irony that I find a freebie to be the best, but it currently is. Nothing else comes close. I constantly find myself thinking ""just one more hour / level"". Everyone should get this game and play it. In fact, I think I'm going to go now... Laters!			"

												(I need to point out that, at the time of writing, I had played the game on steam for 13 hours. I had played the game off steam for a much longer period before moving over. Just thought I should share.)Normally I write dumb joke reviews, but I feel like I owe this one some seriousness. I'm in a similar boat to most of the other players of this game. I loved Diablo 2, but Diablo 3 felt a little lacking (especially at launch, I only bothered to buy it recently, after most of the fixes) and thought to myself ""I really wish there was a good, in-depth ARPG to fill my tim- OH HEY WHAT'S THIS?""Let's clear up that F2P concern first. Path of Exile is the most pure Free to Play I've ever seen. There's no experience or gold boosts, no overpowered weapons to buy, nothing. Only cosmetics can be bought with real money. It's something I never thought I'd see again. And oh god, it's refreshing. It's of the same quality as any game you payed once for, like Torchlight, if not higher. You may notice above, there's no 'starter packs' for sale either. Seriously, you don't have to buy jack♥♥♥♥♥♥Now, the guys and gals that made this game are fantastic. They listen to the community, and actually fix their game when problems arise. How great is that? They don't just go for 'good enough', the strive for the best. It makes you want to give them some cash.All right, now that we've gotten that out of the way, how about the game? So, you pick a class and start on a beach with zombies knawing at your friend's corpse. What do? You decide! The game has a huge passive skill system where all the classes are entertwined, so, with enough perseverence, you can turn that spell-flinging witch into a warrior if you wanted. Or an archer. Or whatever you want. It reminds me a lot of Dark Souls in that sense, classes only really affect how you start the game. Every class can potentially use any skill, which act as socketable gems. Wanna use that green trap skill? Make sure you have an equipment item to socket it into! There is also no currency in the game. Instead, you buy items with identify scrolls, adding this interesting mechanic that reminds me of the metro games. I approve.The combat and visuals harkon back to the days of Diablo 2, throwing out the cartoon-y, WoW graphics of Diablo 3 and Torchlight in favor of a darker, more mature, gritty look. The combat isn't very flashy and as 'cool' as Diablo 3 looks, but it definitely holds it's own in the ARPG genre. Don't knock it until you play it, at least.My only beef with the game is a rather small one. I'd have liked to see a bit more customization for the characters. Each class is gender locked and there's virtually no customization towards the look of your character and you don't really end up looking all too different from once you started because of new gear... Ever. To some people, this is a deal-breaker (as I understand) as one of the allures of ARPG's is to constantly get new gear and have it be reflected in that shiny new look YOU earned. I, personally, can get around that.This game is phenomonal. As someone who's been around the ARPG neighborhood again and again, Path of Exile, and Grinding Gear Games, deserves your attention.			"

												           Path of Exile is a divisive game, If you like you you love it, and if you don't it's a horrible disappointment. I love this game. I love ARPGs. It is complex and methodical while the combat is fast and satisfying.I will say that the combat can be a bit sloggy for the first couple levels, but I feel that the game more than makes up for it over time. The complexity and variety of builds, gear, and skill choice mean that the clunkiness can be overlooked.The game is F2P, and one of the best examples of the medium can work. The closest thing to Pay to Win is the ability to expand your in game inventory, but it's not necessary at all to do well even late in the end game, You can buy cosmetic effects, and many of them look great, and that's about it.The community for the game is amazing and the Devs are very involved with the players, often showing up on forums and in chat to discuss problems and make jokes.Long story short; if you like ARPGs give it a shot. It's free.9.5/10			"

												For a free to play game this is one of the best you'll find.  The replayability is through the roof and the graphics are pretty good.  I have played quite a few hours of the game and I'm not bored.  The class system is nice, but the perk system has almost unlimited potential.  I would recommend this game to anyone looking for an RPG to play alone or with friends.  The one minor quirk is that in multiplayer sometimes it gets a bit laggy.  Still, for free it is pretty awesome and there is no pay to win feature here.			"

It's fun to play with friends or alone, and it'll give you a few free hours of goofing off even if  you end up uninstalling it. Micro transactions exist, but they are purely cosmetic. It's worth trying it out atleast. Give it a shot!			"

												Most action RPGs are dull or simplistic, in my opinion. I gave Path of Exile a chance because of its supernatural theme and was very pleasantly surprised. The gameplay is outstanding, the maps (Acts 1 - 4 so far) each have different environments such as dungeons, graveyards, forests, caverns, the sea shore, and so on, and the item and crafting systems are very robust and engaging. There is a Guild system and also player housing in the form of Hideouts which can become very complex and unique by completing daily missions for Masters (see PoE's Hideout of the Week for some examples). Overall, Path of Exile is a carefully designed, well thought out experience with an engaging story, offering an odd blend of Gothic horror, Diablo-like gameplay, and Kiwi culture (Grinding Gear Games is located in New Zealand). Highly recommended.			"

After that, you just run dry lake or maps until you want to start another character.

It is not by any means whatso-fricking-ever pay-to-win. People call it pay-to-glow, since a lot of the microtransactions you can get involve little things you can put on your weapons to give them glowing effects. There's also pets and stuff. The only potential gameplay advantage you can get from paying is from getting extra bank tabs. Even then, you don't really need them if you're not a pack rat, and they're inexpensive and permanent anyway.			"

												I think having around 300 hours into the game, is enough time to say something about it. Path of exile is worth playing and it's free to play. You can create anything you want, if you have the currency for it. That's the catch though. In the beginning you will be really poor (99% of the time). Meaning the diversity is not that huge. There are a few builds that supposedly work without any gear due to abusing game's damage mechanics or using a very popular skill that outperforms other skills.The game is RNG based. And before I got around 200 hours into the game, I was really annoyed by this idea that my wealth is almost completely dependent on RNG. But then I started noticing things that the developers don't tell you and the community doesn't know. After that, the RNG factor became very minimal. Of course, that's my opinion. I got no proof, so maybe I just started getting lucky. In the end. I had a blast leveling 3 characters from around 50 to around 90. I didn't have to start over, because I had characters that had free respecs. I'd say that I recommend path of exile. I got a little off topic there, but it is worth it. There is no pay to win as far as I am aware and you can make your own luck. The only pay to win, kind of, is if you want to trade with other players more efficiently. But that's completely optional.TL:DR Just go play it. Give it 200 hours, before you decide that you don't like it. The addiction to the loot chase will get you sooner or later and when it does, you will eventually be forced away like I was, due to bad RNG. And if you don't mind, then this is one of the few games that provides infinite entertainment. :) "

												TL;DR: Free to play, zero pay to win, developers are awesome guys that love their game. Takes quite some time to get into (complex game mechanics), insane theory crafting possibilities. It's probably safe to say that not everyone likes this kind of game, but if you're interested in this genre or already enjoyed similar games such as Diablo 3, I can only highly recommend it. ===================It's probably safe to say that Path of Exile is not a game for everyone. It is complex, it is unforgiving, and if you're really into it, you spend probably just as much time looking at skilltrees and numbers on your gear as actually playing your character. To find out whether this kind of game is something for you or not, you probably just have to try it. If you do, just one thing: Don't give up on it too early, as the full potential of a game like PoE reveals itself only through understanding game mechanics, which will take you quite some time. The developers seem to be amazing people that seriously care about their game: The philosophy of the ingame store, which seems to be their main source of income, is to provide three things: Cosmetics, which makes your character looking better without making it any stronger; Quality of Life-Improvements such as Stash tabs which gives you more space to store more items; and last but not least, Supporter packs, which give you various of the aforementioned benefits, but for serious bucks: If you truly want to support the game, you can spend hundreds of bucks for this packs to do so. But again, it's in no way essential for the gameplay to do so.Also, every few months, there are patches that improve the game and add additional content: Be it new leagues, be it new game mechanics, be it new skills and items: It's all been for free so far; no paywall'd content, no DLC nonsense, just free improvement of the game basically. I've played Path of Exile already for a few hundred hours, I've ripped countless characters in Hardcore mode already (where death is final), and yet I still enjoy the game: I can only highly recommend it.

												Great game! Quick access to lots of action in the old hack and slash manner á la Diablo2. The split in active skills (with gems you can equip in your gear) and passive skills in a huge tree is really neat. One small disadvantage you have to live with this F2P game  are desyncs with the servers which can lead to rubberbanding, but 98% time you have a great game performance. Give it a try if you loved Diablo2! :)			"

												I loved every minute in this game, wasn't very grindy (I thought it would be but nope). Amazing game, would have loved to play more... Usually I'm not someone that plays a campaign multiple times on seperate difficulties and such, however playing this game with friends makes it nearly impossible to become boring. The campaign doesn't take extremely long too complete but multiple playthroughs are fun. (content might get extended but I don't know anything about that)It's an obvious Diablo ripoff, but who cares, it's a very very good one.Also it's free, so... play it, it's awesome			"

												I have been playing PoE for 4 years. The game is true free to play. There is no pay wall or pay 2 win. 100% of the game is reachable well if you're good enough. The learing curve all though steep is well worth it. I would recommend watching youtube vids for basic knowledge and joining with friends to make a guild asap. I have played nearly every league which always adds content and boost the experience of gameplay meta. The build list ive played range from a Bowruader (range tank) melee witch(Avatar of fire) to a templar bard (range auramancer). The addition of ascendancy subclasses has brought more build oppotunities as has the long list of uniques. Look forward to the next league and next expansion.			"

												If I had played this before making my top 5 games of the year this game would have stolen 5th place from Saints Row 4.Top-down action RPGs or “Diablo clones” as many people like to call them rarely amuse me for more than two or three hours, Path Of Exile however is a different story. What makes Path of Exile so different? Well I think it is it’s character building that makes it so enthralling. I am playing as a witch, a necromantic witch using my own build; I summon hordes of zombies, skeletons & spectres to overwhelm my enemies whilst I hide in a corner & cry, occasionally raining down fire from the heavens. But that’s just one simple example of a huge number of possible builds each & every character can have.Each character starts at a certain part of the passive skill tree, it is incredibly daunting at first but you’ll soon realise that it’s one of the best thought out skill trees out there, I dare say maybe the best I’ve seen. A witch for example starts at the intelligence slice, then we have the ranger at dexterity, the marauder at strength; then three other classes with a mix of two attributes & finally the scion who will start dead centre & is unlockable after beating the game for the first time.     These classes are purely the starting point, the canvas on which you build your character.   Skills are not dictated by class but by how much intelligence, strength & dexterity you have.You will not gain them by levelling up, you will choose them from quest rewards & will find them as drops from killing enemies.All these factors contribute to a huge amount of replay-ability.There is no character creator so whilst you make look the same as every witch, ranger or shadow you may not play the same. As for the gameplay itself, it is standard for the most part for any game of this style.Kill hordes of enemies, gather tons of loot whilst completing various quests & once in a while take down a tough boss. It sounds just as tedious as any other top-down action RPG yet whilst playing as the witch it never felt like that, it felt more tactical than your standard hit attack button until all bad things are dead approach. The trading system is another great aspect of note, instead of collecting money you trade unwanted equipment for items & stack up enough of these items & you’ll get a usable or better item.These are normally things that will permanently boost the effectiveness of armour & weapons or add magical effects to them. You’ll even get items that will change normal items to rare items. If you trade three of the same flasks you’ll get a better flask that will heal more HP or restore more mana. This removes the annoyance of gold farmers & the monotony of grinding for gold.In fact speaking of removing annoyances & monotony, that seems to be this game’s goal, to remove the things that makes your typical Diablo style top-down action RPG so tedious; & they, in my opinion, have succeeded. Best of all Path of Exile is free & has the fairest free-to-play model I have ever seen, micro transactions are almost exclusively cosmetic with bank & character slot upgrades being the only exception.That’s right none of the pay-walls you would usually find in free-to-play games.Plus if you run it though Steam there is no need to make yet another account for an MMO. There is absolutely no reason anyone should not at least try this game. Fully recommended.			"

												I found this game interesting, I tryed it as a distraction from more mainstream games and found i liked in and intending to play it more often. Although I have not played Diablo III, I have played 1 and 2, and found the similiarities with this genre, but what most intrigued me about the game was the Vendor recipes and the unusual currency usage of not using gold or silver as most games do, but the use of items as trading tools.I really enjoyed playing this game as it is the first game I have seen that has the options for different playing styles, and the races/league give an extra feel of community interaction I never felt i was in.. in Diablo 2.

Posted: February 10, 2014
												This is what Diablo III should have been (at least in my opinion). It follows the tried and tested gameplay formula of this genre with an interesting character development system.Skills are based on gems that are found throughout the game.These need to be socketed into items to be used and these level up with you as long as they are socketed. In theory any class can use any skill (although skill level is limited by the appropriate stat). In addition to this there is a large passive skill matrix which is similar in style to the skill development in Final Fantasy 10 (If any of you remember that one). For those who don't, all character classes start at different places on the matrix and (in theory) can access any skill, although some skills are much easier to reach for certain classes. This means that character development is much more freeform than it is in a lot of other games of this type. I've only played three classes to level 20 or so so I don't know how the game holds up in the final stages, but it seems like an enjoyable, nicely put together game so far. It has PVP (which I haven't tried), regular events and (apparantly) a sizeable number of players. If you find yourself at a loose end one day and fancy taking a chance on an indie game, I'd recommend giving this one a try. Its free to play and as far as I can tell not pay to win, so what have you got to loose :)			"

												I recommend this game because I prefer it's free to play model to what is available elsewhere. I've lost items due to deleting a character that shared a stash with other characters. I tried to join a 'Race' event that was not very new player friendly so it was kind of a 2 hour grind. A grind that had me tied to an obligation that turned out to not matter anyways. On a scale of 1 to 10 I'd rate it a 6. Although I like their model for trying to keep microtransactions ""ethical"", I dislike the fact that it is an arpg that I can not play in single player mode or over a lan. It feels like it should be that type of game even though there was no intention for it to be.It's free, you're getting more than you pay for so to speak.These guys aren't, as of yet (11dec13), using any tactics that compel users to make purchases on the impulse of gaining a small edge. There's no carrot and stick or any unethical use of reinforcement to gain access to players wallets, that alone is why I will likely play this game as long as it is hosted.			"

												This game is a lot of fun but a total time suck.  I've put over 100 hours into the game and am still learning things everytime I play.  Grab a couple of friends for FREE diablo like game play.  Path of Exile is definatly not pay to win, I've spent 5 bucks just for a guild tab to make trading between friends easier.			"

												Liked: Best Free ARPG without a doubt, high complexity and depth, lots of fun for at least the first couple hundred hours (had the game pre-steam). Grinding Gear Games are very on top of updates and adding content.Disliked: Lots to learn and you might feel its a bit slow to start and painful at times if you don't understand the damage calculations etc. (would recommend pulling a tanky build from the forums and following it).

												You can say a lot of good things about PoE. In two words: well known company, that mustn't be named, dropped the ball with their game - that is making good arpg, but fortunately there's GGG, who picked it up and made what is a staple title in the genre. It might be a bit overwhelming at first, but trust me, it's worth to get into.			"

												This game is commonly refered to as the true spiritual successor to Blizzard's Diablo 2, And while this is very true. I think it detracts from the fact that Path of Exile is an Excellent game even without the Diablo 2 influence.Do you enjoy Action Role Playing Games? If you answered yes, then this game is for you. It is also free to play, and not pay to win. So the game uses one of the better Free to Play models out there, similar to TF2 where only cosmetics and inventory space cost actual money.Bottom line, this game takes a lot of what previous ARPGs have done successfully, and then adds a lot of it's own ideas and concepts into the mix. I could list out all the great reasons to play, but basically, if you like RPG's and you have NOT played this, then it is time to start. It is free, so you have no excuse not to try it out.			"

												 Whether you play it on Steam or non Steam version (I play non steam client) this game is great, this is exactlywhat you should be looking for if you were an avid DIablo 1 and Diablo 2 LOD player. Diablo 3 has dissapointedtoo many of us Diablo veterans since it reminds us of a game for kids that is un inspiring with very little to the plotand no planning. Path of Exile is a game pretty much set in Rome and plays like Diablo 1 and Diablo 2 but the skill tree is enormousyou will have to see a professional review and play it yourself to decide if it is worth your time but let me tell youthis game is addicting and free to play!

												Path of Exile is one of the most engaging ARPGs I've played lately.  I'd highly recommend this to fans of Diablo or Torchlight who wish that there were a few more ways to customize their character.  The classes are diverse (and customizable) and combat is intense and sufficiently difficult.All skills in the game are contained in gems, which are slotted into equipment similar to how materia was equipped in Final Fantasy VII.  Also, character progression is done through a non-linear system that reminds me of the Sphere Grid from Final Fantasy X.  There is no hard currency (such as gold or gems) in the game.  Instead, there is a wide variety of customization orbs that can be traded as currency to either vendors or other players.I've had a lot of fun playing PoE, and find myself coming back to it whenever I want to play a good action-oriented smash-and-loot game.

												I just got this on Steam but played since Closed Beta. 200+ Hours into this game. I started with a level 51 Summoner Witch, then started a Ranger, got to Level 71 Lightning Arrow crit build. Now I've made a Marauder 2 handed Mace build with Ground Slam/ Hatred Aura for cold damage and he is at level 78 going on 79. The game is addictive.The Skill system is unique and fresh. The passive tree is a little offputting to noobs but it makes sense and is great after some getting used to. The battles and bosses are fun and require planning in later difficulties. Maps at the end are fun with friends, I like crafting my own level 70 maps and doing them :P or doing 66-67 maps with some magic find gear on. Trading is a bit rough, I like the currency system with orbs, but they do need an in game auction house (NOT WITH REAL MONEY). People use POE.XYZ online to sell items mostly its an item search engine. Trade chat is abysmal at best. If you like action RPG's this is much more fun than Diablo 3.  This game is free, and worth much more. I put in $20 to support developers and get 6 new stash tabs :P TRY IT			"

												This game is hard. At least when you first play it.The Skill 'Forest', because calling it a tree would be an understatement, is overwhelming, the drop is confusing and the currency is great in numbers and not so easy to determine whether it is valuable or not.This will be an issue for the first 10-20hours of your game. You will by no means understand the game fully after that but when you've played the game for 20hours you have the basic knowledge of the 'system' that allows you to get into the more complicated stuff.The game has A LOT to offer if you wish to spend the time. Even though it is free to play I recommend getting one pack of extra stash tabs(for which you do have to pay real money). The default 4 are big. Really big. But you'll come across so much different loot that you'll fill them up in no time and with no order. Speaking of money - the game has no mechanics that can give you an edge over another player. Yes, you can buy gear and lvls from 3rd party websites but so you could in D2 and nobody was saying that D2 is broken because of that. I even think that it is a nice way for people with not so much time to spare to get some more fun out of the game within their time frame. BUT that's a matter of opinion.As for the classes - the only difference between them is where you start off on the skill tree. All skills/spells/etc. are stored in Skill Gems meaning that you can have a berserker witch running around with a bow and spitting fire. Don't forget though that even if all builds are possible not all of them are viable for the endgame content(maps). Still, creating a build is a lot of fun and it doesn't mean much if you won't get past level 50 with your character because what you'll learn in that time will enhance your latter gameplay with all the upcoming characters and builds. You either get your first build from the net(which I do not recommend)or you get ready for completely fail at making your first/first couple of builds and learn much faster how the game works.The infamous desync - yes, it's there. What is desync? Desync is basically a situation when your game client and the server do not agree on where all the stuff is. You, Monsters, Items, Activated Clutter etc. So sometimes it might appear you just smacked the zombie in the face but the zombie still is spitting rotten blood in your face. Is this a big deal? It can in higher levels. When you're not cautious enough and don't ""/oos"" at the right time you might die without it being your fault. This is an endgame issue though! Your first playthrough WILL be a walk in the park whatever build, character or playstyle you choose.My recommendation? Try the game out! One of the few games that has reached a very high quality level with the devs still following they initial agenda(so nothing like ""We will never make a paid Map DLC"" and then release one a few years later[talking to you, DICE]).It is more than worth your time. You will thank me later. "

												I have been playing since the original Closed Beta( yeah there's 2 since a new Act changed the game massively resulting in another beta)>Much more rewarding and challenging than D3.>Good itemization and skills along with some improved and faster levelling makes this game hella fun.>Previously people complained at how slow the game felt in the first 10 or so levels but they have worked hard on that.>The game can now be played entirely solo without ever requiring to trade/interact with other players for items thanks to new crafting and gem/item acquisation methods in masters and divination cards respectively.>The passive tree may appear scary at first but eventually you realise it is pretty straightforward.>The game does not suffer the fate D3 suffers from aka limited build viability( thanks to the class specific item sets in Diablo ). Almost all builds are viable as long as they are cohesive mechanically.>The mechanics of the game are complex similar to Diablo 2. Takes a few deaths to learn stuff the hard way if you prefer Hardcore like me. :)TL:DR I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves TL2/D3/D2. You will be pleased with the game. Also, the biggest complain that people had against this game was DESYNC(caps for visibility). It has now been fixed by introducing lockstep synchronisation(the method D3 uses. your ping decides if you desync essentially. Internet lags, client will suffer.)All these new changes made me feel like revisiting this review.			"

												It's just a hack and slash game (Diablo or Titan Quest style), full of enemies, items, levels... for FREE!If you are really fan of hack and slash games, this game MUST be played, especially because it is free, but it is objectively quite good (which is unusual). And as usual it gets better if you play coop with friends.I must admit that although we used to play it every evening with my wife, we have not finished it yet because we stopped, tired of it. The game gets really repetitive, especially enemy wise. In the end it feels you always do the same thing, for no better reason than the one in the first place.And I know scenarios have never been the strong side of a hack and slash, but here as usual it is really boring... so that doesn't help.Still, a good enough game... free.

												A rather good singleplayer experience in the vein of classic Diablo. Surprisingly polished for a free-to-play title, I especially like the perk web and skill gems compared to static skill trees, and the NPCs actually have sensible things to say - at least for your first go around.No payment necessary to play and advance, as all paid content is cosmetics, which I think is rather fair.The multiplayer is okay, but PvE gets dull fast, as there is not enough variety to pose a challenge and the skills that are fun in singleplayer quickly turn into overpowered steamrollers in multiplayer. Bosses are are a little limited for a modern game, very few different stages and either the fight is over fast or gets protracted. The lenient respawn system alleviates frustration.I would definitely recommend the game for anyone into hack'n'slash, as it is free and of decent quality.			"

(Your progress will be the same on every server, you dont have to start from the beginning again when u switch servers)+ Big Stash boxes u can use to switch items from one character to the other (or just to store your items.)+ FOR FREE (ingame-shop available)ONLY - : I got disconnected from the server once. (i've already played poe for 25 hours and this happened exactly once, consequently it's not even a true -)I highly recommend to play Path of Exile!			"

It's monitization comes from micro transactions on purely cosmetic items.  you can play the game, get high end  gear, trade with other players and generally be awesome without spending a dime.  Also it is more of a mix between Titan Quest and Diablo 2 than anything else and it is very well done.If Diablo 3 left you cold and you want to try a game that can either be a brainless point and click or a deep strategic character building extravagansa you can't go wrong with this one!
