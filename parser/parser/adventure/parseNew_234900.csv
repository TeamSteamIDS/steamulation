												It's basically existentialist Zelda on acid with less combat.This is a weird game. It's got the appearance of a classic zelda game, but there are more areas where you just wander around and talk to random people. You also don't so much unlock sexy new combat abilities and weapons, but just unlock new areas with new traps and puzzles to deal with. There are still boss fights, some of which will give you a challenge, but don't expect the non-stop action of a zelda game. This is much more of an exploration of the mildly dark and mildly bizarre. Not for everyone, but I think many people will find it worthwhile.			"

												Can I give a thumbs-sideways?The word ""anodyne"" in a literary sense can mean ""soothing"" or ""blandly agreeable,"" and I can certainly give the game the bland part.For the better part of three hours playing the game I did not know if I could stomach finishing it. I'm getting ahead of myself.It's a Legend of Zelda-like with a ton of strange thematic choices, poor writing, too much dialogue and tonal shifts that will give a player whiplash. What few inventive game mechanics it employs are spread throughout an atrociously long and dull climb to nowhere. You might pass through seven screens just to get to the next place: no enemies, no obstacles to speak of, just a march. As if the designers (credited indie devs Sean Hogan Jonathan Kittaka) couldn't be bothered, having come up with the overall map of an area, to fill it in with things. This becomes very apparent when retracing your steps. You will find a checkpoint at the beginning of an area, putting you on guard for the trials ahead. Then those trials never manifest and seven screens later there's another checkpoint.To what end? Was my adversary through that place boredom? Will checkpoints at the beginning and end of a stretch really help me combat that adversary?The few basic enemies you encounter are all laughably simplistic. Many pose no threat at all. Some cannot even harm you. This led me to think perhaps they were more of a rhetorical device than a game object, really. The only rhetorical question that sprang to mind was ""why am I still playing this?"" Then later I encountered fire-breathing lions and they shot my dandy theory to hell.But I do know the answer to that rhetorical question, as the game is a little more than a poorly-written, bland, easy Zelda clone.First, even though the various mechanics are spread out way too far, the few that the game offers are very neat. Even with all the crummy verbosity, the game does not tutorialize, rather giving you the tools and letting you figure things out. A good bit of design. The nugget of a good game. I would never have thought that piles of dust could have so many uses, but there you go.Second, there is at least one boss in the game that requires a neat bit of fooling and approaches a reasonable challenge. Shame that I can only honestly say that about one of perhaps eight or so bosses, but that one is very good and fun.Third, there are a few counter-intuitive design choices that I won't spoil that I do admire as choices. It is this last point that keeps my thumb pointing up with all I've said about the game to this point. What I will say is that it's a shame you only get the full, mechanically complete game after playing through the whole thing.Heck I guess that's a second way it reminds me of Fez. The first was the music and sound effects. Which I didn't mention. Okay.The music is fine if you're into chiptunes and oscilloscopes. Tones, mostly sine waves. Some triangle. There are several good tones.Which is more than I can say about the jokes. Those are all tonedeaf. And just grating given everything else that happens. I want to say that, as a rule, you don't get to make crappy puns about bicycles with names in the same game where you murder a man and jump into his corpse-portal to go commit an abortion on a tentacle monster. Which is part of what I mean when I say the game is tonally all over the place. Anything vaguely interesting as a narrative point just gets dropped somewhere; crushed away by screen after screen of nothing happening.Things I didn't like:bad jokesboring, longwinded dialogueblandnessuseless screenslack of difficultyThings I did like:inventive mechanicspost-game elementscertain specific challengescute enemy namesno naviBuy it on sale. At the time of this writing it is half-off the ten dollar list price, which still feels like a bit much for what you're getting. Do not pay ten dollars for this game, at any rate.			"

												Anodyne is a top down action-adventure game that draws inspiration from some of the classic Zelda titles. The developers’ fondness for that iconic series is readily apparent, and at its best Anodyne feels like a genuine love letter to the adventure games of yesteryear. It does have a bit of a little brother problem, and its efforts to follow in the footsteps of its idol ultimately fall a bit short of the mark.At first it seems like the story might be a cute little homage to Zelda, with a little bit of snark thrown in to keep things entertaining. Then things start getting weird. Only little things feel a bit off at first, but before long a general unease begins to permeate the game and you realize that this is not a simple hero saves the world kind of story. I don’t remember any of the older Zelda games featuring paranoid schizophrenics mumbling to themselves in the woods, and I certainly don’t remember finding any houses where the occupant had hung himself. The game vacillates between goofy humor and dark set pieces creating this really unique and interesting atmosphere. Anodyne does a particularly good job at pulling off the creepiness because it cloaks itself with an air of nostalgia. While the atmosphere is solid and there are some interesting portions, ultimately the story doesn’t seem to know what it wants to do. While the first couple of dungeons do seem to at least have some coherent theme and hints at the overall narrative, later portions seem almost entirely unrelated to each other and it feels like the game is being weird simply for the sake of being weird. At times there is an effort to be philosophical, but it is clumsily done and certain segments wind up feeling pretentious. There just isn’t a cohesive narrative, and while bits and pieces are genuinely interesting or unsettling, as a whole the story just ends up feeling disjointed.Anodyne is about as old school as you can get, and there is a heavy reliance the simple puzzles and exploration that made the old Zelda games so successful. There is a nice big map the look through with a lot of things to find, and the exploration actually gets better after you defeat the final boss because you unlock a new ability that lets you reach corners of the map that were previously inaccessible. While I don’t want to spoil anything, it really is a clever and very unique tool to have at your disposal and it is just a little disappointing that the game waited until it was over to pull out what was really its best trick. I found the post game stuff almost more enjoyable than the actual quest, and Anodyne does a nice job of not only encouraging exploration, but giving you a lot of interesting environments to explore. The levels are well varied and memorable and alternate between standbys like forests and cliffs and bizarre, unsettling environments like a black and white town inhabited by ghosts or a creepy circus with ominous headstones detailing past events. The actual gameplay is simple but well executed and that the game remains entertaining throughout its entire run. You wield a broom to defend yourself against a variety of enemies, many of which are mostly harmless once you figure out their simple patterns. The boss battles are somewhat of a disappointment and tend to lack any sort of creativity or challenge to make defeating them feel rewarding, with the notable exception of the final boss. As a whole the game is fairly easy, with the only real difficulty coming in the form of some poorly implemented platforming segments. Each dungeon usually has some new mechanic for you to play around with, including one that is an actual maze and another that uses speed panels to help you jump further. There isn’t as much variety here as you’ll find in a lot of the classic Zelda games, but there is enough that the game prevents itself from becoming too repetitive. Simple puzzles end up blocking your progress in the various dungeons, but unfortunately most of them aren’t any more complicated than getting an enemy to stand on a switch.While Anodyne is clearly piggybacking on the classic Zelda games, it offers a unique experience and manages to find its own voice, even if that voice occasionally morphs into the high pitched scream of nightmare ghouls. Fans of the old school adventure games should definitely enjoy the combination of exploration and puzzles the game offers and Anodyne is a nice throwback to a type of game that you simply can’t find any more. The game does end up feeling a bit more like Zelda-lite than an actual Zelda title, and the actual gameplay and puzzle design lack the same creativity found in the wonky story and environments. Even with its flaws, this is a very impressive product from what was essentially a two man team and is worth checking out for anyone who still remembers how to find all the dungeons in the original Legend of Zelda.

												Writing this review such a long time after finishing Anodyne leaves me grasping to describe the game.Zelda by way of Earthbound seems to be a good summary though. Basic combat, sometimes awkward controls and movement set in a very unusual world that often tries to throw bizarre metaphors and philosophical discussions at your mute protagonist.At this point though, the few people who have not played the game would be remiss to pass up on the opportunity to play this delightfully unique game, especially with how often it is on sale and features in bundles. There's the enough challenges peppered throughout, accompanied by an effectively simple soundtrack and the dialogue does have a few moments of humour and insight.			"

												The Legend of Zelda is without any shred of doubt one of the most important and influential games ever made. Nintendo’s landmark release has inspired hundreds of games and mechanics within them, and you can't take two steps without hearing a developer site it as one of their biggest inspirations when developing their own games. Indie game Anodyne is one such example of a very close replication of LoZ's core gameplay, which isn't necessarily a bad thing in and of itself, but unfortunately fails to bring anything new to a very crowded table that results in but another poor attempt to recapture the magic of a classic.You take control of Young, a man who wakes up in an unknown realm called the Nexus. You are told that you must protect Briar from the darkness, but first must prove your worth by scouring the land for cards. And, that’s pretty much all you need to know. The story unravels in a nonlinear way, leaving much for you to deduce for yourself and numerous questions without straight answers. Unfortunately this initial air of mystery falls apart after you've progressed further into the game and come to realize the developers have no intention of ever answering or even elaborating on the many threads making up its haphazard plot.You run into a lot of characters during your travels, but none of them have anything relevant or useful to say. One of my biggest issues I had is that the dialog aspires to far more lofty and philosophical heights than it has any hope of reaching, ending up feeling pointless and pretentious, while at the same time completely throwing off the tone of the game. A lot of heavy subjects are brought up, from antisocial paranoia, to self worth and parental neglect, but they are never expanded upon or even discussed beyond a cursory overview (which comes across as forced and in poor taste).It’s clear this was a very personal experience for the writer behind the dialog, but putting all of your problems and insecurities into your game is a sure fire way to lose your audience. Adding to the disjointed tone is a bundle of worthless profanity that was unneeded and serves absolutely no purpose. I'm not sure why the developer felt the need to include random four letter words, as it doesn’t jell at all with the rest of the game, and even as someone not typically bothered by profanity felt a tad disgusted when presented with it in this context. The ending is the final nail in the coffin, coming completely out of left field and not giving even a remote sense of resolution. I will be the first person to advocate artistic expression, but the story fails on so many levels it had me wishing it hadn’t been included at all.From a gameplay perspective Anodyne fairs a bit better, but on the whole still fails to do enough with what it attempts. You spend your time split between exploring an overworld, collecting cards and filling out your map, and then dipping into dungeons which comprise some basic puzzles and the occasional boss fight. It's a formula that works, but in this case quickly becomes repetitive as you neither gain any new abilities, nor encounter consistently interesting puzzles to solve. So much of the game is comprised of nothing but wandering, that many areas feel like nothing but filler, featuring no purpose but to elongate your adventure and keep you away from the handful of smartly designed dungeons that could have made for a much tighter experience on their own.The extensive backtracking also contributes to much of your time feeling like a grind, occasionally even breaking the game as paths close and you become forced to retread even more ground taking the long way to wherever you were headed. Simply put, it's poor design that frustrates and belittles the player, dragging the experience on longer than it needed to be and making the enjoyable sections a lot farther apart. It's a shame because at times I really felt Anodyne was onto something, but each time my hopes were shot down as I cursed the many aggravating design decisions the developers made. Truth be told, there were moments when I actually did enjoy my time with the game. The true problem is, to reiterate, the fact that Anodyne does absolutely nothing we haven’t already seen and not well enough to compensate for its lack of innovation. It has it’s moments, but by and large feels all too familiar, and ultimately had me wondering why I was playing it instead of so many other games. I never felt compelled to continue, and I doubt it will be finished by most.If Anodyne does anything right, it’s the game’s music and art. The graphics wholly envelope the 16-bit era, with a wonderful pixel style that is both beautiful and varied. Each dungeon has it’s own look, from a noir inspired town, to a neon maze it is constantly evolving and giving you something new to look at. It may not all flow together, but it was the one thing that made me want to search out new dungeons.The other half of the presentation is the music, which does a great job of selling the somber, lonely tone of the story, even when the dialog can’t. From gentle piano melodies, to a pounding jungle beat, it is just a great set of songs, and some I could actually see myself listening to outside the game. They are that good, and easily the best part of the game. In the end though Anodyne left me wanting. Wanting for better levels, a better story, a better ending, but mostly, a better game. When I first began, I had little idea what to expect and was actually enjoying myself more than I would have expected. But as time went on, the gameplay never evolved, and the story only strayed farther and farther off course making me want to jump ship before it had completely sunk (which by the end it had definitely done.By the time the credits had rolled, I was all too happy to be able to wash myself of the experience. I don't say that lightly, and hate to have to be so critical, but I simply cannot advise anyone to play what was one of the most disappointing games I've experienced in a long time.			"

												This is a top down action adventure game ala the original Zelda or more specifically the game feels like Zelda: Link's Awakening with the simple color pallet, and music. The screen doesn't scroll. When you get to the edge, you go into a new screen, just like Zelda. Its very simple, with an attack button, movement buttons and a menu button. It has simple combat with a good variety of enemies, but there are also good puzzles that feel unique to this game. Things like using a broom to collect dust to place that dust to block things. Again, its very simple and easy. There is no hand holding with this game and you are free to figure things out yourself, BUT when new things are introduced they will bluntly tell you yes you can do this. Such as when you attack dust, it tells you, you've collected dust, attack again to place the dust. It will spoon feed you new things as most good games do, but it doesn't force you to do several tutorials. Once to test a new skill and that's it. The game lets you loose. It doesn't feel like you'll get lost, areas are pretty confined and you have a Zelda 1 like map, there are portals that let you quick travel.Like all Zelda games, there are keys that you'll need. Not just normal keys that open most locked doors, but specific keys to enter new areas. If that wasn't enough, you'll be collecting enemy cards. Enough of these cards will unlock specific gates with numbers on them. Along the way, you'll also find fairies or red insects that will not only fill your health, but also increase your health overall.The atmosphere of the game is very surreal or creepy, which is awesome, its a different flavor to Zelda that makes it feel unique. You're a janitor in a dark, surreal world. In fact, I think the game is trying to subtly hypnotize you with its music and sound effects like clicking, tick tocking and chimes. Nothing is really explained, it just is and I'm okay with that. I don't need a story, even if there are NPCs every so often to talk with.One drawback to the game on PC is that the screen is tall and narrow like an old school arcade cabinet. This tall resolution is because Anodyne is also an Android OS game. A fun Android game, but it doesn't help it on PC.In all, this game feels good and enjoyable. If you're into simple puzzles, action adventure and a SIMPLE old school Zelda that lets you explore a lot; this is for you. If you're into a complex, deep Zelda experience with a rich story, this game isn't for you.			"

												The weirdest adventure Zelda-esque game I have played in a long time. It is one of these games that, after you finish it, you end up: 1. Completely lost, knowing nothing of the hell happened; 2. Searching forums and webs, looking for interpretations, analysis, reviews, wanting to fully understand all the extremely strange stuff you just played. You can love it or being indifferent to it; for me was a worth experience.			"

												I wanted to like this game, I really did.  While I appreciate what the developers were striving for, I just can't recommend this game to others.  On the surface this appears to be a Zelda clone.  While that sounds promising, on delving deeper into this title nothing could be further from the truth.  While Zelda relies on great combat and clever puzzles, Anodyne relies on unfair combat and ridiculously hard platforming.  Enemies don’t stop in their tracks or bounce back when you hit them, so enemies that require numerous hits invariably result in damage to you as they just plow forward through your attacks.  In addition, the number of times you die from attempting next to impossible jumps becomes too much to bear.  Add in that native controller support simply does not work (in the forums the developers even go so far as to suggest getting a third party program such as xpadder or joy2key to make it work) even though partial controller support is listed on the store page, and I feel you have a product that could have used a lot more polishing before releasing on Steam.  For every moment of fun I experienced with this game, I experienced several more of frustration.  On a side note, towards the end of the game suddenly the F word appeared several times in dialog, whereas the rest of the game had been devoid of swearing.  While I have no problem with swearing in video games, I was playing through this game with my young niece and this sudden unexpected change in tone was not appreciated nor did it seem to fit the game.  Overall I would rank this game a 5/10.			"

												A mediocre 2D Zelda clone that managed to keep me hooked until the end, despite it's many flaws.It's missing a lot of what makes Zelda fun: tons of different usable items, engaging story, and clever overworld design (the maps seemed needlessly big and empty). But despite that it was still fun enough to play all the way through, and I'm glad I did because there were some surprisingly dark and memorable moments.Overall I recommend it only if you're craving a slightly watered down 2D Zelda experience.

												My feelings on the game are as follows, I appologize for the poor formatting:I really, really wanted to like this game. I enjoy the visual style and the classic Legend of Zelda type gameplay. There are many interesting areas in the game and amusing little tidbits that come from dialog and secrets, but they are spoiled by the convoluted, often repetetive parts that come between them. The mechanics always feel kind of off (you fight with a broom that you can only thrust forward, making combat feel awkward, *spoiler* the jump mechanic is introduced a little while into the game and to me, the length of the jump felt weird, etc.). You can play for a fairly long time without any story elements popping up, and when they do they're vague and make little sense, so I was personally not drawn in by the story, though others apparently were. I'll admit that I didn't finish the game, so maybe it comes together more closer to the end. If you have any questions, comment them and I'll try to respond (though this is my first review, so I don't even know if I can comment in response to your questions, I guess we'll find out).			"

												Anodyne is a top-down action/adventure game largely drawing from the SNES/Game Boy type of Legend of Zelda games for inspiration. You move between individual screens both in overworld and in dungeons, and fight enemies and solve puzzles in order to unlock new items which allow you to proceed.Anodyne is a rather charming, laid back game, but it didn't leave any particularly lasting impression on me. It was a nice throwback to a style of game which I once enjoyed, is a little self-aware but not annoyingly so, but the story seemed secondary to everything else and was more there to string together a series of set-pieces. The music was quite good.It's alright. If you enjoyed Link to the Past or Link's Awakening back in the day, it's worth a look, although moreso on sale when you can.			"

												A top-down action-adventure with great retro art style and awesome soundtrack. The fairly big world map has many environments to explore and its surreal settings and attention to detail keeps the visuals fresh and intriguing also with the help of the beautiful music.With smooth and responsive controls, the combat is simplistic and enjoyable. All you need to do is hit your foes hard with your trusty broom (which can be upgraded), and learn the patterns. There is a good variety of enemies and bosses (the final boss battle is pretty cool).Most of the puzzles are somewhat easy to overcome but fun nonetheless. In general, the difficulty is well balanced with some annoying exceptions (e.g., the platforms where you need to make diagonal jumps and one of the final puzzles).Anodyne is an entertaining experience and worth the asking price.

												Anodyne is a deliberate Zelda clone that takes the dreamy world of Link's Awakening and applies it to a more modern-day hero.  While providing a fun and tight gameplay experience, it also raises questions about the state of the Gamer generation, about friendship, and about fitting in.Although crippled by bugs (if you try to break the game, you will break the game), I highly recommended this for the colorful, retro visuals and the fantastic soundtrack.

												Stylistically, this reminded me a bit of Space Funeral, in a good way. It uses tried-and-true mechanics (with a bit of a spin) as part of its storytelling, but in a very subtle way.The story itself is difficult to follow. The main theme certainly seems to be about some self-centered individual who is in a constant cycle of breaking and mending a friendship with someone else. The story begins with us in the middle of one of the ""breaks"" in the friendship. Young, the player character, expects it to be easy to fix the friendship, but the friend, Briar, is savvy to the cycle and won't be so quick to forgive. Young's journey is a humbling one, as he has to come to terms with his imperfections in order to show Briar he has changed. However, we can assume the cycle will continue. At least... that's what I got out of the story.It's always tough with these sorts of surreal games to tell if it's just being weird for weird's sake or if everything has a specific meaning. However, this game at least stays consistent in its presentation, and for that much it's commendable.The writing is excellent, the visuals are gorgeous for pixel art, the soundtrack is great (and surprisingly deep), and though the game only has one real mechanic for puzzles, it continually finds ways to keep it fresh. Unfortunately, the game is VERY formulaic. It doesn't take long to figure out exactly how each area will play out: enter a region, explore every cell on the map, enter a dungeon, explore every cell on the map, collect cards, fight a boss, repeat.The dungeons themselves are designed impeccably and the overall pace is good enough that the predictability isn't too problematic. But occasionally I did roll my eyes upon entering a new area, thinking ""Well here we go again.""Still, if you like Legend of Zelda and games with a deeper thematic experience than average, I can't recommend this highly enough.

												Anodyne is a top-down dungeon crawler with SNES style graphics.Your quest in Anodyne is to save the Land from the darkness that has come over it in the form of The Briar. Throughout the game you face many bosses who seem to know deep truths about who you really are. They hint at the fact that you play video games to escape from reality, and that one day you will have to learn how to deal with people.The collecting aspect of the game is very engaging. You must collect cards and keys in order to unlock new areas.Anodyne offers a beautifully realized SNES-like game world. It has a intriguing story and there are some really great songs that capture the mood of the game quite well.Anodyne is a good designed old school adventure game and a perfect choice for those who liked the old Zelda games.Sounds 9/10Graphics 4/10Gameplay 7/10Atmosphere 8/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

Anodyne feels like an homage to The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening, but everything is just very... strange. Just like the classic Zelda game, it's played from a top-down perspective and many of the enemies are even based on similar enemies from the Zelda series. Some of the dialog is even a direct reference to Link's Awakening.Young, the character you play as, wields a trusty broom instead of a sword. Sometimes the broom must be used to push around piles of dust in order to solve simple puzzles. These puzzles never feel to be the main focus, though, and there's an unexpected amount of jumping obstacles in many of the dungeons. You discover a few add-ons for your broom throughout the game, but that's the limit of the items you can use.You travel through varied environments and have many odd encounters. Throughout the game, the mood shifts between being slightly ""off"" to very wrong. It's hard to explain, but here's an example: in one dungeon, there are inexplicably a bunch of identical-looking men that just wander the screen. You can't speak to them or attack them, but they stop your movement and you can push them out of the way. Whenever these men are on screen, there is a creepy sound effect. At another point in the game, you walk down a dock to a fisherman. When you press the button to try to talk to him, Young instead pushes him into the lake and he drowns in a bloody whirlpool. Even later, you must kill a bunch of townspeople so a guy will let you into his house. It's some very odd stuff, and much of it is accompanied by a somewhat creepy atmospheric soundtrack without much of a melody.As a big fan of classic 2D Zelda games, I was excited to try out Anodyne. It's definitely a unique experience. Gameplay-wise, it never feels as well-polished as your typical Zelda game, but I did enjoy my time with it for the most part. There were a few times when I got lost and had to consult some maps online, though. At the very end of the game, I found that I had to get 36 of the hidden ""cards"" to progress. Fortunately I had gotten most of them while playing through, but it could have been particularly frustrating if I hadn't been collecting them throughout my game.			"

												A throwback to the old topdown legend of zelda games. Because of a relatively short story length, the repetative nature of the combat and puzzles does not become frustrating. I personally wad not a fan of some of the bossfights and the discrepancy of difficulty between most of the early bosses being a cakewalk but a couple, including the final boss, being annoyingly difficult for no adequite reason. there are only 6 achievements and three of those come from the main story, while the other three are from the additional achieveable content and gameplay. Overall i would give this game an 8/10, it was well written and ended as soon as it needed to to not overstay its welcome.			"

												Anodyne is a zelda-like with a strange unsettling themed world. I really don't have a grasp on what's going on yet other than I'm in a strange place trying to open portals to different areas. The HUD and the gameplay are exactly like Zelda classic. Your weapon is a broom which can be used to hit enemies, but also can pick up dust on the ground and place it for platform puzzles. You search areas for dungeons which you can enter and complete puzzles to fight a big boss. The art style is pretty classic 16-bit low resolution pixels. The beginning music is really annoying but the music from areas I'm in now are getting better. The programming/UI itself seems glitchy and could use some polish, but the engine is actually pretty good. Honestly, I'm enjoying it so far. I just wish I had a better grasp on what was going on. Also nothing has really jumped out at me as being awesome that separates it from Zelda. It's really just 100% Zelda clone so far with a strange feeling of unease.			"

												Brilliantly dreamt up but executed with a few flaws. The atmosphere surrounding this game is incredible, unbelievably oneiric. This game is pretty polished and will definitely be enjoyed anyone who has loved top-down Zelda games (Link to the Past, Oracle of Seasons/Ages, etc). Made for the older crowd, it has a few suggestive themes that seem oddly places but shouldn't hamper gameplay. The polish seems to wear off near the end with the final stages/chapters (don't want to spoil anything) yet keeps a good incentive for those that want to go back into the game. Personally, I enjoyed the first time through and would love to see a spiritual successor by the creators. Two thumbs up.			"

												Dreams are pretty common tropes in all sorts of media, which is unfortunate because they're rarely used well. Too many games and movies and books use dreams as a cheap shock or an easy way to spill characterization, ignoring the unique sensations and aesthetic of the subconscious. The developers behind Anodyne didn't take the easy way out here, because they've crafted an expansive dreamscape to explore that actually feels like the product of an unquiet mind. And not only that, they built a fun and engaging game on top of that hook.Anodyne is the story of Young, a... youthful, platinum-haired fellow plumbing the depths of his own subconscious. I won't go into anymore detail than that, but the diverse cast of characters you'll come across in your surreal trip will happily fill in the gaps for you, even if it doesn't seem like it at the time. You'll control Young in a manner very similar to classic Legend of Zelda, from a top-down and pixellated perspective. While most of the game is exploring the strange and meaningful world, there is some combat to be had with your trusty broom and some puzzling, including some occasionally challenging platforming.The world of Young's mind is the big draw here, because it does a magnificent job of approximating a series of dreamscapes. I mean, it's going to be different for everyone of course but Anodyne nails the universal logic of dreams, the seemingly inexplicable connections and non-sequiturs that do indeed represent events in the waking world. You'll start in pleasant, wind-swept meadows and mossy ruins but soon find yourself in impossibly-sprawling apartment complexes, twisting dungeons, ghostly towns, and stranger places still. They exist as real places would in a dream but connect and change in unexpected ways, lending them that key sensation of mystery and unfamiliarity.It's not a horror game but the way that every location and creature is a little bit off gives a feeling of foreboding to the adventure. And there are definitely some horrifying things that happen, so that feeling is not at all unjustified. The low-key soundtrack helps a lot here too, setting the tone just right for your imagination to run wild. As you progress the environments get stranger and the creatures spout more nonsense, but it really does come together in the end to give you an idea of what it's all speaking to.I've gone on a bit much about the atmosphere, but the gameplay is plenty solid enough to keep it entertaining. Young is spry and controls well, allowing you to weave around tricky foes and pummel them with your broom. You'll find upgrades to your weapon and mobility as well, along with collectible cards that provide additional insight on the world's denizens. Save points are plentiful and there's an expansive fast-travel system for the expansive world, so don't worry about missing key items or dying at inopportune times.There's hardly anything to criticize here if you're down for a journey into the surreal. The story is good, the gameplay is tight, and the environments are crafted with expert care. It'll last you a few hours even if you don't go hunting for every little secret, too. I love great atmosphere and I love great gameplay, so I can barely contain my excitement for any title that combines the two. Anodyne is an excellent adventure game from top to bottom, and one of the few to really do dreamscapes justice.			"

												Cute little A-RPG obviously inspired by 2D Zelda games.Everything about it is very dream-like, from the environment to the soundtrack. Some of it made me feel a bit nostalgic and sad while sometimes it was just eerie.It's difficult to make sense of the story but you do kind of get the idea. Do keep in mind that this is supposed to be your character's subconscious. It will make allusions to real life and how your character, Young, is just trying to stay out of it.Even though it's left to interpretation quite a bit, it doesn't feel like one of these very artsy games that makes no sense no matter how you look at it and that any vague interpretation could somewhat match. It's dreamy but still fairly obvious.The game never feels exceptional but it's fun to go through. It shows multiple good example of game design where the game will show you that something is possible rather than tell you. You learn from doing and looking rather than reading.Puzzles were never overly elaborate or complicated but required enough thinking that it felt satisfying to solve them most of the time. Some enemies were difficult enough to be challenging without being frustrating.The only thing I liked less of the game is the lack of ""tracking"". The lack of direction it has is perfectly fine as it just reinforces the exploration and adventure part. But there are some stuff that you will need to go back to later on in the game and the only thing the game tracks is where you've been. It would have been cool to see how many chests/cards you've obtained in each area. I found myself 2 or 3 cards short from being able to access the last area and just looked them up since I didn't feel like exploring every area I've been to another time.Otherwise, it was a really mysterious and cool experience. Although it borrows a lot from Zelda, don't expect this game to be one, just similar in some regards.Takes about 6 hours or so to finish, without skipping anything before the end of the game (there are some extra stuff once you're done). Considering this, 11$ might be a tad expensive but definitely get it if it's on sales.Update:Followed a friend's advice and went back to get the remaining cards. I have to say, this further improve my opinion on this game.I initially thought it would be a chore, the sort of collectible you see in every AAA that serve no purpose other than extend the play time.I'll avoid spoiling anything but after completing Anodyne, you are given a tool which allows you to... Reach places you couldn't reach before. ...Including places you shouldn't reach.It's surprisingly cool to go back and try to find anything you could have missed, especially the way that you're able to. There's something hard to describe about it... It's kind of like spying, seeing things you're not sure you should see. It's the same feeling as whenever you use debug functions or any sort of ""wall hack"" in a game and start seeing stuff that are no visible in the main game.It made me remember all the time I spent exploring in Ocarina of Time with glitches. Or lookin at all the unused content. Except in Anodyne, it's actually part of the game. There are a bunch of areas that are not accessible in the ""normal"" game, and a lot of hidden goodies in them!I'm glad I went back, this made me like this game a lot more than I already did.			"

ANODYNE is an ordinary game, probably worth a try only if you are a fan of the genre. Gameplay is rather boring and controls are often a nuisance. The story is hard to understand and it makes it uninteresting. Levels' design varies nicely and it is the most pleasant aspect of the game and its strongest point.STORYStory is either too hard to understand or poor. Whatever the reason is it makes it hard to keep track of what's going on. It could might as well have had no sense at all as the game is made in a dream-like style. It means it could have been just as abstract as the dream itself (which would make an interesting concept if it's true). The humor was nice, there were a few places where I had a good laugh.GAMEPLAYBasically the game is about exploring, looking for collectibles, solving puzzles and fighting.EXPLORING. The world is build of many different areas, areas are build of levels. Levels are screen-wide squares, you can see one level at the time and you move from level to level. The biggest problem here is lack of a proper map. Sure you have a symbolic map but it's just gray squares. It shows only how levels in the area you're actually in are connected, nothing more. It means you have to wander through the levels until you memorize what's where. It's important because it's an open world and you will have to come back to the same places a few times. Too much walking could make you feel a little bored.COLLECTIBLES. In order to progress you have to find cards which will open the gates to the next areas or locked levels.PUZZLES. Most of the puzzles are easy. However the game won't hold your hand and you'll have to learn everything yourself. Puzzles varies in different areas which is nice.FIGHTING. There are different kinds of enemies and you have to adapt to their style of fighting. It's rather simple though. Also every boss has it's own style but they're not that difficult either. Your biggest enemy will be the controls. I've died so many times becuase my character didn't do what I wanted or because I've jumped into the hole.VISUALSIt's very retro pixel art style so you have to be a fan of it to appreciate it. For sure diverse design of the areas is simply the greatest point of this game. Black and white town will always remain in my mind for its creepy and unique atmosphere.SOUNDEverything about this game is a love letter to the old consoles and so is the music. Again, you just have to be a fan to appreciate it. As far as I remember every area had its own, quite short music samples but nothing really remained in my head.			"

												It's as if you had a dream, You're playing A link to the past and then wake up playing a different game. The Zelda classics influence has seeped into Anodynes subconscious and is better for it. Even within the first hour the areas you encounter are varied but share a distinct ambient feel reminiscent of Addams Family Values for the SNES and A Link to the Pasts penchant for tooled puzzles. The music pushes curiosity and retains a sense of exploration and puzzlement as the text is cryptic and at times humorous leading you to one area after another. My one nitpick is that the game may be a bit too easy, or at least for those who've been around top down RPG's like Zelda before. None the less there are not enough games the can be played for simple exploration and promote more relaxation that hard grinding and I'd recommend it to any fans of Zelda or someone who's looking for a game to sit and chill with at night.

												Anodyne is a old school Zelda clone with♥♥♥♥♥♥poor gameplay but really, really cool atmosphere. The atmosphere in this game is really well done, the music mixed with the 16 bit graphics and unusual level setting made it a really interesting game to play. That being said the gameplay is just terrible. Unlike the SNES Zelda games the combat feels clunky and unprecise but nothing that I couldn’t suffer through, that is until I got the ability to jump. The jump mechanic and the jump puzzles in this game are game ruining. The jumping is uncontrollable and extremely variable, there’s no telling how far you’re going to jump or really where you’ll land. Any fun I was having before the jumping went out the window when I got the shoes, which is a shame. This game could have been really good if it had more polish.			"

												It's definitely a nice, well-detailed game exploring the subconscious thoughts of Young, the main character. If it were just that, I would definitely recommend this without a second thought.However, when the game gives up on providing even the basest amount of a narrative, tells you to 'just fetch these 36 cards, then we'll let you finish the game', and starts throwing out some of the most irritating jumping puzzles I've seen in a while, I kind of start thinking about how much better this would be as a novel. Mainly because it's undesirable and almost impossible to implement a jumping puzzle in a novel.It's a very narrow 'not recommended', because there were more jumping puzzles that were irritating than there was crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥to justify continuing to play this game.

												Anodyne is a Zelda-style action game where you explore surreal areas and crawl through dungeons. I really couldn't bring myself to finish this game. While the environments are neat and a bit unsettling, the game's puzzles are really poorly designed and the controls are sub-par, which made this a really frustrating experience. In addition, the map is completely labyrinthine. I had no idea where I should be going, the map was useless, and I pretty much immediately got lost.The star of this game is the aesthetic. It mostly sticks to the 16-bit style, and it does it well most of the time. The music is mostly ambient and a little creepy, which really hammers in the unease. As for the story, well, there's almost none to speak of.Ultimately, though, I found I couldn't forgive the game's serious gameplay flaws. If you think the aesthetic alone will be worth the price of entry, then you might really enjoy this game, but otherwise, there are many better ways to spend your money.			"

Posted: September 30, 2016
												This is a fairly lengthy review- skip to the end for a summary.I purchased Anodyne in a bundle back in 2013, played it for 10-15 minutes and then decided I wasn't enjoying the game enough to continue. I had barely even entered the first dungeon: the slow pace and Zelda overtones to the gameplay weren't terribly interesting to me.About a week ago I decided to give the game another shot- and honestly, my opinion didn't really change too much for a while! Exploration was mildly annoying with the room structure showing *most* passages between rooms. There are a few places where the map doesn't include a connection, and a few places where a connection is shown but can't be accessed for quite some time. There's even at least one place accessible early on that has a room that can't be reached until after you've beaten the game.The slow pace doesn't really pick up either, though the many uses for the dustballs placed throughout the world (puzzles, action, etc.) were cleverly put together. The level design overall isn't bad by any stretch, but it mostly felt... bland for the first half of the game. Perfectly servicable, but nothing too special.What kept me playing despite the overall averageness of the game at this point was a combination of two things: achievements, and wanting to see what other surreal areas there were. The red sea/hellscape area in particular is what I stumbled upon early, and kept me playing the game. That's no small feat, to keep someone playing just off of what *might* be encountered next, so kudos to the devs for that. The cliffs dungeon and end of the acrobat/circus dungeon, as well as the entirety of the town area were quite unsettling: notably, the circus area was the last dungeon I completed, so to have something still unnerving even after the rest of the game is again quite impressive. A+ for atmosphere.The final area was fairly underwhelming in comparison. First the easiest boss in the game, then an obtuse puzzle that's actually pretty cool, then a bunch of annoying platforming sections (the speed boosters and gas spewers in particular were frustrating to work around), then a bunch of combat sections, and then the final boss. The soundtrack here is very unfitting, and the fight comes down to safespot for 15 or so seconds, then either misdirect fire into dust or play tennis with an iceball. Meh. The ending itself... well, it's clearly meant to be symbolic of something, and maybe I don't get it, but it was pretty underwhelming. I would have preferred if the game ended after Sage, or even the Swap puzzle.Combat is very simple. Attack with broom, avoid contact with enemies, avoid projectiles. Except when lions breathe fire in a way that can't be dodged or the lack of knockback makes some enemies trade hits. Probably the most questionably designed aspect of Anodyne.Now, I mentioned the Swap. This one mechanic is what really shines here.You're able to grab any two tiles (that you can reach) and swap their locations.You can literally remake the world. (though it resets when changing screens)You can get out of bounds basically anywhere (and there are secrets scattered throughout the world that can only be reached with this, or glitches)The true ending of the game, even past the final boss, is an impassable gate that requires 49 cards. (There are only 48 total, including 11 only accessible after the swap. One of these is in a debug area where you can talk to avatars of the devs, one of which alludes to beating the game in 20 minutes...)Now, this area doesn't allow swap usage and has a small platform off to the right. It's completely unattainable...except there are 2 different glitchy methods that can be used to reach it. Doing so awards card 49. You can then pass through the 49 card gate... and promptly get a garbled message and see a truly impassable 50 card gate.That's the true ending, at least to me. Like the post-final boss ending, it's very open to interpretation, and maybe this one just resonated with me more. That even after everything, even after gaining every ability possible and using every known trick, there's still going to be something unattainable. The careful placement definitely demonstrates the porperty of diminishing returns: that putting in a lot more effort will sometimes only yield a marginal increase in output.The achievement design ties into that as well: there's only 6, which is very few for this sort of game. Most games would award an achievement for each dungeon in turn, and it's refreshing to see it done differently. The first is obtained within 5 minutes of starting the game. The second is obtained halfway through the game- halfway! The third is obtained on beating the game, and another follows if everything was collected. The fifth is awarded for finding all 48 cards by thoroughly searching the out of bounds areas- this was the high point of the game for me.The final achievement is awarded for meeting the first 100% requirement within 3 hours, and this is where everything ties together beautifully. Now, I'm a speedrunner at heart. I like playing through games over and over for faster times. I could definitely see myself doing that with Anodyne, both for 100% and any% glitchless.And all because of one simple reason.The swap is essentially unlocked by beating the game.Finding card 49 requires working out the 'wiggle glitch'.The wiggle glitch can be used virtually anywhere.It can be used to skip the broom.You can skip the jump bootsYou can also skip getting the swap.You can even skip the final boss and go straight to the ending screen.Doing this after picking up the broom and the swap will allow you to play the entire game with the swap- and this makes the 100% speedrun target much easier. Took me a little over an hour and it was by no means perfect- remaking the world as I went was a lot of fun, and I even found a few bits of lore that I had missed on my first playthrough.tl;drAnodyne is merely decent from a gameplay perspective. However, where it shines is the surreal and unsettling sections, the entire postgame, and potentially philosophical endings. Anodyne is one of those experiences that's proportionally enjoyable to what you're willing to put into it. The best part by far is the postgame, but it can take a lot of effort to get to that point and even then, exploration and experimentation are key. Given the chance to grab this game at a discount, I'd say go for it. It's well worth it.			"

												Anodyne is small, 2d-Zelda-like game. It remindes me a lot of Links Awakening, with the world being a dream and the jumping-puzzles, although the latter being much more present in this game.It is quiet simple, your only weapon is a broom. Enemies have a good variety and the levels are very well designed, especially the dungeons. They require some thinking to solve the puzzles and the game does not hold your hand, which I think is good. Reminded me of the old times and the feeling figuring out on yourself is very rewarding. Half-way through the game you get jumping boots and thats where the game got frustrating for me. The controls are very spongy and the jumps require pixel-perfect jumps, sometimes under pressure: jumping on one-tile-platforms with rolling bars of death? So much fun, especially when you realize that you get knocked back every time you get hit. The story is very confusing and the writing keeps it that way. I'm not sure if I get it at all or it was deliberate that way, since it all happens in a dream and dreams don't always make sense. Still it reminds me somewhat of the story of Links Awakening, the bosses seem to warn you that be beating them, you will eventually destroy the whole world - at least thats what I got from it.If you like the old, 2d-Zelda games, Anodyne is very well done spin on it. Especially the dungeons are very well designed, but the jumping puzzles can get frustating.			"

												Hmm. On one hand, I did enjoy the game. The Zelda-like description for gameplay is pretty accurate; top-down exploration, venturing through dungeons, powering up (although this game is a bit simpler than Zelda in terms of attacks and abilities). The plot was interesting; a bit obtuse at times, but overall an interesting take on what I assume to be self-reflection and issues with depression and anxiety. I enjoyed it... but I'm not sure there's $10 worth of play time here unless you're a 100% completionist or if what you've read about the plot speaks to you on a personal level. If it goes on sale at all though, I'd say give it a shot.			"

												Wow, this game captures everything you love about Zelda! ... except for the ""fun"" part.The overworld is twice as big as an old-school Zelda game, and ten times more empty. Just because there's a lot of space on the map doesn't mean that walking around it is ""exploring."" There's not much to discover, not many enemies to fight, and well over an hour in I don't understand who I am, where I am, what I'm suppoed to be doing... which would be fine, except that there's also no compelling air of mystery. I don't WANT to know those things. I don't WONDER about them. All there is is a bunch of lame ""meta"" jokes that would be charming if the game itself were interesting enough to get meta about it.I'm sure it gets better if you play it longer, but why would you? It's PAINFULLY boring.Music and graphics are legitimately great though, I'll give it that.			"

												Huge fan of Link's Awakening on Game Boy. I probably beat it 4-5 times as a kid.Anodyne is directly influenced by LA in many ways, and other Zelda titles. A sort of postmodern Zelda for an older audience.Mechanics and art style are spot on in this vein. Challenging puzzles, unique environments and dungeons.Also a lot of good humor.Highly recommended.

												Anodyne borrows heavily from early Legend of Zelda, but manages to stand on its own just fine. A lot of familiar mechanics are present here: pressing buttons, running through mazes, solving light puzzles, and jumping across holes. However instead of a large repertoire of gadgets and items, Anodyne sticks with one main weapon and a very small amount of items. The mechanics, from boss fighting to exploring, are largely focused around platforming. Jumping at the right time and angle will be essential at certain points of the game. Given the game's rather brief life, it is understanble that gadgets and mechanics are kept fairly contained.Layered on top of the game is a bizarre narrative. There is certainly some failed humor every now and then, but you will also receive eerie messages, cryptic details, and what seems like nonsense. Also included among the dialog and regular text are the cards hidden throughout the game that act as indirective narrative. It is certainly an intriguing aspect, but don't expect to be rewarded with sure answers.Anodyne is not without its flaws though. The mix of humor, nonsensical dialogue and strange text will definitely turn away some players. The art style might scream Legend of Zelda, but this adventure has been pared down quite a bit and this is most noticeable through the lack progression and gadgets. For those of you that like secrets there are some pretty extensive ones here, but if you are wanting everything up front, a large portion of the game is kept hidden away.With a charming aesthetic and surreal narrative, Anodyne is a neat hidden gem. Those that like some mystery and an adventure that's smaller in scope compared to Link's adevntures will get the most out of this one.			"

												This game has a good recipe for  success, but poor level design really makes it hard to recommend. Pretty much all of the ""puzzles"" in the game are a fork in the road. One way leads to the gate, the other way leads to the switch to unlock said gate. You have to constantly backtrack because you either take the way with the locked gate at the end, making you backtrack to the switch, or you go the way with the switch to open the gate, in which you have to backtrack anyway to get back to the locked gate. It's pointless and annoying and the game makes you do it over and over and over and over and over and over throughout every puzzle. Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?There are also tons of dead ends in the overworld map, and a large amount of empty spaces that serve no purpose other than to make the map bigger. The overworld maps also have gates and switches in them, and a lot of them just make no sense. There's one that's literally four connected tiles, and if you go clockwise, you run into a gate. If you go counterclockwise, you run into the switch. There are no enemies in the way, and there is absolutely nothing even in the area to collect. Why do they exist there? It's the most asinine padding ever.This game loves to waste your time for no reason. There are other ways it wastes your time, but I've wasted enough time talking about it.			"

												Really not sure what to think of this game.At first play, it's a quaint little Zelda clone where you use a broom instead of a sword.Once you go a bit deeper, it's a depressing manifesto of the dev's psyche.Once you beat it though, it's pretty disappointing. You'd think that with the story setup and the way that the dialogue progresses from the mid- to late portions of the game, the narrative would evolve and culminate into something worthwhile at the end.It doesn't.Pros:+Decent writing (mostly)+Good pixel art+Good music+Solid Gameboy-era Zelda gameplayCons:-Too easy, though occasionally frustrating (not exactly challenging, though)-Too short-Pointless endingIf you need to waste 5 hours and 5 bucks, go for it. Definitely not worth 10. Given the default price point, I have to unfortunately rate this game ""not recommended"", as it caused me just as much frustration as it did joy. Not quite worth it for the narrative, not quite worth it for the gameplay. Pick it up on a really, really good sale.			"

												Anodyne is a charming, whatever-bit retro adventure game where you play as a little dude with a broom cleaning up dimensions. The plot and the characters dialogue is a little too self-referential in the humor sometimes, but otherwise it's a fairly compelling story. The gameplay is rudimentary but intentionally so, and from my moderate time with the game I can tell it's gonna be one of those back-track intensive titles where you pass a door midway through the first area that can only be opened with a key found in the second to last boss fight. Not necessarily a bad thing but something to consider if you're looking to pickup this game for a quick playthrough.			"

												A top-down adventure game like The Legend of Zelda, but with a darker and more mysterious atmosphere and a lot of hidden content at the end. For $10, I was really happy with what I got out of this game. It's a pretty solid adventure game, but what really fascinated me was the stuff you can find if you poke around after you beat the game. It's hard to say more about it, really. The only downside is that if you're hoping for some kind of deeper meaning to the story and the darkness that permeates it, well...you're not going to get one, and that's a shame, I think, because it feels like there should be something.I really enjoyed it anyway, though, so don't let that dissuade you too much.

												POTENTIAL SPOILER ALERTQuite a strange game. Provides insight into the mentality of the person who whittles away their youth playing video games rather than engaging with the outside world, to the detriment of personal development or even mental health. It does this only halfway, however, as it effectively backs out of this angle around the end, with the final exchange of the game basically being ""okay, let's go get tacos lol"". And, really, aside from this element of the game, it is insanely forgettable. Have you playing Zelda? Okay, it will seamlessly blend into your memories of this game. The name Anodyne, then, is quite interesting, as it means ""Serving to alleviate pain"" as well as ""not likely to offend anyone"". The insights provided in the storyline are much what any gamer will have internally going on regardless, but...the gameplay is fairly inoffensive. Irritating with how difficult it is to pull off certain manuevers, but I have difficulty even remembering this game's existence until I see it in my Library. I sunk 8 hours in playing it, so it was worth the investment, but I still would not say one should go in expecting too much. Overall, a recommendation with some reservations.			"

												Anodyne capitalizes on an oft-neglected area of nostalgia: handheld Zelda games. When I was growing up, one of my favorite games was Link's Awakening. I liked it more than the other Zeldas because of the unique dreamlike atmosphere it had. Anodyne copies the gameplay, and doubles down on the atmosphere to an astonishing degree. It's a truly unique specimen.The gameplay is about what you'd expect. Walk around, solve puzzles, hit things with a melee weapon (In this case a broom, not a sword). It will feel particularly Zelda-y at first, but it begins to gain its own identity as time goes on. At first I considered the game's lack of items to be its biggest flaw, but on further consideration I think this is part of what gives it its identity. The limited number of options give the combat and puzzles a certain ""purity"" to them. There are no ways to ""cheat,"" no easy way to win, just you and the challenge presented by the game. It's extra impressive since the difficulty curve is very smooth, and provides some genuine challenge by the end. Kudos to the level designers.The game takes several notes from Links Awakening, but it is not the only card that Anodyne has to play. As you progress further into the game, more and more levels appear that are influenced by other games. There are levels that remind me of Earthbound, Last Survivor, LIMBO, and a lot of Yume Nikki. In fact, Anodyne's hopping between mysterious dream worlds with different art styles is eerily similar to Yume Nikki. A couple of level themes are even shared between the two. I found Yume Nikki's lack of gameplay very disappointing the first time I played it (I have since gained a greater appreciation), and Anodyne fixes essentially all the issues that I had with it. Calling it ""Yume Nikki with story and gameplay"" isn't quite correct, but it should give you a good idea of if this game would appeal to you. If you like Zelda, Yume Nikki, surreality, exploration, atmosphere, or just a well constructed game, I'd highly recommend it.			"

												Anodyne is an action-adventure game by Sean Hogan and Jonathan Kittaka, released in February 2013. The game seems to be inspired by the old Zelda games in terms of gameplay and features a nostalgic pixel art. The game is all about exploring the dream world of the protagonist, who goes by the name of Young. The player uses a broom for combat and very few other items to proceed through the story. The goal of Anodyne is to collect a certain amount of cards, which are spread all over the world and often require solving puzzles and fighting enemies to progress to the end area of the game.My first playthrough through this game went fairly fast, there were only a few stages that required some grinding. Considering that, I was happily surprised by the final boss fight, which in my opinion had an adequate level of difficulty. Also there were a few cards that required to solve rather challenging puzzles, but you don't need to collect all cards to finish the game, so that only comes into consideration if you intend to complete the game 100%. If so, the secret ""???"" items are also very difficult to find and obtain, even if you use a guide.I really liked the story of Anodyne, even though the dialogues sometimes screwed that up for me, but that's just a small downside to the otherwise so mystic atmosphere and the dream-like feeling which this game provides. All that is underlined by the enchanting pixel art and incredibly suitable and admirable music. This game possibly has one of my favourite gaming music pieces of all time.All of this matches up to the foggy surreality that makes this game so fascinating for me and which is why I would recommend this game to you. I don't want to spoil anyone's appetite too much, so all I can say is: If you like exciting stories, you should get this game.			"

												First off, I would say this game is worth the $10 price tag, but ONLY if you are a Zelda fan and/or indie adventure games. Otherwise, WAIT UNTIL IT'S ON SALE!! The combat and puzzle solving elements were good, but pretty much only because it was like that of Legend of Zelda's from the various Gameboy/NES games, a few of which I have played before and loved. So only get this if you're feeling nostalgic and want to feel like playing a Zelda-like game.I played Anodyne from start to finish, and overall was disappointed because I was expecting a lot more out of the story, when it turned out that there really wasn't much of one. You have no idea about the the world around you, your character's motive, the main villain, or any friendly NPC. Anodyne isn't even bolstered with loveable characters, since there are very few major ones and you rarely interact with them. Almost every piece of dialogue is a dumb pun or a lame ironic joke, which was endearing and cute in the beginning in small doses, but was VERY overused throughout the entirety of the game and ended up being obnoxious and empty quips.The game tries and fails to form a backstory by inserting weird item/descriptions and strange character dialogue in an attempt to be cool and mysterious (much like the Dark Souls games do, except Dark Souls actually succeeds at doing so), but these numerous parts don't actually amount to anything except a pile of vague foreshadowing that alludes to nothing. One glaring example of this is the title of the game, which a quick Google search resulted in the definitions ""not likely to provoke dissent or offense; inoffensive, often deliberately so"" or ""a painkilling drug or medicine."" Neither of these definitions has any apparent significance to the story, characters, or setting of the game.The game seemed cool because I like adventure games, especially those in the Zelda series, but the game seemed to lose direction the more I played it, concerning the story and the world that the creators were trying to build. This resulted in a mediocre game that I finished only because of cool monster designs, Zelda-like gameplay, and my unhealthy love of puzzles.			"

												Anodyne is not the greatest game and actually it is kind of average on the surface, but two things kept me playing throughout the entire game: the music and the art. The music was great; a lot of it is very creepy and all of it fits the perfectly with each environment. The artwork, on the other hand, is your typical 8-bit style, but something about it really grooves with me.Where it gets bad is the controls. There are several points in the game where you must platform your way through some room but the controls just are not solid enough, it can become very frustrating. The gameplay is also your Zelda style adventure game; platforming, puzzles and some simple combat and boss fights. This is not really a complaint, since I love the Zelda style games.Overall the controls are frustrating at worst, but the music, art, and style kept me engaged. It is not for everyone, but for a cheap price I would recommend it.			"

												Do you like Zelda games? Odds are, you'll like this too.Anodyne is a definite Zelda clone, but that's not a bad thing. Like Zelda, it has a (kinda) open world for you to explore, with a number of dungeons to keep you busy inbetween. While I wouldn't say that the music is iconic, the soundtrack does create an excelent atmosphere throughout the entire game. (I found myself humming along to one of the overworld themes.)The game looks great and controls very smoothly. And it is certainly not without its challenges. I can't say it's the hardest game of its type that I've played, not by a long shot, but it's certainly far from being easy. The game isn't ALL upsides though. More than once when playing, I felt that some of the difficulty seemed... artificial. what I mean by that is, I felt on quite a few occasions that a part of the game was hard because it was annoying or repeditive, instead of actually challenging my skill at the game. that said, this wasn't a thing that happened OFTEN, but just barely enough for me to notice.Another possible issue is the length. I haven't beaten the game yet, but after just 2 hours of gameplay, I'm at the halfway point of the game. So, if short games bother you, you may want to overlook this one.All in all, I'd give this game an 8/10			"

												Recommended to me by a friend who said it was very similar to the Legend of Zelda games of old. I fear he may have been being disingenuous because this is only superficially similar to those treasures. Gone are the varied and complex puzzles, the wide assortment of tools and weapons, to be replaced with tests that a monkey could solve and a broom, respectively. It tries to cover for weak gameplay with an assortment of meta humor but it comes across as kind of cloying. It admittedly does have some very interesting and atmospheric areas later in the game but I really only got there by trudging forward disregarding the fact that I wasn't really enjoying myself all that much. I bought it because I'd seen various people singing it's praises but in the end I wasn't at all impressed. It wasn't bad by any measure but it's also nowhere near as good as they say it is or as clever as it thinks it is. Buy it on sale, if at all because the one thing that I can applaud it for is that the developers have stated that they're fine with people pirating it if they want to play it.			"

TLDR  Enjoyment ★★★★☆   100% Difficulty ★★☆☆☆ 21:9 SupportNo (fixed-size window)ExperienceA great exploration game for people with autistic tendencies. Spent 30+ hours in post-game because I was so bent on unearthing all the secrets on my own, yet failed to do so and ultimately had to consult a walkthrough due to some uncalled-for post-game content design. (Go AFK for 2 hours to unlock a secret chest? Kudos to whoever figured this♥♥♥♥♥♥out...)For those normal minds who don't suffer from this kind of obsession, or simply are not genuinely interested in the post-game, the main quest still offers a decent Zelda-like experience that one can expect to enjoy to a great extent.CommentaryOstensibly, Anodyne reminded me of Seedling and a bunch of other low-budget, low-profile indie Zelda-likes whose names I could no longer recall; however, it didn't take long for me to realize my mistake, for the game was something far from dull and possessed the magic to completely draw me in. While the adventure would lead us to various beguiling places throughout the protagonist's oneiric world, it's the intricate maze design on par with top commercial titles in the genre that ultimately captivated my heart. The existence of several deliberately included tricks and ""glitches""[anodyne.wikia.com] (and - I don't see this one being mentioned very often, but you can actually jump over two tiles at once with the right timing, which helps in quite a few situations) that are crucial to uncovering wilder and ever wilder secrets in the post-game quest also hits right in the sweet spot for those of us adventurous and obsessive souls.That being said, the game is not without its flaws. The lack of an immersive backstory, or even, a coherent narrative, is perhaps the single greatest shame of the title, barring it from becoming something truly memorable. It has also occurred to me that the post-game adventure didn't really actually belong to the game world any more; it didn't involve extra stories or supplemental lore or anything that could help explain or expand on the title, but rather felt like something totally out of context, hashed together simply for the sake of being put there. Such a pity, considering the game's potential.Still, there's no denying that this is gonna be a fun game for most people. Also, as I was able to complete the speedrun challenge in 2 hours and 1 minute (with world maps open in my browser), difficulty-wise the game is suitable for gamers from every skill level. So why not give it a try - maybe you'll find yourself enjoying getting lost in Young's dreamland as well!			"

The game ran just fine and had good remappable control options.  The aesthetics and environments are quite nice, as is the wafting calm and melancholy music.

												Anodyne is an excersize is surrealism with a fairly well executed Zelda-style design. There is a story to be had here, one that you'll have to both look for and make assumptions to grasp. There are rooms filled with muttering duplicates without reason, and there is a circus deep inside a cave. Your weapon of choice? A broom. It's engaging and exciting to see what oddities come your way throughout the game, and the aesthetics are sublime. Sound design is great, and while I'm not a huge fan of the vertical slice the game is framed in (nor some of the initial keybindings, but you can change that in the options), it creates a unique little space for one to explore and plenty of interesting perspective tricks that might not've been as effective were it presented differently. The gameplay can be a bit stodgy, but the dungeon design never fails to stay interesting, and the odd urban aesthetics in the later stages craft a near eldritch experience in their odd familiarity, filled with abstract shadows that chase you and bizarre conversations. It borders on dadaism, honestly. The earlier dungeons fit more standard tropes, albeit with increasingly fascinating design. The puzzles are generally simple, and never made me pause for more than a few moments until the very last few on the main path. The collectables and their puzzles tend to be far more interesting, and the farther off the beaten path you go, the more complex they become. All for what amounts to cute car!It's not life changing, but Anodyne captures a niche space phenomenally well. Give this little guy a shot if you haven't already. It's worth it just for the creative decisions alone.			"

												This is by far the best indie adventure RPG I've ever played. It is heavily derivative of top-down Zelda games like A Link to the Past, so fans of Zelda and Zelda-like games will enjoy Anodyne.GameplayAnodyne's controls are very well-designed. The fact that the game is controlled by a grand total of seven buttons (arrows, select/attack, back/jump, and menu) is an excellent design choice: far too often have I played games with separate buttons for every tool or weapon or action, or so many items that additional controls are needed to cycle through them. The menu very rarely has to be used to play the game, only needed to equip the occasional broom upgrade.The card system is cute and unique, with each card having a funny little quote about the featured character. NPC and enemy design is well done; the sprites are simple and fit the aesthetic of the game, and the AI, while sometimes frustrating, works very well.Level design, while not exceptionally innovative, is well-thought-out and well-executed, although a compass item for dungeons would be helpful for keeping track of what went where in previous rooms. The overworld is expansive and elaborate, with intricate, winding pathways in some areas and wide, open expanses in others. Again, the menu map could use some improvements, such as region labels, but it may just be a design choice.AestheticsAnodyne's 16-bit style is the perfect fit for what it is, and the idea of a Zelda-like game with modern and surrealist twists is certainly charming. The sprites and tileset are all well-drawn and aesthetically fitting, and the selective use of lighting and effects in some areas of the game is a small yet powerful touch.One of the best parts of Anodyne is its music. The music is calm and distant, yet drives the gameplay in incredible ways. The player cannot help but nod along to the groovy, eccentric beats and melodies of the Hotel, the somber, melodic sways of the Temple, or the hesitant, ominous notes of the Cavern as they roam the halls and corridors and solve the grand puzzles contained within each unique dungeon.ConsWhile overall a fantastic game, it could use a bit more in the side quest department, as the game, while nonlinear in layout, is fairly linear in terms of objective.The bosses, while generally a bit tricky on the first or second try, are overall fairly easy and simple, without much variety in fight style (dodge its attacks, strike strike strike, wait for its anger phase to pass, rinse and repeat until dead).There is not much incentive to stay alive in the game. Death means being sent back to the last checkpoint, which in a dungeon can be fairly common. Checkpoints are easy to find and easy to use, and saving at a different checkpoint from the previous one fully heals the player, which seems a bit cheap. There is no currency to be lost, and dying does not reset progress, just position: any items collected will stay collected after death, and saving is only really needed when quitting, as there is no volatile progress in need of saving.In ConclusionIf you are a fan of Zelda-like games and have 10 bucks to spare, give the game a go. As with any Steam game, however, waiting for a discount is probably the best course of action, as the $5 I bought the game for was the perfect price for the game in my opinion (but then again, I don't like paying for things, so there's that).--P~M			"

												I had a lot of fun playing Anodyne for the first time. There is a decent amount of puzzles and jumping challenges. Boss fights are easy but fun. Getting all the achievements was more complicated than I was hoping for. Without finding information on how to get some of the cards online it's hardly possible. You can get some of them by pure luck but some are just impossible without putting in countless hours while doing random stuff with ""swap upgrade"" for your broom. Recommended if you like jumping puzzle type games.			"

This is a must play for fans of 2D Zelda games, or just interesting, retro inspired indie games.			"

												The game draws heavily from the top down Zeldas in terms of puzzles, combat, and dungeon design which is why I'm surprised that I didn't like the game more.  It kept me entertained, but I think the major difference between it and Zelda resulted in repetitive combat, that distinction being there are only a handful of secondary items you earn in the game so most enemies are killed by just slashing over and over.  Story wise, the game has some very insightful moments, but, if there was a coherent subtext in the game, then I did not get it.  If there is a deeper narrative that the designers had in mind, then it is buried deep.  Other individuals might be able to relate to the story more and understand the intention of the creator, but because I never got into the story, I never really understood what was going on.  I don't think it is a bad game, just one I was hoping to like more.			"

												There's a very specific jump in the game: one that is required for an extra card(in-game collectible/plot maguffin), as well as another towards the ending. These are two instances of the game asking for roughly the same thing, for me to fiddle with speed pads and somehow jump diagonally over a ridiculously wide space. These jumps are why I am incapable of finishing this game. While I don't think they're impossible, they constitute a kind of false difficulty (in the sense that the game is asking me for finger dexterity whereas in most other situations it is just asking for puzzle solving), and I was not able to complete them. It's a shame for me, because I think this is a really cool game, with a much stronger appeal to me aesthetically than any Zelda game I have ever played. I came into it much easier because Zelda would often ask for that kind of fiddling very early on, whereas here it waited until right near the end to tell me I couldn't progress without a dexterity test. Take that however you like. I'll give it a recommendation anyway.			"

												A bit like Zelda, but not as clear about where you're supposed to go or what you're supposed to do. Maps are unclear and upgrades are misleadingly useless and few on top of that. Store keeper does nothing, so it's pointless. Many things in the game seem to be like that, now that I think about it. It seems like it attempts to be epic or mystical, but it just ends up confusing with no resolution to the legend it tries to create. Another disappointing mistake in the game is even the most minute incorporation of sexual dialogue and vulgarity when no other classic game epic (that Anodyne pathetically mimics) includes such explitives at all. Overall, it was fun in the moment, disappointingly confusing more often than not, and in the end just sad. Glad I got it on sale! Definitely not worth $9.99, or I'd ask for my money back!			"

												Event though I finished the game with all the cards and *almost* all the achievements it left me feeling empty. The 8 / 16 bits graphic style is great. The music is ok for the most part. The levels are all fun and somewhat frustraiting, but not enough to make you rage quit in the middle of the game. However none of that is enough to counter the biggest down of this piece: its complete lack of story, or should I say, its completly lack of sense.Don't get me wrong, a game doesn't require to have any profound meaning to be entertaining, but this one is just too much.The zones or levels have no relation between them. It's as if they were a bunch of levels from different games put together. Young (the main character) just appears in this word for some unknown reason. It seems that he might be dreaming but you have nothing to expand this theory.In most parts of the game the NPCs present you with filosophical issues, but all of the dialogs are void and empty and provide nothing that your mind can ""munch"" into, failing to give any ""deepness"" to game. It's almost if the game was designed so that only the developers can fully understand it.And most important, for start to end, you are left with the unanswered question of ""what is this game about?""

												Summary: Surreal Zelda-liteMultiplayer: NoCompletion: 6 hrsCards: YesCloud: YesThe first thing you'll notice about Anodyne is how it is inspired from Zelda... in a strange surreal sort of way. You play as the silent protagonist Young in a real-time top-down action RPG. Armed with his trusty broom, Young sets out to battle the forces of... his mind? The game is curiously unclear about this. Going by in-game text only, it's anyone's guess where you are - Limbo? Someone's dream? Tartarus? A video game?The first thing you are told is that you must reach something known as the Briar before darkness does. Young thus sets out on his journey to collect keys and cards in order to unlock gates in order to enter the next area. While keys make sense, it's peculiar that many gates require a certain number of cards to access. This wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't for the fact that the last gate requires obtaining nearly all the cards, and so you must do a lot of backtracking to find what you were missing. The game plays out in a number of different, often disjointed areas, notably modern ones. They range from streets, to caves, to suburbs, to hotels. It's cool, and it's well-drawn, but there's seemingly no coherence. Even if it's a dream world, there's no rhyme or reason ever given for why you may suddenly find yourself in an 8-bit dungeon. There's a town where you can go around stabbing npcs with a sword. It's creepy and unsettling, much like the music in the game, but you just accept it and move on. I feel there were some missed opportunities to expand upon these mysterious worlds. If there's one thing I want in the game, it's more items. Early on you are given your trusty broom, which is a fair enough starter weapon. But throughout the entire game you never get anything different. You can obtain alternative attack patterns, but in the end it's still a broom. The only other power you obtain is jumping (and eventually another late-game power). You don't even learn to dash. I would have liked ranged attacks, learn to set fire to things, communicate with the strange walkers, etc.Anodyne boasts a remarkable large world map and a half a dozen moderately sized dungeons. While it can get a little confusing where to go sometimes, merely heading for parts of the map you haven't explored often sets you on the right path. The maps are fairly well constructed and have a nice open feel to them. I like that switches to open doors will often keep the door open so you don't have to repeat most difficult rooms you come across. There's some good enemy variety too, with unique AI patterns for each type of enemy you face. The boss battles are appropriately intense and often involved some gimmick. They have many varied attack patterns and genuinely feel like bosses, so good marks on that.The game runs pretty well overall. I did occasionally clip into terrain, but other than that, there were no major bugs I found. I give Anodyine a 7/10. It doesn't quite live up to the legacy of Zelda, but it does manage to hold its own. Anodyone is a very commendable game to be accomplished with such a small team. I would have liked a more fleshed out story but I understand that's not what they were going for.			"

												There is so much I could talk about in this game, so I'm going to try to simplify it in two ways: as a game, and as a piece of art.This game is obviously inspired by the Legend of Zelda, and it takes this inspiration well. It's an overhead adventure, in which you explore the world and dungeons as well as you can. To progress throughout the game, you generally must find cards that will help you unlock gates throughout the game that require different amounts of cards. In order to get to the end of the normal, story-section part of the game, you have to investigate places well to find every last card, giving plenty of playability and exploration that doesn't grow too stale or ambigious as new challenges arise to getting each card. You may have to pay attention and give patience, but if you're trying, nothing during the normal gameplay is impossible to find out. In what is technically post-game, you gain no real rewards for what you do except unlocking a few interesting levels. A lot of the post-game items almost guarentee that you use a guide, as they are very hidden and cryptic. However, you don't have to do any of this post-game, and most of these items are pointless anyway unless you're a completionist freak. All of the post-game cards (not hidden items in general) must be found to unlock a special last area, which again doesn't serve too much of a point, but it's a sweet area and gives a sense of accomplishment. There are only two things that I would shame the game in terms of gameplay for, and that is that: 1. when you gain the jumping ability, you cannot jump over enemies or projectiles as you would logistically think, and 2. you can only have one save file, meaning that if you want to replay the game  for a speed-running achievement, you must give up your long and hard progression of card collecting. However, those serve as minor details, and the game is still extremely enjoyable.If you ever wanted to do the famous ""are videogames art?"" argument, this game would be an excellent example for proving so. Everything about this game is beautiful, to the point where I'm still thinking about it almost daily, even when I have completed it several months ago. This game is intended to be the exploration into the mind of Young, which means that everything is somewhat of a pre-set dream. And Hell, it truly is like a dream. The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful, and fits each individual event or area all too well. The graphics are purposely 16-bit-esque, which gives the atmosphere a surreal sense and further helps move the game's intentions of the whole story. The whole plot is an ambigious exploration throughout Young's mind, which brings up so much symbolism. You could hire the most advanced English professors of the world to try to dissect this game, and even then there would be so many possibilities as to how you could interpret almost anything. Even the very existence of characters in this dream world are controversial as to what they mean. Some themes of the game are given to you on a plate, and whether or not some purposes of the game are clear or ambigious to you, they all share ideas that the most troubled in life may have, and they may easily reflect into individuals on a personal level. This is not a ""princess is captured, go save her"" kind of plot for the thick-headed, and that is definitely an up-side.This game is a masterpiece. If you a few good hours to sit down and play videogames each day, or if you ever wonder about your dreams or life in general, you have to play this. The ten dollars are so worth it.			"

												I'm generally a fan of old-school RPGs, I'm all in for supporting indie game developers, but c'mon! This entire trend of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games sold as ""Indie"", ""Retro"" or ""Old-School"" is really starting to get on my nerves! I don't mind the lack of voice acting, I don't need long and gorgeous cut-scenes, I can live with the shallow storylines, I can also deal with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics in general. But what really drive me nuts are the small things, such as, for example, me being able to hit an enemy from 100 miles away.... with a melee weapon! Nevermind the fact that all I really hit was air, the monster on the other corner of the screen just dies and disappears.For me, this is a game breaker. It's like the game devs are telling me, ""Hey, it's a fantasy game, right? You only imagine you're an adventurer, you only imagine you're fighting monsters, so what's wrong with imagining you really hit the bat right before it died?""  Well, at this point I put on my Grumpy Cat mask and shout, ""NO! I won't friggin' imagine that! It's your job as game devs to illustrate at least the most basic stuff!"".Needless to say, that if in the past I generously shelled out money for indie games without digging too deep, thinking to myself that even if I won't be enjoying the game, at least I'd be supporting the games industry, that is not the case anymore. I'm tired of lazy game devs selling me crap as ""Indie"". I'm willing to pay for good games, but I work hard to earn that money, and so should everyone else, including game developers.As far as I'm concerned, Anodyne is a bad game. I can't remember how much I paid for it, I just hope it wasn't much. Oh well, at least I'm wiser and more careful now, when it comes to choosing what games to buy, regardless of how cheap or expensive they are.			"

A Paladin’s Steam Review: Anodyne. I Don’t Have Time For This Nonsense.Genre: Top Down Adventure and Puzzle Game. Developed & Published by: Analgesic ProductionsPlatform: Windows and Mac. Business Model: Base GameCopy Purchased by Myself PreambleAs time passes by, I've grown increasingly intolerant of games like Anodyne. I’m tired of games with the mechanical depth of kiddie pools that sell themselves as hugely deep experiences. These titles that think they’re saying something profound when most of the time I’m just bored by the subtext. It’s nonsense. It’s tiresome nonsense that Anodyne finds itself in. That does color my review a bit but I do think that I point out the troubles this game has well enough to talk about it. So, let’s talk. Overall Gameplay ThoughtsAnodyne is billed as action adventure title tied with surreal and horror elements. With its 2D top-down view, the comparisons to a certain other franchise are easy to make. But look past the surface and you’ll find anything but. Anodyne is a game that’s hard to have fun with. The combat system is abrasively simple, if you can get the finicky controls to work with you. Besides moving around and a short jump, all you've got is a single weapon. Said weapon is a broom that acts like a sword and can only be ""swept"" in the direction you’re facing. You have no AOE attacks or ranged capabilities which makes your broom’s incredibly short reach aggravating. This creates some really problematic situations with both regular enemies (who take a heart a hit and will knock you back) and and boss battles. I should mention that boss fights are very basic. Just find the one place they won't be able to hit you with their highly predictable attacks and bash them over the head until they die. Rinse and repeat as often as necessary. Do, however, expect to restart often just to get past a couple of fights. I don't know what else I can say about this system other than it's awful and basic. There's no enjoyment to be found in it. Just as there's little joy to be found in the dungeon crawling. The majority of the game is puzzle solving which involves a ton of walking around and hoping you stumble upon the right switch or key to get through a door you couldn't get past. Then walk back to that door and continue rinsing and repeating this process till you've gotten through the entire game. While collecting the 48 photographs of enemies you need to finish the game. Exploration is lacking because there’s no monetary system nor can you acquire new items to enhance your character. All you can do is look at the pixelart and survive long enough to make it to the next save point. A lot of the time its just slogging it through normal enemies in long battles of attrition through fights or dungeons.Story ThoughtsThe story is this: Young, you must save >insert vague mention of land/mythical object here< from an >insert ominous vague evil here<! Now go through this door and just do it! That’s basically the best that the game ever explains itself. You're main goal is to find 48 photographs of enemies either by defeating them or finding them in treasure chests. Then, you win the game. That’s it. Of course, getting to those photographs requires getting through a whole lot of dungeons but you’re not even given the basic reasons to do this other than to do it. No princess in another castle or interesting characters to get attached to. Truly, the characters are the worst part about Anodyne. There’s only a couple of recurring characters who don’t have any personality and very limited agency in the game. They simply show up, say a few lines at you and then leave. None of the dialogue really cements that you should care. Just do it and get your achievements already. Legend of Zelda ComparisonsHaving played all of the Gameboy Legend of Zelda titles multiple times over, I can say this with absolute certainty: the comparison of Anodyne being like Legend of Zelda is a terrible one. Andoyne’s combat system is extremely stripped down, there’s no interesting story or colorful characters. Probably the only comparison that works is the dungeon crawling/puzzles. Those at least feel very similar to each other, even if they don't feel particularly good in Anodyne. Do not go into Anodyne with the expectation that this is a Legend of Zelda clone. It’s not. Consider this, at best, an experimental 2D indie “horror” game with some inspirations from previous action/adventure titles of times gone by.  Abysmal PC SupportAndoyne’s PC support is abysmally bad. There’s only one resolution that the game is set to and it’s some smartphone portrait resolution. There’s no way to change it either, outside of making it run in stretched, windowed or fullscreen mode with scaling up to 5X. Controller support doesn’t work or is incredibly finicky to get running. I couldn’t get it to run and neither could quite a few people on the Steam community forums. That’s inexcusable considering the genre of game we’re talking about here. Keyrebinding is possible but it makes you set all of the keys at once so if you screw up a key, you have to do it all over again. The game’s menu isn’t mouse driven, so, have fun with that. The framerate is locked to 30FPS and it will quite often fall below 30FPS. No idea why. Oh and you can only have one save game at a time. Why? Who knows, I guess save games take up too much space. There’re a multitude of bugs and problems mentioned on PCGamingWiki[pcgamingwiki.com] that haven’t been fixed either. The poor PC support, the framerate problems and other issues are enough on their own to not recommend this game. Graphics are pixelated art pieces that use very reddish/dreary colors. While it gives Anodyne a distinct look, I found it to be overly samey and dreary to look at, so I don’t particularly like the style. Audio is a very moody and calm electronic soundtrack but I found it to be unmemorable at best. Overly repetitive at worst. There’s a single audio slider for the volume. The UI is….ok but the lack of mouse control can be confusing/annoying to deal with at times. Final ThoughtsI don’t have the time or patience for this nonsense anymore. Anodyne is certainly a different twist on the usual RPG affair with its moody atmosphere and unusual visuals. But the gameplay is puddle-deep and extremely repetitive. Controls feel far too loose/unresponsive for how much precision the game sometimes demands. Additionally, don’t be fooled by the comparisons to Legend of Zelda either, Anodyne isn’t even in the same ballpark. The most that it picks up from Zelda is dungeon crawling/puzzle solving but even that’s fairly samey/dull to get through. The bosses are poorly designed, the combat is dull at best and there’s no story or interesting characters to speak of. The world itself is just a dreary place of misery and poorly written angst. None of this is fun to play or experience. Pass on this. Read this Review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me] "

												As far as ""heavily influenced by The Legend of Zelda indie retro pixelly meta games"" go, this one is pretty good. Sure, there are flaws (platforming requiring pixel-perfect timing and execution may not have been an overall good idea in a top-down game for instance), but the game keeps on being interesting until the end with enough extra content to go back for more.The metaphorical layer may fly over many heads or just be forgettable/hard to relate to but at least it isn't shoved into one's face every so often. Expect a good four to five hours for a regular playthrough and double that for the extra mile (bonus items, achievements and whatnot).			"

												A lot of people are comparing this game to 2D Zeldas, and while there are a lot of similar elements and it's obvious that there was some inspiration drawn from it (there's even a few Zelda jokes), to me this game was more akin to Earthbound or Yume Nikki, at least in terms of atmosphere. The game comes off as a fairly basic ""save the world from evil"" but takes a more eerie turn as you play through it. Even more so if you're going for 100% of the cards and you start exploring with swap tool post-endgame.It was an entertaining game, and kept me busy for 7 hours (one playthough to experience the whole game and get all the items, and another to get the 3 hour achievement). I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to get lost in a surreal world while solving some puzzles as you go. Though some of the puzzles can be bypassed entirely at times by finding a way to cheat the system.			"

A Paladin’s Steam Review: Anodyne. I Don’t Have Time For This Nonsense.Genre: Top Down Adventure and Puzzle Game. Developed & Published by: Analgesic ProductionsPlatform: Windows and Mac. Business Model: Base GameCopy Purchased by Myself PreambleAs time passes by, I've grown increasingly intolerant of games like Anodyne. I’m tired of games with the mechanical depth of kiddie pools that sell themselves as hugely deep experiences. These titles that think they’re saying something profound when most of the time I’m just bored by the subtext. It’s nonsense. It’s tiresome nonsense that Anodyne finds itself in. That does color my review a bit but I do think that I point out the troubles this game has well enough to talk about it. So, let’s talk. Overall Gameplay ThoughtsAnodyne is billed as action adventure title tied with surreal and horror elements. With its 2D top-down view, the comparisons to a certain other franchise are easy to make. But look past the surface and you’ll find anything but. Anodyne is a game that’s hard to have fun with. The combat system is abrasively simple, if you can get the finicky controls to work with you. Besides moving around and a short jump, all you've got is a single weapon. Said weapon is a broom that acts like a sword and can only be ""swept"" in the direction you’re facing. You have no AOE attacks or ranged capabilities which makes your broom’s incredibly short reach aggravating. This creates some really problematic situations with both regular enemies (who take a heart a hit and will knock you back) and and boss battles. I should mention that boss fights are very basic. Just find the one place they won't be able to hit you with their highly predictable attacks and bash them over the head until they die. Rinse and repeat as often as necessary. Do, however, expect to restart often just to get past a couple of fights. I don't know what else I can say about this system other than it's awful and basic. There's no enjoyment to be found in it. Just as there's little joy to be found in the dungeon crawling. The majority of the game is puzzle solving which involves a ton of walking around and hoping you stumble upon the right switch or key to get through a door you couldn't get past. Then walk back to that door and continue rinsing and repeating this process till you've gotten through the entire game. While collecting the 48 photographs of enemies you need to finish the game. Exploration is lacking because there’s no monetary system nor can you acquire new items to enhance your character. All you can do is look at the pixelart and survive long enough to make it to the next save point. A lot of the time its just slogging it through normal enemies in long battles of attrition through fights or dungeons.Story ThoughtsThe story is this: Young, you must save >insert vague mention of land/mythical object here< from an >insert ominous vague evil here<! Now go through this door and just do it! That’s basically the best that the game ever explains itself. You're main goal is to find 48 photographs of enemies either by defeating them or finding them in treasure chests. Then, you win the game. That’s it.

YouTube™ Video: Steam Review E7 Anodyne 

			Views: 106		

			A truly awesome world for $10 USD. Wait for sales as always but I paid full price and I found that the game was easily worth it.		

Anodyne: A 16-bit game that goes through the very dream like story of Young in his quest to defend the Briar! The story of Anodyne is abstract and ‘weird’ and may come off in a way that becomes unappealing. For me though, Anodyne is a beautifully crafted world with a story that personally interest me, its controls are simple and fitting and each area of the game feels unique as well as strange but interesting. The music in this game also does a wonderful job of creating a very mood altering atmosphere. The game is a lot of ‘puzzle’ solving and plat-forming but never felt too hard to be frustrating but challenging enough to keep me interested. With all that said, if you enjoy 16-bith games with a unique style that harkens to older Zelda titles then I highly recommend Anodyne for its full price and hope you find your own interpretation of the story as so many others have.-Thumbs Up from RoyialVideo Reviews can be found at: www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork "

												I liked this game. It's a good Zelda-lite game. It's a tad harder than most 2D Zelda games, but it's also more forgiving with saves and checkpoints. The later platforming challenges were hard to execute from a precision standpoint, but overall I really enjoyed my time with it. The puzzles are about what you would expect from a Zelda game, even though they use drastically different mechanics. The game does a good job of teaching you as you go how the puzzles work so that when you come back to old areas you see answers to puzzles you didn't know were there. The soundtrack is really relaxing, even during Boss fights. Overall just a fun time with a fun game.			"

												Anodyne is a simple, fun experience. It's easy to compare to Earthbound, but more structurally similar to The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening, with items functioning as puzzle-solving elements within the world that you can use to advance through the otherwise non-linear game world. Anodyne is light on story and leaves most plot threads dangling, but it makes use of a dreamy atmosphere and an almost-otherworldly soundtrack to fill its worlds with character.Definitely worth the buy.

												Anodyne is super weird.  It has the look of the original Zelda, but instead of a plucky young hero you play an aloof janitor name Young.  The game is played from an overhead perspective as you control Young through the various areas of the game.  You quickly become armed with a broom, and you better like it because that is the one weapon you will have throughout the game.  Unlike Zelda, rather than the player getting powered up, the areas you explore do.  The most you can hope for as far as power ups go is learning to jump and minor augmentations to your broom.  You must discover the proper route, the sequence of switches, or simply timing your jumps to fully explore each stage and defeat the enemies within them.  You'll receive little guidance on where to travel next, or what your objective might be.  Along the way, you'll find treasure chests containing cards, and magical gates that open when you are carrying enough cards.  The story, if you can call it that, makes very little sense.  You get the idea this might just be bizarre dream.  Throughout you will find homages to other NES classics subtly hidden throughout the scenery and dialogue.Is it fun?  Yeah, it's fun.  One thing I appreciate is rather than requiring twitch reflexes the game often rewards a more methodical approach.  Once you find the pattern for an enemy or boss you can easily sidestep their attacks and take them out with little risk of injury, but if you try to rush you will probably take damage, or worse, be forced to retry the room.A word to parents: the dialogue in Anyodyne includes language you may not consider appropriate for young children.

												A curious 2d Zelda-esque game with an eerily dark tone to it.  It may mean something or it may be style over substance (with regards to the story anyway), but the game itself is solid and playing it you can't help but get an uneasy feeling that this world is off.It's hard to really describe this because of how unusual the story and tone fit with the play itself.  It's quite dark and often makes you question the meaning or motivation of many of the characters - but is there a deeper meaning to it?  I don't know.Whatever the case may be, I will recommend this if you like the zelda style of 2D action game.  It has some clever bits to it, as well as a rather different ""weapon"" that adds a neat little gimmick overall.  I like it, though I am still not sure how I feel about it, meaning-wise.			"

												Anodyne is a very strange game... When you look at it or when you first play it you get the feeling that it is an old game, similar to Zelda in some ways. The music is actually pretty charming and relaxing while you're exploring around. The gameplay is nothing spectacular nor does it have any unique mechanics, it is solid, it works, it basicly puts you on a quest to gather a bunch of cards in order to unlock certain doors and defeat certain bosses until you reach the final boss. Now what really intrigues me about the game is the actual storyline, as soon as you start the game you are given the task to fight the Briar who has spread the Darkness across the land but the more I played and progressed throughout the game the more I got confused. In the end I kinda got the feeling that Anodyne tells the story of 2 friends along with their upsides and downsides in their relationship. It's really weird and odd, hard to understand to me atleast. In the end I think that Anodyne has it's own merit and it's actually a pretty good title but only because of the story in my honest opinion.			"

												An alright Zelda clone that has a very wistful, dreamy feeling to it. The entire game pushes that sort of aimless, wandering quality while dropping hints of what's at the heart of the game on a deeper philosophical level. Ultimately though, I found it a bit too aimless, and got bored a little over halfway through, when I discovered the only way to the end of the game was finishing a collection of cards, and relentlessly screen-hunting through a game that doesn't have any tracking system for if you've been to a place or not. While I have no issue doing it myself, the game wasn't compelling or entertaining enough to make me want to do it. The only puzzle mechanic was Roc's Feather style jumping, button pushing, and pushing dust around with a broom. No other puzzle, items, or anything to use. Bosses were unimaginative and felt like slogs, and even with the portals and jumping around, a great deal of the maps felt like empty needless filler, walking from place to place in what is, admittedly, a chamring, quirky (and sometimes fairly dark and entirely unsettling) little world, but filled with very little actual substance.I think that's what the game was trying to do, though, which means I can't really fault it for being exactly that. The game would get a neutral rating from me if I could give it one, so I'll recommend it and give it a positiv erevie wbecause I think the game is well done, it's just not a game for me.			"

												Think of Anodyne as Zelda Lite.  It strips away a lot of the variety you'd find in Link's arsenal, but make no mistake: that simplicity does not mean there's no challenge.  Still, the best thing about it is the mesmerizing and imaginative world that waits to be explored.  This is a delightful title, and one I'm absolutely thrilled to have stumbled upon.			"

												Anodyne is a very strange game... When you look at it or when you first play it you get the feeling that it is an old game, similar to Zelda in some ways. The music is actually pretty charming and relaxing while you're exploring around. The gameplay is nothing spectacular nor does it have any unique mechanics, it is solid, it works, it basicly puts you on a quest to gather a bunch of cards in order to unlock certain doors and defeat certain bosses until you reach the final boss. Now what really intrigues me about the game is the actual storyline, as soon as you start the game you are given the task to fight the Briar who has spread the Darkness across the land but the more I played and progressed throughout the game the more I got confused. In the end I kinda got the feeling that Anodyne tells the story of 2 friends along with their upsides and downsides in their relationship. It's really weird and odd, hard to understand to me atleast. In the end I think that Anodyne has it's own merit and it's actually a pretty good title but only because of the story in my honest opinion.			"

												I tried to give this game a chance, I understand how daunting it is to create a game as an independant developer. But there's no excuse for this. Anodyne is an Action-Adventure game that draws heavy influence from the Legend of Zelda series, along with Yume Nikki (a surreal, horrorfying exploration game). Unlike LoZ, almost everything is amateurish in this game; the animations, the sprites, level design - it just all seems really poor. Unlike Yume Nikki, the atmosphere that the game presents is cheesy and trite. I never got that ""dreamlike"" vibe from the game just because of how clumsily it presented itself.  Many of the enemies you encounter don't even look like they belong in the area they reside in. The soundtrack can be hit-or-miss but is mediocre for the most part.After defeating 3 ridiculously easy bosses, I lost interest and motivation to continue trying to make sense of the cryptic plot  - which was the only thing keeping me from quitting the game earlier.

												Find cards and battle bosses--that about sums up this adventure. There's a good number of different environments to explore, puzzles to solve, and monsters to fight. The gameplay is on par with other games in this genre. The story doesn't make a whole lot of sense and is probably the weakest part of the game. This is a great game had it been released 30 years ago. Today, it's just one of many attempts to copy The Legend of Zelda and just falls short of being anything but a clone.			"

												So here's the game that is being called the Zelda clone. Well, Anodyne, I got Zelda back in the day, I played Zelda over and over, and can say quite honestly ---- you are no Zelda.Not to say that this one doesn't have its moments ---- it does ---- there are some interesting mechanics, tricky puzzles, and even some decent, if convoluted, exploration. But, for me, the game lacks the most fundamental aspect ---- an interesting story. And, hey, maybe there is and it does ---- I just wasn't willing to spend more time to find it.Too much dialogue that leaves you with a ""huh?"" feeling,  too many screens where absolutely nothing is going on, the lack of enough tutorial or instruction leaves the player on his/her own to find their way, and some really strange and confusing controls ---- and, again, I wasn't interested or patient enough to figure things out.To me, a game needs to have enough interesting things happening pretty early to capture my willingness to continue ---- and though this game had some nice qualities (ok graphics, some clever puzzles, challenging exploration) ---- it might be a while before I play this one some more. But I recognize that this might be a great game for some people, so I'll recommend it ---- with the above mentioned reservations.			"

												If there is one thing that comes to mind playing this game, it's the Gameboy Colour Legend of Zelda games. The art style calls back to those games with a sense of fondness and love, paying plenty of tribute to style of spriting and the dungeon design. However, it is not a flat out imitation of the handheld Zelda games, there is plenty of originality with its beautifully vivid art palette, and the more psychedelic musical score that burrows into your brain and puts you in a dreamlike state. Which is quite fitting, considering that the entire game takes place in a dream realm.I'd highly recommend this game, especially if you're looking for a game that is like the classic Zelda games, but is also original in its own right. For best results, Use an NES controller with a USB adapter.			"

												I bought this game based on the stellar reviews of the art, music, and story--the three things I go for in a game. This game falls short in 2/3 categories.Art: 6/10. The vistas in the cliffs were lovely, but many of the outdoor maps left something to be desired. You can design a pixellated tree and call it a tree, or you can design a pixellated tree and it will be freaking-beautiful-how-can-one-squeeze-that-much-detail-into-a-pixellated-tree sort of pixellated tree. So while I wasn't blown away, or even mildly wowed by the art, I love bit-style games, period. But they're difficult to bring to life unless paired with a solid, captivating story.Story: 2/10. Anodyne drops you into the game without any back story, any context of the worlds you visit or creatures you speak to, any idea of what to do, any inkling of a purpose, not matter how you might search. ""That's alright,"" I thought, ""I like open world exploratory games. This'll be fun."" The difference between an exploration game and Anodyne is that if you decide not to participate in the main quest line, it's assumed there are other quests around to pique your interest. Anodyne is not only devoid of a main quest line; it is devoid of any quests at all. The closest thing I found to a quest was a talking bear that asked me if I had any berries. The game is generally light on text, and those creatures that do speak to you have no information, useless or otherwise. (Edit: Okay, I lied. There is a main quest line in which a creepy mage person (can't tell if it's male or female) tells you that you must do something to save something, a quest which your characte blindly and wordlessly accepts. It happens so quickly and so casually that I can't even remember the specifics of it all.)Music: 8/10. The music has been the saving grace of Anodyne. They did a fantastic job creating atmosphere and differentiating one map from another. Only one song was catchy enough to get stuck in my head, but I found all the music to be very enjoyable. (Applause!)I've seen reviews that the controls were a bit clonky. I found them to be decent at best, tolerable at worst. My only complaint is that it's extremely tough to judge where a jump will land when one jumps north or south. The amount of times I died attempting to get a feel for it over some chasms in a cave is embarassing.Overall, this game had a lot of potential for me but ended up being a disappointment. The lack of direction left me wandering in circles across several maps trying to figure out how to progress in the game, resulting in loss of interest. Kudos to the developers for creating a cool game, but their abstract method of storytelling (giving them the benefit of the doubt here) isn't going to be for everybody.			"

Title: AnodyneGenre: Action, Adventure, IndieDeveloper: Sean Hogan and Jonathan KittakaPublisher: Analgesic ProductionsRelease Date: 22nd March, 2013TL;DR, VerdictRecommend, however the resets make it frustrating, as puzzles and monsters will respawn/revert upon leaving and re-entering a room. ProsHumour/DialogueGood old school style adventure if you loved those types back on platforms like the game boyGood music Good graphics for a game in this gerne ConsThe resets(the resets themself are really annoying and killed me multiple times so be aware of that) Sometimes feels a bit to much like a copy Gameplay an RPG sprite side scroller game, your character travels the world(s) by jumping through portals, interacting with characters (with nice one liners and rocks that don't talk or passive aggressive rocks that have writing on them saying you have no friends). It's a game that seems savvy to itself and feels like a parody of story games. After all your legendary weapon is a broom, and the characters around you are either sarcastic or silly. Or wimps.You need to save the world. Somehow. By smacking enemies with a broom. And solving puzzles also with your broom. It also reminds me a bit of the old Zelda games. Puzzles reset if you leave the room which is both a blessing and a curse, since it seems puzzles and monsters will reset even if you've solved/killed them as well. This is annoying if you want to explore everything. I like the game, but there are aspects I dislike, such as the resets. Personally it bothers me enough to not want to play for stretches of time since I have to keep repeating things each time I go to a room.Graphics wise this game reminds me of old school Pokémon on the game boy, way back in those days before the dinosaurs were wiped out.Want to read more of my reviews?

												+ A mix of modern and classic action adventure+ Very pleasing and well designed graphics+ Feels very nostalgic for me+ Exploration+ Very nice soundtrack+ It's more mature than the games it was inspired on, both in its story and humor and designs+ Puzzles are of the right measure+ Secrets!- The world design can feel weird and unrelatable- Steam overlay notices will bug on full screen- The minimap is too simple to be helpfulVerdict: I got Anodyne as a gift and it's been a game I've always been curious about. For my surprise, it took me on a trip back down memory lane to times when all I had game-wise was a GBC (my beloved and so missed crystal clear Japanese edition, so rare in the Americas) with Pokémon Crystal and TLoZ: Oracle of Ages. I had that GBC throughout my teen years and I finished both Pokémon and TLoZ: OoA way too many times to count. Later when I was 18-19 I had the opportunity (after all those years) to play TLoZ: Orace of Seasons, a game I've always wanted to try out (and actually the one I wanted instead of OoA). I'm quite certain that Anodyne pays tribute to the GB-GBC TLoZ era, including Link's Awakening. Walking around some areas, I even felt like I was back at Labrynna due to how similar that particular spot was to another one in OoA. It's actually the first tribute game to make me nostalgic and if I used scores on my reviews, it would get a 10/10 just because of that.			"

												[Spoiler-Free Review]Anodyne is an exploration game which borrows heavily from classic 2D Zelda titles (especially Link's Awakening). The dialogue is introspective, the subject matter is mature (sometimes even disturbing). It's also one of the strangest games I've ever played.Exploration is at the core of the game. If Anodyne was a protest piece against hand-holding in video games it would be considered a masterpiece. You aren't given a whole lot of instruction regarding where to go next. This feels liberating, for the most part, as you alone are free to decide your next course of action. It's also intimidating and frustrating though, as getting lost/stuck at some point through your playthrough is pretty much a given. It's not necessarily bad game design, it's a product of having too open a world and too linear a path to success (i.e. to get past this next section, the player will have needed to speak with this person to get this item). There aren't many indicators letting you know whether you fulfill the prerequirements for an area so there's a lot of trial and error involved. Be patient or look up a guide.All areas have their own themes and every dungeon offers up new challenges. This isn't the stereotypical fire/ice/earth/water stages type of game, the locales are varied and interesting: ranging from hotels to small towns and highway construction sites.The soundtrack is excellent and deserves to be praised as such. It reminds me of EARTHBOUND most noticably. The atmosphere is palpable; brooding, imaginative, mysterious. I wish there was a sound test option to be able to listen to the soundtrack from the main title screen.Aside from having a penchant for getting lost, the only other issues I'd express concerns about are the graphics and the flimsy gamepad controls.The graphics are muddy and crude, utilizing a palette usually reserved for NES/GBC titles. They don't get in the way of the gameplay, but if you aren't a fan of pixel/sprite based games, you won't be convinced otherwise by Anodyne.Although the XBOX 360 Controller is supported, the controls for movement are mapped to the analog stick and are very loose. I'd like to say this is a matter of preference, but when you're down to one health bar and your character charges at an enemy with reckless abandon despite your best efforts to carefully evade said foes, it's an issue. Nothing can be more frustrating than losing due to struggles with controls. A simple option to control the character using the digital pad would remedy this issue but as it stands, it isn't an option. I ended up remapping my controls through the joytokey program and my enjoyment with the game increased immediately.If you like exploration games and don't mind the graphics, pick this one up. It'll surprise you.P.S.Anodyne easily takes the title for strangest post-game I've ever experienced. It's beyond interesting.			"

												On the surface, Anodyne looks like your traditional, top-down SNES-inspired action RPG. And while I'm thankful for this aesthetic, I'm even more thankful for what turns out to be a cerebral experience that evokes an array of emotions while playing. Many indie games do a decent job of this, but often at the expense of game-play. Not Anodyne. It looks beautiful, it sounds beautiful and it's FUN.			"

												This game was great from start to finish. Reminds me a ton of the 2D Legend of Zelda games, but it has lots of charm and enough unique items and personality to be more than a lookalike or clone. It's obviously a bit shorter than LoZ, and the few puzzles are pretty simple, but the simplicity is part of what makes it attractive. I might replay this to get all of the achievements one day, and to do that, I'll have to attempt a speedrun. With most games, that's a scary thought, but in Anodyne, it sounds like a great way to spend a night and soak in any details I missed.			"

												I must first say that I forgot to write a review for this game when I decided I was finished playing this 2 years ago so my review may lack a little bit of depth. However, based on what I remember, Anodyne was a nice little action indie game that featured a well crafted 16-bit environment and a nice soundtrack. Throughout the game you get certain items that help you with the game. The game played smoothly from what I remember and overall the game was pretty good.Rating: 7.5/10			"

												My full review is available at http://www.danilopianini.org/anodyne along with screenshots and a guide on how to run the game and how to configure a gamepad under Linux.Steam does not allow me to copy the full review here (too little space), so here are the conclusions.ConclusionAnodyne is a below average game, and I do not recommend it. Authors are probably much more creative artists than game designers. The atmosphere of the game is nice, but it is technically too below the threshold of niceness, and the gameplay is not innovative nor addictive. If you find it for a very convenient price may be worth the money, but for sure I would never ever spend $9.99 to buy it at full price on Steam.Final rate: 4/10.How much is worth™: ~1 Euro.			"

												If you just want to play the main game and stop there and ignore the postgame, then it's okay, I guess. Nothing special though, but decent fun. Some good atmosphere, some decent puzzles, a pretty decent-sized world to explore.The post-game, though, feels like something that was thrown together in a few hours and they didn't bother to test it or fine-tune it at all. It's easy to get stuck and have to warp back to the nexus, the challenges tend to be tedious and unfun without being really hard in a legitimate way, and the world loses a lot of its charm when you just want to friggin' be done already. I went from ""meh"" to ""despise"" on this game pretty quickly and I can't say I'd recommend it for a good gaming experience.Oh yeah, AND. The game is really pretentious and tries to be super creepy but it ends up trying way too hard and I'm so done with the ""spookiness"" pretty quickly into it. Gag me.			"

ThemeThe game derives both its graphical style and its gameplay from the earlier Legend of Zelda games (Link's Awakening, and A Link to the Past), but does not do its source of inspiration any justice. Upon starting the game you are thrown in the deep end of the proverbial pool knowing nothing about the world, yourself, or what you are supposed to be doing. A brief few sentences cryptically inform you of your quest, and off you go. The apparent veil of mystery, however, never seems to be lifted. As you advance through the game you're not told what you are doing, why you are doing it, and why you should keep doing it. Instead you get some quasi-philosophical sentences randomly thrown in your direction, giving the game an air of pretentiousness.The visual style of Anodyne is not necessarily bad, but it is severely limited by simplistic and repetitive tylesets without any unique or impressive structures to look forward to. It is nothing special, and it does not contribute much to the theme of the world, unless the theme is supposed to be bland and uninspiring.GameplayMuch like its visual style, the gameplay is very repetitive. Borrowing its base gameplay from the aforementioned Legend of Zelda titles, Anodyne does nothing new or spectacular with it. In fact, it does not even borrow the parts that make its source of inspiration such great games mechanically. In the Legend of Zelda you are constantly advancing by obtaining new items, requiring you to master these respective items and use them (often in combination with other items) to solve puzzles and advance through the game. Anodyne does nothing of the sort. It does not seem to grant you new accessories to work with, leaving the gameplay as bland and one-dimensional as it is from the very start. Transitioning between areas in the game is equally repetitive. Many screens just seem to be there as filler content to make the game world seem larger, but contribute nothing to the experience. You'll be walking around a lot, which coincidentally gives you a lot of time to ponder the meaning of it all.The game controls well, although it lacks some polish here and there, particularly noticable while fighting bosses or certain enemies, or trying to circumvent certain obstacles.ConclusionUnpolished, pretentious, bland, repetitive, and boring are the defining keywords of this game. While the game is not necessarily bad, it just doesn't do enough to be worth playing. If you are new to the genre, I can recommend trying the Legend of Zelda instead. If you are looking for a game similar to the Legend of Zelda, then this game will be a disappointment.It does nothing new, and what it does is worse than its predecessors in the genre. Therefore it's safe to say this game can be skipped entirely.			"

												I got this game based on the reviews and my love for the Zelda franchise. While the music is awesome the game isn't. It wants to be a parody, but also serious at the same time. It’s a weird combo. The very first dungeon rubbed me the wrong way. You see, if you kill enemies in a room, then leave and return they all respawn. However, the last room requires you to kill an enemy on the top right, leave the room and then re-enter from the bottom killing the second enemy to proceed to the boss. This broke with the rules they had established and caused me to lose trust in the gameplay mechanics.Needless to say, I’m not happy with this game, but I do plan to continue and if my opinion changes, so will this review. But for right now, I can’t recommend it based on what I’ve played so far.			"

												When I first heard about this game on the Humble Bundle, I was a bit confused. How much can you get away with with the main character's weapon being a broom. Apparently a lot. From the very beginning, your loyal companion travels from a deranged fetus to the depths of space. The gameplay is always changing, creating new uses for old tools as puzzles and action alike keep the game alive. It is well worth the 100% achievements' time (which I have yet to earn). I will continue to play and enjoy this little indie RPG, from its gameplay to its story. 5 stars, more if possible.			"

												To put it briefly, Anodyne is a pretty decent game and definitely worth a quick run-through if you catch it on sale... but it's quite a bit underwhelming considering the potential it has.It's baiscally Zelda: LInk's Awakening (or one of the Oracles games), but with a trippy, dreamlike vibe (including some very good and atompsheric music and some great visuals here and there), and almost depressingly watered down (though that's somewhat the point, I think).   It's not super fun or amazing or anything breathtakingly new, but it's not BAD in any way other than some questioable chunky jumping controls and a couple little glitchy / unrefined tidbits.For a much wordier and detailed review of mine, check out:http://hip-indeed.tumblr.com/post/67644130704/lil-anodyne-mini-review "

Young. Guide him through the Dungeons, woods, cliffs, and plains given, and help him collect as many cards (Which are required to progress) as possible, and have a blast doing so!I could say much more about this game, but if you're actually interested just PM me, it's truely a gem among many of it's indie brothers, unfortunately, very underrated and underplayed, why do I say this?

It doesn't fully explore the implication that our player-character has had a psychotic break and is imagining the whole thing, but that's just a nitpicky point.			"

												First game I've played through to the end in a while -- in only a couple of sittings, too. The atmosphere kept me drawn in the most, and the variety in the different zones. The puzzles are simple but engage your brain just enough to be fun without being frustrating (looking at you, Myst). It's a small detail, but the character moves fast enough that traversing through territory you've already explored isn't a burden. There's a lot of creativity here, and it's well polished. Definitely deserves a beer and a play through. Sound track sounds awesome with a subwoofer.			"

												This game harkens back to the original Zelda in a lot of ways, but its biggest strength is probably its emphasis on exploration. Finding all of the cards and secrets in the game is a very fun and rewarding venture, and the exploration capabilities given to you as a player get turned up to 11 once you beat the game. It's not long, but it's certainly interesting and well worth it.			"

												This review will be rambling a bit, because of how much I loved the game and because of the prevalence of instant gratification and cheap thrills in gaming in this day and age.Anodyne is reminiscent of top-down Zelda games in terms of gameplay, but the two should not be compared against each other.You probably shouldn't play this if you're in a hurry and/or not able to focus on enjoying the game.My personal list of do's and do not's for the sake of enjoying Anodyne:-Play in a quiet place-Play with the sound on-Play alone-Don't watch videos about it, especially playthroughs (and stop if you've already seen some)-Figure out puzzles without the aid of the internet-Don't just play this game, absorb it-Don't rush through this game, explore it-If you have any juvenile hostilities towards the jump puzzles, feel free to slam your fists on the table in rage, or even stop playing for a while out of anger, only to resume some days later because you spent money on the game and want to get your money's worth-After you beat the game, reflect upon it-Most importantly, approach it with an open mind and heart, and let your thoughts and imagination roam freeThe main gist of the list is: play it as if you were living in simpler times, without all the distractions and stimuli and obligations foisted upon us nowadays.Beyond some frustrating jumping puzzles, Anodyne is an experience like no other.To me, Anodyne is an absolutely beautiful work of art, but it's only whatever you make of it. That being said, I can only suggest that you experience it for yourself. As a side note, having a controller for this game is nice, but not necessary. I played through more than half of it with a keyboard.			"

												This game is an amazing Zelda-esque work of art. While the combat is pretty basic, the atmosphere is incredible and this game has plenty of clever puzzles. It shouldn't take too long to get through the story, its about the length of a classic Zelda game, but there's plenty of incentive to keep exploring afterwards. My advice would be to not look up anything about the game and just dive right in. You won't regret it.			"

												I was a big fan of the old 2D Legend of Zelda games like Link's Awakening, and Anodyne effectively recaptures their spirit with some...very strange new twists.Um...minor spoilers, I guess.So it's like...a broom instead of a sword? What? Like, one minute you're floating down a river on a pile of dust, the next you're falling down a whirlpool into a weird land with walking trees, and then you climb a windmill and get to outer space, which is ruled by cubes wih faces, but it's actually a hotel filled with evil ghostly cleaning ladies, and there's a town where everything's in black and white and shadows are chasing you and...well, don't get me started on the ending. It's ridiculously surreal.Therein lies Anodyne's brilliance--unlike Link's Awakening, which had some weirdness but was always internally consistent, Anodyne perfectly recreates the fuzziness and weirdness of an ACTUAL dream. And it does it well! A work of art, really.The gameplay is great too, of course, standing on the shoulders of giants and whatnot. If you've played the top-down Zeldas, you should feel right at home. Frankly, it's a better Zelda game than some of the actual Zelda games we've seen recently.Anyway, thumbs up.			"

												To put it briefly, Anodyne is a pretty decent game and definitely worth a quick run-through if you catch it on sale... but it's quite a bit underwhelming considering the potential it has.It's baiscally Zelda: LInk's Awakening (or one of the Oracles games), but with a trippy, dreamlike vibe (including some very good and atompsheric music and some great visuals here and there), and almost depressingly watered down (though that's somewhat the point, I think).   It's not super fun or amazing or anything breathtakingly new, but it's not BAD in any way other than some questioable chunky jumping controls and a couple little glitchy / unrefined tidbits.For a much wordier and detailed review of mine, check out:http://hip-indeed.tumblr.com/post/67644130704/lil-anodyne-mini-review "

												This is a soft yes reccomendation.  The controls are too snappy/twitch for my liking.  Lacks a lot of the finesse controls of a game like Zelda: LTTP+ World building is interesting but the way its presented isn't always the best+Cool take on the broom/dust puzzels at first-Map can be far too confusing at times.  Often uninspired maze-levels with a few too many dead ends that just waste your time (would have been fine if there was something to explore or pickup at those deadends)-Broom/dust puzzels become very tedious after a few hours, especially when you are backtracking through dungeons trying to figure out where to go-Garbage storyOverall, 6.5/10.  Good game to experience if the price is right, but nothing to really write home about.  Beginning of the game is the strongest imo.			"

												Anodyne is a delightful, surreal, pixel-art masterpiece. Total gameplay time for the main storyline is a bit short (6 hours at  the most) but there are a lot of end-game secrets. Challenge level is minimal, but the environments are spectacular. Unfortunately the various levels do not tie together especially well, so it will probably take a bit of digging on your part to make sense of the world of Anodyne and how its levels relate to one another thematically. Still, it's a solid game for fans of Zelda:LTTP, surrealism, or gamers who love the 'indie' vibe.			"

												On the whole, if you want a fun and unique Zelda-like action-adventure game with puzzles you couldn't go wrong with Anodyne. The music is good, the look is interesting, the gameplay is generally solid. It's not without flaws. When it comes to jumping, you will probably be swearing a lot because the game feels ""slippery"" when it comes to edges. There's also a fair bit of tedious exploring at the end of the game to get the necessary items to progress to the final area. But overall, it's a pretty solid and fun game that will take you between 3-6 hours to beat on your first try.			"

Young. Guide him through the Dungeons, woods, cliffs, and plains given, and help him collect as many cards (Which are required to progress) as possible, and have a blast doing so!I could say much more about this game, but if you're actually interested just PM me, it's truely a gem among many of it's indie brothers, unfortunately, very underrated and underplayed, why do I say this? Well, out of my 110+ Friends on steam, NONE OF THEM play Anodyne! Thats shocking! :OC'mon guys, do you're pal Thundar a favor and BUY THIS GAME! It's not expensive at all, heck as far as I remember it's around £/$/€5-10			"

												Fun but very buggy and the developer isn't gonna fix anything.He actually told me it was unreasonable to expect bug fixes because he was working on his own and already busy with a new project. Apparently it's not his responsibility to finish his projects before starting on something else and apparently it's our responsibility to know that it's a one man team before asking for a game that works.Oh yeah and the game itself is fun when it's not bugged out but there's a big luck factor. If you take a certain road you have to start the entire game all over again because when you take a certain route via a certain gate you get stuck while there's nothing to warn you about that. Not really thought through, or that way they can sell it as if it's got replayability. Because the chance you'll be able to finish it the first time is small.In short very amateuristic developer and a great concept for a game that just isn't really finished.

												I bought this thinking it would be an RPG based on its appearance (which is entirely my fault, because nowhere does it promise to be an RPG).  It is not an RPG in any way shape or form, despite its superficial similarity to games of said genre.  This is a console style action game through and through, a type of game which I loathe.  If you like that type of game, you might enjoy this game.  If you're looking for an Pc-style adventure game or RPG, you might hate it as much as I do.			"

												Anodyne's story has been criticised for being pretentious. I cannot agree with this criticism as I couldn't even work out what the hell the story was. Signs and characters make cryptic statements, none of which gel with any other sign's or character's cryptic statements, leaving the player alternately baffled and bemused, and propelled only by the gameplay, which is fairly decent without being amazing.Is it pretentious? I don't know, but it is most certainly extremely poorly told.			"

												Most mediocre game of the year, 2014. Seriously, this is the most banal and bland game I have ever attempted to play. It's neither good, nor is it particular bad. While the areas are varied, the terrible ones go on forever while the interesting ones are kept really short as well as having a really boring mode of progressing the story.Overall, I really wish I could give a neutral review, although I'm leaning toward negative simply because I can't recommend it. If it seems interesting to you, try waiting for a sale, I can't say it's worth the full asking price.			"

												I got this game with the humble bundle I purchased and had the lowest of expectations and was still disappointed.  It seems like this game was made 10 years ago by people who didn't have the game's best interests in mind. The enemies are always easy to defeat including the underwhelming bosses. Your character's weapon is a broom, which is amusing at first, but the novelty quickly wears off. I did not complete this game or in fact get very far as I found it extremely boring.			"

												This game is a bunch of incoherent garbage that never goes anywhere.  It does a lot of interesting world building throughout, but never follows through on any of it.  Basically, lots of mystery, no real answer.  It's one of those interpretive symbolic games that doesn't actually give you enough to make it worth the trouble.  Avoid this game if you don't like that sort of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ unsatisfying ending.  Avoid this game if you do, because it's not even good compared to those kinds of games.			"

												Anodyne is a game that a lot of people will look at the visuals and be like ""zomg my childhood.""  ♥♥♥♥ it, I can't even write a review for this. The game ♥♥♥♥ing sucks♥♥♥♥♥ The puzzles are bs in a lot of ways, the game design is pure garbage and it's quite obvious the developers got lazy and gave up.See the thing is that Anodyne had a really interesting meta story going for it, then about two hours in, the entire thing is completely dropped for no real reason. I was actually quite interested, but then no one ever spoke of the story again. It's easy to get lost in, the puzzles can be obnoxiously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and it has pointless grinding to continue to the end because the devs couldn't think of any other way to make you keep playing.The cards are stupid, most of them you won't have any idea where the hell to even find them unless you look up a guide. The game just doesn't tell you. This would be fine if some of the cards didn't require you to magically know that you need to move one ordinary piece of the background in order to get to a ""debug"" world or something similar.Honestly, don't waste your time. It's full of so many incredibly frustrating problems that unless you can get it for less than 2 dollars, pass.Verdict: PASS			"

Posted: September 16, 2015
												I really, really wanted to like this game. A surreal, creepy take on the Zelda formula set in its protagonist's subconscious? Sign me up. Unfortunately, Anodyne fails not just at being a ""deep"" experience but at being a functional game.Hit detection is terrible. The worst I've ever seen in a professional game. It's incredibly frustrating, especially when the game frequently demands pixel perfect movements from the player. It's tolerable until the jump boots are introduced, at which point I was frequently subjected to the clumsiest, buggiest platforming I've ever seen. Countless times my character would land on the edge of a platform, only to hang there for a second and then ""slide"" off. Either they didn't playtest this at all, or they were comfortable with such awful core gameplay. Not sure which is worse.The creators implemented mercy invincibility, but seem unclear on the purpose of it. Your character is invincible for a fraction of a second after being hit, but flashes for much longer than that. Expect to take damage from the same enemy/attack 3-4 times before you can move him. Even regular enemies enjoy a much longer window of invincibility than you, making combat much slower and more annoying than it needed to be. Enemy attacks carry a huge amount of knockback, frequently ruining attempts at platforming sections.The game is divided into about 50% dungeon crawling and 50% combing the map for cards. The former is irritating because of the above mentioned problems. Puzzles are very simple; there wasn't a single one that required an ounce of thought once I had figured out the central mechanic. (Oh, I jump on this to make it move...time to do that 1000 times.) Bosses (with the exception of the more ambitious but terribly designed final boss) can be beaten just by rushing them and hitting them faster than they hit you. There's no strategy required, and you only have a single attack for the entire game.Hunting for cards (which is mandatory) is a transparent way of extending the game's runtime. A few are cleverly hidden. The rest are just crammed in the most obscure, closed off nooks and crannies of the map. The cards do nothing besides unlock health containers, and, eventually, the path to the final boss. Even with this padding, Anodyne is very short. My blind playthrough, 100%ing the game and taking my time, took about five hours.For a Zelda ripoff, Anodyne contains very few usable items. You get a broom (your weapon) and jump boots. Two optional upgrades very slightly change your broom's range, which feels like a cruel joke on anyone who wanted a varied gameplay experience. The only remotely novel gameplay element is an item that lets you swap two tiles, but it can only be used on a single, incredibly dull puzzle. Beating the game lets you use it anywhere, but since the only thing left to do at that point is go find more cards, I've yet to touch the post game content.On the more superficial side of things, a lot of the buzz surrounding this game concerned its graphics and soundtrack. The graphics are fine if you're not tired of the whole 16 bit tribute thing by now. Apparently the main character wears a hoodie; I didn't realize this until it was pointed out in dialog. Most of the animations look sloppy.As for the music, it is an absolute insult that the OST is being sold for $5. Anodyne has the worst ""retro"" game soundtrack I've ever heard: just tinny, low quality attempts at chiptunes. Nearly all of the tracks are short loops. Most of them are just forgettable in the ""might as well be white noise"" sense. A few stand out as so awful I had to mute the game to make it through their respective areas. Even if I loved this game, I wouldn't spend a cent on the soundtrack.As far as the plot, writing, atmosphere...the things that interested me about this game? Disappointing.There's very little actual plot. The premise is you're the chosen one on a quest to save the land from the darkness. That's the exact language the game uses, and it thinks it's being clever as it bashes you over the head with it. It broadcasts its only real twist from minute one, and doesn't subvert this premise in any significant way. The ending is about twenty seconds long: nothing explained, a cheesy joke and a fade to black. ♥♥♥♥ that.Before playing this, I saw a few reviews that noted that the tone was all over the place. Which I thought would be interesting. The game cycles you through generic video game tropes, horror, and humor. Unfortunately, the writer isn't strong enough to juggle these ideas. The horror elements aren't scary enough, and the jokes not funny enough, to be welcome, interesting or justified. I couldn't shake the sense that Anodyne was a dumping ground for every single idea the developers had, but without a decent design plan the various pop culture references and spooooky uterus themed dungeons never become anything more than the sum of their parts.And it's all pointless anyway, since the game expects you to forget about these weird asides the moment they end. We're left with a very boring, standard video game fantasy plot with some token ambiguity about what it all might mean. But again, the writing is just not strong enough to make you care about that.If Anodyne had been free, I might have a more charitable opinion of it. It has some interesting ideas, but the developers lacked the ability or willingness to refine them. But I paid $3.50 for it and am walking away feeling profoundly ripped off. The idea of paying $10 for it makes me nauseated.			"

												This is a very interesting little game that for some reason reminds me not only of Zelda but also Chip's Challenge.If you want a game with decent challenge and something to relax this is a fairly easygoing game that won't frustrate you.Oh and in the game there is a Sage character who usually shows up near an orange and red statue. Take note to listen to what he says and read the statue afterwards because he is actually reading off the statue lol			"

												This is a really, really trippy one. The best I can describe it is Zelda meets Yume Nikki. The gameplay is very solid, the characters are highly amusing, and there is a huge range of how every area makes you feel, from the serene to the scary.To this day, I'm not sure what it's about, but I don't think it matters that much.There is also something amusing about fighting monsters with a broom			"

												This is for all of the people who are calling this game a Zelda rip-off:Look, I understand where you're coming from.  At many times I would see something in the game and go ""OH, really showing your roots there Anodyne, might as well just call your last boss Ganon and slap on a green hat...""  but then, I did something that really helped me appreciate the game, and games in general, for that matter.  I stopped evaluating it with respect to other games.  I considered it by itself.  The art style is beautiful, and it's not fair to say that just because other games have succeeded using a pixel art aesthetic that Anodyne is just riding their coattails.  Is it true?  Maybe.  Is is a fair criticism?  No.  It's really not.  Look at the game again and tell me it isn't beautiful.  I spent so much time in the world of Anodyne not because I miss my old Link's Awaknening game, but because it was a world in which I truly enjoyed to be.  So, the moral of the story is this:  you can tell me that the game lacked meaning, or didn't appeal to you, or that you didn't like the art style or humor or direction or pacing or any other legitimate complaint.  Just at least give it the credit to evaluate it by its OWN merits.The platforming is fun and challenging, the myriad of ways in which the designers have you exploring the broom mechanic is brilliant, the characters are quirky and fun, the world is gorgeous, and I truly enjoyed every part of this game.  I would recommend this game a thousand times over.			"

												This is what you get when you mix the gameplay of the 2D Zeldas with the surrealness of something like EarthBound. I wasn't expecting much going in, but it ended up being enjoyable by the end of it. (Now if only we could open that 50-card door...)Anodyne has some strong points and good moments that I won't spoil here. It's worth the asking price if you're a fan of the 2D Zeldas, but it needs some polish to be truly *great*.For starters, as a first impression, when first running the game it asked me to adjust the window's size with the arrow keys (what game does this?), which couldn't even be held down to change the size and then proved to be completely useless when I could just change the settings to presets in the menu later. I understand this was originally made in Flash but the PC port should be more standardized with the resolution and other options.There's quite a few dead-ends that *look* meaningful, but are really nothing of use and that makes the world feel more empty than it should be. Also the overworld could have been much more interesting but instead is just a bunch of mostly arbitrarily-placed portals to the different levels, of which have no labels to identify them aside from the small screenshot of the area (heck, even the signs in the levels are worn away and as such don't tell you where you're going).My other critique would be that the pacing/story should be stronger. Finding the protagonist's signature broom is simply a plain chest in a plain room. The item itself is hilarious because there's nothing special about it and yet it's the weapon for the whole game, but the moment of getting it shouldn't have been so plain.Overall, Anodyne is fairly imprssive considering it was made in 10 months by 2 developers, but it could have used more polish to really stand out as something greater than a Zelda-inspired dungeon-crawler.

												This is a game that has a lot of promise, but ultimately falls flat. It's delightfully atmospheric and the game's creators are masters of tone, making clever use of classic visuals and music to evoke feeling very well. However, gameplay quickly grows repetitive, and the exploration is much more confined than the games it was clearly inspired by, such as the Legend of Zelda series. The story is bare-bones yet still interesting, with interesting moments woven into the gameplay, such as attempting to talk to a fisherman but ending up accidentally murdering him because the game makes you attack instead, resulting in a bloody whirlpool in the ocean.The game ultimately feels more like a rough draft or a demo of a much more fascinating, fully fleshed out game. I wish I could like this more than I do.			"

												Anodyne is one of these short sweet indie games that offer a great experience while it last. The story stars with a character named young waking up to find himself in a dreamrelm. He then comes across a sage who says he is the chosen one and must   defeat the creatures in order to escape. What makes the story special is how the bosses and NPC's seem to have different ideas about what is going on and sharing them with you. The gameplay is very similar to the old Legend of Zelda games. Both have an overhead view and use a weapon for stabbing your enemies. The main differences come with the limited items and main weapon. You use a broom throughout the game to dispatch enemies and activate switches and the only usable item you obtain is some jumping shoes that allow you to jump which is used allot in later areas. The game looks fantastic with a retro art style. It fits the world and setting nicely and the game isn’t afraid of some dark tones when it wants to. The settings are also quite unique where you find yourself in a hotel or a strange universe instead of your usual dungeons and temples. Music is nice most of the time and has some nice tracks that I wouldn’t mind downloading. Anodyne mages to bring back the dying overhead action adventure genre and does it in such a well way. The game may only be 5-6 hours long but it is well worth the money and it was only made by two guys in less than a year. Pick it up some time and experience it for yourself.			"

												Anodyne has a great atmosphere and decent gameplay, but its slow pace will be off-putting to many players.What was awesome:As I said above, the atmosphere was wonderful. The music really sets the tone the developer wanted and the pixel art was beautifully done. I also enjoyed the diversity between the worlds you explore.What was okay:The mechanics the game supplies you feel fresh, but leave you feeling over-prepared in the often empty environment. The ambiguous storyline may be a deal-break for some, so know what to expect before you purchase the game.What was bad:Your initial visit to each world is exciting, but the backtracking gets old. The problem is that Anodyne never enthralls the player enough to want to stick around. Just when you start to get immersed in a boss battle or a puzzle, the game decides to slow down.If you like games that focus on exploration and have the patience it takes to explore the entire game, give Anodyne a chance.

Plenty of humorous bits of dialogue.  A lot of people are comparing it to early Zelda games, but I think it's much more akin to Earthbound in style and feel.  The dungeons are more like platforming puzzles, and the 'combat' feels far secondary to the jumping and other puzzles.Great game, if you like Earthbound and Secret of Evermore, I'd say this game is right up your alley.

												What do you get when you mix one part Zelda, one part Cthulhu, and one part…well, I’m inclined to say Earthbound, but somebody already has and while it’s certainly odd and funny at times, it comes off as more bizarre than anything. Anyway, you get Anodyne, a game about…well, I’m not really sure. I do know that it has a similar look and feel to older Zelda games, but it’s way darker.  The game pokes fun at various videogame tropes, but also throws a few of its own out there, such as collecting cards in order to proceed because doors are apparently…shy…and won’t open if you don’t have them.No, not keycards either; collector cards for different monsters. Yeah, the game is definitely bizarre.  It’s also very fun and intriguing. There are a number of things that happen in the game you certainly don’t expect, but that’s not saying much from a game like this. Really, I’m halfway between not wanting to spoil anything and also not really understanding what I’m looking at all at the same time. It’s cheap, it’s fun, and it’s definitely worth it.			"

												This game isn't for everyone, but hardcores and nostalgics will both be mystified by Anodyne. This game is not at all what it looks like and it really is greater than the sum of its parts. At times playing this game struck such a chord in me that I couldn't really sleep at night. It gets you thinking, and it's not a comfortable experience.In order to get the full experience of this game, you'll need to play it obsessively. Then again, if you're not a completionist, this game's message wasn't really written for you.TL;DR: This is a must play for hardcores, but don't expect it to be fun all the time and don't expect it to make you feel good. Ever.			"

												What do you get when you mix one part Zelda, one part Cthulhu, and one part…well, I’m inclined to say Earthbound, but somebody already has and while it’s certainly odd and funny at times, it comes off as more bizarre than anything. Anyway, you get Anodyne, a game about…well, I’m not really sure. I do know that it has a similar look and feel to older Zelda games, but it’s way darker.  The game pokes fun at various videogame tropes, but also throws a few of its own out there, such as collecting cards in order to proceed because doors are apparently…shy…and won’t open if you don’t have them.No, not keycards either; collector cards for different monsters. Yeah, the game is definitely bizarre.  It’s also very fun and intriguing. There are a number of things that happen in the game you certainly don’t expect, but that’s not saying much from a game like this. Really, I’m halfway between not wanting to spoil anything and also not really understanding what I’m looking at all at the same time. It’s cheap, it’s fun, and it’s definitely worth it.			"

												Anodyne is one of these short sweet indie games that offer a great experience while it last. The story stars with a character named young waking up to find himself in a dreamrelm. He then comes across a sage who says he is the chosen one and must   defeat the creatures in order to escape. What makes the story special is how the bosses and NPC's seem to have different ideas about what is going on and sharing them with you. The gameplay is very similar to the old Legend of Zelda games. Both have an overhead view and use a weapon for stabbing your enemies. The main differences come with the limited items and main weapon. You use a broom throughout the game to dispatch enemies and activate switches and the only usable item you obtain is some jumping shoes that allow you to jump which is used allot in later areas. The game looks fantastic with a retro art style. It fits the world and setting nicely and the game isn’t afraid of some dark tones when it wants to. The settings are also quite unique where you find yourself in a hotel or a strange universe instead of your usual dungeons and temples. Music is nice most of the time and has some nice tracks that I wouldn’t mind downloading. Anodyne mages to bring back the dying overhead action adventure genre and does it in such a well way. The game may only be 5-6 hours long but it is well worth the money and it was only made by two guys in less than a year. Pick it up some time and experience it for yourself.			"

												If you happen to enjoy the Zelda titles on Game Boy (Color) and consider atmosphere and immersion to be a big part of your gaming experience, then by all means, give Anodyne a chance.Initially initerested in the similarities to one of my favourite game franchises and my favourite games within, I was treated to an astoundingly well designed gem. Only having stumbled across this by chance I can't believe what I would have missed out here, sound design, level design, gameplay, everything seems to be exactly in place where it should be. All of this while retaining an ominous and mysterious world I for once actually felt like I was exploring something new.Anyone who considered this game on a first glance, don't worry, you won't be disappointed if you purchase into this indie gem, and to anyone else, give yourself a push! You won't regret it!			"

The game captures this half-awake dream logic where you aren't quite sure what you're trying to do but you know it's very important.  When describing this game, I am inclined to contrast it with the average violent FPS; the violence is superficially disturbing, but the repetetive motions and reflex-based action is relaxing.  This game is the opposite, superficially relaxing yet on a deeper level it is vaguely unsettling.10/10			"

												Simply put, I love this game. It provokes a sense of wonder and engagement due to its amazing artstyle, beautiful, wistful music, and solid gameplay.i had orginally downloaded this game off of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as they first advertised there about 2 years ago. I loved the game so much I decided to just buy it and it has now become one of the very very few games I've replayed twice. Too many great indie games are caught up in difficulty; such intense gameplay often detracts from my experience because it gives me little time to appreciate the music and art. This is different. Like Zelda: Link to the Past, I find myself exploring and running around just for fun while enjoying the difficult battles within the dungeons.No question. If you like Zelda, adventure games, or little indie games with a huge soul, do not hesistate and buy this game.			"

												Anodyne is a game which I bought for $3 along with a bundle of other assorted indie games. Having finished it, I can wholeheartedly recommend it, even at full price, for it imparts simplicity, solitude, and subtlety that I find rather underappreciated or ignored these days.The story, ostensibly about a human named Young attempting to protect ""The Briar"" from ""The Darkness"" that has spread across ""The Land"", would be rather uninteresting if it were not for how the game's description directly states that it all takes place within Young's subconscious. Resulting from this is a somewhat lonely journey which focuses more on succinct phrases rather than grandiose spiels and atmosphere over tangibility, overall akin to going through a series of dreams within a larger dream (which is no surprise as Yume Nikki is cited as one of the inspirations for this game). Later on in the game the ideas and caricatures presented occasionally get a bit too obtuse for me to understand, but the main theme of the plot is still clear and I was quite satisfied by the ending. Moreover, Anodyne never interrupts its gameplay for an extended period of time to exposit or pontificate, which is nice as it means players are not forced to care about the game's script if they do not want to. That would be a shame, however, as the multiple lines of dialogue from the game's NPCs and signs tend to be incredibly humorous or chilling, sometimes both at the same time.Mechanically, the game is not particularly complex; imagine Link's Awakening but with no items outside of the Sword and the Roc's Feather. Although Young gains several equippable upgrades throughout the course of the game, the majority of them just increase the range of his broom, and the enemy and obstacle counts are not particularly high either. As such, the majority of the game consists of exploring the overworld (surprisingly large and spanning multiple environments), slaying enemies (both passive and aggressive), clearing dungeons (about as much as you'd expect in a Zelda game), vanquishing bosses (all of them uniquely designed and fairly tough), and ultimately collecting cards which are required to progress further in the game.Nonetheless, the rooms of each dungeon tend to be designed well enough that old adversaries often offer new challenges. There are also some tricky puzzles and platforming sections as well, the latter sometimes becoming a bit too tricky due to the top-down perspective. Honestly though, there are only two points of contention I truly have with the gameplay. Firstly, the collection of said cards might put off players who do not enjoy backtracking and exploring EVERYWHERE. I was personally okay with it, though Young's mediocre movement speed made the task plodding at times. Secondly, the post-game is rather lackluster, basically furthering the card seeking with a late-introduced gimmick which can be hard to control along with literally exploiting glitches; it feels like an afterthought. Other than that, the simplicity of the game is a mark in its favor.Moving on to aesthetics, the game describes its visuals as ""GBC/16-bit"", which is certainly true and they are sprited very well in that style, but what really stood out to me were the gorgeous overlays that complimented many of the game's areas. I'm particularly a fan of the cliffs (pictured above), which are bathed in a warm sunset's glow, along with some later, gloomier areas which would be a shame to spoil. The sound design is excellent as well, especially the ""Obtain Key"" noise which is utterly jarring and I love it.Continued...			"

												Anodyne is a strange game, similar to Zelda but not as upbeat. As Young, you find a broom and use that as your weapon throughout, collecting cards and clearing dungeons. There are some very interesting puzzles, and the locations are very unique, with some being completely bizarre or unsettling. The story is a bit odd and I can't really wrap my head around it, but that is probably just me.The music is also completely different than you should expect such a game to be. It is more... drone-like than it is upbeat. It can be pretty creepy at times, but it absolutely is something to behold and makes for a unique experience while playing.A playthrough will take 3 or 4 hours first playthrough, and a full speedrun achievement asks for less than 3 hours, so it isn't too long, but it is very unique for what it is. I highly recommend picking this up sometime. You could do a lot worse.			"

												Despite loving the Zelda/exploration/adventure genre, and despite enjoying several parts of this game, I cannot in good faith recommend it.

This might not seem like a major issue, but jumping becomes an essential aspect of the gameplay, and it is incredibly frustrating to repeatedly die at certain points due to vague collision detection and poor controls. It didn't feel difficult because it required skill, but instead because it felt clunky and unpolished. I never found myself thinking, ""I did it! Cool! That was hard but rewarding!"" but rather, ""Thank god that's over--hopefully I don't encounter that sort of thing ever again!""--There were bugs noticeable enough to hamper gameplay. On several occasions, I fell into a pit, respawned, and then randomly found my character teleported back into the pit (thus taking double damage for a fall). In one instance, I somehow respawned from one room into another and found myself irreversibly stuck in a pit until I died. There were also a few times where the game went unresponsive, but I suspect that this is a mac compatibility issue. (These weren't the only bugs--there were troubles with water, for instance, and collision detection in general--but the ones mentioned were the most salient and annoying.)--The story seems like fragments from a crappy pseudo-philosophical dream. There is no real development,* the dialogue does not make a great deal of sense (though ""dream""-like and ambiguous enough to lend it an illusion of depth and wisdom); in short, the game didn't really take off or make me ""feel"" anything. It was entertaining at times: there were glimpses of interesting story ideas and a coherent ""style""; there were characters I tried/began to like; there were some exciting discoveries; there were interesting/unique areas that I wanted to somehow develop a nostalgic fondness for...but it all just fell sort of flat. In the end credits, the enemies are named in a ""cast"", but they are given extremely boring or otherwise obvious names (""The Wall""; ""Frog""; etc.); I think this epitomized my experience: there were things, and things sort of happened, but ultimately it felt unmemorable and like something(s) was missing. I won't look back on this game with any feeling of warmth but instead with an attitude of ""Yes, I played that. It had some good ideas, but meh. It was okay.""If you like exploration enough to disregard some bugs, frustrating mechanics, and lack of compelling narrative, go for it! Otherwise, I'd recommend maybe picking this up on sale and seeing what you think.*Even if lack of development is part of the ""point""--e.g. existential uncertainty, absurdism, etc.--it doesn't ""feel"" right in this sort of game. Character development, surprising turns of narrative and anagnorises (""HE was the bad guy all along??"" or ""So THAT'S what that thing was!""), moments where the story ""coils back"" upon itself and redefines what has come before...this is all missing. There might be a place for bold Zelda-esque dream-like existentialism (where, perhaps, the clues unravel nothing and the journey leads to nowhere in particular), but it was not well executed here: the game is too ""conventional"" (it has a general sense of progress/story) and non-experimental enough for me to justify the lack of some sort of satisfying, interconnected, overarching narrative.

												Great game, I got it at 50% off. Love it. Lots of dungeons, lots of gameplay. A bit limited on parts, but it is an indie game made by I believe just two people so whatcha' going to do? Basically. Hack and Slash.. with a broom!(and a sword in parts. xD), It is short(Could probably beat it in under 10 hours easily without much effort). End-game after0play is fun with the swap feature to get to play it a bit more.Quick recap-Zeldaisque gameplay-Swap feature adds to additional game-play after beating game-A bit challenging in parts but for the most part easy.-Very good music for an indie game-Glitchy in Spots.Worth it. Buy it on sale. You could buy it at $10, but personally I don't think there is enough in it for $10, so get it on sale.:D			"

												This game was a lot of fun(it was part of a Humble Bundle). It has a lot of inspirations from the classic Zelda games. Only thing difficult was the jumping action sometimes didnt work as expected. I used a xbox360 controller and would have probably been better if I could have configured the d pad instead of the analog stick. Also for the first part of the game there is not much guidance so you are on your own to explore or use the guides created by people here.TL;DR This is a great Zelda-ish game to explore.			"

												This game retains both the gameplay feel of the original Zelda, and the quirkiness and psychological absurdity of Earthbound fused into one, mysterious and, at times, wonderful, RPG. For me, I think this game by its own merits is a very interesting game at the very least, with a unique feel to the artwork, and some of the most luscious, entrancing melodies I have ever heard in a videogame. They seem to shimmer with celestial mystery, and at other times, shift into quaint, innocent tunes which fits perfectly with the idylic, art inspired world. The fact that this game, was done by literally only two people is beyond incredible, and the complexity of the project and beauty of the music when looking at the budget and manpower attests to the ingenuity and imagination of the developers. However, there are some flaws which certainly makes me think this game often betrays good gameplay or even an entertaining story for overly abstract and 'out there' symbolism. The use of the broom, although an amusing play on the sound of Link's sword, makes for an especially boring weapon and means of interacting with the world. Never mind the grating sound as the broom emerges before you, the lack of any other notable weapons and tools (unlike Zelda which had a whole set of tools to diversify gameplay) makes being stuck with this weapon feel limiting and maddening at times. This same lack of variety also plagues the enemies, who don't necessarily feel special or unique enough to employ any more meaningful strategy than 'attack with your broom and hope for the best'. Having said this, whilst the combat gameplay feels beyond mundane, some of the puzzles are much more convincing, and reminded me of the good days of more challenging Zelda puzzles. In the end, definitely get this game and try it out, it is, in my opinion, one of the most innovative and atmospheric RPGs I've seen in a long time, but it is plagued by a few narrative decisions that seriously hinder the gameplay and a story that often seems to run away from concrete themes and ideas into the black abyss of abstract meaning. I seriously hope for the next game by these two talented developers, and hope they continue to pour resources to channel their amazing ideas into a more solid gameplay experience to match the incredible sophistication of the atmosphere and beauty their games attain.

												A nice over-the-top style game with a grim retro feel. The story is compelling and truly immersive as well. It's true to the ""Legend of Zelda"" feel as well. Music fits with the subject matter, and although it does get annoying when you have to venture across 100% (and even more after a certain point in the game), the stages keep you fairly involved. The difficulty varies here and there, but all-in-all, the game is worth the buy to play. It's a really long game, but I found it worth my pay.			"

												It's certainly interesting, though a little rough around the edges. It has a mood and flavor, but with a little more polish and concentration could be something really great. As it stands, if you want something like Off or Yume Nikki (and it's clear the developers tried really really hard to follow in their footsteps) then Anodyne could work for you.But then again, you could just play Off or Yume Nikki, couldn't you? That's the problem with Anodyne, because the technical design is very rudimentary and lacking in some basic graces the game is less than it could be. The first dungeon is a clear indicator of this issue.At the very least, play for a few hours. I recommend it mostly because I'd like to see these people make more games in the future. And perhaps as they hone their craft they'll work out the little kinks.			"

The game captures this half-awake dream logic where you aren't quite sure what you're trying to do but you know it's very important.  When describing this game, I am inclined to contrast it with the average violent FPS; the violence is superficially disturbing, but the repetetive motions and reflex-based action is relaxing.

The graphics are low-res, and the sound effects are meh, but the music is pretty decent.Unfortunately, it uses Adobe Air, which currently fights my window manager (xmonad) for control of the window, and ends up getting progressively slower over the course of seconds until it is unuseable.

The puzzles won't leave you scratching your head for long, but they are satisfying when completed. The soundtrack is a pleasure for your ears, and I recommend playing with quality headphones. The story is very abstract and leaves a lot open for interpretation, and I can forsee it being lost on most people. Overall, Anodyne is worth your time and money.			"

Not much thought seems to have gone into this game at first until, as you progress, you feel more and more alone and divided from your comfort zone. Immediately you are thrown into a world of darkness and despair; locations and enemies have odd names, people seem friendly or derranged and harmless, and you yourself - named Young - access the world of Anodyne through a strange dreamlike overworld on a weird quest given to you after being rudely awoken. Although rather short, Anodyne is a great game for those who want a simple, not-so-relaxed indie game that will keep you playing and guessing.			"

												This is a game that has a lot of promise, but ultimately falls flat. It's delightfully atmospheric and the game's creators are masters of tone, making clever use of classic visuals and music to evoke feeling very well. However, gameplay quickly grows repetitive, and the exploration is much more confined than the games it was clearly inspired by, such as the Legend of Zelda series. The story is bare-bones yet still interesting, with interesting moments woven into the gameplay, such as attempting to talk to a fisherman but ending up accidentally murdering him because the game makes you attack instead, resulting in a bloody whirlpool in the ocean.The game ultimately feels more like a rough draft or a demo of a much more fascinating, fully fleshed out game. I wish I could like this more than I do.			"

												While not a bad game, if you've ever played a Link to the Past or Link's Awakening, you don't need to play this game. If you haven't played either of those, I'm afraid I would still have to recommend them over this game. It has some interesting ideas, but isn't anywhere near as compelling, interesting, or fun to play as the Zelda games it is clearly mimicking. It might be worth checking out if you're a diehard Zelda fan who is interested in any game that is at all similar, but to everyone else, I would say this is an adventure you can skip.			"

												It's certainly interesting, though a little rough around the edges. It has a mood and flavor, but with a little more polish and concentration could be something really great. As it stands, if you want something like Off or Yume Nikki (and it's clear the developers tried really really hard to follow in their footsteps) then Anodyne could work for you.But then again, you could just play Off or Yume Nikki, couldn't you? That's the problem with Anodyne, because the technical design is very rudimentary and lacking in some basic graces the game is less than it could be. The first dungeon is a clear indicator of this issue.At the very least, play for a few hours. I recommend it mostly because I'd like to see these people make more games in the future. And perhaps as they hone their craft they'll work out the little kinks.			"

												Anodyne is a very fun, and sufficiently lengthy Legend of Zelda-like fantasy adventure game.  However, don't expect an ending that explains anything of the story nor wraps up tight very many loose ends.  It would seem that the developer ran out of funds or just got tired of the product and decided to cut the game short just at the moment your hopes are at their peak that you are about to reveal something epic and enlightening, only to dash them with one of the most unfulfilling endings I'd ever experienced in a game of this sort.  I'm sure, however, there are plenty of fans out there who will attempt to defend the game by claiming that this unfinished ending is meant to be cryptic somehow and you make of it what you will.  I simply say to that, were that the case, I still consider it a lazy way to not finish what you started.  So then, fun gameplay and lots of interesting secrets to find if you like Zelda clones, well-made and great story up to a point just when it begins to feel unfinished.  Real stinker of an ending when it could have easily been very epic.  I still recommend it to play through once and only once for anyone.			"

												After spending a few hours with this game, the confusion and difficulty curve became too much to continue for me. When I started the game, it seemed like it was going to be a decent Zelda clone, but after the first half hour roughly that didn't pan out quite as much as anticipated.I did enjoy some aspects of the game such as the ""hub' world, but even that quickly turned to a highly confusing area for me. Honestly the problem is that I just couldn't follow along with the story or where I was supposed to be going at any given point. Exploration rewarded me in hitting improbable areas or back tracking where I had already been. There was just no clear path of what/where I should be heading.I can certainly appreciate the depth and overarching story that exists, but this was just not the game for me.			"

												Anodyne is a delightful break from the mundane amongst a sea of rubbish. The indie games category has grown into an overwhelming flood of mediocrity and inadequacy - traits that Anodyne does NOT share. Coupling Earthbound-esque attitude/theme and early Zelda influence for gameplay, Anodyne brings to the table a brief but completely enjoyable experience that is somehow both classic and also undeniably modernly influenced. Enjoy it for what it is and kill an afternoon in the pleasures of pixelated adventure throwback glory.			"

												Anodyne is a top-down adventure game in the same vain as Legend of Zelda and Startropics. You will journey through a vast world of strange places in a dream like state that holds little to no consistency. The music adds to the foreboding mood and pushes you through to meet some crazy characters along the way. You’ll be confronted by some well designed puzzles and lose life after life jumping over chasms and scratching your head through boss battles. If there was ever a time to take a chance on an unknown developer, Anodyne is the one I would recommend.http://iamericm.com/2014/01/anodyne-indie-game-review/ "

The scenery, music, and general creepiness of Anodyne produce an addictive dreamlike atmosphere.When I bought it I sat and played it to completion, which took a little over 5 hours.

												Anodyne is a strange game, similar to Zelda but not as upbeat. As Young, you find a broom and use that as your weapon throughout, collecting cards and clearing dungeons. There are some very interesting puzzles, and the locations are very unique, with some being completely bizarre or unsettling. The story is a bit odd and I can't really wrap my head around it, but that is probably just me.The music is also completely different than you should expect such a game to be. It is more... drone-like than it is upbeat. It can be pretty creepy at times, but it absolutely is something to behold and makes for a unique experience while playing.A playthrough will take 3 or 4 hours first playthrough, and a full speedrun achievement asks for less than 3 hours, so it isn't too long, but it is very unique for what it is. I highly recommend picking this up sometime. You could do a lot worse.			"

												A fantastical Zelda-like adventure that meanders from parody and homage into deconstruction and psychological themes – and back again.  Fun, thought-provoking, and beautifully crafted, this is a must-have for fans of action-adventure and artistic titles alike.  Plus, features the very unusual combination of SNES-style graphics at (roughly) Game Boy Color resolution, with a CD-quality soundtrack...			"

												This had been sitting in my library for a long time, but it has become one of my favorite steam games. The two devs did an incredible job at creating a game that had a very distinct retro feel, while also having a story and environments that are completely different from what you would expect from a traditional zelda game. It is a must-buy in my opinion.			"

												I'm not sure how I would categorize this game. Adventure? Surreal? Psychological? I simply can't decide.But that's not important. Not really.This is a game that makes you think. About life, about dreams. You play Young, a man whose story I am not privy to; but, like the kind of game it is, this, at the moment, is unimportant. I am interested; that is all that is really needed.The gameplay, as you could gather from the description, is much like Zelda: A Link to the Past. It is simple, dungeon filled, puzzle-ridden fun. You wander the land in search of keys, cards, and items.Scattered around the land are signs. Some are faded; some simply state thoughts.Thoughts like ""I think you are reading a rock because you don't have any friends.""You will meet interesting people along the way. Some will have something to say. Some will not.I have not finished this game yet, but I look forward to it; and when I do, perhaps, I will write another review.			"

												This game is one of the big reasons I love indie games. A heavily Zelda inspired journey through a surreal landscape with a gorgeous soundtrack. It takes a little while to truly feel engrossed in the games world, but once you do, it becomes a world that you're reluctant to leave. It won't be for everyone; it's not as difficult or challenging as a classic Zelda, yet it still feels rewarding when you make it through an area and finally kill the boss, and more of the enjoyment comes from the atmosphere anyways. The narrative was sparse, and I wished there was just a little more, as I enjoyed trying to puzzle out exactly what was happening, but I was left confused and wanting answers. Being able to glitch out the game as a feature at the end and continue exploring the world was a nice bonus thrown in by the makers, and neatly wrapped up a great experience.8/10			"

												Controls and Mechanics:The controls are simple, basically you use the arrow keys to move and C to fight and to open doors / solve puzzles.The combat mechanic is simple as well, you use your mighty sword (actually it is a broom) to attack the enemys while using the arrow keys to dodge.Puzzles: The puzzles are quite interesting. Anywhere you go, you will find a puzzle you need to solve in order to continue with your adventure.The puzzles require a lot of logic. The most common puzzles in the game require you to play with switches, you will find pushing enemys around a very usefull technic to solve puzzles.Graphics:There is not much I can say about the graphics. The style is very simple and old school, I liked it.Gameplay:The gameplay in anodyne is not the best, you explore the world, solve puzzles, murder stuff and find collectables. The exploring part is really good, there are different kind of areas to explore with many hidden stuff to find. I find the puzzles really annoying because you encounter them a lot. The main problem for me is that killing stuff is just not satisfying in this game, which is really sad.There is as far as I know only one weapon, and in my opinion its bad. Yes you do have option to upgrade your weapon but thats all.Players that don't like to explore will find the game really annoying because you have to explore every inch in the level in order to find cards (keys), without those cards you won't be able to access all the areas, and obviously you won't be able to finish the game.The game is also really short so don't expect a long adventure. Music:The music in the game is great, it helps the mood and I can definitly say that the music is one of the things that encourge you to play. Every level and biome got it's on music and usually it is also really good.Story:The story in the game is really average. The begining make you think it is going to be a really good and interesting story that will suck you in but when you go deeper into the game you get to know that it is not spectacular at all.You play as Young, a guy with a white hair and wierd glasses that uses a broom to save the world. When you start the game you encounter an old dude that give you a quest to search for ""the land"", and thats how your adventure starts.In conclusion, I have to say that maybe others will find the game much more interesting, but I didn't. I can also blame steam offline system, because I played the game while I had free time in the army and I had to be offline and I lost my save games like 4 or 5 times, and it forced me to play through the same areas.Anyways the game is ok but it gets boring really quick. 6/10			"

												This game isn't for everyone, but hardcores and nostalgics will both be mystified by Anodyne. This game is not at all what it looks like and it really is greater than the sum of its parts. At times playing this game struck such a chord in me that I couldn't really sleep at night. It gets you thinking, and it's not a comfortable experience.In order to get the full experience of this game, you'll need to play it obsessively. Then again, if you're not a completionist, this game's message wasn't really written for you.TL;DR: This is a must play for hardcores, but don't expect it to be fun all the time and don't expect it to make you feel good.

												What do you get when you mix one part Zelda, one part Cthulhu, and one part…well, I’m inclined to say Earthbound, but somebody already has and while it’s certainly odd and funny at times, it comes off as more bizarre than anything. Anyway, you get Anodyne, a game about…well, I’m not really sure. I do know that it has a similar look and feel to older Zelda games, but it’s way darker.  The game pokes fun at various videogame tropes, but also throws a few of its own out there, such as collecting cards in order to proceed because doors are apparently…shy…and won’t open if you don’t have them.No, not keycards either; collector cards for different monsters. Yeah, the game is definitely bizarre.  It’s also very fun and intriguing. There are a number of things that happen in the game you certainly don’t expect, but that’s not saying much from a game like this. Really, I’m halfway between not wanting to spoil anything and also not really understanding what I’m looking at all at the same time. It’s cheap, it’s fun, and it’s definitely worth it.			"

This game is very entrancing.  Very trippy storyline, haunting atmosphere, Legend of Zelda-esque game play, and a BEAUTIFUL soundtrack make this game worthwhile. If you're into the old action adventure 16-bit games, definitely add this to your Steam library.  It's such a great game, and it's strangness pulls you right in.

												It’s pretty ok.An action adventure game in the vein of, and clearly inspired by Zelda games. The gameplay mechanics are fun and work well but don’t do much to expand on the basics of its genre. You only get one weapon for the game (a broom of all things) and while there are a few bits of equipment to gather the only new ability you get during the game is jumping. There’s no shield, no bow, no bombs and no spin attack, just you and your broom. And it does work quite well. There’s a good variety in both the enemies and bosses to keep things fun, even if it’s never extraordinary.The game has some nice puzzles as well. Familiar setups that would, in Zelda, be solved by finding a new item are instead solved by manipulating enemies in the area or finding a new use for your broom, which lets you move around surprisingly useful piles of dust in the name of puzzle solving. It’s occasionally quite clever but never really mentally taxing.What sets the game apart is its tone and world, though unfortunately not in a way I’m actually fond of. The world is made up of a series of interconnected areas, but as the game goes on each area starts to get steadily more weird and disconnected. The beach leads to an undersea area, which leads to a zombie filled labyrinth where the graphics suddenly switches from SNES to NES inspired, which leads to a circus (in a cave) filled with notes about people dying in horrible accidents. You wander from a black and white town filled with serial killers to an abstract region of space filled with holographic projections of sentient pyramids ruled over by two cubes who will talk to you about how their “rule” is utterly meaningless as they have no subjects. This in turn leads to a hotel themed dungeon because why not?What is the story linking all this? There isn’t really one, you just work your way through the areas, solve puzzles, defeat bosses and collect cards. At the start of the game the Village Elder (there is no village) tells our hero Young that he must save The Land from the Darkness. It’s hopelessly generic and the game is very much aware of that. There’s a borderline sarcastic aloofness about the whole thing. The Village Elder, despite sending you on your quest, doesn’t actually seem all that enthusiastic about your mission and actually starts to discourage you as things go on.The wrongness and flippancy of it all permeates throughout. A stone sign informs you that stones will never have something different to say if you interact with them more than once, but only when you interact with it a second time. Bosses that talk to you but don’t seem to actually have anything to do with the Darkness that you are supposedly fending off (but is in no way evident). A sign informs you that a parking lot was built in honour of the fact that the major couldn’t find anywhere to park. There’s occasional cursing that seems, to me, to only be there to highlight how jarring cursing is in a game that borrows so much from Zelda.None of this is ever tied up into anything that resembles sense or thematic coherency, at least not to me. Once you defeat the final boss the story shrugs its shoulders and gives you a signoff as opaque as everything preceding it.You do get an extra reward for finishing though - a new ability that allows you to practically tear the gameworld apart in order to traverse hidden areas and find secrets. To be honest though I didn’t feel much motivation to make use for it. A world that doesn’t make sense, and refuses to make sense, a world that revels in not being real rather than attempt to give you a sense of place, is not that interesting to me. And I didn’t particularly care about trying to tease out its last secrets. I think that this sort of thing was done better, and with more thematic relevance, in Porpentine’s Armada. And for that matter I think Armada did the flippant tone better too.This review has probably come across as very negative. Despite the lack of cohesion between areas, many of the areas are quite interesting to explore in and of themselves with some very clever ideas. I honesty did enjoy playing the game and working through it. It’s a consistently fun game even if it doesn’t do anything spectacular. It’s a game a profession reviewer would give a solid 7/10 because the standard game review scale is dumb as hell.			"

												I picked up Anodyne from https://www.chrono.gg/ for a fourth the regular price and I'm glad I did.The art style is beautiful and the music is alternatively atmospheric, clever, and fun in all the right places. The windmill in the rainy area is one of the prettiest locations in the game, just for the lovely rain and reflection effects going on nearby; my favorite track plays in the hotel dungeon and has a very Stewart Copeland, Spyro the Dragon feel. I wish more of the game had made use of that style of music, just because.The characters were charming, funny, and memorable. It's going to take me a long time to forget the wolf on top of the mountain who says he won't hurt you because he isn't like the others, the fisherman I accidentally murdered, and the man on top of the hotel who finds the lit windows of the city beyond to be one of the more beautiful things he's ever seen.The puzzles are variations of kill-everything-in-the-room and press-the-switches, often forcing you to path into certain rooms from a different direction in order to step on an out-of-reach button. They're nothing fancy, but they get the job done and they keep you thinking about how to proceed.I had fun in my playthrough of Anodyne and if you grew up with the Game Boy-era Legend of Zelda titles the way I did, you'll probably enjoy Anodyne, too. Anodyne is cute. Not $10 cute, in my opinion, but still cute. If you happen to catch it on sale, definitely pick up a copy.That said...There's something about the jumping and damage knockback mechanics that make rooms like the following pure agony to play through your first time. That this room occurs almost immediately after the jumping mechanic is introduced only makes it harder on the player.


This room is 33rd-degree levels of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. 
A Screenshot of Anodyne
By: Connor




There often isn't enough of a perspective in Anodyne to really judge where you are in relation to the rest of the world, there are minimal invincibility frames at best when you're actually in the air, and there isn't any forgiveness when you go to touch back down. If your landing is not nearly pixel-perfect, be prepared to take damage, knockback, and/or fall and find yourself obliged to try again. It's a stark contrast from the Roc's Feather in the games that inspired Anodyne, which was the best item in those games precisely because it felt amazing to use. Jumping in Anodyne is anything but.There is a room prior to Card #48 in the debug world that makes every other platforming challenge in Anodyne look like fun by comparison. The footholds are smaller and there is a third roller, and if you screw up, you might accidentally leave the room when you respawn because the player's hitbox occasionally intersects with the view's boundaries when you fall into a pit and reappear. When that happens in the room leading to Card #48, it prevents you from finishing the series of platforming puzzles to acquire your reward and renders you incapable of either going forward or going back. You must commit suicide in order to try again from the beginning.The precision platforming in Anodyne isn't well-implemented and it isn't fun to play. While it's passable in the main game because it's not a major focus, neither quality makes for a fun achievement (""Lots of Cards"") for completionists to hunt. The extras in Anodyne are not worth the effort it takes to gather them. I collected all of them; I know.			"

												Simply put, I love this game. It provokes a sense of wonder and engagement due to its amazing artstyle, beautiful, wistful music, and solid gameplay.i had orginally downloaded this game off of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as they first advertised there about 2 years ago. I loved the game so much I decided to just buy it and it has now become one of the very very few games I've replayed twice. Too many great indie games are caught up in difficulty; such intense gameplay often detracts from my experience because it gives me little time to appreciate the music and art. This is different. Like Zelda: Link to the Past, I find myself exploring and running around just for fun while enjoying the difficult battles within the dungeons.No question. If you like Zelda, adventure games, or little indie games with a huge soul, do not hesistate and buy this game.			"

												A neat little game in the style of the old 2D Zelda games, of which I don't come across as many duplicates outside of indie games like this one. While not as thoroughly designed and challenging as many of the games in that series, nonetheless Anodyne provides more than enough of a challenge & entertainment to see the player through to its completion. There are a fair amount of secrets to be found as well, and a lot of clever references to other games (""the village elder in name only, for he is neither""). Although the team behind this game said they're not planning on making any additions to it, I'm really looking forward to whatever they end up making next.			"

												This game is absolutely excellent, and a great experience for any action-adventure fan out there. It's already been three years since this game was launched, but when I beat it, I felt like I owed the developers this review.You play the game in the shoes of a character called Young, who is in a mysterious quest to reach something called a ""Briar"" with the help of a sage called Sage. In your way stands an amazing world full of secrets, puzzles, enemies and landscapes to explore, and treacherous guardians to fight your way through. When you go deep into the game's world, you'll notice that it is... a brilliant metaphor, which I won't spoil (not that there's much to spoil three years after the game's launch, but still, I'd rather let uninformed players figure it out by themselves).The game's world feels like a mix between Legend of Zelda and Yume Nikki, if that makes any sense. On one hand, it contains vast explorable maps with foes to fight aplenty, puzzles to solve, and items to collect, hence the Zelda comparison. On the other hand some of its maps are surreal, eerie and psychological, as though you were walking around a person's very fears and afflictions, hence the Yume Nikki comparison. The music always helps set the mood perfectly, sometimes being a simple eerie horror-like sound effect, and sometimes being beautifully composed tunes that go well with beautiful sections.During the adventure, our hero Young counts on a single weapon: his trusty broom, and a few extensions to it, that modify its range. There is also a jumping skill to get across treacherous holes in the ground, and another awesome skill that I'd rather not spoil. The fighting mechanics are not the most innovative I've ever seen, but they're pretty fun regardless. Most boss fights are rather easy and formulaic, but thankfully never boring.As for the dungeons, they're designed pretty well, making you solve simple puzzles, pick up keys to open up doors, backtrack to change the state of a switch or get a card you forgot, and ultimately reach the guardian of each area and beat it to a pulp. The dungeons occasionally get a bit redundant when, say, you see a button in a room that can only be reached by taking a long path through other rooms, and then going back to the same path to get to the door you opened, but that happens way less than necessary to make me frustrated.When the game ended, I simply didn't want to go. I wanted to stay... a little bit longer, it's hard to explain.Thankfully, though, I was delightfully surprised to know this game had even more content in the post-game, which is rife with awesome secrets to find and a near open world-like freedom.One thing I feel this game lacks, however, is the whole Zelda-like ""key and keyhole"" aspect. What I mean by that is in Zelda, upon getting a new tool, skill or weapon, you'll usually be pleased to realize that the item you just got can be used to get accross an obstacle you encountered previously, possibly to uncover a secret or to follow on to the next section of the game. In this game, however, the only situations where this happens (in a meaningful way) involve the jumping skill, which needs to be used in order to access an area in the Lake that leads to a card (said area, however, can also be reached by different means), and to reach the path that leads to the Briar. Sure, you also get to use trash from the ground as a raft, but that only comes up long after you already have the broom. This in particular bugs me a little, as I feel the game could be slightly better with a progressive ""unfolding"" of its world. I mean, sure, the lack of said ""key and keyhole"" obstacles meant that the game was more ""open"", meaning that one could go through the dungeons in many different orders according to their peference, but still, I feel like the developers could, perhaps, have included some optional sections with said unlockable obstacles, which you'd find on your way to each mandatory part of the game, so you can get back to them later, eager to see what they contain.In spite of that minor complaint, I'm still very glad I got this game, as it is enjoyable, interesting, deep and simply awesome. Even though it's not as Zelda-like as I expected, it's still worth any action-adventure enthusiast's time, and I couldn't recommend it enough.			"

												A lightweight adventure game inspired by the original Legend of Zelda. The main goal is find all of the cards located in treasure chests throughout the world and dungeons.The overworld is mainly for exploring and has very little in the way of enemies. There are a few scattered environment puzzles. The dungeons have more enemies and puzzles.The game is fairly non-linear, usually having quite a few different areas available to explore. Once you find enough cards you can open doors to new areas, giving you more options to explore.There isn't much in the way of tools in the game, you mainly just look for cards and a few secret Easter eggs. There are a few upgrades for the weapon that can be found but that's about it. At the very end of the game you're given a tool that lets you swap any two tiles, allowing you to actually remove walls and go through to screens you would never normally be able to get to. There are actually quite a few hidden areas with cards in them that are only accessible with this tool. This has a very ""hacky"" feel to it which I really thought added a new dimensionto the game after it's already been completed.-Playtime-The game is fairly short. Expect only 4-7 hours on a first play through, depending on how much backtracking you do. With the correct route the game can actually be completed in only about 2 hours.-Achievements-The big one here was to find 100% of the cards which requires you to go back through a lot of the areas with the tile swap tool. I enjoyed the treasure hunt of tracking down all the cards and having to use the swapper really added a different feel to it at the end. The other notable achievement is the speedrun, completing the game under 3 hours was actually fairly easy with the correct route.Recommended on sale.			"

												This game is fantastic.  Some of you may not know, but I am a Zelda nut, it's my favorite series.  This game plays and feels like a zelda game.  The graphics are very like the GBC release of Link's Awakening.  If you like Zelda, you'll like this game. It's pretty great stuff.			"

												Anodyne is a game which I bought for $3 along with a bundle of other assorted indie games. Having finished it, I can wholeheartedly recommend it, even at full price, for it imparts simplicity, solitude, and subtlety that I find rather underappreciated or ignored these days.The story, ostensibly about a human named Young attempting to protect ""The Briar"" from ""The Darkness"" that has spread across ""The Land"", would be rather uninteresting if it were not for how the game's description directly states that it all takes place within Young's subconscious. Resulting from this is a somewhat lonely journey which focuses more on succinct phrases rather than grandiose spiels and atmosphere over tangibility, overall akin to going through a series of dreams within a larger dream (which is no surprise as Yume Nikki is cited as one of the inspirations for this game). Later on in the game the ideas and caricatures presented occasionally get a bit too obtuse for me to understand, but the main theme of the plot is still clear and I was quite satisfied by the ending. Moreover, Anodyne never interrupts its gameplay for an extended period of time to exposit or pontificate, which is nice as it means players are not forced to care about the game's script if they do not want to. That would be a shame, however, as the multiple lines of dialogue from the game's NPCs and signs tend to be incredibly humorous or chilling, sometimes both at the same time.Mechanically, the game is not particularly complex; imagine Link's Awakening but with no items outside of the Sword and the Roc's Feather. Although Young gains several equippable upgrades throughout the course of the game, the majority of them just increase the range of his broom, and the enemy and obstacle counts are not particularly high either. As such, the majority of the game consists of exploring the overworld (surprisingly large and spanning multiple environments), slaying enemies (both passive and aggressive), clearing dungeons (about as much as you'd expect in a Zelda game), vanquishing bosses (all of them uniquely designed and fairly tough), and ultimately collecting cards which are required to progress further in the game.Nonetheless, the rooms of each dungeon tend to be designed well enough that old adversaries often offer new challenges. There are also some tricky puzzles and platforming sections as well, the latter sometimes becoming a bit too tricky due to the top-down perspective. Honestly though, there are only two points of contention I truly have with the gameplay. Firstly, the collection of said cards might put off players who do not enjoy backtracking and exploring EVERYWHERE. I was personally okay with it, though Young's mediocre movement speed made the task plodding at times. Secondly, the post-game is rather lackluster, basically furthering the card seeking with a late-introduced gimmick which can be hard to control along with literally exploiting glitches; it feels like an afterthought. Other than that, the simplicity of the game is a mark in its favor.Moving on to aesthetics, the game describes its visuals as ""GBC/16-bit"", which is certainly true and they are sprited very well in that style, but what really stood out to me were the gorgeous overlays that complimented many of the game's areas. I'm particularly a fan of the cliffs (pictured above), which are bathed in a warm sunset's glow, along with some later, gloomier areas which would be a shame to spoil. The sound design is excellent as well, especially the ""Obtain Key"" noise which is utterly jarring and I love it.Continued...			"

												First of all, $10 is too much for this (luckily acquired it with bundle).Game story is unclear, has some little reference of Zelda which is creative and fun(!).Only positive thing is game mimics gameplay and graphics of old games (make you feel like playing a Gameboy Color game). But that's all.However it's my humble opinion, but i can recommend to try it before buy.			"

It is a nostalgic throwback which delivers through its simplicity, and to boot I am enjoyed unveiling the story in a piecemeal fashion. I would recommend purchasing this game, even at the full price point, to help support the developers and encourage them to create another quirky game.			"

												I played all the way to the end of this game, and I still don't know what it's about, yet I am entirely okay with this.  The game captures this half-awake dream logic where you aren't quite sure what you're trying to do but you know it's very important.  When describing this game, I am inclined to contrast it with the average violent FPS; the violence is superficially disturbing, but the repetetive motions and reflex-based action is relaxing.  This game is the opposite, superficially relaxing yet on a deeper level it is vaguely unsettling.10/10			"

It's one of the few games I feel can earn that praise, but then the story is just really depressing.Seriously, like this is a great game but it's such a downer with its tone and themes and if you're at all sensitive to adolescent loneliness or sadness then it's gonna bum you our for a week or two, so plan ahead.

												This is a really awesome game. Very interesting story. It feels a lot like those classic Zelda games, still different enough though,  so if you enjoyed those, you'll probably like this as well. There are also tons of secrets in this game. One of my favorite things (Spoiler Alert) is the wand that lets you switch tiles, like actual game tiles. It opens up whole new paths to areas you would never be able to go/shouldn't go. You don't get this till the end of the game, so it's not like you can use it to ruin all the puzzles throughout the game, but it was a very interesting feature, and very fun to explore all those crazy hidden areas. This game is definitely worth checking out.			"

												Anodyne is a strange game, similar to Zelda but not as upbeat. As Young, you find a broom and use that as your weapon throughout, collecting cards and clearing dungeons. There are some very interesting puzzles, and the locations are very unique, with some being completely bizarre or unsettling. The story is a bit odd and I can't really wrap my head around it, but that is probably just me.The music is also completely different than you should expect such a game to be. It is more... drone-like than it is upbeat. It can be pretty creepy at times, but it absolutely is something to behold and makes for a unique experience while playing.A playthrough will take 3 or 4 hours first playthrough, and a full speedrun achievement asks for less than 3 hours, so it isn't too long, but it is very unique for what it is. I highly recommend picking this up sometime. You could do a lot worse.			"

There are a fair amount of secrets to be found as well, and a lot of clever references to other games (""the village elder in name only, for he is neither"").

Posted: November 2, 2016
												It’s pretty ok.An action adventure game in the vein of, and clearly inspired by Zelda games. The gameplay mechanics are fun and work well but don’t do much to expand on the basics of its genre. You only get one weapon for the game (a broom of all things) and while there are a few bits of equipment to gather the only new ability you get during the game is jumping. There’s no shield, no bow, no bombs and no spin attack, just you and your broom. And it does work quite well. There’s a good variety in both the enemies and bosses to keep things fun, even if it’s never extraordinary.The game has some nice puzzles as well. Familiar setups that would, in Zelda, be solved by finding a new item are instead solved by manipulating enemies in the area or finding a new use for your broom, which lets you move around surprisingly useful piles of dust in the name of puzzle solving. It’s occasionally quite clever but never really mentally taxing.What sets the game apart is its tone and world, though unfortunately not in a way I’m actually fond of. The world is made up of a series of interconnected areas, but as the game goes on each area starts to get steadily more weird and disconnected. The beach leads to an undersea area, which leads to a zombie filled labyrinth where the graphics suddenly switches from SNES to NES inspired, which leads to a circus (in a cave) filled with notes about people dying in horrible accidents. You wander from a black and white town filled with serial killers to an abstract region of space filled with holographic projections of sentient pyramids ruled over by two cubes who will talk to you about how their “rule” is utterly meaningless as they have no subjects. This in turn leads to a hotel themed dungeon because why not?What is the story linking all this? There isn’t really one, you just work your way through the areas, solve puzzles, defeat bosses and collect cards. At the start of the game the Village Elder (there is no village) tells our hero Young that he must save The Land from the Darkness. It’s hopelessly generic and the game is very much aware of that. There’s a borderline sarcastic aloofness about the whole thing. The Village Elder, despite sending you on your quest, doesn’t actually seem all that enthusiastic about your mission and actually starts to discourage you as things go on.The wrongness and flippancy of it all permeates throughout. A stone sign informs you that stones will never have something different to say if you interact with them more than once, but only when you interact with it a second time. Bosses that talk to you but don’t seem to actually have anything to do with the Darkness that you are supposedly fending off (but is in no way evident). A sign informs you that a parking lot was built in honour of the fact that the major couldn’t find anywhere to park. There’s occasional cursing that seems, to me, to only be there to highlight how jarring cursing is in a game that borrows so much from Zelda.None of this is ever tied up into anything that resembles sense or thematic coherency, at least not to me. Once you defeat the final boss the story shrugs its shoulders and gives you a signoff as opaque as everything preceding it.You do get an extra reward for finishing though - a new ability that allows you to practically tear the gameworld apart in order to traverse hidden areas and find secrets. To be honest though I didn’t feel much motivation to make use for it. A world that doesn’t make sense, and refuses to make sense, a world that revels in not being real rather than attempt to give you a sense of place, is not that interesting to me. And I didn’t particularly care about trying to tease out its last secrets. I think that this sort of thing was done better, and with more thematic relevance, in Porpentine’s Armada. And for that matter I think Armada did the flippant tone better too.This review has probably come across as very negative. Despite the lack of cohesion between areas, many of the areas are quite interesting to explore in and of themselves with some very clever ideas. I honesty did enjoy playing the game and working through it. It’s a consistently fun game even if it doesn’t do anything spectacular. It’s a game a profession reviewer would give a solid 7/10 because the standard game review scale is dumb as hell.			"

												This game is absolutely excellent, and a great experience for any action-adventure fan out there. It's already been three years since this game was launched, but when I beat it, I felt like I owed the developers this review.You play the game in the shoes of a character called Young, who is in a mysterious quest to reach something called a ""Briar"" with the help of a sage called Sage. In your way stands an amazing world full of secrets, puzzles, enemies and landscapes to explore, and treacherous guardians to fight your way through. When you go deep into the game's world, you'll notice that it is... a brilliant metaphor, which I won't spoil (not that there's much to spoil three years after the game's launch, but still, I'd rather let uninformed players figure it out by themselves).The game's world feels like a mix between Legend of Zelda and Yume Nikki, if that makes any sense. On one hand, it contains vast explorable maps with foes to fight aplenty, puzzles to solve, and items to collect, hence the Zelda comparison. On the other hand some of its maps are surreal, eerie and psychological, as though you were walking around a person's very fears and afflictions, hence the Yume Nikki comparison. The music always helps set the mood perfectly, sometimes being a simple eerie horror-like sound effect, and sometimes being beautifully composed tunes that go well with beautiful sections.During the adventure, our hero Young counts on a single weapon: his trusty broom, and a few extensions to it, that modify its range. There is also a jumping skill to get across treacherous holes in the ground, and another awesome skill that I'd rather not spoil. The fighting mechanics are not the most innovative I've ever seen, but they're pretty fun regardless. Most boss fights are rather easy and formulaic, but thankfully never boring.As for the dungeons, they're designed pretty well, making you solve simple puzzles, pick up keys to open up doors, backtrack to change the state of a switch or get a card you forgot, and ultimately reach the guardian of each area and beat it to a pulp. The dungeons occasionally get a bit redundant when, say, you see a button in a room that can only be reached by taking a long path through other rooms, and then going back to the same path to get to the door you opened, but that happens way less than necessary to make me frustrated.When the game ended, I simply didn't want to go. I wanted to stay... a little bit longer, it's hard to explain.Thankfully, though, I was delightfully surprised to know this game had even more content in the post-game, which is rife with awesome secrets to find and a near open world-like freedom.One thing I feel this game lacks, however, is the whole Zelda-like ""key and keyhole"" aspect. What I mean by that is in Zelda, upon getting a new tool, skill or weapon, you'll usually be pleased to realize that the item you just got can be used to get accross an obstacle you encountered previously, possibly to uncover a secret or to follow on to the next section of the game. In this game, however, the only situations where this happens (in a meaningful way) involve the jumping skill, which needs to be used in order to access an area in the Lake that leads to a card (said area, however, can also be reached by different means), and to reach the path that leads to the Briar. Sure, you also get to use trash from the ground as a raft, but that only comes up long after you already have the broom. This in particular bugs me a little, as I feel the game could be slightly better with a progressive ""unfolding"" of its world. I mean, sure, the lack of said ""key and keyhole"" obstacles meant that the game was more ""open"", meaning that one could go through the dungeons in many different orders according to their peference, but still, I feel like the developers could, perhaps, have included some optional sections with said unlockable obstacles, which you'd find on your way to each mandatory part of the game, so you can get back to them later, eager to see what they contain.In spite of that minor complaint, I'm still very glad I got this game, as it is enjoyable, interesting, deep and simply awesome. Even though it's not as Zelda-like as I expected, it's still worth any action-adventure enthusiast's time, and I couldn't recommend it enough.			"

												Played it a little and got bored. The retro graphics and generic characters only go so far...EDIT: Played some more after having owned it for 2+ years. It's pretty interesting, actually. But you have to be either bored or in the peaceful explorative mood to play it. Exploring is fun but you honestly might as well go explore outdoors in real life if you are in the mood. This game subtly brings back fond memories of games I played when I was little.			"

												I enjoyed the weird world and kind of story that Anodyne had. I do have to say I did get this game on sale. It was fun with Zelda ish gameplay, but I would wait till it goes on sale.			"

												I've feel in love with this game the moment I started playing it. The exploration is great and the tone and atmosphere of the game is on point. Fans of Link to the Past will love this game.			"

												NOTE: This review is written 2 and a half years after playing; my memory may be somewhat foggy.Anodyne was... an interesting experience. Other reviews (even positive ones) seem to describe it as a bit bland and, despite enjoying it myself, I can agree.From the outset, Anodyne felt rather low-energy; there wasn't enough variety in the mechanics to make it feel engaging. The often empty environment and soundtrack gave the world an eerie, ethereal tone, which bored me a little at first instead of intriguing me. After the first time I played, I took around a week to get back to continuing it.That being said, why am I giving Anodyne a positive review?As I continued playing, the world grew on me. I wasn't aware of a clear, linear plot, although perhaps the game didn't need that, for what it was. The absurd settings I encountered led me to want to interpret what I was seeing, to figure out what was going on for myself even when I wasn't playing. I'll exclude any interpretations I came up with so you can form them on your own. When I beat the game, Anodyne left me with some indescribable feeling... Though I remember being bored at first, I can only look back on playing it fondly.In short: Anodyne is fairly simplistic in terms of gameplay. If you're expecting a Legend of Zelda clone, you're not really going to get it. It's the strange emotions resulting from the experience that sell Anodyne, for me; nothing you'd get an idea of from the store page.			"

												I have thoroughly enjoyed playing this game for the few hours I have played so far. I wish I would not invoke other franchises as a comparison, but this game feels like the quirkiness of Earthbound meets the game mechanics of the Gameboy Color Legend of Zelda games. It is a nostalgic throwback which delivers through its simplicity, and to boot I am enjoyed unveiling the story in a piecemeal fashion. I would recommend purchasing this game, even at the full price point, to help support the developers and encourage them to create another quirky game.			"

												A surreal experience, Anodyne provides fun, Zelda-style gameplay and interesting environments, puzzles, and story to go with it. The sound track is great, and the art style is simple, but satisfying. Definitely worth the price of entry.			"

												Good: A pretty fun Zelda-ish game, with a lot of different levels to explore and puzzles to solve. The areas are nicely varied with different graphical themes.Bad: Some areas are ugly and dreary. The story's ending was kind of a letdownVerdict: If you like'd the old 2-D Zelda games, get this one for the gameplay.			"

												Simply put, I love this game. It provokes a sense of wonder and engagement due to its amazing artstyle, beautiful, wistful music, and solid gameplay.i had orginally downloaded this game off of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as they first advertised there about 2 years ago. I loved the game so much I decided to just buy it and it has now become one of the very very few games I've replayed twice. Too many great indie games are caught up in difficulty; such intense gameplay often detracts from my experience because it gives me little time to appreciate the music and art. This is different. Like Zelda: Link to the Past, I find myself exploring and running around just for fun while enjoying the difficult battles within the dungeons.No question. If you like Zelda, adventure games, or little indie games with a huge soul, do not hesistate and buy this game.			"

												Fun! Not too difficult, just right even. Story and setting is a nice mix of whimsy and darkness. Some endearing characters in there. Good music, some pieces really great at setting up atmosphere. Blind playthrough took about 8 hours.			"
