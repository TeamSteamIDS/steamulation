												This game is only for patient people who don't mind the old graphics.I've only recently discovered the universe behind this and Dreamfall and as a real sucker for good stories, I went for the first one in the saga. It blew my god damned mind. You play as April Ryan, an unknowing savior of the two worlds that had been split ages ago. She is able to cross the border between them and is able to fully interact with both of them. You'll meet dozens of interesting people and creatures that are fairly believable and likable. You'll be solving some really tough puzzles that don't compare with what's called puzzle now-a-days. Some mysteries which don't make any sense in the beginning will be revealed and fit so perfectly in the story at the end. Other mysteries stay concealed until now and keep thousands of fans excited for more. I highly recommend playing this one before jumping to the newer Dreamfall games. I give this game the ultimate rating 10/10In fact, I loved the game so much that I made a complete walkthrough  guide to it, feel free to check it out if you're seriously interested in buying this game because the tasks can get very confusing sometimes.

												Having previously played Dreamfall, which I consider one of my favorite games, I recently decided to give The Longest Journey a shot. Now, having finished the game, I can say that this game surpasses Dreamfall and is without doubt one of the best game I have ever played. This game is a masterpiece in storytelling and has some of the most believable and likeable characters I've experienced in a video game. The writing and voice acting is top notch. The graphics are dated but there is some nice looking world design and set pieces. The puzzles are varied and fun however some are downright illogical (I'm looking at you, rubber ducky). This is a long game, and it's worth every second.			"

												The Longest Journey does its name justice. It is an epic adventure from beginning to end and it never gets tedious or boring like a lot of adventure games tend to do when they try to forcefully increase the playtime. The setting is unique, intriguing and creates a great atmosphere. The plot is original and inspiring and shows what adventure games can do when they're done right. The brightest aspect of the game, however are the characters. From the heroine to the minor characters, they are all wonderfully designed with a certain integrity that makes them incredibly powerful. They bring the story to life and make for a truly memorable game. This could not have been done without the excellent writing and voice acting. The only argument I have against the game's excellence is the pacing and execution of the lest stretch before the finale, which compared to the rest of the game seemed rushed. It seems as if the development team was not able to give this segment the attention and devotion that it deserved. It is a small issue barely worth mentioning however, since the rest of the game shines brightly.If adventure games are your thing, this is a must-play.			"

												Upon completing the Longest Journey, I wasn't surprised it constantly gets ranked in top PC game lists. Clocking in at a solid 25 hours, it will keep you entertained for quite a while. You do have to put yourself into the Click and Point Adventure mindset however, as it is by no means, a fast paced game. It's more like an interactive book.The game for me shined the most in its dialogue. Nearly every character has an incredibly natural enunciation rarely found in games. It gives you a stronger connection with them, and helps you believe every word.The next best parts of the Longest Journey was its story and variety of characters. It takes place in the 23rd century Venice, and gives a fascinating perspective of the past, present, and future. With a story as interesting as this, that's all I can really say without spoiling anything.The characters feature a wide range of tallent and personallity, which makes them so interesting to talk to. By the first sentence someone utters, you already know what kind of person he/she is, and how he/she is going to treat you, it really is that detailed.For a game stuck in 640x480 resolution, it is full of very detailed and beautiful scenery. 3D objects are pretty pixelated and jaggy, and are probably the thing that aged the worst. Some up-resing would benefit The Longest Journey pretty well, but I quickly became lost in everything else it had to offer, that the quality rarely bothered me.The puzzles as well can be pretty cryptic. I had to look up a guild many times to figure out what to do next. That didn't bother me too much either, but it would have been nice if the main character gave hits on what to do.I am currently working through the sequel, Dreamfall, which early on already has reoccuring characters and locations, and because it came out 6 years after the first, it's nice to see things in better detail.If you want a less action oriented experience that feels like a mix of an interactive painting and a best selling novel, I highly recommend picking up the double pack. With a promising 3rd installment in the works, how can you go wrong?			"

												I came to The Longest Journey expecting a classic, critically aclaimed point & click adventure with a great story, and the game really delivered. This has to be one of the best written games I have ever played, without any exaggeration. The thing with game plots and game characters is that we usually compare them to other game plots and characters when we praise them, so ""slightly less superficial than everything else"" gets named ""brilliant writing"". The Longest Journey's writing could easily have been a book or a good movie screenplay however, and it definitely is shockingly better than most games I can name. Characters have personalities, distinct voices, motivations, relationships, lives. Their conversations make sense and are interesting. You get to care about everyone, and you can empathize with your down-to-earth yet epically heroic protagonist. The world-building and exposition never feels like a boring dictation that you need to click through to go on. Even the in-game Diary serves an actual purpose, adds to the story and delivers hints in writing that you really want to read. There is drama and silly jokes, grand adventures that get toned down with humor, an epic sci-fi/fantasy save-the-world plot with twists that make actual sense and don't leave gaping plotholes behind. It's all quite a feat, especially considering the theme.And yes, the graphics didn't age all that great, the gameplay doesn't reinvent the wheel, there's the long back and forth running through mutiple screens to patiently wait for, and some of the puzzles are what you'd expect from classic point & click adventures - namely not all that brilliant. But it honestly doesn't matter. If you like the genre, you have to play this game, there is a reason it's still getting mentioned so often. It's not just a true classic, it's also very much a joy to play.			"

												If you are thinking about playing this game, please do.The Longest Journey has quickly become one of my favourite games, with possibly my all time favourite video game story line. The graphics are dated, but trust me, it doesn't matter - the story line and characters make it beat most of the games with fancy visuals that we have today. The characters are excellent, April Ryan is an absolute bad♥♥♥♥♥ how is it there was a game made with a witty strong female lead 15 years ago but they can't manage it now?! I loved her, you will love her. The puzzles are challenging at times, but that only makes the experience more immersive.If you're wondering whether to buy this before playing dreamfall, 100% yes. I was going to skip this one, thinking the graphics and age would make it a chore - I was wrong. This is way better than its successor.Just buy the damn game,You won't regret it. "

												Best point and click adventure game I’ve ever played. Up there, if not more enjoyable than The Curse of Monkey Island, Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars and The Walking Dead - I can see now why it is scored so highly.First of all The Longest Journey no doubt requires a lot of patience. The game shares more familiarities with a novel, having an extraordinary amount of dialogue to go through and numerous objects to click on and explore. Story felt refreshingly unique and flows well. It is split into thirteen Chapters of varying length and themes. The voice acting is brilliant – characters feel natural, not samey and often time’s humorous (mature content).  Puzzles on reflection were mostly straight forward, logical and challenging – and only had to use a guide for small sections of the game that didn’t make sense or where I forgot one piece of dialogue (you need to complete certain things in order to continue with the plot). Graphics and cut scenes look dated at first impression but soon becomes part of the games charm. Musical soundtrack does a fantastic job at conveying the different moods throughout the journey.Chapter Three is the funniest, and cements the fact that this is now one of my favourite point and click games. Definitely a masterpiece.10/10			"

Posted: August 21, 2014
												English review (Polska wersja, jak zawsze, niżej):  By completing the Steam version of The Longest Journey I have broken one of the most basic principles of gaming: One does not simply come back to playing a game that one loved more than ten years ago. But upon doing so I have to tell you two things: This game aged pretty badly. And it hasn’t got old one bit. These two sentences do not constitute a paradox. Back in the days, the art of TLJ was simply breathtaking, which nowadays clearly isn’t the case. The 2d backgrounds are still impressive, but all the models are old and ugly. If you’re going to play this game in modern times take my advice and override the display settings from your graphic card’s control panel. TLJ really benefits from trilinear filtering.Having said that, besides the models and somewhat clunky and dated controls ( though nothing really serious) TLJ remains the most complete adventure game experience I have ever played. The game skilfully balances between the hard dystopian sci-fi and magical fantasy, creating a truly uniqe and extensive storyline, the characters –even these appearing for a few minutes – are charming and original, and the humor is clever and entertaining. Speaking of characters: the game’s protagonist – April Ryan – is perhaps the most developed and unique character in gaming. And also, it should be noted that the game soon turns much more adult and dark than one should expect from a story about girl jumping back and forth between the worlds of magic and reason ( but then it swings back to cheerful fairytale just to get even more serious in the next chapters).The voice acting is stunning. Actors do an unforgettable job, especially during the final chapters of the game. This may come up as a surprise since if you pay attention to credits, you will notice that one actor often voices three or four characters.  Furthermore, the dialogues are written in a truly brilliant way – even the shortest ones are witty and memorable. While it can be argued that after finishing there is nothing much to come back to (there is The Book of Secrets but obviously I won’t tell you what’s inside…), a single playthrough took me 16 hours which is enough time for two point and click games. While the puzzles usually aren’t that difficult (usually… the rubber ducky puzzle)and don’t take that much time,still there is an INCREDIBLE amount of lore, and some dialogues can take few minutes while characters convey that information. Vestrum Tobias is particularly guilty of that, since he introduces April to the story of the world. Worlds. The ending is perhaps the most fulfilled and satisfactory conclusion to a game I have ever seen, but it leaves a sense of melancholy. I will probably play this game in the next ten years just the way I tend to re-read certain books to measure them against the impact of years. This may be the only game in my entire Steam library that I would grade ten out of ten without hesitation. And in the meantime, I’ ll be waiting for The Longest Journey Home…   Polska recenzja: Kończąc Najdłuższą Podróż na Steamie złamałem jedną z najbardziej podstawowych zasad gamingu: Nie można tak po prostu wrócić do gry którą kochało się więcej niż 10 lat temu i oczekiwać że doświadczenie grania w nią nie uległo zmianie. Najdłuższej Podróży wyraźnie przybyło lat. Ale też nie zestarzała się nawet odrobinę – i nie, te zdania wbrew pozorom wcale sobie nie przeczą. Swojego czasu grafika Najdłuższej Podróży zwyczajnie zapierała dech w piersi. Obecnie tła ciągle mogą robić wrażenie ale wszystkie trójwymiarowe modele są zbyt proste, słabo oteksturowane i zwyczajnie brzydkie. Na pewno pomaga odwiedzenie panelu sterowania karty graficznej i manualne włączenie filtrowania – grafika odrobinę  na tym zyskuje.Pomijając grafikę i nieco przestarzałe sterowanie (nic bardzo poważnego) Najdłuższa Podróż ciągle jest najbardziej kompletnym i spójnym doświadczeniem jakie zapewniła mi gra przygodowa. Gra umiejętnie miesza dystopijne sci-fi z bajkowo-magiczną fantastyką opowiadając wyjątkową i bogatą historię. Postaci – nawet te pojawiające się na chwilę – są urocze i oryginalne, opowiadane dowcipy nie są nachalne i potrafią rozbawić do łez. Skoro mowa o postaciach: April Ryan – główna bohaterka – jest chyba najciekawszą i najbardziej rozbudowaną postacią z jaką spotkałem się w grach. Trzeba też dodać że atmosfera gry szybko staje się dużo cięższa i bardziej dorosła niż można by się spodziewać po opowieści o dziewczynie skaczącej między światami nauki i magii ( a potem znów zmienia się w radosną bajeczkę tylko po to żeby w następnym rodziale stać się jeszcze bardziej poważna – nie pozwala się nudzić nawet przez chwilę). Osoby podkładające głos dokonały czegoś niesamowitego. Gra aktorska  – szczególnie w końcowych rozdziałach – jest genialna. Tym trudniej w to uwierzyć, biorąc pod uwagę że prawie każdy z aktorów podkładał głos przynajmniej pod kilka postaci. Co więcej dialogi napisane są po mistrzowsku – niektóre zostają w pamięci na długo po ukończeniu gry. Skoro już o tym mowa – skończyłem grę w 16 godzin  i właściwie poza Księgą Tajemnic (Oczywiście nie powiem co znajduje się w środku...) nie ma po co wracać do świata gry. O ile zagadki na ogół nie są trudne (chociaż … dmuchana kaczuszka) i nie zajmują wiele czasu, świat gry jest niezwykle bogaty i te 16 godzin to przede wszystkim zwiedzanie i dialogi – niektóre trwające dobre kilka minut, szczególnie jeżeli ktoś zacznie opowiadać historię świata gry. Światów. Zakończenie gry – jak cała opowiedziana historia – jest piekielnie satysfakcjonujące, przemyślane i kompletne. I zostawia straszliwe uczucie melancholii – po 16 godzinach gry, czyli czasie którym można by skutecznie obdzielić dwie lub trzy gry przygodowe, szkoda było mi że to już koniec. Z całej mojej Steamowej biblioteki jest to jedyna gra której bez najmniejszych wątpliwości wystawił bym ocenę 10 na 10.  Prawdopodobnie odświeżę moją znajomość z Najdłuższą Podróżą za następne 10 lat tak jak to robię z niektórymi książkami, a w międzyczasie czekam na Najdłuższą Podróż Do Domu … czy jakkolwiek zdecydują się to przetłumaczyć.

												My review will only show the amount of hours (very few at time of posting) I've played this on steam, but don't let that fool you into thinking I've never played this game.  I've just recently re-discovered it on Steam during the winter sale and couldn't be more excited.This literally was the first PC game I ever purchased with my own money back in '99.  Entire evenings and weekends and school breaks were devoted to this game.I forgot the name of it years after losing one of the discs (the monster 4 disc collection to install it back then) and used to ask people all the time if they had heard of this game.  None had, so I figured I was out of luck.Yeah, the graphics are dated, but it's still a beautiful game.  The voice-acting is phenomenal for the time and pulls you in.I'm so excited to start the journey over again, this time with my boyfriend watching as I play and getting interested in the lore as well.  This type of game is not his 'genre', but he will sit and watch me go through it like he's viewing a movie, and pretty much, that's what this game is good about doing.  It's a slow moving movie, with a great plot and characters that you help move along.I even remembered the rubber ducky outside the window right off!  That's how long lasting this game stays with you.  I loaded the game, went through the opening sequence, and as soon as April was in her apartment I declared ""There is a rubber duck outside this window that I have GOT to get right now!""I'm not a puzzle person, at all.  So that aspect of the game has always had me pulling my hair out, but I'm excited to take this game on as a 30 year old and not as impatient 14 year old, who'd give up and find a guide online to just get through it.Long story short:  If you love point-and-click stories.  Get this one.  It is most definitely my favorite of all time.  Right after that, find Syberia and Syberia II.  They're another series of point-and-click adventure games that I thought were from this same developer and they were very close to the style of The Longest Journey.			"

												I'm very much a fan of ""modern"", more narrative-focused adventure games (The Walking Dead, Wolf Among Us, Kentucky Route Zero, etc). I saw the trailers for Dreamfall Chapters and wanted to play the first games to get caught up on the story. The Longest Journey is definitely a ""classic"" adventure game. It has all the pixel hunting, item combining, and obscure puzzles that are the hallmark of the genre. I admit I don't particularly enjoy this aspect of adventure games, and am glad to see it mostly absent from more modern adventures. GameFAQs was my constant companion while playing this game, and thankfully kept it from becoming frustrating. The graphics are very... 640x480, and while I can usually look past dated graphics in older games, there were points where it was difficult to tell what an object was, or what was going on in a scene, simply from lack of resolution/polygons. I don't want to sound too hard on the game, because I actually loved it. Definitely the strongest point of the game (and why I think it's remembered so fondly) is the fantastic writing and memorable characters. April Ryan feels like a *real* person, and talks like a real person would. I loved talking to Burns Flipper or Captain Nebevay or Crow just to hear what they had to say. Admittedly sometimes people can be long-winded or launch into overlong explanations, but it never really detracted from the game. The story too, while at times dropping into fantasy cliches and being the Chosen One (TM) who can save the world, was still really interesting and mostly unique. The Longest Journey is still a great game despite its technical/gameplay flaws, and if you're looking to get into the Longest Journey/Dreamfall series like I was, it's definitely worth playing.			"

												I had no idea what to expect from this game - I had heard that this series by Funcom/Red Thread was quite good, but I wasn't prepared for the Journey that lay in store. (har har)To be completely fair, the graphics are, as expected, very dated. But as an avid fan of the old point 'n' clicks, that came as no surprise to me. That being said, the static backgrounds were often very good and at times even striking. Gave me that warm nostalgic feeling without ever causing any real troubles with seeing items or what is going on.Probably the highest compliment I can give to such a game is to say that I almost never came out of a puzzle still feeling frustrated. For illustration, let me compare this title to some of the old Sierra games (which I adore): frequently in Sierra games, you would either spend hours banging your head against the wall or break down and look up a hint to get you through some tough puzzles only to find that you needed to:pound the wall next door to knock a painting off the wall which fell on a rat to stun him thenpick up the rat andchoose the correct dialog choices to make him bite youwipe your bleeding hand on your napkin in order tofinally get the red pocket square you've been needing.Yes, this kind of makes sense. But no level of thought would have ever led you to that conclusion on your own. So usually, you are left to wander around trying every verb on every noun in the blasted game until the solution just falls into your lap. Not a very rewarding feeling.On the other hand, TLJ only incited that feeling once or twice. True, some of the puzzles were especially easy -- perhaps too easy -- but I went through the story feeling smart and engaged. The last compliment I can give this game applies to the series (and studio) in general, but also applies here. Funcom/Red Thread are great at making their games inclusive (e.g. female protagonist, racial diversity, different sexualities) which really adds to the immersion for me. Being in a world that more accurately reflects the real world creates depth and allows me to get swept up on a journey of my own.This is now one of my all-time favorite point-and-clicks and games and series. 5/5			"

												It feels a little pointless to review a game that came out 16 years ago, but I had to throw my hat into the opinion ring - I absolutely adored this game so I felt duty bound to gush about it a little. Plus, having never played it when it first came out, it's brand new to me.The Longest Journey is as long as the name suggests. The amount of content for a point and click game is phenomenal. And describing the story as anything less than epic would be like describing the Great Wall of China as a bit long.Set in two worlds, one woven with magic and filled with dragons and fantastical creatures, and one in a slightly bleak but tech-filled future, this is a must for point and click adventure fans. The Longest Journey has a wonderfully told story, which equal parts intriguing, touching, engaging and funny. With only a handful of exceptions, the voice acting is equally stellar, and the puzzles pitched just right (I did need to use a walkthrough on a couple of occasions, but hey, what's new).Although the graphics are a little dated due to the age of the game - the sprites and animation is dire in places - the backgrounds are beautiful.My biggest - probably only - gripe with the game is that it takes an age to move your character from screen to screen (even if you're running). Top tip (which sadly I only found out towards the end) - if you enable it in the settings, the escape key will skip those bits for you.All in all, this game was an unforgettable experience and even at full price is worth every penny.

												Adventure games are not for everyone.  They have little replay value unless you enjoy the story so much that after the first playthrough you want to experience it again.  What's interesting about The Longest Journey is that it appeared during a time when adventure games had largely fallen out of favor.  The odds of it becoming a success were slim.However, writer Ragnar Tørnquist knows how to assemble a compelling, quirky and funny story that captures the hearts and minds of many gamers.  For this reason, TLJ has become one of the best adventure games of all time.  Female characters in video games don't always have complexity, but April Ryan is one of the most interesting characters I have ever encountered.  It is a joy to observe her grow as a person as I play, from a woman unsure of her future and place in the world to a savior of the people.  Also, I love how Tørnquist successfully blends both cyberpunk and fantasy elements together to create a unique narrative.  I don't recall encountering a nonsensical puzzle, either, which is a flaw that some adventure games have.Update:  It's still a wonderful game and I played through it again because I've been going through a TLJ binge, but I had some trouble getting the game to display correctly even though it had worked for me in the past.  You may need to run this in compatibility mode to get it to work.			"

												This game is the god and ancestor of all the point and click adventure titles out there now. This game has a movie-like, amazing, wonderful story and incredible worlds which has one of the greatest atmospheres and characters made with superb intelligence and imagination. Even the very old graphics can't hide the awesome piece of art and design. The puzzles are very difficult and surpsisingly fun and do not frustrate players like most of the other adventure games does. Soundtracks and voice actings are one of the bests ever, presentation is amazing and this game is simply P.E.R.F.E.C.T.Although most of the new-gen gamers out there will not going to enjoy this because this game didnt aged well for them, but if you are a person who likes to try completely new and difficult things, give this game a shot.  Pros- Amazingly designed worlds(Stark,Arcadia) and wonderful art design in them- One of the best atmospheres in video game history- Great presentation mixing real life into fantasy- All characters are wonderfully designed, they have realistic personalities.- Wonderful puzzles, the best in video game history in my opinion- Awesome gameplay- Great soundtracks- Amazing voice acting- More than 35 hours of non-repititive playtime Cons:NoneOverall Score: 10/10			"

Featuring a unique and strong storyline that never gets old (i have already finished the game like 5 times and i still want to download it again to play). I love every piece of it and i always remember the strong emotions and the bonds that game created between me and the main character. STRONGLY recommended to all the point 'n click adventure fans out there!			"

												All the visual bugs from the Windows 95 to modern PC have been fixed. Music, voice acting still hold up great. The graphics, not so much. That's the only flaw. You will find yourself immersed in this intricate tale that has you explore the mysteries of a fantasy world, and a future Earth. With more realistic themes. You don't get to say that often. The difficulty for a point and click is moderate. FAQ recommended, but not to the point where you need it. This is part of a trilogy of games, and it's recommended you start here.			"

												There has been a time, around 2000, everybody was thinking  that maybe graphic adventures were doomed. After the commercial failure of Grim Fandango the future seemed obscure, and The Longest Journey was a shining light. Maybe I am too melodramatic, but I like to think that TLJ saved this genre, because it showed to everyone that it was still possible to make extraordinary point and click games. I won't tell you anything about the story, if not that it has a strong sci-fi/paranormal vibe, because I really want you to discover it entirely. The setting is futuristic, and you'll help the main character, April Ryan, discover the truth about herself and the world she lives in. The characters are deep and very well written, the story manages to be funny and allegoric at the same time, and the puzzles can be really challenging. Old School. Awesome. In the end FunCom and its lead writer at that time, Ragnar Tørnquist created a world that feels alive, characters you really care for, and a story that will make you think about our role in modern society. Even the smallest details are perfectly integrated in the main narrative arc. The Longest Journey is a must have for any graphic adventure fan, and a great game in general.Sadly, as many early 3D games, if played now feels (graphically speaking) very outdated, but I assure you it won't be an issue as soon as you enter this fantastic world. But yeah, a resolution patch would be awesome ;-)			"

												I played this for the first time, when it came out. It was the first game I completed and I really, really loved it. Playing it again, it was an amazing experience and even though now, the graphics look outdated, they story was still enchanting and I loved every minute of playtime.My only problem was that I couldn't quit the game using the controls, there was some sort of a glitch that didn't let me see the confirmation window and move the cursor when the confirmation window was active. I had to log off the entire system and reboot. That was annoying. Still. Great game!			"

												Had this close to i think 2 years? Finally finished it (more than half of the game I played without a walkthrough), and this was THE BEST, most fulfilling end to a game I've had in years!!! The old 90s classic style is so inviting, and the extensive storytelling had me hooked, even though it took long because of life duties lol. I'm not sad it ended, because at least the ending was so worth it, even though it's weird to not be on the Journey any longer. Lots of twists and turns, no cliches, and really this game seems like it was ahead for its time. So if you want a game that makes you feel like the devs really loved making themselves, with rich storytelling and equally beautiful fantasy and sci-fi worlds, this game is definitely for you! I give this game 10/5 stars!! ♥			"

Epic novelPlaying 'The Longest Journey' felt like reading a captivating story, rather than playing a game. Sure, there are plenty of puzzles to solve, but it's the story that will have you hooked. You play as April Ryan, an artist who moved to Venice from the countryside,  who is struggling to make ends meet in her art career. Everything changes when she meets a man named Cortez, where she gets herself into a plot to save both worlds of order (science) and chaos (magic).Gameplay is presented in the usual 'point and click' fashion. You click on areas of the map to move April, double clicking will make her run. You can press 'escape' to skip animations (if you allowed this in the options menu) and dialogue if you just want to progress through the story quickly (although I recommend not to skip the dialogue as you may miss important information). You can interact with characters and objects by simply clicking on them. There is an inventory system which allows you to store and use items to solve the puzzles. The puzzles  may be a bit tricky to solve as your not given a clear indication of where to go and how to solve the puzzles, which makes you refer to the 'trial and error' approach. Other times you will be moving back and forth areas due to some fetch quests. The store page says the game will last you '40 + hours' although I completed it in about 17 hours through using a wlakthrough (because I wanted to progress the story, without dealing with the puzzles).The graphics are somewhat outdated in this current age. 3D-models are a bit blocky and the textures aren't as detailed as other games in the genre. Having said that, they do a decent job at setting the atmosphere in the various environments you roam in. The CG movies haven't aged well either.Plot is where this game trully shines. The story is unique and will keep you guessing as it unravels. Voice acting of the main characters (especially April herself) is excellent and believeable, minor characters voice acting are somewhat mediocre. Your emotions will be tested here as you will feel a sense of wonder and awe, fear, laughs and a bit of sadness as the you progress though the story. The music is also decent at setting the mood.Furthermore, you can unlock 'The book of secrets' which contains dialogue and music which were removed from the final product.I highly recommend this game to point-and click gamers looking for a good story and don't mind solving puzzles (although I do advise using a walkthrough).

												This game is really amazing. It is about 16 years old now, and it is stil comparable to some of the great games of today. The graphis were awesome I'm sure (~2000), but to some younger players the game may appear a bit Minecraftish. The story follows a heroin that goes form Art student to the destiny of becoming a savior of two worlds. While initially taking place in the far future of the Earthen city of New Venice she finds herself learning about ""magic"" and powers she has had since birth. The characters in this game are well-developed and the main character herself, April Ryan, is quite funny and sarcastic. Both the conversations and her personal journal are humourous to read. The settings are really well thought of, and the futurisitc corruption of coporations are placed. It is a point-and-click game that is worth the money.  Also, if you're thinking of buying this game for your children you might want to wait until they're a bit older. (Lots of profanity and sexual references). More about the game play....THIS NEXT PART MAY HAVE MINOR SPOILERS The game itself isn't too difficult to complete. It plays as more of a story with some actions, rather than actions that contribute to a story. It does have the typical puzzle solving that most point-and-click games have. I would say in general about 95% of the puzzles can be solved without too much difficulty. There were a couple of times I had to ""cheat"" by looking up walkthroughs. That rubber duck contraption to get the key in the railway was ridiculous. Also having to knock three times specficially to get the garage door open was kind of pushing it.  I ended up with some items that I'm not sure if I was supposed to use or not. I was a bit dissapointed that we never got to see what became of her art show and other tidbits about her personal life. Although, I read about Dreamfall and plan on eventually playing that. I'm curious if they're going to pick up on April's personal life in the sequel. I read mostly in online forums that her breast size changes. I guess that's what matters. "

												I recently played through TLJ again in anticipation for the Dreamfall Chapters and wow, this game is so great! I remember playing it many years ago and I was blown away by the amazing story, graphics and characters. Well, the graphics are aged but still you're swept of your feet and thrown into worlds of science and magic. Few games make me laugh out loud or can actually make me sad but TLJ manages to get my emotions going in every step that April takes. The sheer wonder of exploring an unknown world is breathtaking and nothing seems impossible.I would, without a doubt, call this a timeless classic that will forever place in my top three favorite games of all time.To anyone who has never played this game and is thinking about it; think no more. TLJ is a masterpiece in storytelling and is surpassed by few.			"

												I started off playing Dreamfall: The Longest Journey, but felt I couldn't continue without playing the start of the adventure; I'm glad I did! This game holds true to the promise of being submersive and story-rich. I would recommend continuing onto the other 2 games if you enjoyed this one. I absolutely had to finish the story, and I was not disappointed. The point and click allows you to become bonded with the characters (you get to focus more on the story given instead of choices as in the other two games) and when you see/hear references to this game in the other two, your heart will simply swell with the heartfelt memories from The Longest Journey.

												Pros:Story-The story of The Longest Journey is probably one of the best I've seen in a video game. When you think the game becomes too predictable, it quickly throws you into a loop to think otherwise. World-The world I think was ""magical"" if I was to be so blunt. The environment and background images were truly beautiful. Cons:Font-The game turns off clearfont setting in my pc, so I have to turn them back on again after playing. Hidden agenda-Some of the characters in the game seemed forced to act a certain way to appease some sort of hidden political/social agenda by the developers. Voice Acting-Some of the voice acting for the side characters seemed pretty bad to me. One character spoke in a monotonic voice in one sentence, but then spoke in a 1950's greaser accent. There are others as well that bothered me. Puzzles-Most of the puzzles in the game were pretty good, but some in the first few chapters were pretty ludicrous. Graphics-I'm used to old graphics, but obviously some people don't like outdated graphics.Language-Wish at least the subtitles in the game would be in norsk, that way I could practice bokmål. All in all, I really enjoyed the game and would recommend it to friends. If side characters bother you, just skip through or ignore the extra diolgue with them. Use a guide if a puzzle gets too annoying for you.			"

												This is one of the last games from the Golden Age of adventure games, the genre created by the titles published by Sierra and Lucas Arts.  Unfortunately, it does show its age compared to some of the other adventure games, which was the problem for the early 3D games that weren't extremely stylized like Grim Fandango or The Neverhood (both worth checking out).However, once you can get past the low poly characters and the resolution being what it is, it's very easy to become fully immeresed in the game.  That's when the voice acting and story quickly come to the forefront, and you will realize that this game is easily on par with many of the modern games.  It's rating is completely is justified.For only 10$, this game is a steal.			"

												I keep wanting to call this game my favourite of all time. but there are two or three other games that I think I like just as much.  This is the only one, though, for which I've kept the original box.  In any event. no game has ever matched it for story and character development.  The actual gameplay consists of puzzle solving (at times brilliant and challenging, but occassionally nonsensically contrived) and dialogue selection, but the value is in the imaginative story that it tells and the artwork that supports it.It's hard to say how someone new to the series would take to the game now, as it was an oddity even when it came out.  The pacing and feel are not like any other game, and for those reasons alone it's worth checking out.  The story is adventure fantasy, but with such rich, endearing, and philisophical inventiveness that it plays like a piece of grand literature.It's one of the classics and I have revisited it many times over the years.  I strongly recommend it.			"

												With more than 25+ hours of adventure, The Longest Journey certainly lives up to its title--man this game is long winded. Overall, this is a fantastic fantasy point-and-click adventure, although the beginning doesn't really do a good job at being captivating so I'm sure a lot of players quit prematurely never actually giving it a chance. I also got a little fatigued near the end as well, but by that time there was no way I was bailing out. Now I'm actually getting excited to play the sequel and also to learn about the upcoming 3rd episode due in 2014.The one sad part is the game can only be played at 640x480 resolution and the graphics and animations did not age well making for some serious sore eyes. Thankfully, the story more than made up for it--absolutely classic.			"

												An old classic, this game is one of the best experiences for quest-lovers.the game is rather solid, length-wise, i clocked at 30 hours of gameplay, which is impressive, we are talking about ""the longest"" journey after all.The dialogue in this game is really powerful and it helps you to connect with different characters, and some of them are really cool and interesting.This game requires the player to think, like any good Click and Point Adventure should, but by no means is it a quick pased game, it's rather slow pased but really rewarding, like an interactive book of some sort.The puzzles are challenging and quite cryptic, i was sitting on some of them for more than 25 minutes, and when i was able to solve such a puzzle i was extremely pleased.the Graphics, however, did not age well. You are forced to play this game at 640x480 resolution, which really is an eyesore.All in all, if you are looking for a game with great plot and dialogue and can overlook the distasteful graphics, this game is a must.

												Point and click adventure games are usually synonymous with LucasArts in most people's minds.  However, although LucasArts certainly perfected the genre, and gave the world the SCUMM system, they by no means make the only good games.All the way back to the Atari ST with games like Erebus, or Obitus, there have been some intriguing and wonderful games.  Even ""Scoop"" back on the Archimedes was fascinating in its own way.  But technology has moved on.  Branching story lines, throwaway disk space, FMV, voiceovers, you name it.       The main thing which more modern computers allows is for a variety of backgrounds, sounds and models.     This allows the game creators to generate a less homogenous world, giving you more of a sense of adventure.   How many old PaC games have spent their entire time wandering around the same desert island, or the same metallic city?The Longest Journey isn't made by a mainstream distributor, like EA or LucasArts.  It snuck under the radar, and has sat on shelves in stores, or on Steam for a long time, with an unattractive, amateurish-looking advert.  the postive reviews, however, show that underneath a game that outwardly looks decidedly second or third-tier (like some of the ""hidden object"" games, is a compelling, almost-first-tier game.The game starts off strange, and remains delightfully off-kilter all the way through.    It really leverages the universe that it's set in, to allow fast, interesting scene changes.   The artwork is luscious, and the voice acting is both hilarious, and excellent.  The music's pretty good too.  It's very satisfying to solve puzzles, and you get a genuine flow of story.  Solving a puzzle doesn't leave you thinking ""now what?"".  The in-game journal provides an amazing amount of back-story and hints.So, why do I say it's only ""almost"" a first-tier game? Well, it has a few kinks.  Although it plays perfectly well on a Windows-7 PC, it is ageing.  The FMV is older-style ""3DSMax"" rendering, with high compression (Think Tomb Raider 2 FMV).    Also, it's short.  Don't let my playtime fool you, I had the game minimized for a lot of the time.  I actually finished it in about 6 or 7 hours.      But the length, and the slightly ""B-grade"" FMV isn't what knocks it off the top spot, it's the habit that the game has, of breaking its own rules.  I'll explain:-The game is a series of ""compartments"", You finish everything that's within one compartment, using everything that's in that area, and then you move through to the next one.   This is pretty standard PaC fare, actually.  Early in the game, you get access to the ""Metro"", which allows simultaneous access to the the next compartment, while allowing access to previous ones.   9/10 times, re-visiting those older areas does you no good at all, you just go to the next 'opened up area'.However, there are a few times in the game where you hit a brick wall.  You're trying to ""use everything-on-everything"" (uEoE)  in the usual PaC way, but nothing's helping.  The only thing to do it backtrack to an earlier area, and do the uEoE approach again, in the hope that you get a different outcome.    Sometimes it makes a kind of sense... often you scratch your head and think ""uhh.. that makes NO sense, I could have easily done that THIS way, if the game had let me"".   To attempt to reduce the futility, the game flashes objects when you hover them over each other, to show that it's a valid response to uEoE, but you're still dragging, clicking and right-clicking for literally HOURS until you find that (for example- changing the objects, but not the logic), using the ""PEPPER SPRAY""  (obtained in area 5) on the ""DUCK"" (in area 3), will cause a door to open in Area 7. Why? Because eventually, after going through the door, you need to go back to where the duck was sitting to get the next piece of dialog, which is dependent on going through the door in area 5.  This is just after you have used the ""BREAD"" on the ""DUCK"", and have had a piece of dialog that says ""Ok, I better leave him alone then"".     Hmmm.  Why go back and bother the duck, when the game just told me not to.So, I had to resort to the walkthrough a few times because i'd spent too long uEoE and the combinatorial complexity was teeing me off.   There is another puzzle where the hint just isn't good enough to let you know how to solve it, and the combinatorial complexity is something like  4x6x6x6x6  to just get it ""randomly"" right..  A futher hint which doesn't ruin the puzzle completely reduces this to just 2x2x2 (telephone puzzle).Despite this, I had a wonderful time exploring the interesting world.   For a ""indie"", this is amazingly well made.  The outtakes at the end are great too.   I totally recommend playing it if you like PaC games which focus a little more on the cyberpunk / fantasy / sci-fi realm.   It's not ""Blade Runner"" or ""The Dig"", but you'll really enjoy its humour and setting.    Very well recommended, but keep one tab open on a walkthrough page! ;)			"

												Within it all, a bewildered April is forced to grow as her understanding of the world is routinely shattered by the things she sees and the actions she has to take. Where her quest was once fuelled by crushing fear and unwanted obligation, she’s forced to accept her role in things, personally investing in the worlds and the people she aids along the way. The twenty or so hours from the start of The Longest Journey until the end exhibits two very different April Ryans. Not necessarily better, but certainly different. It’s a story before it’s anything else; a tale of change and acceptance and hardships and how a simple rubber ducky could easily have led to the death of two worlds. It’s hard not to fall to that particular obstacle, but an unforgivable wrong not to find a way through. There’s too much at stake.

												This is a point-and-click adventure game with 3D characters on 2D backgrounds. It's an epic chosen-one story that, to me, doesn't quite feel finished in some middle parts. Get these fonts[forums.longestjourney.com] and put that folder in your game directory, because the game expects them but does not include them. Also, I highly recommend forcing anti-aliasing in your graphics card settings, since the game runs at 640×480. Or you could try forcing a high resolution with dgVoodoo, though I haven't done so.The game's point-and-click interface works like this: If you click on something you can do more than look at (and hear your character's thoughts on), it'll bring up a circular menu around the cursor to let you choose to use your eyes, mouth (for talking, drinking, etc), or hands, where applicable; if you can only do one of these, clicking will just do that. Right-click anywhere to bring up the inventory, or press A and D to cycle through it, and then click to use an item or to talk to someone about it.Overall rating: $16.			"

												First of all completely disregard my play time as it is way off xDThis is my favorite game of all times so I'm not gonna be the least bit objective ;)The story is just amazing and you can fall in love with all the characters, not only April, because each of them has substance. It is nothing like these newer games which revolve around forgettable characters and sexual connotations/strong graphic scenes or violence. This is a classic adventure from the time when games had soul and you were expected to pay attention to the story for the game to make sense. The conversations are funny, sad and feel real.The puzzles aren't too complicated and won't drive you to look up walkthroughs or drive you so insane as to forget about the story or the game all together, but they are complicated enough to make you use your brain and not think the creators made this for imbeciles.In this game you don't have to worry about dying or making a fatal error, this is a casual mood and story based adventure for all of us who don't feel like being tense throughout the game.The controls are, as one would expect, very simple.In my pre-Steam era I've played through this game at the very least 50 times, and I'm not exaggerating. I believe I will play it at least as much times now I've gotten it on Steam.			"

												I gave up on this game when I found out I had to put a ring on the middle of broken cables to open a valve that would let me get a clamp to combine with a duck that you get by throwing bread through your window and with a clothline I'm not even sure where I got, everything to get an extremely hidden key at the subway that fits perfectly on a fuse box on the other side of the city. The logic of this game DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE, and it's too freaking hard to find the items, you get through a lot of pixel hunting, IT'S BORING, and even harder and more boring it's to try to combine completely unlikely items and try to use them on some part of the screen all the time. And it's not ""hard"" of a nice challenge, but a frustrating hard. When you get the right answer, you don't get ""Whoa, how I didn't think about this before"", you just get ""This was so ♥♥♥♥ing stupid"". Voice acting is ok, at best. Dialogues are uninteresting and long. I like puzzles and point and click games, but this one is not worth it. Desisti desse jogo quando descobri que tinha que colocar um anel no meio de um par de cabos cortados pra abrir uma válvula que me deixava pegar uma ferramenta pra combinar com um pato de borracha que tu consegue jogando pão pela janela com uma linha que nem lembro de onde peguei tudo pra pegar uma chave em um metrô que serve perfeitamente em uma caixa elétrica do outro lado da cidade. A lógica desse jogo NÃO FAZ NENHUM SENTIDO, e é muito difícil achar os itens, tem que ficar fazendo MUITO ""caça-píxels"", e ficar combinando itens totalmente improváveis, e toda hora ver se consegue usar algum deles na tela em uma combinação mais improvável ainda. Não é um difícil de desafiador, é um difícil frustrante. Quando você consegue fazer algo, você não pensa ""Nossa, como não pensei nisso antes"", você fica ""isso foi extremamente idiota"". A atuação é ok, no máximo. Os diálogos são desinteressantes e longos. Eu gosto de jogos puzzles e point and click, mas esse não vale a pena.			"

												I was looking for a game with a good story-line, I love being embraced by a fantastic world where I really get into it and feel like I am personally in it physically, mentally and emotionally. I am glad I gave ""The Longest Journey"" the chance, it didn't meet all those I stated, but it Indeed does have a fantastic story with great characters and settings. At first I did not really get into the game as it was a ""Point & Click"" type of game, plus it is quite old being released in 1999, with a few graphical tweaks I got the game working and looking decent with rendering issues. To be quite frankly honest I did start this game quite some time ago, but never really got into it and put it aside, and I am glad I gave it a second chance as I could not stop and was always wondering what would happen next as the story picked up and drove me in.So I'll give a basic overview of the story but I won't touch on it too much as I don't want to give too much away.You are April Ryan, an 18 year old girl who ran away from home and moved to a new city to start a new life at an Art School Academy, working at a crummy cafe and living in a tiny room in a bording house with fellow students and friends. Stark is a futuristic world, in which you live in you yourself live in a place called ""Newport"". Life is going okay, your ""average"" student life and attempting to keep yourself alive with little pay until one day everything changes. April starts having strange dreams, and soon these strange things and creatures start burrowing into the real world, a mysterious man named ""Cortez"" helps you and guides you to your destiny. He tells and shows you a whole new world called ""Arcadia"" in which only ""Shifters"" can travel too, and April unknowingly is a Shifter, during her journey between Two World to restore the ""Balance"", April must confront many different trials in order to prepare for restoring the Balance, along the way she meets new friends that help her on her Journey. April has alot to take in, she must keep her sanity and focus on saving both worlds, as she only has a few days to do it.The Gameplay, ""The Longest Journey"" is a point and click game, which I didn't mind after awhile I got used to it. That being said this game is quite ""Hard"", keep that in mind as it forces you to obtain items, combine items, and use items at certain moments, It may sound simple as I word it but It can become a mind bottling headache to attempt to figures out what to do next, there is also ridiculuous puzzles combinations such as ""The Rubber Ducky"" and others that will make you cringe when you do finnaly figure it out (If your lucky enough), most people tend to just look up a walkthrough though I prefer to figure it out myself. Let your imagination run wild with combining items, trust me the ""stupidest"" combo or use of an item you can think of will probably help you proceed to the next part of the game.The Dialogue system is something I really enjoyed, your conversations can have many different turn outs depending on what you choose to say, you can be mean and crude or friendly and nice even silly in your responses to characters. April also keeps a Diary that you can access in the menu and ready her thoughts on her day to day activities, and struggles with everything that is occuring, all your dialogue you have chosen is also stored in the menu.Overall the game can be difficult, but the pay off is from the Story, Environment & Characters you meet along the way (Also the cheesy voice acting). This game has lots of great references to things in real life which is quite funny, but please note this game does have alot of Profanity in it (Swearing, Sexual References etc..) its better suited for an older audience.The Longest Journey is a game that is hard to get into at first, but once you finnaly do it does certainly pay off.

												I loved this game and couldn't get enough of it. The story is well written and very intresting, the same goes with the characters. What kept me going was definately the story. This is a vey long game with a lot of gameplay, I played it mostly offline, so the hours doesn't represent the reality. This game is a typical point-and-click, the puzzles are however quite hard and I honestly had to use a walktrough a couple of times. if you're looking for a feel-good-game, with a story to die for with a lot of gameplay this is definitely the game or you.

												One of the greatest adventure games ever to be made. The visuals look very dated and the game only runs in 640x480. Even when it first came out this game wasn't anywhere near the prettiest around. Having said that the 2D backgrounds are stylish in their own way and do a good job of setting the mood for each particular scene.If you can look past the graphical shortcomings and take it for what it is, the writing, the characters and the world will blow you away. All characters are fully voiced and the acting mostly lives up to a high standard. The semi-orchestral soundtrack is also amazing and boasts some very memorable themes.The puzzles are mostly standard point-and-click-fare. There are a few particularly obnoxious spots where the solutions can only be found by randomly combining things without any clear logic behind it (yes, duck clamp rope, I'm referring to you). All in all, much like the graphics, the puzzles are something of a weak link but still solid enough to not detract from the overall experience.The story is the main attraction here. Combining scifi and fantasy the plot reaches some epic heights. It might start a little slow, but in my opinion it only makes it feel even more grand when it eventually starts picking up momentum. The story goes into some pretty dark places, and you might be in for a more mature experience than you may first think. When it came out and I first played it, I'd never heard so much swearing in a video game. Of course the industry has changed a lot during the years, and that aspect will probably not be as much of a shocker as it was then.I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes a good story, especially if they're into scifi or fantasy. Those more gameplay oriented might just want to give this one a pass, since the puzzles really are just a vessel for delivering the main attraction.			"

												The first, and the best, of the Longest Journey series. This adventure game tells a complete, fun story from start to finish (unlike the new ones). While the visual might be a bit dated, the game stands the test of time when it comes to storytelling (plus, it's an adventure game, so the visuals aren't THAT important).			"

												I liked and enjoyed this game, except for two small things: the pacing was sometimes annoyingly slow even for a 'longest journey' game, ie very... slow... talking...  Also the logic for some of the things you need to do is pretty vague, ie disjointed connections between what you have just done and what you need to do next, or things being activated by just happening to walk to some random area of the scene. I probably would have given up in frustration if not for a few pointers from a walkthrough. However if you like such games and solving puzzles and problems you will probably enjoy it :)			"

Very challenging but if you love challenges then play this game. CONSCONCONCSCONCSCONSHOWEVER, I wouldnt reccomend this game for those who love fast pace games...I understand this game was made a long time ago so graphics may not be toothers' liking (I didnt mind the graphics). I tried to have fun while playing...but I just couldn't :l So I will only thumbs up for those who like these type of games. TIP!!++Double click your mouse to run! It gets pretty boring watching your character walk slowly...from place to place...lol.++GAME IS BUGGY. BUT IT ISNT THAT BAD. You can SAVE anytime and anywhere. Make sure to save (lots of saving slots).			"

												I was born in 1993 and this game came out in '99, so I definitely wasn't playing it at the time. However, this game really interesting to me as it was both a throwback to my childhood and set in the future. Going on 20 years since it was made, it's definitely intriguing to see a version of how the future could be envisioned (plus a load of 90s fashion and cultural references). One of the things I definitely notice between then and now is how much more action focused our games have got - I was getting really frustrated with how slowly she travelled and walked to places.I bought this game because I'd heard good things about Dreamfall Chapters and then wanted to play the prequels to have a better idea of the storyline. For story lovers like me, this game won't disappoint. It has a really solid storyline and had me hooked. It was a really great intro to this series and keeps you thinking as a player of the game (which I really like).It's also great to have a female protagonist and there's a lot of background legend to get involved in, if you enjoy that in your games. Overall, a great buy and I'd definitely recommend.(Note: at first, the game kept crashing, but by putting a HD video on on youtube in the background my laptop could deal with it better and the problem was 'solved')			"

The story is fascinating, its quality surpasses the plots of many fantasy books, the dialogues are witty, the characters are deep and convincing, its technical side is easy to master... The riddles are hard and can sometimes get you discouraged, but is it not - after all - the puropse of the adventure game - to make your brain work at a quicker pace? All I can tell anybody, thus, is just it: buy the game and take part in one of the most exciting journeys in your life.			"

It has an utterly compelling story and some decent gameplay that holds up to this day despite being a point-and-click adventure game. April is such a likeable and relatable character throughout the game and her interactions with Crow, not to mention her sarcastic comments towards NPCs and her surrounds, help to keep you interested in what happens to her.

YouTube™ Video: The Longest Journey Review 

			Views: 255		

			The Longest Journey is a point-and-click adventure game where the player interacts with objects on the screen to solve puzzles and advance the story.		

Old School 3D Adventure GameLot of people consider this among one of the best adventure games ever made for PC - i can see why after playing it. While the game has very good writing on story/dialogue i do feel some of the issues exist mostly on gameplay aspects.Positives Full spoken dialogue with great voice actors and cool dialogue overall that makes you giggle sometimes (Especially Crow) Decent Soundtrack April Ryan is actually a good female protagonist that doesn't fill female heroine stereotypesNegatives The game doesn't offer options for resolution sizes nor windowed mode, very limited settings Alt Tabbing on the game causes some issues, also the game changes your PC's font (Goes away after you reboot) Among this there were lot of bugs. Sometimes it was hard to spot key items on the ground due to graphics, some of the textures were missing in certain angles for certain models "

Visuals are a bit dated, but don't look too bad all things considered, and the game can last you a good 20-24 hours to play through once, so you get your money's worth, really.This game is ♥♥♥♥ing great, and I wil defend it to the end's of the Earth.

The Longest JourneyAn oldies with great gameplay. Don’t be taken aback by it’s low polygon graphic, it still have very good story and character personality. Once you play, you’ll be looking for the game’s sequel.ProVery good story. With a bit of twist here and there. A fantasy well written. Character with personality. If you feel attach to the character of a games, that’s a well written and acted character. You’ll love April Ryan, and Crow, especially Crow.Good and challenging puzzles. The puzzles are well made and not ridiculous as some point and click games are. If you need to do something, there’s a good reason behind it and there’s also a good logic on how doing something will affect the outcome. ConGraphic not at current standard. It’s a Y2K era game. What did you expect?The pop up menu not showing properly. When you click some menu and a “Yes or No” question pop up, it just showing a blank white rectangle. You can use keyboard (Y or N), but it might not be obvious at first. "

												The Longest Journey by Funcom takes us on April Ryan's adventure to save the world(s)! I didn't know what to expect from this game, especially since I'm not a huge fan of point-and-click adventure games, but The Longest Journey is easily the best p-a-c game I've ever played, and is a highly worthwhile title for its story alone. The backgrounds are beautifully done, but the character models are quite dated; that said, that doesn't really matter, because the writing, world-building, and characterization are incredibly manufactured and suck you so deeply into this adventure you soon don't care about looking at a blocky April texture. Seriously, there are more memorable characters in this game than the last several games I've played *combined*. Crow, The Wheel Man, The Flipster, and especially April - she's an incredibly *real* character. I'm just flabbergasted how well Funcom has pulled her off. She seems just like an 18 year old girl would, and the rest (or most important) of the characters are equally deep and interesting. To add to this characterization, the voice acting is also outstanding (mostly, there were a few poor ones) and...I just really can't get over how real April was, I honestly feel like I know her, and the rest of the characters too - they're very dynamic and just so well done. There are also lots of dialogue choices to pick through that don't pertain to *immediate* story progression used to flesh out the worlds and the characters - this was much appreciated, and made the created universe feel large and dynamic. There were other nice features as well: the setting was very unique, there was a video replay option to view the FMVs, nicely done music...However, the downfall of any point and click adventure game are the puzzles. Some are very convoluted. I remember one where you had to make a fishing pole out of some kind of string, an inflateable duck, and a bandaide. It was just too much for me, I admit, I used a walkthrough. That said, I would recommend using a walkthrough if you get stuck in this game - it's definitely worth playing, even for a p-a-c adventure game. Pros:Excellent (like really) characterization and world buildingMusicBackgroundsStorylineCons:Convoluted puzzlesA little too much backtracking at timesThis was a great adventure, after playing it I'm really excited to move on to Dreamfall and I've also kept my eye on the kickstarter for the new Chapters that's coming out. I'm now a bonafide TLJ fan. Even if point and click adventure games aren't for you, if you enjoy a wonderful story full of magic, rather adult themes (including child abuse), great writing, worldbuilding, and astounding characterization, pick up The Longest Journey and use a walkthrough if you need it. A-Note: Initially I didn't like the movement speed of the character - then I figured out you could double-click to run around. I also thought it was difficult to find where exits to different areas were on-screen - then I figured out if you press ""X"" it will show you. Keep that in mind while playing if you have the same difficulties I did. Also, as mentioned, the puzzles can be tough and not so obvious. The story, characterization, and world building are what makes this game great - don't let aggravating gameplay choices stop you from enjoying April's adventure, use a walkthrough.			"

												I hadn't played The Longest Journey until now. I had read about it from the PC magazines in 1999/2000 when it came out and I've always found it quite interesting. Why it took so long for me to finally play the game? I don't know. But I'm really really glad I finally did play it!The Longest Journey is a point-and-click adventure game in which the player takes control of an 18-year-old fine arts student April Ryan. The events of the game take place in the year 2209 and the futuristic city of Newport is quite believable. April suffers from strange nightmares and is stressed out to finish her artwork for an upcoming exhibition. Soon she is pulled into a dangerous adventure of fantasy and magic, and all her former petty teenager problems turn pretty meaningless, as a far larger destiny is waiting for her to be fulfilled.  I don't want to give away too much the story — less you know, more enjoyable it is.April's is a likeable character. Luckily she's quite a mature gal for a 18-year-old! She can be a bit whiny and sarcastic sometimes, but mostly she's great and well-written. The pre-millenial 3D graphics don't add much for the character, but the voice-acting is superb. Sarah Hamilton does an outstanding performance as April. There are also many other memorable characters.As mentioned, the 3D graphics haven't aged that well. Don't get me wrong, the game's still charming looking and all, but especially the 3D character models and some of the cutscenes are quite cringeworthy. They have the ""late nineties awkward 3D graphics look"". The voice-acting and overall sound are great.Controls are basic point-and-click stuff and you cannot die or screw up — just the way I like my point-and-click adventure games. Some of the puzzles are kinda strange and ”out there”. I had to check out a walkthrough a few times. It took me about 13 hours to beat the game.The detail of the story and all the small things are quite baffling. April keeps a journal throughout the game's story and it really feels like it's written by a young girl. The journal is not necessary at all, but adds detail to this masterpiece and a lost player can find some clues while reading it.Tl;dr: A fine quality point-and-click classic with a compelling story, a highly detailed world and great characters. The graphics are a bit dated. Some of the puzzles are♥♥♥♥♥ Highly recommended!			"

												Great point and click adventure game. Sure it a bit outdated, but the basic foundations are still there and it has a solid  GREAT story behind the game. Well worth playing even after all this time. Story = Great; Characters/Building = GoodWorld: Outdated, but still goodNavigation: Good (Esc to speed up)If you're into games with rich stories this is a must play.			"

												Wow, I honestly am glad to have discovered this gem really late. Considered one of the best Adventure games out there. It is really sad that my game save got deleted out of nowhere despite me attempting to fix my issue, I finished the game by watching a playthrough online. Regardless, I played through the first half and enough to be pulled into the world the developers created, and what a world that is. It has a much more complex story than I had imagined. It is extremely long and the only 7 hours I played was less than half of the game. I blindly recommend this game to any Adventure game fanatic, although not new ones since it might be too overwhelming.			"

												A great Adventure game A great story about a world of science and a world of magic. You have to fulfill a prophecy, to prevent the collapse of the balance and finish your painting. It is a 2D point&click game with painted backgrounds. Great colorful characters. A bit dated graphics, but still playable. Puzzles are of fair difficulty.			"

												It's starts out veeeery slow (say, first 2-3 chapters?), but the more you play, the more awesome it gets. Especially once you figure out the shortcuts (like how to run, time skip, quick select items from inventory, etc)It's enjoyable, culturally rich, conceptually rich and fun. The important part is that it's fun!The puzzles aren't that hard to figure out either so it's not one of those frustrating puzzle games.In regards to characters... I only like 3 characters, including the main character, April. The other characters aren't as endearing or impactful, I suppose.The ending was a bit lackluster and didn't offer much closure, so I can't wait to play the sequel.8/10 would recommend you playing this game though!

												Old game, with old graphics and slow animations that sometimes will irritate you.Those are the only bad things I can say about the game, although I don't really mind at all it being old or the graphics.Not that kind of point-and-click game that you just gotta find all the items in the screen, maybe combine them and booyah, proceed. There's just so much stuff involved around the puzzles and that's what makes it one of the best point-and-click games of all time.The characters are really well made, no character appears without adding substance to the game and you will definitely love the Main Character, her attitude throughout the game is really cool. I love when the MC captivates me in a game.The story, which is the most important thing in a game for me, is simply amazing. Crazy plot twists that make your mind blow in a good way. You play the game, something happens, then you want to keep playing to get the answers and see the story unfold. It's full of surprise and emotions that create and incredible experience.If you love adventure games, puzzles and enjoy a great story, by all means, give The Longest Journey a try.			"

												One of the best, if not -the- best, point & click games ever made. While the cut scene graphics are rather dated now the very nature of point & click games means the game mechanics itself have held up just fine. The background art is still stunning and the worlds and people of Stark and Arcadia are enchanting as ever. I've owned multiple copies of The Longest Journey over the years and regret none of the repurchases lol Although it came out in 2000 it is still worth ever penny.A gorgeous blend of sci-fi and fantasy with a story that'll have you hooked from the start, The Longest Journey is a must-have for fans of story-telling and adventure, and especially for fans of point & clicks. Even now it remains my favorite entry in The Longest Journey series, with the nostalgia of the games' origin story still warming my heart, like rereading or rewatching your favorite childhood novel/movie.

Easy enough to play without a guide but has a few tricky puzzles up it's sleeve and the story isn't to short or too long but will keep you engrossed for a while.			"

												So this game is not for everyone obviously, it is a quite old Point & Click'er so the graphics are very very outdated.How ever the reason i bought this game in the first place is because i did a researxh about what are the most stroy rich games out there, and i very frequently dcame across this game. So i bought this game for the story it provides not for graphics. i played it the first 2 chapters than forgot about it and put it aside. So yesterday i can upon ""Dreamfall:Chapters"" again searching for a game with heavy story telling, like ""Bioshock infinite"" but without the FPS, and i was ready to buy on sale Blackfrieday. But after a reaserch i made i found out that its an awsome game but if you havn't played ""The longest journy"" you'll be lost, and wont know whats it about.So i remembered i had the game already, and started palying it from scratch, this time paying atention more closely to the story telling.The actual review:So the game has a very very rich story telling, The chracters in this game each have its own uniqe personality and history, which is manifested in very rich dialogs between the characters, the vocie acting is Holywood worthy, top notch voice acting. You get really sucked in to the story and conversations. the chracters really show personality, with their own humor, dilemas, downfalls and positives. This game is all about story telling. The gameplay is very simple, and you have some very cool and excelently written puzzles which includes everything from solving ""code"" sequances, to manipulating people with object to, for example, go away from a place, or give you something. you also have dialog pussles where you have to make the right dialog to get something. But it shines in story telling. everything is connected, and you actually find yourself rimembering parts of the story and understanding what is happening in the story. There is a clear line of story trouggout the game.Should you buy it? If you want to buy Dreamfall:Chapters, this is than a MUST. since Chpaters builds uppon the first game.If you would buy an Indie pixalated game for a few bucks, and you dont accept action but logics, than you should buy this game. It may have old graphics, but so do many indie games today and those are on purpose.And the main thing about this game, the story, the chracters and the voice acting, these all make you forget your playing a pixalated game (the game also has sound fx which really contribute to the atmosphere).If your a fan of cyberpunk themes in games than you should also buy this game.For an old game, this game deserves a very high score, since its really the 90's equivalent of ""Bioshock:infinite"" or ""Last of us"", that is story whise. So on my scale this game is a 9.5/10.even today its highly playable, and enjoyable and a must if you want Dreamfall:chapters.			"

												Highly entertaining point-and-click adventure classic with an interesting and original story. My rating: 8.5/10.The game has a nice mix of dark and more lighthearted mood. It has a strong focus on dialogue (with some very long ones) and story. It is set in two detailed worlds (one technology and one magic oriented). The body models are rather basic compared to today's standards, but the background art and scenery are quite good. Most of the puzzles and uses of various items that you find are intuitive - not too easy, not too difficult - although a few instances where you have to combine items seemed a bit farfetched.			"

												In my search for good story driven games I tripped over Dreamfall chapters some months ago. It looked pretty interesting and it was then that I learned about it`s predecessors and how I missed them. All of them. Never heard of the ""Longest Journey"" before. And so I decided to go and play these titles. Starting with the first part of the trilogy. Although I hab some difficulties with the immersion at the beginning of the game which were all caused by it`s really badly aged character models. The scenery looks even today pretty, but the 3D rendered models do not. But nontheless I kept playing and oh boy I don`t regret a single second of it. This game is amazing! It`s storyline could have easily been a book. Or a movie. It`s fantastic. I loved this little masterpiece. The games characters are full of life and absolutly believable. And most important you get to care about them. Brilliant writing. Everyone who like me several weeks ago didn`t play the game yet, please do.Everyone needs to play this, although the game is not flawless. The puzzle logic is sometimes questionable to say the least and the graphics aged not too good. And I wished there was a little more crow. Still this game is a masterpiece. Best adventure game I played so far. Even better than monkey island. Looking forward to the next titles of the dreamfall series.			"

												You're going to look at my hour record and think that I've never played this game. Don't let that fool you. I've been playing this game for years and I know it back to front and inside out. You play as a young woman called April Ryan who is trying to find her way in the world, as an artist. Instead, she crosses to another world, back and forth, saving the worlds time and time again with her faithful feathered side-kick, Crow. She fights big corporations, shady underground factions and meets a collection of interesting people and races along the way, who both help and hinder her. If you're thinking about getting this game, do it. I beg you. You won't be disappointed. The longest journey will forever be at the top of my favourite games of all time. The characters are not only memorable but relatable... and oh so lovable. I can't stop singing the praises of this game.May the balance protect you.			"

												For me this is one of those games that it's almost impossible to take an objective perspective on just because it made such a profound impact on me at a young age. Could it be one of the best adventure games ever made? Most definitely. Maybe even in the top 5. If I had to put on my objective hat and evaluate it I would be forced to admit that it does have some wonky puzzles at times (particularly in the first chapter) and a few instances of somewhat awkward massive exposition dump (particularly the first time you get to Arcadia), but the world it creates, its characters, and more importantly, the way it introduces you to and draws you into that world puts this game in a class all its own--not only among adventure games, but video games in general. Anyhow, regardless of its position in the history of gaming as a whole, I do think it's safe to say that there's probably no better adventure game on steam than this. So if you've yet to play it do so now.			"

Graphics are not exactly modern, but for me it was only a good thing, as I don't have a modern gaming computer.There were a few situations in the game where I had to resort to a walkthrough, because there was absolutely nothing in the game that would indicate that event B (required to progress in the game) is conditional to completing event A first. Things like a certain NPC appearing in a certain spot for instance. Sometimes the hotspots were really difficult to find, too.Overall, despite the plot of the game leaving me a bit unsatisfied in the end, I enjoyed this game a lot.			"

												Having never played this game's sequel, I thought it would be novel (and necessary, due to having forgotten most of the details of the complex story) to replay TLJ before taking on Dreamfall for the first time. So the big question is: how does this game (which I considered to be an adventure masterpiece a decade ago) hold up today? The verdict is mixed. On one hand, it nearly perfects the classic adventure formula (click stuff, talk to people, solve puzzles), the number of absurd puzzle solutions are minimal, and the story is well thought out. But on the other hand, the writing, while well-intended, sometimes comes off as amateurish. The script is also extremely verbose and really could have used some serious editing. The graphics, of course, are extremely dated, but that is easily forgiven. All in all, the spirit of the game holds up well, if not the technical side. Assuming you are a fan of the genre and can overlook its dated flaws, it is still fun to play today. A true classic!			"

Quite a bit of pixel hunting.Overall, this game only holds up well when bolstered by nostalgia. Otherwise, while it may have been stellar in its time, it still suffers from many of the frustrating gameplay tropes that adventure games have left behind.			"

The characters are all fully developed and unforgetable. It has mature themes which games rarely explore.

The way in which the story escalates while dumping beautifully constructed ambients is truly magnificent and rare in games made in the time period when this game was released.

												Recently played this for my first time and I amazed how great the story is in this game.I have to say this is one of my favorite story games ever. The depth and humor is great.The outdated graphics aren't anything that effects the gameplay nor effecting how much one enjoys the story/humor.One get to meet so many different characters with all their different persona.The puzzles in the game are very diversified.I for sure do really recommend this game.

												I never got to play the Longest Journey when it first came out. But it was always on my wish list after playing the 2nd installment. Even though this game has a decent amount of years on it, it is still a great game. I am so glad that I finally got to experiance it.			"

What really made me change my mind was the story With this, along with the other games Dreamfall and Dreamfall Chapters a very engaging story plays out. There are some asinine and confusing puzzles dotted about here and there but the story of this game is really what should keep you playing through this.			"

												This game may seem clunky at first, but after some time you get used to it. This is due to some slow animations which make the gameplay seem sluggish. If you can overlook this, and some extremely convoluted puzzles, you will find an imaginative and story driven experience that few games have ever accomplished. The way in which the story escalates while dumping beautifully constructed ambients is truly magnificent and rare in games made in the time period when this game was released. If you want to get this game I reccomend getting the sequel and, if you can, ""Dreamfall Chapters"" for a more complete experience.			"

But I found the solution! I installed it on my very simple touchscreen laptap (normal and certainly not a gaming laptop) and it works. If you like (old) point and click games like me, you got to get yourself a touchscreen laptop as point and click and touchscreen are a match made in heaven. Probably will save you from RSI as well :). Most of them work on touchscreen but not all. This one works flawlessly, much better then on a normal pc.			"

												Okay, having now finished this I can easily recommend it. Those people who claim it's one of/the best adventure game? They're right.I'm still digesting it so this will be rambly (and is more for myself as an aide-memoire in any case) so yeah.It's from 1999/2000 and it shows, it only supports 640x480 for a start, the background pre-rendered stuff is still fine but many of the characters haven't aged as well. Mechanically though it still plays well, the only issue is with hot-points - there's no way of highlighting them you just have to sweep the screen with the cursor and hope you discover everything. There was at least one puzzle which had me stumped as I just hadn't seen the object I needed to interact with.Having said that - the puzzles are really not the point here, this is clearly all about the story.The story. Where to begin?You are April Ryan a young art student struggling to come up with a painting for her college's end of year exhibition. Lately she's been plagued by nightmares, but is it from the stress of her painter's block or is it from the uncomfortable heatwave? (Of course we know better but she doesn't)That's essentially your introduction to what is probably one of the best realised worlds in an adventure. Often these games can suffer from a feeling of 'flatness' - that the locations are just sets, the characters props. But the writing here gives almost all the characters just enough depth to avoid this and all with a nice light touch so it's mostly done through allusions and conversations without ever feeling forced or like it's trying to make a specific statement. All of this has almost no bearing on the actual game either, it's just there to flesh out the world and it does a marvellous job. One character will confide in you about her concerns for a mutual friend with bad taste in men but you won't get the details as your character already knows them, and the game makes no judgement on this friend - that's just how she is. It's little elements like this that make the world and make you care about these characters so you do fear for them and want to help them.That's just the background cast, April herself is a wonderfully believable (and likable) protagonist. She doesn't really know what she's doing, or even what she wants to do. She'll worry whether she is actually doing the right thing or if she even can do the right thing. She gets frustrated when characters are obtuse or cryptic rather than just answering her questions. She's witty but doesn't necessarily get along with everyone. A nice touch is that all the objects in the game are described from her point of view, so if she doesn't know she'll just guess or quote Star Wars because it looks a bit like the Death Star.Which incidentally reminds me that the voice acting is all extremely well done and just adds to the characters (Crow and Captain Nebevay, I'm looking at thee).She also keeps a diary as you progress through the game, and for a change it is an actual diary - usually it'll just be your quest log or a straight up history of what you've done. Here it's her view on what's happening, often the fears or thoughts that you wouldn't necessarily bring up in conversation. Again, this has no impact on the game and you could easily progress without even noticing it's there - it adds nothing beyond an enjoyable insight into the character.Yeah, this really is an excellent story well told.Trying to think of anything similar and the only thing that pops into my head is Beyond Good And Evil, a normal extremely likable/human protagonist who just wants peace and quiet but gets unwillingly caught up in things and a well-realised world that you're just dumped in and left to figure it out from conversations and interactions.It isn't Lara Croft or some devil-may-care adventurer, it's just a normal young woman who's ashamed to admit she's a little bit scared of the old homeless guy who hangs around her neighbourhood, and who hates her sleazy neighbour who keeps propositioning her despite repeated rejections.The best adventure game? Quite possibly. The best characters, world, story? Almost certainly.			"

												What a phenomenal ,fantastic experience it is .The only regret about this game is that I have played it recently after all these years.This game has very unique artistic touch.You can feel the spirit and the work given to this piece of art on each detail.Games back then succeeded in both keeping the pace serious and the humor sense intact.They also managed to give some references from classical writers,books and even fairy tales.What I mostly enjoyed was the philosophical,metaphysical and spiritual background of the game.It was not just doing the job for just sake of doing it, not ; it is a process of believing in whole story, it completeness and presenting in most mesmerizing way.This game had everything in it ;cognitive dissonance states describing sociological and psychological states of characters as well as their choices (free will).Astral projections could not be done as perfectly as was presented in this game , it was just a perfect fit.This a progressive game which requires patience at the start but as it develops and story goes the gameplay experience enhances.

However, The Longest Journey overcomes the distaste I have for the genre. A compelling story, well written dialogue, a well fleshed world. Every irksome puzzle and irritating effort to find the thing I was supposed to click to progress forward was rewarded in a way that compelled me to keep going. Just keeping in mind the story, this is worth every cent paid and minute invested.			"

												This game has some challenging puzzles, is rather slow, has some interesting characters, but it is really nice. I recommend this game to anyone, who wants to play out a really nice story that is more heavy on the dialogue and the text than the action.The characters are certainly one of the best parts, and April as well as her friends made it a very enjoyable journey for me. The game felt really slow at times, especially when you had to wait for the characters to slowly move before they began dialogue, continued the story, or just allowed you to click around again. It certainly felt slower than what I have gotten used used to, but then again it is a long time since I played point and click adventure games.The game is very dialogue and text heavy, but it kinda compliments the games slow pace and atmosphere. A few times it got annoying if the character was too weird or dull, but mostly April Ryan's personality made me enjoy it the game as a whole, as well as the diverse environment and cast.I only experienced one minor bug during my playthrough. When trying to save the game, return to the main menu, and close the game, the ""are you sure window"" just showed up as a white square. But after I realized I just had to press ""y"" or ""n"", so i didn't need to see it, it didn't really interfere much in the game or outside of it. So yeah, pretty happy I was able to play the game with no real problems. Though the ""40+ hours gameplay"" that it promised in the about section doesn't really seem right... But I had already seen the time on other people's reviews so I didn't actually expect it.			"

												Definitely one of the best point & click adventures I've ever played.The puzzles are mostly really easy to figure out. There are only a few harder but still managable ones. If I still got stuck - which happened quite often - I just took a look into a walkthrough. But that wasn't because I couldn't solve a riddle, sometimes the game just doesn't give you any hint at all on what's your next (illogical) step, there are some easily missable items and sometimes you have to trigger an event by looking at some insignificant thing in the environment.However, the greatest thing about this game is its story. It's exciting, you always feel that you're getting forward and you find a lot of lore throughout the game.So basically there are two worlds: The logical world Stark, which is basically a dystopian future of our own, and the magical Arcadia, which is some kind of a dream world. (Notice the Lovecraft reference? It's not the only one)The game keeps putting you in both of them, whereever you are it feels entirely different but it still manages to make sense.There are few things I don't like about The Longest Journey, for example the epilogue was kind of pointless and there are some things that could have been explained better, but really, the pros overweigh the cons by far.

												This game really is among the very finest ""point-and-click"" adventure game that has ever been made.  The controls aren't particulary complex.  Left-click, right-click, Esc for the save menu, click to skip through dialogue.  Pretty standard.  The graphics looked dated when the game was new, and by today's standard they're antique.  Puzzles are pretty logical, and not very difficult.  Death is impossible.  But none of that is the reason you want to play this game.TLJ has one of the most incredible stories ever told in interactive format.  It's like playing through an epic-length novel in 15 or 20 hours of gameplay.  The voice cast is outstanding from front to back.  The lead character, April Ryan, is likable and intelligent, and by the end of the game, you'll feel like you know her, and you'll be sorry to see her go at the end of the game.  Despite being dialogue-heavy, this game is never boring.  The plot advances with every puzzle solved, every character spoken to.  The cultures of two entire worlds are brought into conflict through April Ryan.April is an art student in a slightly-dystopian, near future version of our world, a high-technology two-class society.  Magic doesn't exist there any more than it does in real life.  But April gets involved in a complicated plot that finds her being trapped in a parallel universe on a world called ""Arcadia,"" where magic is real, and technology is sparse.  April occasionally goes back and forth between worlds, and even into space, in order to save Arcadia and her own world, and in the process learns a lot about herself.Best $10 you could spend on Steam.

												Simply fantastic old school adventure game. Some of the best characters in gaming. A deep and unique story set in our world, and a world of magic that have been seperated, but are now collapsing as the balance is threated to be undone. If you like old point and click adventure games then this is an absolute must!			"

Great music and a fantatic story... yeh yeh i know is over 1 year since i completed it and the game is over 16 year old now. But it is still a masterpiece of a game. Highly recommended. NB : i have used around 35 hrs on this game, alot offline. I also remember haveing it home at cd somewhere and i played it over 14 years ago or so.			"

												Just replayed this classic masterpiece some 15 years after my first run-through. And WOW does it hold up! A great old school adventure game of the point-and-click persuasion, with an amazing story, cool atmosphere and lengthy gameplay set in both a future bleak version of earth, as well as a magical fantasy alternative.Unlike those extremely annoying old Sierra games where opening the wrong door, forgetting to pick up the red berry from the Evil Wizard's toilet 5 hours earlier, or just putting on the wrong pair of socks, will kill you instantly and set you back to your latest saved game where you'd still forgot to pick up the damned berry, TLJ encourages you to try everything. This game will never punish you for exploring, just like - for example - the original Monkey Island trilogy.There were a couple of small but easily ignored graphical glitches on my Windows 8.1 rig, e.g. some characters walk around with slightly unmotivated see-through holes in their heads, but you don't play a game originally released in 1999 to dive into the realer-than-real pixelwork. This IS your parents' old adventure game. Also, if the Yes/No dialogue window turns out blank, kick it DOS style and just press 'y' for Yes. You'll be just fine.Again: a classic adventure masterpiece. Highly recommended.			"

												I must admit I was insecure at first due to the gameplay-style and the looks of it all. I do enjoy a good graphic, but this game is old ... THEN AGAIN, due to the fact that it's a little older it means there's only a great story behind it. I definetly do recomend this game to just about everyone out there, even though it's more for you who enjoy point-and-click, and some head-grinding games. It's not particulary difficult, even though I was stuck a few places... But luckily there's a walkthrough somewhere :) This game was absolutely worth everything, I got it on sale, and bought the package including dreamfall, then happened to start dreamfall first (as I was insecure if it even mattered which one I started to play of the two,) and dreamfall has a much bigger and better upgrade in looks and everything. So starting this to finish it before I got to dreamfall was a bit dull at first, but now that I've played it through it was soooo WORTH IT!!! So the two are connected, and dreamfall is the second. Enjoy this one first, you won't regret it. And the playtime is pretty long too, took me a good 30 hours to finish :)			"

Despite that, I've replayed this game dozens of times since I first encountered it nearly 15 years ago. The story always pulls me back eventually. One one hand, it's a science-fiction/fantasy mashup that spans several worlds. On the other hand it's the personal story of an extremely well-written protagonist. Those two elements are weaved together perfectly, and that's what makes this game timeless.			"

												I picked up this game (Along with Dreamfall: The Longest Journey) when the bundle was on sale. I originally just wanted to play Dreamfall but everyone was saying ""PLAY THE FIRST GAME FIRST!!"" And boy where they right!!I honestly didn't think I would enjoy this point and click adventure as much as I did.I will keep this short:The story is the MAIN part of this game along with puzzles that require a lot of thinking.. Maybe TOO much thinking haha.I used a walkthrough because the game doesn't explain well at all that each item in the game is CRUCIAL to move on to the next part of the story within the chapters. Seriously how was I supposed to know at the top of my head that I had to combine a rubber duck, rope and a clam to make a fishingpole to get a key that blends into the scenery????Lot's of backtracking too.. LOTS and LOTS of backtracking.. But that didn't take me away from the experience!!The characters are so fantastic and have much much more personality than everyone in todays modern games have!! VERY funny game to!! Countless moments where I had some good, legit laughs!! You actually CARE about the character you are playing as where I couldn't turn the game off just to see what came next!!This is a WONDERFUL story and the world is so mystical that you wish it became a movie.But that's why this game is unique.. It can only work as a GAME!!On to the second game...			"

												This game is definitely one of the best point and click games out. Although the game was maybe a little too long (Hence the name 'The Longest Journey') it kept me entertained and engrossed in the storyline. You play as April Ryan, a teenage student who goes on an unparalleled adventure to save the world. You come across multiple quests and puzzles, escaping death throughout the game to continue on with the experience. There's not too much to say without spoiling the story but if you are a fan of point and click games, this really is a must play.Pros:- Excellent Storyline- Unique Characters- Gameplay Well Designed- Well Written Narrative- Excellent Voice Acting- Characters Felt RealisticCons:- The game was a little prolonged- Some of the puzzles were somewhat confusing/frustrating- A couple of compatibility issues with later OS versionsScore: 9/10Now onwards to the sequel! Dreamfall: The Longest Journey!			"

												This is the greatest adventure game ever. I played it as a kid when it first came out before the great Y2K scare and 9/11.It has an amazing story with two fun worlds to explore. Some puzzles are a little bit of a pain and obscure, but if you think like an adventure gamer, you might have a leg up or go find a good ole' well written walkthrough (yes, written!!). Regardless, April Ryan is an awesome, sassy protagonist that anyone could and should love.- Great story- Great voice acting and characters- Great environment (beautiful scenes)- Great puzzles- AMAZING soundtrack! Thank you, Bjorn!P.S. Be sure to take a piece of candy and eat it from where you work. You'll thank me later.P.S.S. Don't play Dreamfall or Dreamfall Chapters after this. You will cry erry time.			"

The storyline was interesting (always played more and more just HAD to know what was hapenning next).The chars are well made. I loved every single one u can encounter through the gameplay. Matching voices, funny and well made personalities.Though the 'riddles' are are not that hard (I dont think if u properly listen to the story and read the Diary u find a part where u rly can get stuck) it is much fun to play.The music was good and matching.The cutscences were short but nice (well older game no big grafic over here, but thats not all it is about in games).Only No-Go so scenes just took to long imo. I know u can just jump them, but who am I to know there is not going to happen somthing important? I can just say: Go and get it!Fav char? I would say Bird Bird <3 "

												This game is one of the greatest point & click adventure games I have played so far. If you took my top games of all time, it would be on it. Maybe not number one, what with all of these truly amazing games you see, but it would be there and not too low.The Graphics are a bit dated, but not an issue.The music was a bit forgettable but good, and quite fitting.The story is great, I really did like it quite a lot. Throughout the whole game it was intriguing and fun to experience. The Puzzles were at times quite challenging, but rewarding, and isn't that what you want from a puzzle game?The characters were all unique and interesting (well most of them), and the locations were quite fantastical.The basic story, without spoiling too too much, is that once technology and magic existed side by side, but it almost caused the world to rip apart, so the earth was separated into two worlds. One of logic and technology, and one of magic and chaos. They are kept separated and in order by this ""Guardian"" character, who spends a 1000 years or so before being replaced. But an evil organisation want to merge the worlds again, and there fore kidnapped the replacement, causing the old guardian to grow tired and leave his realm, leaving the border between the worlds week and messed up.You play April Ryan have the power to move between the realms, and you seem to be the only person that can currently fix everything. So you go on a long, epic journey. And you meet all sorts of people and creatures. And you travel both the worlds. And it's really really good but I don't want to spoil more stuff.Get it. 9/10Note: Got stuck on some puzzles; broke down and looked them up. try to avoid this as it takes away the fun			"

												The Longest Journey is indeed a long journey. It may take you about 15-20 hours to finish, maybe even more. It's a traditional point-and-click adventure game and it is said that it may very well be one of the best ever made. The story is great and the voice acting is actually surprisingly good. If you don't mind the outdated graphics and that the game still runs with a very low resolution (extremely low) it's worth playing through. There are a few tweaks you can do to make the game more compelling for the eye, for example running it windowed. I recommend this one to anyone who is a fan of point-and-click adventures.			"

												What's the longest journey you can imagine? Probably to China or something stupid like that, right? WRONG. It's to the moon. Science has PROVED this beyond ANY REASONABLE DOUBT. Little known FACT: Russia never (not ONCE) made it to the moon, despite firing large amounts of dog-filled Soyuz capsules at it. Also, important clue - having claimed it in 1969, the AMERICA lives on the MOON when AMERICA isn't in the USA. So now that you know that, you are ready to embark on your OWN ""longest journey"" into the soul (to the moon). Don't forget to pack SANDWICHES like: roast beef, tuna salad, peanut butter (and jelly). This game will PREPARE you also. It was sadly and regrettably of NO HELP to Laika but it is too late to mourn this fact now.			"

												What's the longest journey you can imagine? Probably to China or something stupid like that, right? WRONG. It's to the moon. Science has PROVED this beyond ANY REASONABLE DOUBT. Little known FACT: Russia never (not ONCE) made it to the moon, despite firing large amounts of dog-filled Soyuz capsules at it. Also, important clue - having claimed it in 1969, the AMERICA lives on the MOON when AMERICA isn't in the USA. So now that you know that, you are ready to embark on your OWN ""longest journey"" into the soul (to the moon). Don't forget to pack SANDWICHES like: roast beef, tuna salad, peanut butter (and jelly). This game will PREPARE you also. It was sadly and regrettably of NO HELP to Laika but it is too late to mourn this fact now.			"

												One of the very few games to ever make me cry. The first game out of 3 others was probably the best STORY-wise, and this is coming from someone who initially snubbed this game because of crappy graphics. Dreamfall was amazing with it's story, but I have to admit that this one is better. Granted, the graphics are VERY dated, but they were all the rage in the year 2000. The story is so good though, that after I stopped paying attention to it I got totally absorbed in the story of April Ryan, Stark, Arcadia, Abnaxus, Cortez! Even though this is mostly about April's journey, you'll find yourself caring for the ""backup"" characters. I know I did. I love the humor and wit in this, and how it wasn't afraid to be sassy or goofy (without resorting to cheap kid humor).  If you want a game that you'll probably never forget, this is a good one to get. Dreamfall TLJ and Dreamfall Chapters are good too, but trust me, play this first. There is so much that you miss in the other games if you skip this.			"

												Really enjoyed the story of this game and the puzzles were great, if a little random at times! I wish I'd played it when it was current as I struggled a bit with the graphics but that is a very minor personal bugbear. Also, the walk/run speed was a frustratingly slow at time but apart from that the game was engaging and kept me busy for nearly 35 hours (especially good value as I bought it on sale). Would defintely recomend this game and I am now going to play the other two!			"

												A great story that you want to get through, even if you didn't have to solve any puzzles. Lovely (dated only by being lo-res) artwork. Saying that, it is still plagued by some stupid puzzles where you have to use things in the oddest of ways, and when you complete them, you just say to yourself ""that was just stupid"". If you like adventure games, this is still one of the best.			"

												10/10Edit: One of the greatest adventure games in the history. Long, captivating story, interesting and believable characters, amazing music and fantastic visuals (at least for a game from 1999). The only flaw: you have to wait ages for the sequels (Dreamfall - 2006, Dreamfall Chapters - 2014, The Longest Journey Home - 2020 probably).			"

												Live it as you were reading a book and the game will be really amazing.If you're searching for fast pacing game and difficult enigmas it will be a delusion.The game in itself is just finding things on the screen or put the ones you already have on it, but beside this the story is awasome, good dialogues, good fantasy.I'll how's the next one.

												For the first 1/3 of this game, I would have given it a ""no."" Then up until an hour or so before the end, I felt pretty neutral about the whole thing. By the end of the game, for whatever reason, I had fallen a little bit in love with the world(s) this adventure spans. So it's a yes, but with some warnings.This game was created at a time when 3D graphics technology, even pre-rendered, was quite limited. It shows, big time. The characters are chunks of polygons and the animations in particular are quite absurd. Like, unintentional humor absurd. Nonetheless, I could see how this could be visually captivating for people-- 14 years ago. I didn't come into this game expecting anything other than dated graphics but it is not a game that has aged well in that respect.In terms of ""gameplay,"" there isn't a whole lot of it. It's an adventure game, so it comes with the territory that a lot of your time will be spent walking about and taking in the storytelling. This game felt like 80% of it was just spent listening to people talk. There's just a lot to listen to. At times, especially towards the first half, it can seem very slow just listening to all the talking. But there are eventually puzzles to solve. Unfortunately they're not good puzzles. If you're familiar with adventure games, you'll know there are right ways to do puzzles and wrong ways to do them. TLJ does them the wrong way. I was forced to consult a walkthrough several times in order to progress, and the things I was ""missing"" were always ridiculous.The defining (if not redeeming) aspect of any adventure game of course is the storyline. Despite a funky opening, The Longest Journey doesn't exactly dash out of the gate. The aforementioned long-winded dialogues quickly reveal a diverse cast, but they're not all what I would necessarily consider ""fascinating."" Unfortunately the voice acting is extremely uneven. Rarely, it's quite good, but occasionally it's plain terrible, and often it's just ""off"" enough to keep it from being believable. The game is ambitious; it really tries for a lot of drama with developed characters and action and humor, and the acting really doesn't sell it. Admittedly, 14 years ago, it was probably pretty impressive. So the game throws you into the ""Journey"" with really little reason to be interested in it, largely because you're not sure what's supposed to be going on. Then soon enough things get weird, and you start getting a sense of the scope of all this weirdness, but it honestly feels pretty cheesy. For some reason it was enough to keep me coming back to playing TLJ again and again (it IS a long journey), and eventually the game lulled me into appreciating the depth of its story. I became numb to the games flaws and was left to contemplate how thorough a world was created here, particularly the many characters and their stories, and how they all together belong to something bigger. Still, it isn't fantastic, but it is something rather special. By the end, I was glad to have met them, awkward as some of them may have come across at first.The Longest Journey was clearly a very ambitious adventure, and while it may not have aged so well, you can still sense the vision of the creators as something that is quite remarkable. The game's ending can be described as unsatisfying, but moreso than leaving a bad taste in my mouth it just left me wanting more. And, as it turns out, there is more. So that's where I'm headed next.			"

I've bought the sequel of TLJ, Dreamfall: The Longest Journey and i can't wait to continue the adventure with Zoe Castillo and discover more of the worlds of Stark and Arcadia!This is by far one of my most favorite video games ever.+ a large variety of voice actors + each character has their own individual voice actor (mostly of them anyway)+ High quality voice-acting+ gripping and enchanting story+ beautiful and sometimes haunting music+ huge feeling of achievement when you figure out a puzzle without googling it (haha or is that just me?)+ easy-to-use interface + immersive cinematics+ the Book of Secrets is really cool hehe+ even with it's dated graphics, most areas of the game still looks beautiful= the graphics arent good but it's an old game so you can't really expect too much= some puzzles are very hard for some people- In my opinion, i feel that a couple of the puzzles were overly-hard and seemed impossible to solve without a guide (but i'm relatively new to point&clicks so meh)besides that, I can't think of any actual negatives of the game!

												The Longest Journey is considered by many to be one of the best point and click adventures games of time.  Despite it being dated by 15 years and some very high expections on my end, it does manage to live up to the hype that surrounded it so many years ago.  A very impressive and rewarding journey that should be taken by anyone with a love for classic P&C adventures.  Pros: +Incredibly massive, well told story - This thing is huge, running the gamut from fantasy to sci-fi.+Really likable characters - April Ryan might be one of my favorite female protagonists in gaming. +SOLID voice acting+An endless amount of beautiful scenery.  Even by today's standards, most of the backgrounds look great. Cons:-Really dated characters appearance and animation - Welcome back to the days of low poly-Some pretty wonky sound mixing-THE SLOWEST, NON-SKIPPABLE animations ever witnessed.  You will feel like 20% of your playtime is spent watching April run across the screen then back again.  Watching a character leave the scene after a conversation.  Watching a character enter the scene.   Watching someone pick somthing up...put something down....ANOTHER CROW FLYING ANIMATION.... these will all be unskippable and PAINFULLY slow animations that you will just have to sit and bear.  We had more patience in the 90's.			"

												This game just amazes me. It's such a classic and the CGI, though dated by today's standard, is still impressive for the time it came out. It's an amazing point-and-click with a beautiful and flowing narrative.I am amazed that it hasn't gotten more recognition over the years and not as well known as some of those classics like Monkey Island and Sam & Max.My only real issue is that some parts are a little difficult, but the items glow if you have to use them on a certain object or person which can be a real life-saver. I also dislike the fact I had to disable the steam UI to have it work (though that was sometime ago and it might work ok now) so there aren't any chances to take screenshots to show friends some of the awesome scenes and enlightening words of wisdom that are often spoken in this game.If you're a fan of point-and-click and you for some reason don't have this in your collection then I don't know why you havn't bought this yet. Especially for it's price and what you get.			"

												The bad:- The graphics- The whole user interface pretty much- Scanning every possible place for that one item you missed is a ♥♥♥♥ing nightmare. I gave up and used a walkthrough every time that happened- Some of the major puzzles are based on trial-and-error, which is pretty damn annoying- Choices you make don't actually make any difference... Though I guess that was too much to expectThe good:- Great story- A very original and well built fantasy world. Wonderful lore overall- Voice acting is, mostly, pretty goodThat's basically it. If a really good story is enough to get you through some not-so-good gameplay (Though I have to say it's MUCH better and more intuitive than I expected it to be), you'd love this game. If not, don't bother. Or just use a walkthrough and rush through it for the story.			"

												This game hands down is the most polished, well written, longest and best adventure game I have ever played. It felt I was in an interactive novel with classic point and click adventure included for good measure. This game is a story of a girl who lives in the future but finds out she is destined to help save another world filled with magic and fantasy as well as her own world. The beginning of the game drags on a bit but it introduces all of the characters and gets you to care about them and familiarize yourself with the worlds. The game is over 20 hours long so you get your money’s worth and the art style has aged well over a decade. this game has as much attention to character development and twist as a well written novel. This game makes me feel sad that the modern adventure games lean more towards humor than story because this is a breathtaking experience that anyone can enjoy and I wish there were more games like this.

												I feel very cheated by this game. I was promised an experience, not any experience, but the ability to experience what is known as ""The Longest Journey"".I go back to their proficiency (or lack thereof!) in the name, because it's key to what makes this so special-- if not successful. What is shown by the game is far less engrossing than how they amplify that, sometimes excruciatingly, until the pointing, clicking, and adventuring is raised to a gale force bellow. You're pulled so close to the guts of the mouse that by the end you'll think you could build one yourself.The first half of ""The Longest Journey"" simulates how it must feel to be eaten alive-- at least until the second half, when player one attempts to eschew the paradigm, drowning in it. But in the back half of the game, the storm ends and it = switches to a hush. ""The Longest Journey"" is ambient and gentle, almost absent-mindedly turning upbeat at the end, and ""The Longest Journey"" grows so static that it's not even a dirge: It's lovely to play but bereft of tension.Which is why I'm so curious about whether it's actually ""good"", if ""good"" even has a meaning at all (it doesn't).  Like early Pink Floyd, it, (both player and game as a one-self 'playergame'^[1]^[2]) engaged in an exploration that was unrehearsed and maybe even naïve. The game tried to become something other than the sum of its parts-- and by emerging from free and unrehearsed improvisation, the game resisted containers; the wails and ballads emerged organically, and their apparent goal-- of creating spontaneous, non-idiomatic, and exhilarating adventure-- was reached again and again, if only by proxy through existence.It feels like the game wings itself in front of us-- thrilling us with new discoveries one minute, and the next, batting around ideas that go nowhere. Is the organ lineup here to stay? (Probably not) Is the pervasive melancholy a stylistic choice, a side effect of playing without truth, or an emotional reaction? Does ""The Longest Journey"" survive, evolve, or die?^[3] Whatever the future holds, this is some of the riskiest improv ever recorded: In every moment of the game, you just wish you actually went on the journey which was in fact, in the longest, but you just ♥♥♥♥ing don't.Footnotes:1: As put fourth by Charles Montagu Doughty in The Titans.2.

												I probably spent more time trying to get this to work than actually playing the game. After hours of trying different switches and looking up solutions online and it seems like even trying to run this on Windows 7 is near-impossible. If I felt like dedicating more time to resolving this I would probably try running it under an emulated Windows 95/98 environment in virtualbox or something but tbh that's too much effort and my backlog is too long to waste any more time on this.

It's a shame because they did their best to run against the grain of mainstream tropes and really spent quality time on the dialogue and character development. If only the story, with such fleshed-out characters, actually went anywhere with resolution. I finished confused and let down, which was strange considering how much I liked April Ryan.			"

												I know this is supposed to be one of the best adventure games of all time, and I really wanted to like it, but it just kept dropping me right when I thought it was getting good.The character development at the start of this game looks detailed and promising, but it doesn't follow through with a complete theme. It starts with one theme, then abruptly picks up another, starting with a unique character and ending with a stereotype.The puzzles are difficult, and there are a lot of them, but they aren't very intuitive. They're good for a brain exercise, but I didn't find them fun. I ran to the walkthrough a lot (and I hate walkthroughs) because the game design didn't get me to care about the puzzles. This could very well be personal preference, though.You can sprint or walk, but even while sprinting....You. Run. So. Slowly. Over. Vast. Distances. The game world tried very, very hard to be immersive and one-of-a-kind. It offered a lot in the way of lore and history to the world, locations, etc. But I found it all to be ultimately lacking. It felt like somebody who loved fantasy and sci-fi writing one of their first stories. Not bad at all; I can tell they loved their creation, and I appreciate their efforts. But it's not something I would want to PAY for, if you know what I mean. It's not a bad game. Don't get me wrong. I did enjoy parts of it. But, for the most part, I found myself continuing just for the sake of finishing, and in the hope it would get better along the way. I did buy the sequel, so, again, it's not a bad game. But it's not a great one, either. Just average.			"

												The Longest Journey is imaginative, but it is also tedious and difficult to close out of.  There is no pause menu, no exit button, and alt+f4 will make the game pop up with a modal dialog box asking if you really want to quit... yet you can't click anything because the game just freezes and messes up your computer's resolution.  Then, you have to end the process manually.I honestly didn't play this much because I didn't like the visuals, didn't like the controls, and felt like the adventure genre gimmicks, like collecting pointless objects you shouldn't need but are forced to interact with as a plot device... yeah, I guess I just don't like the game's quality of storytelling enough to justify the bad gameplay, because I've played way worse just for a good story.

												Game is super slow, but you can toggle a setting that lets you speed it up by cutting animations. Story is interesting but do beware this is a point and click. I somehow missed that when I bought it but it's no problem a walkthrough can't fix. The only reason I can't reccommend it is because it royally messes up Windows 10 after playing. That's the only reason I don't really want to open it up. After playing the game, all the fonts in ALL programs get super messed up. I get that it's an old game, but it's pretty annoying having to restart the computer just to get normal fonts back. Also the quit and overwrite ""Are you sure?"" prompt is bugged and doesn't let me choose, so I end up having to force quit the application everytime and save in a new slot.			"

												I don't recommend this game.Sorry, but I've spent 5 hours in the game trying to find a reason why people like this game and keep recommending it on Steam. It's a decent game pure technically and runs smoothly but it's faults are too serious to ignore.This game offers*Dissapointing humour*Boring storyline*Unrelatable heroine*One-dimentional side characters*And some no-sense-making puzzlesIncluding some minor technicalities as wellLike seriously, I can see why people liked it 16 years ago, but now? Please, there are tons of games better than this one available on Steam today. There is no reason to play through this game these days (as I also hear it's very long). I didn't like the heroine, since she always fails to be funny, whines about how difficult the truth is to accept, yells at the only character who understands and obviously wants to help her (even though she secretly believes in everything he says) and... she sometimes speak like a robot. Also, she's a complete nobody with seemingly no personality. Thank god there are worse characters in the game!The story itself, isn't the best one. I wasn't amazed in any way. It's just too boring. Another ""Save the world"" kind of plot, basically. As if I've never heard that one before... Nothing new or unique, just dissapointing.And please, the humour in this is unbareably cringeworthy! I'm refering to a scene in some back-alley where you use a certain toy and a certain garbage pile and make it look like a cop pointing a gun at someone and shouting: ""Do the ape dance"" or something equally silly. And guess what? He falls for it... hillarious(!) That's the kind of humour you will have to endure by playing this.I've heard so much great things about this game and I've looked forward to trying it out for quite a while, but I can't finish it if the whole game will be like this. So could someone, anybody, please tell me exactly where this ""Journey"" actually starts? Because, right now... I'll settle for the end. "

												The Longest Journey has an interesting story and interesting characters, but interactivity is at a minimum. There are long stretches of sitting there and doing nothing other than listening to characters talk. Maybe that's par for the course for adventure games at the time, but I think they could've done more to involve the player. Nevertheless, it's an interesting narrative and woth going through it if you like sci-fi and fantasy joining hands and frolicking through the lilacs.			"

												I realize this game is 15 years old, but I'm surprised by what passed as ""entertaining"" back then. I have trouble staying awake while playing this game. It is sooo slooow. For example, if you want to make the protagonist, April, walk from one end of an area to the other, you simply click where you want her to walk and then... WAIT. And wait. While she walks. Make that stroll. Saunter? She's obviously in no hurry. Okay, looks like she's finally there now. Now? No, now. There. Several minutes later you can start her walking to her next destination. (Update: Apparently she'll jog if you double click.) Let's see, what else bothered me? Shortly into the game we get to interrogate her landlady in detail about her lesbian lover. That, I'm sure, is pivotal to the plot somehow. When I tried to save the game I would lose my mouse pointer, but luckily I found the enter key worked. I can only exit the game via Task Manager/End Task and when I do, all the font on my desktop reverts to the crappy font from the game.Rhetorical question: Regarding the abysmally low helpful review rating by the community... Is this because the cons I've listed weren't beneficial in helping you decide on a purchase or just because you love this game and can't stand anyone having a differing opinion on it's worth. Perhaps I should go downgrade all of the thumbs-up reviews... Nah, I'm bigger than that.			"

												I can see that this game took an incredible amount of work and I'm sure many of the games themes will appeal to a certain audience but I just couldn't get into it.Apparently this game is one of the longest point and click adventure games of all time. Trust me, I believe it.I like to consider myself a patient person but this game has way too much dialogue for its own good. It's hard for me to stay engaged when conversations go on forever and most of the dialogue is fluff. I'm sure I'd give this game another shot if they just trimmed the fat and focused on more of the core themes of the story.They tried far too hard to make April a normal everyday girl and maybe they have succeeded to an extent. But she doesn't come off as relatable, or heroic, or even interesting, she's just all around bland... and whinny. So, damn, whinny. This wouldn't be so bad if the side characters were interesting. There are a few here and there that are, but not enough to slog through the entire game.I'm sure there are people who would enjoy this game for what it is but I expect my games to engage me on some level, whether conceptually, emotionally, or through raw stimulation. I was patient and kind to this game and was left feeling as if it wasn't worth my time.Not recommended unless you are a die-hard adventure fan.			"

												After playing this I wanted to give it a really bad review. But then I played the 2nd part ""Dreamfall"" and realized that that was way worse... The story is quite interesting but evolves way to slowly. It takes at least 5-6 hours of playing before something remotely interesting happens. It really does pick up at the end, there are some very funny moments, but for my taste it was too little, too late, i already had mostly stopped caring. I am really amazed as to why the game has received so many positive reviews and awards. My tip: play Monkey Island for the 20th time and you still spend your time in a better way. I found this game rather boring over all.			"

												I wanted to like this game, but even with an M-rating I wasn't thrilled with having swearwords used as adjectives. Also, I know it's from the 90s, but the slow pace of the graphics loading meant that I was spending more time waiting for the game to catch up with me then I was actually playing. Some of the puzzles I got to in the hour or so I played just felt illogical. I normally give ""combine these two object"" puzzles a pass in adventure games -- but there were several times when I had no idea what to do because you know, I didn’t pick up the one obscure object back at the starting point that you need like six or seven scenes later? Ugh.There's also the fact that playing on laptop without a dedicated USB mouse means that every time you click to do anything you pull up the inventory. That's just an irksome mechanic that while it started out annoying become bothersome enough for me to stop playing over it. I really did like the idea of the game; and if you're playing on a console or with a dedicated mouse and don't mind swearwords essentially every sequence of dialogue then I'm sure it lives up to all the hype about it I'd read. But, for me, there's better click-and-point adventure games out there where I won't feel obligated to tab through conversations that read like bad locker-room trash talk.Pros+ Interesting storylineCons- Graphical lag- Excessive swearing- illogical puzzles			"

												Overall rating: 5.5/10Game TW: Hardcore sexual harrassment pervasive throughout the gameIn The Longest Journey, the world and culture is more often explained rather than experienced. There's a lot of blah-blah about these people and that culture, but you don't *see* it. Much of the important information you need to know to progress is just dumped on you. There is no pacing and it becomes somewhat overwhelming (there is a conversation log that is helpful).The story itself was interesting enough, but the vast majority of characters are *not* particularly memorable (despite what many appear to claim). In fact, most of them are intolerable. 75% of the male characters are literally the exact same grumpy, horrendously sexist piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ but with a different face. So if you're looking for something deep story-wise, you will be sorely disappointed.I don't even feel like I know the main character. Aside from the very beginning, very little time is spent getting to know April Ryan - every interaction becomes about the main plot or the universe's lore, and we learn about these sexist side characters a lot more than we ever learn about her. There is no meaningful character development. Despite its title there is no emotional journey for April Ryan - she seems to take things in stride pretty well all things considered. The only thing I know for sure is that she is frequently on the receiving end of sexual harassment and/or discrimination.I won't lie. I liked it enough to finish it - and I don't regret playing it (not too much, anyway). But I would definitely *not* recommend it and I would not say it was a good game. If it's on sale REALLY cheap and you have nothing better to play, sure. The puzzles were pretty good - you have to be creative and they were relatively satisfying to solve. I was more interested in what puzzles lay waiting than the progression of the story. Maybe the story was applauded because it was more in-depth and complex than most other games in its time, but I've played better games and read better books.Pros:+ Interesting universe with some fairly intriguing lore+ Some creative puzzles that were pretty satisfying to solveCons:- Boring music (aside from a few standouts almost every track has the same ""subtle"" ominous feel to it)- Boring cast - frequently recycled personalities- Too much exposition- Weak voice acting (had to turn voices off)- Unnecessarily heavy doses of sexism*-- Seriously, can't April get a break?*It served no purpose for me other than to make me despise almost every male character. I don't know if it was trying to be funny or enlightening to the then majority of gamers (men). Would it have been too much to ask that at least the one consistent companion NOT be a sexist♥♥♥♥♥ Apparently it was.			"

												I have nothing against old point-and-click games; in fact, I've played a fair few recently and they're often still really good. This one came about during a love-in with pre-rendered 3D art, before nice art styles became common, so unfortunately it looks very ugly. It's got obtuse puzzles with obscure solutions. tediously slow dialogue, and I had to admit defeat when I came across a game-halting logic bug that stopped me from progressing any further without starting from the beginning again.Some of the writing is good, perhaps progressive for its time, but I can't recommend anything else about it. Also please note, this game is not optimised for widescreen and I had to spend far too long getting it to display at the correct aspect ratio. No, it wasn't worth it.			"

												This game is totally overrated. I don't even know why it was so hit back in 1999. There are classic games still fun to play, like Monkey Island series or Planecape Torment, but this one is definitely not one of them.I heard this game is story rich, but I didn’t like it. I don’t get the concept of divided two worlds.World Stark makes sense, where there are no magic. Because magic is fantasy bullsh!t which isn’t real at all.But Arcadia? The world where people doesn’t believe science? B!tch please, EVERYTHING IS SCIENCE. Science is not just about fancy technology. It’s a method you use to explain every phenomenon that happens in the world. Let’s just say science is just about technology. Where’s the boundary? I saw people in Arcadia treats bike like some kind of abomination, because they don’t like technology thingy at all. But they’re totally OK with boat/Ship. What the hell? So you don't like that the thing with two wheels which carries you when you cycle your legs, but you don't bat an eye when giant wood bowl carries dozens of people through vast ocean?I noticed not everyone in Arcadia can use magic. A lot of people are mundane. It means they can’t just make a ship out of air. There must be a shipyard, where dozens of people works to build ships. To build a ship, they have to do measuring, calculating, cutting, nailing and more measuring. If building a ship is not technology, and I don’t even know what technology is. You can’t separate science technology from human society.Enough with the story, let’s talk about stuff in the game. Backgrounds are disaster. It’s very freakin hard to tell where I can go and which objects are Interactive, even if considering this game is old. Because every god damn thing in this games are all looks rusty and tacky, and camera angle is just awful. Grim Fandango did a better job at this. A little bit of camera switching work would’ve nice, but I guess their budget was too tight. And I'm pretty sure of that because I can see they had to cut down many things in the game.I am not saying this is an utterly bad game. If you like listening old fairy tale, this game is for you. But If they made this game like Planecape Torment, I would’ve much more enjoyed this game.			"

												The Longest Journey is a point-and-click adventure with an amazing story.  This game was made in 1999 but it has a story that can match with some of the better video game stories of today.  Not only that, but this gamealso has the greatest voice acting in a video game that I have ever heard in my life.  The protagonist April is a lovable character, and the voice acting really makes her seem like that she could be a real person.  The game starts out pretty slowly as you learn everything about yourself and the world around you, but it picks up.  Some of the puzzles can be a bit obscure, but it doesn't take away from the story.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys point-and-click games or quality storytelling.			"

												One of my favorite games of all time! You play as April Ryan an art student in the future whos reality is going to radically changewhen the barrier between two worlds starts to collapse.The game is a point and click adventure game, a genre that was very popular during thetime 3d graphics and better computers were seeing the light. The whole genre is thereforelittered with games that used the amazing graphics from 1999 (irony).Therefore you mightbe put off by this games simple and old looking graphics. For those of you who aren't canlook forward to a game with well-written characters, a cozy world and a fantastic story.And if you enjoy it and want more there's a sequel and a another sequel in the making. To round it off this review has been compressed to only contain the most basic you needto know about this game. Partly because it has such a spoiler sensitive storythat might get ruined by too many details. Therefore I leave it up to youto experience it. If you want a cozy game want to take a break from stressful military shooters like CoD or the likes.This Is your go to game.			"

												Ok. So comparing this to a novel is the best example that can be given, and it appears to be a game, but I feel it lacks what games offer  because I didn't feel deeply invested like we should be. There was only one time that it actually felt like something threatening was happening in my whole journey, and it ended all to quickly. The story I think is predictable for people nowadays. However the rich characters are intriguing (and if you have the time talk) and while the dialogue was hard to listen to for me it is very well developed. Give it a go, but remember to keep track with the playing because I forgot a few things after leaving it awhile.The ending seemed to be generic at first, and is debatble to say that, but after everything wraps up  the ending was quite satisfying as I had a smile on my face (so it's still a game, but more a novel). It's worth the a weekend for yourself.			"

												Interestingly enough, The Longest Journey is not the longest game I have ever played. Based on the graphics, the game is evidently from a time when people were shaped like clumps of obtuse shapes. HOWEVER, it is because of this title I realized that I missed out on an entire generation of good games. Emotion is this games weapon of choice. Right from the start the characters are well voiced, authentic, and lovable. Whether it be the vulgarities of a crazed paraplegic, the deviant humor of a talking crow, or young April Ryan's glorious destiny, the game has a connection for everyone.TLJ is art, it is as engaging as a good book, an epic at that, and a stuffed animal that you could never throw away.

A few ridiculous or tedious puzzles, but most aren't TOO bad, amazing characters, and yes, the graphics aren't ""modern"" but I actually think they did OK, especially in the cutscenes.  And of course, plenty of humor, as many characters are sarcastic and there's a few pop culture references as well as inaccurate references to the past (aka modern day for us) that made me smile.			"

												Normally, old school games with low res graphics don't normally interest me. But I got this game free with the collectors edition of Dreamfall ages ago and, being a story completionist, I just had to play it first.It is a fantastic game! True, the graphics are a ""little dated"" to say the least, but the characters are well developed, there's an excellent amount of humour and the story is very deep and meaningful. It's no real surprise it earned such a good Metacritic score; though I would recommend using that only as reference.If ever you see this game in a sale and aren't sure about it, read pretty much any review from anywhere on the web, or just ask someone who's played it, and I guarantee that 90% of the time they will recommend you play it.So what are you waiting for?

												My recommendation for The Longest Journey comes from the perspective of someone who has never played through a point and click adventure game. This game is considered to be a classic in the adventure genre, and I'm sure many would consider it to be an all time great . The aspects of this game that I loved were the art, story, dialogue, voice acting, humor, and music. Be aware that, as I'm guessing is the case with most point and click adventure games, this game is dialogue heavy and focuses on the story. The Longest Journey first came out in 1999 so some graphical aspects of the game are dated, like the 3D characters (which move around on a 2D background). You cannot die in this game and you cannot become permanently stuck, but it can definitely be challenging. I had no hesitation in looking at a walkthrough to help me out when I was stuck. Most of the puzzle challenges are workable if you are persistent. The final item I would reiterated is that the story is very deep and well written			"

												I have somewhat mixed feelings about this game.  It was perhaps the most epic, involved, creative, and intelligent story I've come across in a game.  At the same time the writing and voice-acting are uneven across the entirety of the game.  Some clever humor is appreciated, but it too often strayed into just plain corny and bad.  The voice-acting was not very convincing on the whole, kept afloat only by the smart dialogue.  The puzzles were good overall, but at times quite inane and illogical.  Some of the solutions just weren't logical and I don't know how anybody would have figured them out on their own.  Also keep in mind that this game is nearly 15 years old.  The graphics may have been good when the game was originally released and some of the environments are nice, but by today's standards, the graphics are extremely poor.  The characters are at times gruesome looking regardless of how long ago they were produced.  Overall though, it's a classic point-and-click adventure that is worth your time if only for one of the most epic stories ever told in videogaming.			"

A couple of the puzzles had solutions that were way too convoluted. Story and writing's alright; nothing especially good.

												This was one of the first PC games I brought and still probably one of my favorite games. While I haven't played it much on Steam I've played it multiple times before. While the graphics are a bit dated now, the story and world of the game is great. This game also has a wonderful soundtrack.This is the first in a series of games that continue with Dreamfall: The Longest Journey and Dreamfall Chapters.			"

												This is a huge game and quite difficult but worth the perseverence because it it very intense. You must not miss anything out so it can be frustrating at times when you miss picking something up or do something out of sequence and have to go back. Make sure you save your game plenty of times. A walkthrough is needed to assist players like me who need clues and a guide. Unfortunately there is far too much dialogue which gets a bit repetative in my opinion. I started getting rather disinterested in the ""Balance"" and it's motives towards the end. There are some really spectacular graphics in the scenes to visit. This is a point and click game for those like me who prefer. It's a game not to be missed, well worth the price.The Longest Journey was quite thought provoking about a future world good and bad. Maybe a bit scary but it sucked me in to being totally addicted to playing it. I actually felt quite deflated when it finished.			"

												In my opinion, this is one of the best point-and-click adventures ever made. It is rich with story, with a kickass protagonist and a bad-mouthed companion. It's funny, shocking, and really quite long (4CD's back in the day). You'll get lost in this wonderful world, whether you're jumping in garbage trucks to get into buildings, or attempting to talk with Merpeople. It really is a spectacle.			"

												An amazing classic. The graphics are dated for 2015/2016, but the story is absoutely amazing. Dynamic, fair voice acting, and a steal for the price. This game combines narritive and puzzle solving to keep you occupied rather than subjecting you to endless combat - so if that's your thing you might look elsewhere. If you want an interactive and detailed story without the grind of gearing a character or leveling up - here's your game!			"

												Late 90s point-and-click adventure. Not bad at all. Manages to avoid ""moon logic""-type puzzles (either that or my brain is broken). The only exception I found was due to a graphical issue preventing me from seeing an object.Note: doesn't run 100% nicely on modern hardware. I found that you need to run it in a window with software rendering, otherwise the background and various important bits of scenery don't update properly unless you walk in front of them. "

												[Very emotional review ahead!]I have played The Longest Journey three times already -- once when I was barely a teen, once after getting into college and the last time two weeks ago. And I would play it a fourth time! Can't hurt to get some Balance in your life sometimes. ;)It's a story unlike any other. The protagonist, April, is an unconventional hero; everyday girl but still not exactly what we, or she, expect her to be, to grow into. As her adventures went on, the story took such unexpected turns sometimes that I just had to put my laptop to the side and scream out loud! It's one of those point-and-click adventure games where I just want to explore every little detail, examine the smallest object to get some more funny and/or insightful little tidbit from the heroine's mind.Yes, the graphics are rather old, and sometimes running around between scenes gets a bit tedious. But it's all so very worth it for the story, for the overall experience.I think the TLJ series will forever be my favourite.			"

												Excellent Point and click adventure! Ties things up and yet the sequal still adds to the storyline.You play the role of an art student. One day things start happening and you end up in another world. You find out that there are two worlds Stark (our earth) and Arcadia (a magical non technological world). Every few thousand years a person is chosen to make sure the balance between the worlds stays the same. The current person ends up missing. This is where you come in. As you travel between both worlds looking for the current guardian you find out about yourself and your destiny.This is a LONG game. The tittle is not kidding. The game has numerious locations with lots of side characters. When this game was released it won multiple awards for being one of the best point and click games created.If you are a storyline style person, this is definitely the game for you. The graphics definitely show its age but the story is very captivating. In fact the story was so good that they made a sequel back in 2006 and a sequel to that one in 2014.			"

												7 out of 10I played TLJ2 Dreamfall a long time before (I didn't know it was a sequel), and although I forgot everything about the plot, I remember I really liked it so I wanted to replay the game when I learned that Chapters was already finished. I decided to play TLJ1 first. Kinda regretting it, but I'd still play this game if I were to make the choice again.Waaaaaaaay too many slow, expositions of dialogues that made me want to pull my hair out, and at times I felt I was forcing myself through the game when it got to those long, never-ending dialogues. Everyone was so long-winded I wanted to scream at them. But, I am not one to skip dialogue/scenes, so I always want to make sure I squeeze out every answer for every available question. Since I don't like to cheat with the walkthroughs unless I'm stuck, that part on that Alatian Island or something was excrutiating to say the least. In terms of character development, April, the MC, was at times very annoying, but other times ok or bordering likeable. I liked Crow, however. Overall April and Crow did make me laugh a few times, so out of the painful monologues there were a few gem lines here and there. At least the characters themselves sometimes acknowledge that other characters sounded corny and fake as hell.Voice acting - uh. Sometimes they just got on my nerves, sorry. The villains especially...so typical, those villainy voices. Anyhow I was not impressed but voice acting is not a deal-breaker for me considering I played FFX and still really liked it.The good thing about the game was naturally the mystery solving and adventuring parts - they were fun, and some were not very obvious so I had to look up walkthroughs. Would have liked more of those as opposed to monologs, but thankfully I remember Dreamfall was a vast improvement. I didn't have high expectations about the adventuring part, since it was a fairly old game.I won't say anything about how the game looked, because again it's an old game so my expectations were low. Needless to say I'm looking forward to healing my eyes somewhat when I replay Dreamfall.In terms of plot, I didn't really like the whole deal with the destiny/prophecy cliches - those were too convenient and my brain does not really like those plot devices. Overall, however, the game was a decent journey. Would have liked more wrapping up at the end, but meh I guess I'll just play Dreamfall to refresh on what happens after that.  All I remember from Dreamfall was this little creepy girl telling the MC to save April Ryan, and that I thought April was a b*tchAll in all I can only say I'm neutral about this game. Since this is where it all starts, I still think this is probably a must-play if you're like me and you have this OCD about story completeness and you have a compulsion to play every game in a series and play them in order.

												Alright Buckle Up kidlets.TL:DR ----This game is the game you wanna get if you are willing to be chokeholded and dragged through a rich and deep story driven game.I sat down and spent 13.5 hours playing this game from start to finish. Binged it. All day.I highly recommend this game.-Onto the meat-To be honest I did not know what to expect. Especially when I played Dreamfall: The Longest Journey first before playing this one. I didnt even know it was part of a series to recently. As soon as it went on sale in stea, it was the best decision ever to buy it.Playing the second game first doesnt spoil much. But you will be like ""Ohhhh"" with some places and remember. Which was what happened to me throughout the game.I did love playing this game very much so. Some parts you will get stuck and cannot figure out what to do. But paying close attention to absolutely  everything is the key. I know some might phase out after a while.But I do reccommend you play this in one sitting whilst everything is still fresh in your mind so do not forget places or what you need to do.Always check your diary, It is your best friend.Other than that. I highly reccommend this game to anyone and everyone. Well worth the money and well worth the time!!			"

												After a MAD love affair with this game one snowy weekend in college, I picked it up in a steam sale a while ago, and let it sit on the ""to do"" list until this snowy week.This game is SUPERB! I put it off because all I really remembered was that it's a committment- you really should play it start to finish, because if you put it down for a few days you may not remember what the hell you were doing.  BUT, the story is good enough to keep wanting to roll with it once you get going.If you're a very casual gamer like I am, I do suggest you play it with a walkthrough- even guided step by step this one takes a while. Graphically, the scenery is gorgeous! Enjoy the ride!!			"

												One of the best point and click adventure games of it's time, and in most ways it still is one of the best these days. For a title almost 15 years old, some elements of course  have become dated - the pre-rendered cutscenes are a clean giveaway - but Ragnar Tornquist's ability for story telling more than makes up for this. He created a universe of two worlds where The Longest Journey tells a great story and lays the groundwork for further developments. Dreamfall neatly expands on this and as of Q4 2012 it is clear that he will work on continuing the story in Dreamfall Chapters. If you are a fan of adventure games and you can appreciate a good story development I would recommend The Longest Journey. It's a great game in and of itself and if you have become involved into the world and characyers, you can continue your experience in the sequels.			"

												PROS: Unique story, lovable characters, tons of worldbuildingCONS: Dated graphics, buggy features, obscure puzzlesOVERALL SCORE: 9/10The Longest Journey is a classic game, and I think it absolutely deserves to be remembered throughout video game history. It's a monumental game, and one I can't recommend enough that people play.The best thing about The Longest Journey is, hands down, its story. You play April Ryan, and young art student who's just found out she's a ""shifter"" - a chosen one who has to maintain the balance between two worlds - Arcadia, a world of magic, and Stark, a world of technology. Both worlds are rich in lore and fascinating to explore, and the characters you explore with are witty and charming. There's never a dull moment in The Longest Journey. I think my favorite things about the game is the way it breaks stereotypes. Not just in our protagonist, considering female protagonists were very rare at that time, but the twist at the end. The subversion of the ""chosen one"" trope so frequent in fantasy stories was really awesome to me, even though it was heartbreaking in execution. The ending to the game broke my heart, I'd grown so close to April and her sidekick, Crow, that seeing them both suffer disappointment made me so sad. It was an amazing feeling to connect with characters like that, and one reason I'll always recommend The Longest Journey.One thing to remember about The Longest Journey is that it was released in 1999. It's a seventeen year old game, as of writing. But it still warrants saying... the graphics didn't age well. The backgrounds actually still look really pretty, but the characters look really blocky and low-res. For people who are used to realistic, high res textures, it can be jarring. Still, it's worth it to try to appreciate this game for what it was at the time of its release. Along with the graphics, another product of its age is the bugs. I didn't encounter a ton, but the ones I did were frustrating. There was a particular issue with saving and loading saves that I kept having, I couldn't overwrite a save spot and I couldn't load a save while playing, without the game crashing. Thankfully, that was the only major one I encountered, and I was able to play through the whole game without too many problems as long as I didn't mess with saving too much.Outside of the age, my other complaint was a pretty typical one for adventure games - some of the puzzles just don't make sense. Here's looking at you, rubber ducky. There were some really great puzzles in The Longest Journey, but I found it got bogged down by what I can only describe as video game logic. You basically have to scour environments for random objects just because. It doesn't make sense in the actual game's logic, we just do it because we know we'll need that random piece of chewing gum later down the line. However, frustrating puzzles aside, this game is truly great. Experience the story for yourself. Honestly, this whole trilogy is great and definitely worth playing.			"

												A compelling story about interesting characters that is stuck in a very unfortunate UI. This game came out nearly 15 years ago at the time of this writing, and it's definitely showing its age. Regardless of the controls, it's still worth it for the story and the ability to know what's going on when playing the sequel(s), which are also good games. This is also a classic point-and-click adventure game, which means WALKTHROUGHS! A lot of the puzzles make no sense, and I am unashamed to have played with a full guide open on my second monitor. So yeah. Good story, gameplay was a bit lacking. Overall a solid 7ish out of 10. Worth it for $10!			"

												TLJ is an asthonishing blend of sci-fi and fantasy that flows on a linear progression, sans most point and click adventure games, but the pacing is smooth and you'll never be stuck in a single area for long periods of time. The story itself can be really intense at times and for the most part doesn't give in to jarring plot conveniences. The writing, brainchild of Ragnar Tornquist, is great as well. Usually protagonists, or characters in general, can be two extremes: really swell, or really annoying. If they fall inbetween they are bland. Tornquist's writing makes protagonist April Ryan annoyingly believable. Her mannerisms will constantly remind you that she's just a college student and not someone fit to save two worlds.Spec-wise, the game came out in '99, and to my knowledge there are no HD mods or anything, and if this bothers you, start to notice the scenery more. The backgrounds in this game are gorgeous and they really amplify the atmosphere. The gameplay has some good puzzles. They aren't very hard, but they do the job. Also you can't die. To me this is a safer approach than other pointnclicks like Sierra games where you are punished for not knowing what was ahead of you ahead of time and it doesn't create anxiety for the sake of defibrilatting action into otherwise bland gameplay like The Walking Dead. If you like sci-fi or fantasy this is a game to check out, if you find it on sale that is. I really enjoyed it.			"

												Although originally released 12 years ago, the Longest Journey is an excellent point-and-click adventure game that has withstood the test of time--if you can ignore how laughable the graphics can be occasionally! It's definitely worth a look-in if you like point-and-click games, and if you enjoy this one, there's a sequel, Dreamfall, to keep you occupied for a few more hours.			"

												One of my favorite games of all time! You play as April Ryan an art student in the future whos reality is going to radically changewhen the barrier between two worlds starts to collapse.The game is a point and click adventure game, a genre that was very popular during thetime 3d graphics and better computers were seeing the light. The whole genre is thereforelittered with games that used the amazing graphics from 1999 (irony).Therefore you mightbe put off by this games simple and old looking graphics. For those of you who aren't canlook forward to a game with well-written characters, a cozy world and a fantastic story.And if you enjoy it and want more there's a sequel and a another sequel in the making. To round it off this review has been compressed to only contain the most basic you needto know about this game. Partly because it has such a spoiler sensitive storythat might get ruined by too many details. Therefore I leave it up to youto experience it. If you want a cozy game want to take a break from stressful military shooters like CoD or the likes.This Is your go to game.			"

												Ok. So comparing this to a novel is the best example that can be given, and it appears to be a game, but I feel it lacks what games offer  because I didn't feel deeply invested like we should be. There was only one time that it actually felt like something threatening was happening in my whole journey, and it ended all to quickly. The story I think is predictable for people nowadays. However the rich characters are intriguing (and if you have the time talk) and while the dialogue was hard to listen to for me it is very well developed. Give it a go, but remember to keep track with the playing because I forgot a few things after leaving it awhile.The ending seemed to be generic at first, and is debatble to say that, but after everything wraps up  the ending was quite satisfying as I had a smile on my face (so it's still a game, but more a novel). It's worth the a weekend for yourself.			"

												This is perhaps one of the best 'old-school' 2D point and click adventure games, good enough to rival Monkey Island or other classic Lucas Arts titles.Big strengths include the story, characters, full voice-acting, and great music.  The story is good enough to be continued, years later, in the sequels Dreamfall (and now Dreamfall Chapters).  Some of the puzzles are a little random, though by old school adventure game standards they aren't TOO hard (easier than Myst IMO).  The game is LONG but doesn't feel drawn out.Graphics would feel very dated when put next to more modern titles, and game pace would feel a little slow for those more used to the instant gratification of some new releases - not that this should necessarily be a problem for fans of old-school adventure games.

												[Very emotional review ahead!]I have played The Longest Journey three times already -- once when I was barely a teen, once after getting into college and the last time two weeks ago. And I would play it a fourth time! Can't hurt to get some Balance in your life sometimes. ;)It's a story unlike any other. The protagonist, April, is an unconventional hero; everyday girl but still not exactly what we, or she, expect her to be, to grow into. As her adventures went on, the story took such unexpected turns sometimes that I just had to put my laptop to the side and scream out loud! It's one of those point-and-click adventure games where I just want to explore every little detail, examine the smallest object to get some more funny and/or insightful little tidbit from the heroine's mind.Yes, the graphics are rather old, and sometimes running around between scenes gets a bit tedious. But it's all so very worth it for the story, for the overall experience.I think the TLJ series will forever be my favourite.			"

												The Longest Journey is an epic masterpiece that has the bad luck of being made in the era where everything had to be 3D, although there was no decent 3D around (remember the first Tomb Raider parts, do you?). Nevertheless, the story is fantastic, the gameplay smooth and the ideas simply breathtaking. You definitely get a lot for your money here, and I'm talking both quality and (time-)quantity. MINOR SPOILER (That's pretty much already shown in the screenshots):I like the contrast between the cyberpunkish Stark and the fantasy Arcadia very much as well as everything that spans the gap (like certain organisations) between both. Arcadia offers a fresh new perspective on fantasy creatures and radiates that feeling that there's always more to explore, which is what a fantasy world should do.			"

												It's been called one of the best adventure games of all time, and with good reason.  Compelling story, good visuals for its time, and puzzles that are challenging but not nearly as obtuse as other adventure games'.  The story is a fairly traditional fantasy one with some cyberpunkish sci fi thrown in, but it lays out a really fun world to visit for a while.  (Its sequel, Dreamfall, improves on the ongoing story by moving into less traditional territory, in my opinion.)  If you can get past its very outdated visuals, you'll probably find yourself sucked into it on the merits of its story within an hour.			"

												It's been almost 15 years since The Longest Journey came out, and ever since I first demo'd it on Steam I'd always meant to play it through. I'm glad I finally got the chance.Although it hasn't aged well since it's release, the small development team created their own engine for this project and I completely appreciate the effort put into it. The game might be a bit rough around the edges (some voice acting/ dialogue and most cutscenes) but it's still a good point-and-click adventure.The Longest Journey provides you with some excellent voice acting, mostly for the main protagonist, funny dialogue, and some good in-depth characters early on in the game. You really get a good sense of the characters within the first few hours of game play- which may be slow. Most of this detail can be missed as it is optional, yet being able to avoid lengthy dialogue for your second play through will probably be a positive. There are some quick-time-esque moments that spiced things up nicely in a game consisting of try-every-item-on-this-thing-to-see-if-it-works.If you can forgive some choppy cutscenes, and poor graphics- make the purchase for a good point-and-click game with funny dialogue and clever puzzles. Overall pretty happy with the experience, considering what I paid for.			"

												There is no false advertising here - this game is long and it's one heck of a journey. The story bridges two worlds - a sci-fi dystopia and a fantasy world full of strange magical creatures. It's rare to find a story that manages to incorporate dragons and hovercraft, castles and spacestations and the game manages to do it almost seamlessly. The characters are believable with realistic motivations for the most part, and the voice acting (and almost everything is voiced - which is a rare treat for such an old game) is very good quality. It is easy to get frustrated with the pace of the game, however. Several people I know gave up after the first few chapters, and I almost fell into that trap, but it's well worth persevering through the endless *walking* (even with double-click or Escape to make her run, the protagonist seems agonisingly slow sometimes) and the extremely linear puzzles which sometimes have the oddest and most unlikely solutions. If you get too frustrated, as I did at some points, don't feel too guilty about doing a little cheating. It's worth a little shameless googling sometimes to get on with the story. The ending is a little abrupt, and I felt that I was wishing for something more, but maybe it's just because I missed talking to Charlie one last time! (Charlieeeee!)			"

												92/100 - Though it was a  long journey, I really enjoyed playing this game. The characters, story, and setting are memorable, enjoyable, unique, and life like. Though it is an old style point and click adventure game and the graphics are dated, the puzzles never felt to be too hard or impossible to solve. If the longest journey was a book, it would be the kind where you're reading but after a little bit the words melt away. You're still reading, only you see the entire story in your mind like you're watching a movie, and you will quickly loose track of time as when you next look at the clock hours will have passed. That's not to say that the game is without its flaws - a few npc characters have foul mouths and other elements. However, story and character wise it doesn't get much better or real than this game. It may not be for everyone but I enjoyed it to say the least.			"

												An excellent game. I honestly cant recall why I purchased this game and got it to begin with. I believe I was on an adventure storyline games high and this was highly rated. The characters are very well rounded, and even though the 3d characters are VERY dated in appearance, you easily get past that after playing and getting pulled into the story. The best friend you can have when playing this game is to set in options the use of ""ESC"" key to speed things along. Sometimes it can take April a long time to walk to places, and though the dialogue is interesting... some of the characters can be quiet long winded. So read ahead of them and use ESC if that bothers you. Play the game, once you get past the first chapter you will be hooked. Point, click and inspect everything, sooner or later you will use everything in your posession.			"

												This is simply a fantastic game. Great characters, plot and some funny moments and dialogue thrown in. There are some quite challenging puzzles in it and lots of things to interact with. Sure, the graphics aren't spectacular, but, this game was made about 15 years ago (1999, in fact) and has pretty good graphics for its time. Its been rated excellent by critics and they certainly aren't wrong about that. If there's one game you should play, its this one. I rate this one a 9/10.			"

												Normally, old school games with low res graphics don't normally interest me. But I got this game free with the collectors edition of Dreamfall ages ago and, being a story completionist, I just had to play it first.It is a fantastic game! True, the graphics are a ""little dated"" to say the least, but the characters are well developed, there's an excellent amount of humour and the story is very deep and meaningful. It's no real surprise it earned such a good Metacritic score; though I would recommend using that only as reference.If ever you see this game in a sale and aren't sure about it, read pretty much any review from anywhere on the web, or just ask someone who's played it, and I guarantee that 90% of the time they will recommend you play it.So what are you waiting for?

												This is by far one of the greatest games I've every played, and when you couple it together with dreamfall, it creates a story so immersive that even after the hours upon hours it took to figure out that you do actually need that rubber duck you fished out of your aparment window after all, you still fall head over heels for the game. As far as gameplay goes, this is your typical point-and-click experience - youve got an inventory filled of stuff (some f it you never even use) and you can use those to solve puzzles. But if gameplay is all you really look for in a game, this isn't for you. The Longest Journey is strictly about story and navigating through the world as the charming and resourceful April Ryan.All in all, I highly recomend this game. It has a story you can't help but become immersed in, fantastic characters, and an origional concept with a very interesting backstory.			"

												The Longest Journey is an epic point and click adventure puzzle game. With witty characters and some unique settings it definitely was a major game of its time. Rest assured, while the graphics are massively outdated it is a game than really can stand on story alone and can be replayed over and over too. There are however some system issues with it being an old game and all, but thanks to the games popularity there is plenty of support to be found on the internet and steams version seems to have reworked some bugs that used to come with the disc version. I'm currently on my second playthrough (first on steam) and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. In terms of point and click adventure games, its in a league of its own and there is simply no beating it.			"

												I was fortunate enough to have this game gifted to me by a fellow point-and-click enthusiast, and I was really happy to have a chance to play it. I remember playing Sierra's Torrin's Passage when I was a child, and this game hit me with an extra large dose of nostalgia. When it comes to point-and-clickers, The Longest Journey dominates the field and is a classic staple that all people interested in the genre should definitely check out.If you like point-and-clickers, expansive storylines, and challenging puzzles, then you will really enjoy this game.The aesthetics are good, but the graphics are very, very dated. Despite this, the environment and the examinable items (in your inventory) remain well-detailed.The character models are a bit lacking, and this is most evident during cutscenes. The music and ambient sounds are approporiate for the themes presented throughout the game, The story is slightly convulted, but also fairly easy to follow if you take the time to read/listen to the dialogue. Your character records her thoughts in a diary, and these can be helpful for summarizing key details and better understanding the story. Each interactable character provides a good amount of backstory and lore. The voice acting is great, but I personally find the main character's voice a bit irritating.The controls are simple and typical of a pount-and-clicker. There is no tutorial - you are simply dropped into the game, however, it is easy to pick up how to play if you experiment for a few minutes. The learning curve id minimal to moderate - the most difficult thing so far being item combinations (a number of the possible item combos are not obvious). I've also picked up A LOT of items, but their value and use have not yet been determined in my playthough. The game and story are very cool - the main theme centralizes around two worlds (the magic and non-magic worlds) that can be traversed through ""shifting,"" or moving through portals. At the end of each chapter, you are usually presented with a choice of two options, each potentially moving the story in a different direction. Much of the game involves you combining items and giving them to people, or using them to get more items. You can also ""look"" at certain items in your inventory, and experimenting with clicks on different areas may yield a new item added to your stash. You can press ""x"" to show all the exits in an area, and this is useful if you don't want to scan with your mouse for different exit points. There is a metro train system, where you can travel to other unlocked areas freely.Overall, this game provides a very good point-and-click experience, and I suggest you give it a try if you are interested in that particular type of gameplay. The story is well-written and pretty expansive, so you will be spending a lot of time reading/listening to dialogue (all skippable).Recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												I'm really enjoying this adventure so far, and I understand why it is considered one of the best of its genre even after all these years. My only minor complaint has to be for a glitch involving the order in which some specific items (clamp, inflatable duck and clothesline) have to be combined if you don't want to get stuck and be forced to start from a previous save file or start all over again, but with such a great story I shall just turn a blind eye on that. :)			"

												The Longest Journey was an old game when I first played it and that was probably about 6 or 7 years ago. Then and now the graphics don't hold up terribly well, but considering that it was launched in 2000 I'd say it's not that bad. However even now the voice acting, story and dialogue are still fantastic after all this time and it's in these areas that Longest Journey truly shines. Like a good book you can't put down, I was sucked into the story immediately and hardly noticed the time passing until looking at the clock to see that it was the middle of the night. The themes are mature and intelligent, the dialogue extremely well crafted, and the characters believable. I almost feel like I need to exhaust all dialogue options because I want experience all of it and to see what the characters say and do in each situation.It still has faults in the same way that point and click games usually do - the solution for the puzzles are sometimes opaque, or sometimes you know what you need to do but you're pixel-hunting to find where exactly you're supposed to click - but these are problems with the genre and not this particular game. However, there are relatively few of these genre-related problems given how long ago this game was launched.The one glaring problem that may make this game unplayable for some people is the graphics - if you can't stand fairly blocky character models and low-res textures then this may not be the game for you (just check out the screenshots on the store page to get a good idea). Out of all the re-make games coming out, this is a game that deserves an HD remake. Once you look past the aging graphics however, you will be transported to an incredibly detailed world with an inventive mixture of fantasy and sci-fi in this excellent story.9.5/10			"

This game came out nearly 15 years ago at the time of this writing, and it's definitely showing its age. Regardless of the controls, it's still worth it for the story and the ability to know what's going on when playing the sequel(s), which are also good games. This is also a classic point-and-click adventure game, which means WALKTHROUGHS! A lot of the puzzles make no sense, and I am unashamed to have played with a full guide open on my second monitor.

I went into this game expecting it to not really be my thing or all that enjoyable, and I really couldn't have been more wrong.Granted, it's not completely perfect. It's dated, for one thing. You can run it in a windowed mode, but unfortunately there's no option to increase the resolution.There were some parts in the game that lacked a sense of direction, I found myself getting frustratingly stuck at least a handful of times.Still, it was all worth it for such a fantastic title.

If you're familiar with any other point-and-click adventures like Nancy Drew or Sam and Max, this interface will suit you perfectly. The game-play is simple, though you sometimes have to resort to clicking through every item in your inventory to figure out what the heck works. The dialogues can go on for some time, but each weaves one more piece of the fantastic story into place. Highly recommended for fans of the adventure genre.			"

												The Longest Journey is a classical type of point and click adventure, much for the better rather than worse - if with one or two of the usual foibles of the genre. The storyline is highly enjoyable, taking place in two quite different but intertwined worlds; complete with a strong female lead character and many memorable supporting characters. The Longest Journey conveys the feeling of exploring the fantastic and mysterious well, in addition to offering several thrilling situations.I feel the largest stumbling block is found in chapter 7, where a crystal puzzle has too many options that could have been correct based on the hints that are provided. If need be further hints can be found here though, http://www.uhs-hints.com/uhsweb/hints/tlj/1875-2.php without giving away the entire solution or spoiling the enjoyment of the game.			"

												An amazing classic. The graphics are dated for 2015/2016, but the story is absoutely amazing. Dynamic, fair voice acting, and a steal for the price. This game combines narritive and puzzle solving to keep you occupied rather than subjecting you to endless combat - so if that's your thing you might look elsewhere. If you want an interactive and detailed story without the grind of gearing a character or leveling up - here's your game!			"

												As a Point&Click fan, why didn't I play this game sooner? I had it for quite a long time in my library and din't try it. As I like games ""à la Telltale and Life is Strange"", I wanted to try Dreamfall Chapters but waited for sales to buy it. As it was in Humble Bundle I eventually got it, but I wanted to play the 2 previous game to understand the story.So I finally got to play The Longest Journey, and I saw that it was a mistake not playing it earlier. The graphics are atrocious on a new computer though. But if you can go through that, this game is amazing. The story is fascinating and the characters lovable. Some puzzles are quite difficult, but nothing impossible for the old Point&Click players. One of the best game of this genre out there.			"

												This is a huge game and quite difficult but worth the perseverence because it it very intense. You must not miss anything out so it can be frustrating at times when you miss picking something up or do something out of sequence and have to go back. Make sure you save your game plenty of times. A walkthrough is needed to assist players like me who need clues and a guide. Unfortunately there is far too much dialogue which gets a bit repetative in my opinion. I started getting rather disinterested in the ""Balance"" and it's motives towards the end. There are some really spectacular graphics in the scenes to visit. This is a point and click game for those like me who prefer. It's a game not to be missed, well worth the price.The Longest Journey was quite thought provoking about a future world good and bad. Maybe a bit scary but it sucked me in to being totally addicted to playing it. I actually felt quite deflated when it finished.			"

												Long ago I was bored and I went to Walmart to find a game to play.  There wasn't a large selection, and I was about to try Deus EX when I saw The Longest Journey behind it.  I had never heard anything about it, but it looked more interesting than Deus Ex.  Longest Journey turned out to be one of the best investments in gaming I ever made.  Great Story, great voice actors, VERY long,  I enjoyed every minute of it, and I still wonder about the fates of some of the characters April met during her journey.    One of my favorite lines comes from this game.  At the docks in Acadia, April looks at the blue flames on towers around the harbor and says:  ""It is either propane or magic, and I'm betting it isn't propane.""  There are some who object to the language in this game, but I don't think it is out of place.  The scene with the intercom in the warehouse district is the worst part of it, and it is a hilarious scene:  A speaker blaring obscenities in an echoing environment.The graphics are adequate to the task for the most part; it's the dialogue that counts.  They say that the English speaking girl who voices April Ryan is good, but the girl in the French version is even better.  Makes me wish I knew French.   I would like to hear the French version of ""Screw you, Jerry."" - April's response to a stickler for details, delivered with her characteristically sweet voice.			"

												What can I say about The Longest Journey, If you can stand the retro graphics and gameplay, and sometimes illogical solutions to puzzles (I used the guide a fair bit). If you can get past all that, the story is amazing, I bought this after purchasing Dreamfall chapters and realising it was a third sequel, btw if your going to play chapters you need to have played this. It is completly work playing, excellent characters, imaginative locations, and a really furfilling and in depth story. PLAY IT!			"

												A fantastic point and click adventure with a very memorable protagonist. The voice acting, especially for the protagonist April Ryan, is wonderful and adds to the immersion. Most of the puzzles are great, though there's the occasional esoteric one that may require a look-up. I played this game for the first time in 2008 and loved it, and just replayed it in 2016 and loved it again. If you can handle old school 3D graphics it's still well worth your time even decades after release.Highly recommended for anyone who wants to experience an adventure with a heavy focus on story and characters.

												An excellent game. I honestly cant recall why I purchased this game and got it to begin with. I believe I was on an adventure storyline games high and this was highly rated. The characters are very well rounded, and even though the 3d characters are VERY dated in appearance, you easily get past that after playing and getting pulled into the story. The best friend you can have when playing this game is to set in options the use of ""ESC"" key to speed things along. Sometimes it can take April a long time to walk to places, and though the dialogue is interesting... some of the characters can be quiet long winded. So read ahead of them and use ESC if that bothers you. Play the game, once you get past the first chapter you will be hooked. Point, click and inspect everything, sooner or later you will use everything in your posession.			"

												There is no false advertising here - this game is long and it's one heck of a journey. The story bridges two worlds - a sci-fi dystopia and a fantasy world full of strange magical creatures. It's rare to find a story that manages to incorporate dragons and hovercraft, castles and spacestations and the game manages to do it almost seamlessly. The characters are believable with realistic motivations for the most part, and the voice acting (and almost everything is voiced - which is a rare treat for such an old game) is very good quality. It is easy to get frustrated with the pace of the game, however. Several people I know gave up after the first few chapters, and I almost fell into that trap, but it's well worth persevering through the endless *walking* (even with double-click or Escape to make her run, the protagonist seems agonisingly slow sometimes) and the extremely linear puzzles which sometimes have the oddest and most unlikely solutions. If you get too frustrated, as I did at some points, don't feel too guilty about doing a little cheating. It's worth a little shameless googling sometimes to get on with the story. The ending is a little abrupt, and I felt that I was wishing for something more, but maybe it's just because I missed talking to Charlie one last time! (Charlieeeee!)			"

I was totally engrossed with the story, the lore, the artwork, the sound track and the sheer amazing mature story book aspect of the game. This is the most creative game I have ever played and one of the most enjoyable story lines and characters ever. Even if you cant stand point and click games BUY THIS GAME. And when your done, buy Dreamfall the longest journey too, it is almost as enjoyable and has a more action packed sytem to it!10/10 "

Ever since, it serves as a beacon of hope that I shall find another adventure game that can live up to this perfect standard of adventure games! The story, voice actors, enviroments, puzzles.. The only flaw I can find (and that's based on adventure games today) is that it's on a rail, basically. You can't screw up. You solve the puzzle, you progress.			"

												Do you like click adventures? This should be in your collection!The story is long, but not tedious. The game never gets too hard figuring out what to do. Except for the part where you need to get an item on the tub tracks. Hint: DuckThe main character is witty yet realistic, arty and girly, yet brave. Or maybe not brave, but determined.There are quite a few characters to interact with, all voiced.Personally I like the sci-fi future setting, but she also gets drawn to a place where magic is alive - this is good for varation!

												This game is a bt old. But in my view it has aged well. For a point and click that is. The characters are funny and memorable, the voice acting is great. The puzzles. I'm not very smart with puzzles. So it took me a LONG TIME to get some of them, I eventually cheated because I wanted more story and less thinking.I'd aboslutely reccomend the TLJ series. This game alone was worthwhile and with the release of dreamfalls and dreamfall chapters, I'm litterally checking the dev's blog once a week for new updates on the release of the latest epsiode. 10/10 excelent narrative, not like that life is strange horse manuer.

												Pros:* great story* good level of difficulty on the quests (both difficult and easy quests) * quite easy to controll the caracters for people that have not played much computergames* great characters* loving the map that ""takes"" you around so you dont have to run a round like a maniac doing nothing (this is extreamly annoing in ""Dreamfall: The longest journey"". Cons:* some scenes are extremly annoying. Like in the library in arcadia one has to wait for the librarian to get books for you. I actually prepared food inbetween him getting out the books for me. * sometimes you click on stuff and the game does not respond as its supposed to, if you go in a different angle it works. But i used some walktroug finding out that I actully did the correct move, but somehow it did not work the first time I did it. This is my favorite game! I played in one time when it got out and resently played it again 10 years after, and I found it just as good as I recalled it, I would say thats impressive considering how old it is!			"

												I really loved this game. The world and story are absorbing and the game is a lot of fun to play. Some of the puzzles are... well, there's a bit of moon logic involved, and unless you stumble upon the right thing to do at random you won't find the answer. There are only a couple of puzzles like this, though; for the most part everything makes sense. The graphics are a bit dated, but that's to be expected, and everything runs okay on my Windows 10 (though you have to use the Y and N keys in a couple of the popup menus because they don't render correctly).

TLJ, a pleasant odessey...I landed on this game because I wanted to play what originated the story from Dreamfall Chapters, and while this is a 1999 game, I was very very pleased. Like they say, they don't make stuff to last like before nowadays!GraphicsWell, this is a game from 1999, so forget about it, you cannot play this game expecting HD textures, expect Nintendo 64-like graphics at its best, with old Diablo-like cutscenes, nor there are any mods to that I could find to help with this, this is most unimportant anyway, since the true treasure of this game lies elsewhere. However, I do find appealing all the drawn scenarios, thinking of all the work that went through the creation of this game to make all the world, I absolutely love it. Also, just as me, you'll probably have find issues with the graphics, with 3D models looking incomplete, this can be easily fixed by following the instruction in THIS thread, easy peesy! The music and sound effects used always suits the areas you find yourself in, although only in some very specific ocasions I found the music to be of special notice, it was just pretty much suitable, makes you feel in the right ambient.The StoryThat is truly the point of this really, no? What is a point-and-click adventure game without its story. I must say, I had some expectations and they were fullfilled, I deeply enjoyed the story in this game. I won't go on the details, for what I love of the story is to be able to discover it as you progress, every little piece of it, and I won't take that away from you. Mind you, there is something you should know, this game is young adult-oriented, so be warned about the content you might expect to find in the dialogues. That said, if you have lots of crops on your sense of humor field, this game will certainly make you harvest them all, the characters are quite hilarious, sarcasm is the everyday bread, and witty verbal knives fly here and there. Even when it wants you to feel omnious, it keeps making you chuckle.This game makes you love its characters, so you are more inclined to care about the story has a whole. And the voice acting...is truly grandious. This is how I like my stories told to me. My favorite character without doubt was Crow, it is are amazing. And man, this had gotten me 20h to complete, I did not expect that either, the game is appropiately long.GameplayWell, this is an old game so if you are used to have clear aids on games, be aware this has none of it. By ""clear aids"" I mean like ""objetives menu"" ""map"", etc. No, you do have ""story follow up"" materials that help you remember what just happened and might be expected to do, and lets you review the conversations you had with NPCs should you have forgotten something important that they said, however apart from that do not expect any kind of leads or explicit help.The puzzles can go from simple to ""OH MY GOD, REALLY?"", sometimes it requires you to push and get going on those  abstract thinking processes to be able to figure out what it wants you to do, makes your inner celeron dust its core quite a bit for sure. If you are truly lost, do not worry, it is acceptable that you might end up in a game guide at some point because some of them are quite tricky...very tricky...let's say. How to succed at completing this game though? My recomendations are the following:*From the very start, ALWAYS check everything in your scenario, everytime your scenario changes (whereas you went to a whole new area or you simply decided to take a look at something specific, scan it thoroughly, and see if you can interact with it in some way, or interact with items in some way. If you can grab something it -WILL- have an use or various uses along your journey, so keep always an eye peeled. One item you might have overlooked, and it might prove problematic later on, so be very vigilant, and very curious.*Pay special attention to what has been said by the NPCs.*Keep track of the details, and track of what you have in your inventory so it is easier to connect the dots with the help of your logic skills! The way you have to interact in with your environment always appeals in great deal to your logic (*Stark-ing intensifies* lol).Overall?I would venture to say that this is a masterpiece. Despite the fact that I could send this game to be carbon-dated already, it surprised me as it surpassed my expectations. I was a little dubious when I purchased it despite having loved Dreamfall Chapters, but I absolutely do not regret it a single bit. I enjoyed every single chapter, and should you, reader, stumble over this title by chance, know that you are in for a treat, and one hell of worth it. And if you decide to give it a shot, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.This is the way storytelling should be.			"

												A classic I played along time ago and since forgotten, still remember it was an awesome experience so going for a fresh re-run of this and Dreamfall. So even though i did finish them a long while back I'll remember and feel like I completed the series with Chapters. Def a must have if you've never played it urself, very nostalgic.			"

It was an excellent puzzle-solving game, though I think it could have been made more difficult, like Myst.			"

												If you look for story in your games above all else, like me, then you may want to try The Longest Journey.Pros: -The world presented in the longest journey is extremly detailed and interesting, tons of depth.  If you like to take your time an experience the world of your games, then this one won't let you down - The story is exciting and engrossing, lots of twists and turns. - The game has a great sense of humor, but it doesn't take away from the serious aspects of the game at all -A game that is actually well written, what a surprise.I don't really want to spoil any plot elements, I sugest you just jump right in and don't look back.But of course the game isn't perfect, it falls into some of the same problems a lot of older adventure games faced.cons: -Solutions to some puzzles and just absurd or nonsense. -lots of running back and forth especially early in the game, especially if you happened to miss an item you were meant to pick up along the way (trust me you will) -Graphics, the game is old you can't fault it that much.- Movement feels kind of clunky, it's not that big of a deal, but might as well mention it.Overall I think the pros outweigh the cons greatly in this game, and it is worth looking into for anyone that appreciates good stories in games.

												I felt compelled to play this game after having completed its follow up Dreamfall: The Longest Journey and that is the only caveat I feel is necessary to recommend this game. If you have an appreciation for the other games in the series than the completionist in you is the only reason to play this game. Graphically this game has not aged well and works counter to the fantasy/futuristic atmosphere that the game tries to create. The lead character April is somewhat interesting and well voice acted but almost all the other characters get very little attention and with regards to how it ends completely forgotten about. As a point and click it's equal parts rewarding and utterly nonsensical but thankfully you can enable the ESC button in the menu to skip through dialogue, slow moving character animations, cutscenes (They are unintentionally laughable) and to transition from the various locations you visit (and from one side of the screen to the other).

The puzzeles are hard but not impossible.. though I think it took me 1 year or 2 to finish.. but i was only 12-13 year old at the time i played it. If you love the point and click genre you sould absolutley play this! The only thing I need to complain about is that I played this with Swedish audio & text, the swedish voice actors is so good and nostalic and I don't understand why it's not avalible here on steam?

												I feel like I'm about halfway through with the game right now, so I think it's safe to give a review.The Longest Journey is a point and click adventure game that delves into both high fantasy and futuristic themes. It does both very well, and in a seamless way that doesn't feel like the developers are trying to force two unrelated genres into their game forcefully. The story, thus far, is good. It's easy to follow, but also deeper than you'll initially think, going into the game. Puzzles are challenging, but not impossible. Most of them are fairly easy to figure out once you get into the right frame of thought, or just going at them with trial and error. Voicework is good, and the characters are charming and likable. The graphics are dated, but this shouldn't deter you from getting the game. I bought it when it was 80% off, but I would still pay full price for it. With that said, I've found some problems playing the game. I cannot overwrite saves, otherwise it causes the game to freeze. I've been getting around this by making multiple saves and deleting the ones I'm done with to save on space. Also, When I try to exit the game through the in-game menu, it also causes the game to freeze. Again, I find it an easy fix  by just opening up the task manager and ending the process that way. As easy as it is to get around these issues, I think I should share my issues with it.			"

												This is one of the best point and click adventure games I've ever played. The story is so engrossing, it was often hard to stop for the night. If you're a fan of the genre, you must play this. Several times, I found myself thinking it reminded me of Gabriel Knight, so if you liked that, that's a good sign.I do have 3 complaints. First, there were a few puzzles where I thought the solutions were absurd. I had to look at a walkthrough about 3 times, fairly early in the game. Second, there are LONG unpausable conversations. Finally, you can't play it at anything but its native 640x480 resolution, so it's stretched and badly pixelated at fullscreen on a modern 16:9 screen. Don't let these things stand in your way, though. It's a great game.			"

												Alright Buckle Up kidlets.TL:DR ----This game is the game you wanna get if you are willing to be chokeholded and dragged through a rich and deep story driven game.I sat down and spent 13.5 hours playing this game from start to finish. Binged it. All day.I highly recommend this game.-Onto the meat-To be honest I did not know what to expect. Especially when I played Dreamfall: The Longest Journey first before playing this one. I didnt even know it was part of a series to recently. As soon as it went on sale in stea, it was the best decision ever to buy it.Playing the second game first doesnt spoil much. But you will be like ""Ohhhh"" with some places and remember. Which was what happened to me throughout the game.I did love playing this game very much so. Some parts you will get stuck and cannot figure out what to do. But paying close attention to absolutely  everything is the key. I know some might phase out after a while.But I do reccommend you play this in one sitting whilst everything is still fresh in your mind so do not forget places or what you need to do.Always check your diary, It is your best friend.Other than that. I highly reccommend this game to anyone and everyone. Well worth the money and well worth the time!!			"

												PROS: Unique story, lovable characters, tons of worldbuildingCONS: Dated graphics, buggy features, obscure puzzlesOVERALL SCORE: 9/10The Longest Journey is a classic game, and I think it absolutely deserves to be remembered throughout video game history. It's a monumental game, and one I can't recommend enough that people play.The best thing about The Longest Journey is, hands down, its story. You play April Ryan, and young art student who's just found out she's a ""shifter"" - a chosen one who has to maintain the balance between two worlds - Arcadia, a world of magic, and Stark, a world of technology. Both worlds are rich in lore and fascinating to explore, and the characters you explore with are witty and charming. There's never a dull moment in The Longest Journey. I think my favorite things about the game is the way it breaks stereotypes. Not just in our protagonist, considering female protagonists were very rare at that time, but the twist at the end. The subversion of the ""chosen one"" trope so frequent in fantasy stories was really awesome to me, even though it was heartbreaking in execution. The ending to the game broke my heart, I'd grown so close to April and her sidekick, Crow, that seeing them both suffer disappointment made me so sad. It was an amazing feeling to connect with characters like that, and one reason I'll always recommend The Longest Journey.One thing to remember about The Longest Journey is that it was released in 1999. It's a seventeen year old game, as of writing. But it still warrants saying... the graphics didn't age well. The backgrounds actually still look really pretty, but the characters look really blocky and low-res. For people who are used to realistic, high res textures, it can be jarring. Still, it's worth it to try to appreciate this game for what it was at the time of its release. Along with the graphics, another product of its age is the bugs. I didn't encounter a ton, but the ones I did were frustrating. There was a particular issue with saving and loading saves that I kept having, I couldn't overwrite a save spot and I couldn't load a save while playing, without the game crashing. Thankfully, that was the only major one I encountered, and I was able to play through the whole game without too many problems as long as I didn't mess with saving too much.Outside of the age, my other complaint was a pretty typical one for adventure games - some of the puzzles just don't make sense. Here's looking at you, rubber ducky. There were some really great puzzles in The Longest Journey, but I found it got bogged down by what I can only describe as video game logic. You basically have to scour environments for random objects just because. It doesn't make sense in the actual game's logic, we just do it because we know we'll need that random piece of chewing gum later down the line. However, frustrating puzzles aside, this game is truly great. Experience the story for yourself. Honestly, this whole trilogy is great and definitely worth playing.			"

												7 out of 10I played TLJ2 Dreamfall a long time before (I didn't know it was a sequel), and although I forgot everything about the plot, I remember I really liked it so I wanted to replay the game when I learned that Chapters was already finished. I decided to play TLJ1 first. Kinda regretting it, but I'd still play this game if I were to make the choice again.Waaaaaaaay too many slow, expositions of dialogues that made me want to pull my hair out, and at times I felt I was forcing myself through the game when it got to those long, never-ending dialogues. Everyone was so long-winded I wanted to scream at them. But, I am not one to skip dialogue/scenes, so I always want to make sure I squeeze out every answer for every available question. Since I don't like to cheat with the walkthroughs unless I'm stuck, that part on that Alatian Island or something was excrutiating to say the least. In terms of character development, April, the MC, was at times very annoying, but other times ok or bordering likeable. I liked Crow, however. Overall April and Crow did make me laugh a few times, so out of the painful monologues there were a few gem lines here and there. At least the characters themselves sometimes acknowledge that other characters sounded corny and fake as hell.Voice acting - uh. Sometimes they just got on my nerves, sorry. The villains especially...so typical, those villainy voices. Anyhow I was not impressed but voice acting is not a deal-breaker for me considering I played FFX and still really liked it.The good thing about the game was naturally the mystery solving and adventuring parts - they were fun, and some were not very obvious so I had to look up walkthroughs. Would have liked more of those as opposed to monologs, but thankfully I remember Dreamfall was a vast improvement. I didn't have high expectations about the adventuring part, since it was a fairly old game.I won't say anything about how the game looked, because again it's an old game so my expectations were low. Needless to say I'm looking forward to healing my eyes somewhat when I replay Dreamfall.In terms of plot, I didn't really like the whole deal with the destiny/prophecy cliches - those were too convenient and my brain does not really like those plot devices. Overall, however, the game was a decent journey. Would have liked more wrapping up at the end, but meh I guess I'll just play Dreamfall to refresh on what happens after that.  All I remember from Dreamfall was this little creepy girl telling the MC to save April Ryan, and that I thought April was a b*tchAll in all I can only say I'm neutral about this game. Since this is where it all starts, I still think this is probably a must-play if you're like me and you have this OCD about story completeness and you have a compulsion to play every game in a series and play them in order.

												I liked it a lot. Oh, sure, there was some Adventure Game Nonsense in there, but that’s just the price of admission when you like the genre. A few of the jokes were really gross, too.But! It’s one of those games that’s more than good enough that I can look past those flaws, and they’re pretty sparse. Great writing, great voice acting, I don’t… actually know if the graphics were impressive for the time it was made (early 2000′s) since I didn’t play a load of PC games back then, but they sure felt like it and certainly got the job done, and did I mention the great writing? Also, there are dragons in it.			"

												The Longest Journey is a masterpiece. It has one of the most interesting storyline I've ever played (except for perhaps Planescape: Torment). The game itself is well made, controlls and the interface is well made and polished. The graphics are old and outdated (it's fine for a game at that age). The storry and the setting is very well made the music makes the perfect  atmosphere. As you play you will care about the characters and the storry is intriguing. This game is one of a kind that you cant put it off until you finished it! It runs well on modern systems 32/64bit OS (even on Intel integrated VGA stuff it's an old game after all). I recomend anyone who likes this gener of games (telltale / point and click) or wants a good storry driven game with colorfull worlds / characters.			"

												A fine little adventure, if a little too heavy on the expository dialogue and the ""epic"" fantasy clichés (Destiny, chosen one, yadayada) Personally, I found the future elements more interesting. BUT! The game can lure you in like a good book and the moments that stand out *really* stand out, not least because of the *superb* voice acting. Currently having high hopes for the sequel!			"

												Fantastic gem of an adventure game which is widely regarded as the spiritual successor to the kings quest series.  It is a must play for anyone who likes adventure games.The only downsides are: 1. The graphics are dated by modern standards: It screams for a Hi-Def update.2. Without a guide you might find yourself confused about what do to next. Recommended for any fan of the adventure game genre.			"

Finished the game four times throughout my life and it never gets old :^) The story is beautifully written, the art is absolutely stunning, and the voice acting is fantastic. The game can be a bit slow at times but I guess that's why it's called The Longest Journey... :0  "

												In short: Very good. 8/10Pro's: Excellent story telling. Marvellous fantasy. Easy to play. Solid fun, no noticable bugs.Con's: Graphics are very outdated, would love a Remastered version :). Conclusion left me a bit... meh'ed.To me this game is proof that you don't need full HD super graphics to have a wonderfull time. The game begins slow and doesn't overwhelm you with information. But soon enough magic and mystery is all around you. Although I totally love the fantasy of this game, I do recognise where some idea's came from and feel that some plot moments could have been worked out better. None the less, having missed this in the past, I played it for the first time in 2016 and was left wanting more! Fortunately, there is :)TLJ is never boring, the puzzles are never frustratingly unlogical, there is plenty of humor and you are always wondering what will come next. The only frown I got was at the conclusion where the ending was much different than expected and a little bit of an anti-climax.If you love story telling and if you're not hung up on the latest graphical achievents, then I'd recommend this game 100%.

												This is one of the best adventures I have ever played. Intense, twisted story, epic dialogues.Since this game is from 1999, it has some technical issues with modern OS, like Windows 10.Just dont get it, why people give negative ratings due to minor issues. - Crashes on exit, need to kill the process via taskmanager. No problem at all.- Crashes on save overwrite. Just save in a new slot each time. - Need to tweak preferences.ini to remove some gfx glitches (ATI)No other issues than those. And it's toatally acceptable, considering the great storyline. People who dont play the game cos it crashes on exit really miss something.			"

												If you look for story in your games above all else, like me, then you may want to try The Longest Journey.Pros: -The world presented in the longest journey is extremly detailed and interesting, tons of depth.  If you like to take your time an experience the world of your games, then this one won't let you down - The story is exciting and engrossing, lots of twists and turns. - The game has a great sense of humor, but it doesn't take away from the serious aspects of the game at all -A game that is actually well written, what a surprise.I don't really want to spoil any plot elements, I sugest you just jump right in and don't look back.But of course the game isn't perfect, it falls into some of the same problems a lot of older adventure games faced.cons: -Solutions to some puzzles and just absurd or nonsense. -lots of running back and forth especially early in the game, especially if you happened to miss an item you were meant to pick up along the way (trust me you will) -Graphics, the game is old you can't fault it that much.- Movement feels kind of clunky, it's not that big of a deal, but might as well mention it.Overall I think the pros outweigh the cons greatly in this game, and it is worth looking into for anyone that appreciates good stories in games.

												Just finished the game. Loved it. When I first started out, I was only half-interested in anything the characters were saying. Mind you, I'm playing this in 2016, so everything felt very 'been-there-done-that'. The further you progress into the story, however, the more you get pulled into it, into all of it, the world, the characters, everything. Talking about those characters- it just, it always amazes me how developers can pull of creating alternate worlds, the different creatures they invented were all just so darned likeable, especailly the Bandu. And it has to be said, for a 1999 game, it's very modern. It had a bunch of stuff in it that nowadays people tend to make a big deal out of, like a lesbian character and a wide variety of races, oh, and did I mention, blatant profanity just like in real life.As for some of the more technical stuff. The voice acting was great, and everything was voiced over. I know that's possible with games like these because they tend to be smaller in size, but it really helps a ton with immersion. Sure, the graphics are from 1999 and sometimes you're not sure whether that's a face or a melted candle, but at least everyone's got stellar voices to go with their retro looks. Besides, the sceneries were lovely, just the characters that looked a bit clunky. As for the gameplay, it was just the basic point-and-click stuff, required some quick/clever thinking at times. Only thing I couldn't stand was April's walking speed, girl get a move on, buuut I could just speed my way through any animation that took too long for my liking, so that wasn't really a problem either.  I think if I'd have any serious ""issue"" (I say ""issue"" because it didn't actually bother me) it's that I felt no real emotional connection to most of the characters, so whenever anything happened to them, it didn't bother me, but I think when it comes to creating emotional connections to characters, you just need more time with em than a game like this can give you, so I wouldn't really chock it up as a flaw. Overall ratings:Audio: 9/10Graphics: 8/10*Gameplay: 7.5/10Story: 10/10*keeping in mind it's from 1999, and the sceneries were very good			"

TLJ, a pleasant odessey...I landed on this game because I wanted to play what originated the story from Dreamfall Chapters, and while this is a 1999 game, I was very very pleased. Like they say, they don't make stuff to last like before nowadays!GraphicsWell, this is a game from 1999, so forget about it, you cannot play this game expecting HD textures, expect Nintendo 64-like graphics at its best, with old Diablo-like cutscenes, nor there are any mods to that I could find to help with this, this is most unimportant anyway, since the true treasure of this game lies elsewhere. However, I do find appealing all the drawn scenarios, thinking of all the work that went through the creation of this game to make all the world, I absolutely love it. Also, just as me, you'll probably have find issues with the graphics, with 3D models looking incomplete, this can be easily fixed by following the instruction in THIS thread, easy peesy! The music and sound effects used always suits the areas you find yourself in, although only in some very specific ocasions I found the music to be of special notice, it was just pretty much suitable, makes you feel in the right ambient.The StoryThat is truly the point of this really, no? What is a point-and-click adventure game without its story. I must say, I had some expectations and they were fullfilled, I deeply enjoyed the story in this game. I won't go on the details, for what I love of the story is to be able to discover it as you progress, every little piece of it, and I won't take that away from you. Mind you, there is something you should know, this game is young adult-oriented, so be warned about the content you might expect to find in the dialogues. That said, if you have lots of crops on your sense of humor field, this game will certainly make you harvest them all, the characters are quite hilarious, sarcasm is the everyday bread, and witty verbal knives fly here and there. Even when it wants you to feel omnious, it keeps making you chuckle.This game makes you love its characters, so you are more inclined to care about the story has a whole. And the voice acting...is truly grandious. This is how I like my stories told to me. My favorite character without doubt was Crow, it is are amazing. And man, this had gotten me 20h to complete, I did not expect that either, the game is appropiately long.GameplayWell, this is an old game so if you are used to have clear aids on games, be aware this has none of it. By ""clear aids"" I mean like ""objetives menu"" ""map"", etc. No, you do have ""story follow up"" materials that help you remember what just happened and might be expected to do, and lets you review the conversations you had with NPCs should you have forgotten something important that they said, however apart from that do not expect any kind of leads or explicit help.The puzzles can go from simple to ""OH MY GOD, REALLY?"", sometimes it requires you to push and get going on those  abstract thinking processes to be able to figure out what it wants you to do, makes your inner celeron dust its core quite a bit for sure. If you are truly lost, do not worry, it is acceptable that you might end up in a game guide at some point because some of them are quite tricky...very tricky...let's say. How to succed at completing this game though? My recomendations are the following:*From the very start, ALWAYS check everything in your scenario, everytime your scenario changes (whereas you went to a whole new area or you simply decided to take a look at something specific, scan it thoroughly, and see if you can interact with it in some way, or interact with items in some way. If you can grab something it -WILL- have an use or various uses along your journey, so keep always an eye peeled. One item you might have overlooked, and it might prove problematic later on, so be very vigilant, and very curious.*Pay special attention to what has been said by the NPCs.*Keep track of the details, and track of what you have in your inventory so it is easier to connect the dots with the help of your logic skills! The way you have to interact in with your environment always appeals in great deal to your logic (*Stark-ing intensifies* lol).Overall?I would venture to say that this is a masterpiece. Despite the fact that I could send this game to be carbon-dated already, it surprised me as it surpassed my expectations. I was a little dubious when I purchased it despite having loved Dreamfall Chapters, but I absolutely do not regret it a single bit. I enjoyed every single chapter, and should you, reader, stumble over this title by chance, know that you are in for a treat, and one hell of worth it. And if you decide to give it a shot, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.This is the way storytelling should be.			"

												BEFORE: I chose to gave up this game right after i can't even quit the game...I thought it will be quite good but I didn't last for even 30min because of the grapgic is not what i was expecting :/(seriously, I do think that my laptop setting is quite good for most of the game, yet just this game giving me headache.. *sorry* )I couldn't really recommend this game, as myself never finished it or start it, buy it during the sales if you are interested to try it!AFTER: First, I did not managed continue the game due to the graphic expectation and the bug(maybe just my laptop), whenever I wanna save the game or exit, I clicked, a white box appeared and I couldn't see anything. It really bugging me a lot until few people were encouraged me to give the game a second chance. YES, I researched a bit and bear with the bug, I found a thread and it said whenever we wanna save/quit, after the white box, just press 'Y' on keyboard, and it did working!I must say that if I didn't give myself another try, I will be regret deeply! Thanks to everyone who spent their time to convince me, I am really appreaciated and I never judge a book by its cover.The game has very lively voice over, music and those puzzle is not just point and click, but a challenging one! The story surprisingly is so good, and I played Dreamfall: The longest journey before this. Two games have a minor relation with each other, especially about April Ryan.If you are interested on Dreamfall series, I would suggest go for The longest journey > Dreamfall: The longest journey > Dreamfall Chapters ! You won't be disappointed :)Now, I can't wait to begin the Dreamfall Chapters, and please try this game, it's one of those rare gem that we hardly seen in these day!			"

												It's not entirely correct that this game released in 2000 as the game description says (this is the UK release), it was first released in Norway in 1999. I first played through TLJ in 1999 and I always found the graphics quite impressive for its time. In fact it seemed years ahead of the competition, I knew of no other beautifully detailed game quite like this. Back then there were no walkthroughs. Since I was also a child, seemingly easy puzzles sometimes took me days to figure out. I spent more than a month getting through the entire game (also because I wasn't allowed to game ALL day). This game left such a massive imprint on me and my imagination. I love the magical ambience of the game, the music, the main character (which, at least in norwegian, was kind of funny), the backgrounds and scenery, the places to travel to and the puzzles. Also, the controls were easy to use and the menus easy to manuver. Being able to skip long dialogues (perhaps accidentially revisited) with the right mouse button made things even easier. The only thing I felt a little negative about first playing this game was that there was A LOT of walking, even tho April runs she doesn't run fast enough! And a lot of dialogue where they go into great detail on almost everything. In my 2016 playthrough tho I find these long dialogues interesting, cause they fill in the gaps where I had holes in my understanding of the story. I'm also now more interested in knowing more about the characters and places because they're now distantly familiar. As a kid, some of the story was hard to make sense of. Yet through actions and imagery it all made sense in the end. Wenever I think of The Longest Journey I get that magical feeling kids get around christmas time; anticipation. This game always had me curious of what would happen next. I'm so happy this game is available on Steam for newer generations to play, and for old-time players to revisit and reminiscence. I hope to one day see a remastered version with polished up graphics!(The only bug I've so far encountered playing on Windows 10 is that I can't exit the game because a white box appears. But a quick google searched showed that you get asked to end the game by pressing ""y"" for yes and ""n"" for no. So far this has worked)			"

												The Longest Journey really is something else. It's a jewel of a game, with fantastic writing, art direction, and music, but there's more to it than that. This game was way ahead of it's time, and still is. The dialogue and characters are deeply realistic in a way that was unheard of for the time and is still all too rare. It plays in a deeply satisfying old school point and click adventure format that's very rare nowadays, and scratches an itch I'd almost forgot existed. Getting this game is a service to yourself.

												As a Point&Click fan, why didn't I play this game sooner? I had it for quite a long time in my library and din't try it. As I like games ""à la Telltale and Life is Strange"", I wanted to try Dreamfall Chapters but waited for sales to buy it. As it was in Humble Bundle I eventually got it, but I wanted to play the 2 previous game to understand the story.So I finally got to play The Longest Journey, and I saw that it was a mistake not playing it earlier. The graphics are atrocious on a new computer though. But if you can go through that, this game is amazing. The story is fascinating and the characters lovable. Some puzzles are quite difficult, but nothing impossible for the old Point&Click players. One of the best game of this genre out there.			"

												A fantastic point and click adventure with a very memorable protagonist. The voice acting, especially for the protagonist April Ryan, is wonderful and adds to the immersion. Most of the puzzles are great, though there's the occasional esoteric one that may require a look-up. I played this game for the first time in 2008 and loved it, and just replayed it in 2016 and loved it again. If you can handle old school 3D graphics it's still well worth your time even decades after release.Highly recommended for anyone who wants to experience an adventure with a heavy focus on story and characters.
