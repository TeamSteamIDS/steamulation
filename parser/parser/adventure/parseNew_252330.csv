												The original Slender, released in the summer of 2012, was an experimental horror game that dropped you into a spooky forest with nothing but a flashlight to guide your way and a faceless entity known as the Slender Man following your every step. Despite having rough, simple graphics, it was a chilling gameplay experience. Slender: The Arrival, a reimagining of the original game, once again sets players up to encounter the enigmatic Slender Man, this time with a much more robust story, improved visual design, and just as many scares.The Arrival has you play as Lauren, a young woman who is visiting her friend Kate. Kate is selling her isolated family home after her mother's death, but upon your arrival, you find Kate's house mysteriously empty. The doors are wide open, there's furniture knocked around, and there's several mysterious notes about repressed memories and hallucinations... then you see a strange figure watching you from outside the window. It isn't long before you realize something terrible has happened to Kate, and it's up to you to find out where she is and why she disappeared.One of the first things you'll notice about The Arrival is that along with a significantly overhauled visual design compared to the original, it features a very dark and foreboding atmosphere that does an excellent job of keeping you on edge, if not outright terrified. Whether its hunting down those eight infamous pages in the remake of the original forest level from Slender, or scrambling to turn on an elevator in an abandoned mining facility, you'll rarely feel that you're in a safe enough spot to stand still and catch your breath. Much like the original game, you're almost completely defenseless, and all you have with you is a flashlight and the ability to sprint for short distances. However, you'll have to worry about how often you use your light and how much noise you make, since your pursuers rely on both to track you down. Deciding between whether you should try being stealthy and risk getting lost in the dark environment, or dashing to your objectives as fast as possible knowing that you're more likely to run right into the Slender Man's open arms, can be an unnerving choice to make. The implacable Slender Man is as imposing and aggressive a foe as ever, and often the only notice you'll have that he's caught up to you is a slight distortion that ripples across your screen... occasionally followed by him flashing directly in front of you in a cacophony of digital noise and electronic screams.While the stages do have randomness to them in the form of starting locations, landmarks or key items being different each time you play through a stage, most feel like they could have had more variety. Almost all follow a similar formula of ""find X number of objects while trying not to die horrifically."" What really hurts The Arrival the most, though, is how short it is.Slender: The Arrival is a significant improvement over Parsec Production's original game, featuring a much more robust narrative, and a darker, more foreboding atmosphere. You may have mixed feelings about its brevity and the repetitive mechanics, but it's certainly a well-built game that, above all, is scary to play.			"

												Imagine it, you're walking down a dirt road in the woods at dusk, it is autumn the leaves are turning orange and red. You come across an abandon vehicle on the road. The sun quickly sets, leaving you in the dark without a flashlight and suddenly, you aren't alone anymore. You are being watched and stalked by something. It feeds off of the power of your video camera, which is the only way to see it (I guess).When your video camera flickers, it is closing in on you. It is drawing the power from the batteries as it draws near. It is Slenderman. A tall thin humanoid creature that looks over you from afar from hilltops. The creature that opens the doors that you just closed. The creature that your only defense is to not look at it. To wish it away as you cower in fear by looking at the ground. No... just run away until your video recorder stops flickering. How do you run from something that just teleports in front of you? You can always walk backward.This is Slender: The Arrival, less of a game and more of a first person experience along the lines of Dear Esther and Gone Home. It preys on your fears. It has a great, creepy atmosphere and great sound design. You have little in the way of controls, left stick to move, right stick to look, a sprint button, flashlight button, zoom button, and a use button. There are other buttons, but they feel redundant.The game dumps you in and never explains why you're there. Not just the first chapter of the game, but over and over again, its the same thing, you start at dusk in the woods and go into the night and then find an abandon building. Each chapter has a different task, such as turn on X generators, find X pages in the woods and close X windows. Simple things, but you're just stuck with something that can be anywhere at anytime that will warn you when its near. The more things you collect, the more intensely you will be harassed.As you wander in the dark you quickly come across an average house. Depending on where you enter, it looks like there is nothing wrong. Just a normal house for sale with a playground in the back. Soon enough you'll find things scrawled on the walls and rooms in disarray. Eventually, you'll find a flashlight that will help you. The idea of wandering in the woods might seem like an easy way to get lost, but as you roam the darkness, you'll be enticed by audio and visual cues such as paths, lights and dozens of arrows pointing in one direction that will guide your way.If you think you'll get used to Slenderman, once you progress far enough, eventually you will reach an abandon facility and have a follower. Perhaps it is a follower of the Slenderman, but it follows, chases and strangles you. This isn't a creature like Slenderman, so it doesn't have magical powers other than it is getting closer, running after you. You'll hear its footsteps running up to you. Your only defense is to focus your flashlight and blind it. That adds something different to the game. Getting trapped in a side room means there is no way out and no where to run away from the follower.It is a toss up if this experience is for you. If finding stuff in the dark isn't for you then skip it. You'll be searching open areas for sometimes tiny things (sheets of paper). Lost in the woods and abandon buildings. Being thrown off your direction from having to run away and forced to figure out where you're going again in an area that is mostly woods. If you can't handle bobbing and weaving cameras, avoid this game. It might be a nitpick but sometimes the camera seems to be at a person's waist. The height of a sink or a doorknob.I couldn't really recommend Dear Esther or Gone Home. They were both beautiful and immersive, but I didn't feel anything playing those games like I did with Slender: The Arrival. Is it worth $10 for an hour or two of gameplay? I feel like I was engaged and always challenged by a single strange foe with powers to teleport anywhere.			"

												Slender: The Arrival is a first person adventure game. You are only equipped with a flashlight. You have to explore various locations and search for clues to your friend's whereabouts, while avoiding an unspeakable fate at the hands of Slender man himself. On your way you can pick up various papers that give you background information on the story, or clues.There are no problems with controls and everything feels very smooth. The game itself is too short, it takes around 1 hour to finish.The graphics are good, you will not be disappointed. Slender Man himself looks awesome, in my opinion this is the best Slender Man model of every Slender game. Everything else in the game, from the trees, to the rocks and so on looks pretty well, no complaints here.The music is great, it really adds to the experience. You can hear that slow thumping in the background from the original Slender game when you pick up that first page in one of the levels. The sound effects are also good, sometimes you will hear the sounds of footsteps from someone or something other than you in the forest close by, or you will hear the Owls hooting at night, and other various forest sounds.I can recommend Slender: The Arrival to people who wants a good fun scare or a nice horror game and of course all fans of the original Slender Man game. Fans of the original Slender will be happy to know that the original game is remade in one of the levels.Sounds 8/10Graphics 8/10Gameplay 6/10Atmosphere 8/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												Slender: The Arrival is the follow-up to the popular freeware horror game, Slender: Eight Pages, being made by the people responsible for making Slender so popular (Mark J. Hadley, creator of Slender: Eight Pages, and the Marble Hornets team who made a series of Slender-themed YouTube videos). It's not just another Slender clone though, it goes for a more cinematic approach to gaming, and not as in fixed cutscenes or QTEs, but in providing an interactive cinematic horror experience.The stories pretty simple. You are going to check in on a friend who lives deep in the forest who hasn't been responding to calls, texts, or emails for the last few days. Turns out, there's evil that lurks in these woods... Now can you escape?Slender: The Arrival is probably the closest you'll get to playing a found-footage horror film in game form, at least yet. The way everything is told through the gameplay's lens, the 'folk-story' tone the game goes with the legend, the execution of how Slender and the events that transpire work, feels very much in-line with a found-footage horror film, except you are the driver and the one tasked with capturing it all and surviving.In that regard, Slender: The Arrival is a very cool experience. It has some good build-up, atmosphere, and escalates the situation while still retaining a more down-to-earth feeling. All through gameplay, you experience a series of events and have to respond to them.The basic Slender gameplay is still there... Collect different items and avoid the big tall man in the suit, but there's more to it here, and this is often where the split in opinion on this game begins.The game is rather short, and honestly you probably spend more time just exploring places in-between the game's 'main' stages than you do actually playing the core Slender gameplay.This mainly involves going around locations, like a forest trail or a house, and opening doors to get to the next story location.Slender: The Arrival is split into nine 'stages', five of them in the story, one as a secret hidden level, two of them were added post-patch to make a hidden new miniature story, and one as a bonus stage. Beating the story should take 2-4 hours the first time (the five main stages), and consist of two stages with you actually collecting items, two scenarios with you avoiding Slender via other means 'cinematically',  and most of these stages as well as one stage entirely having 'build-up' situations where nothing actually happens, but it builds-up to the next main gameplay scenario.The length and the cinematic direction the game takes will turn some people off, but on my part it actually made me enjoy the game more. It legitimately feels like a playable found-footage horror film, and has charm and atmosphere in its design and oppressive stages. I found myself enjoying it during its short course.I even got scared a few times, something the original Eight Pages and many Slender clones don't do to me. Scariness is subjective, but a feat I must mention as I don't actually find the character of Slender to be scary in general. This said, I found myself more terrified by Slender's 'unidentified' masked assistant than Slender himself. She's a stalker who appears in a specific stage in the game, and her sounds, appearance, animations, and the environment you encounter her in legitimately made me afraid of her for a time.However, for all of this 'cinematic charm' I'm spouting about, the game maybe alienated its main audience in some ways, as part of the charm of the original Slender game was with its minimalistic atmospheric gameplay and dreary feeling without need for story, explanation, and just throws you right in. This is a very different experience and very different game, and these changes completely alters the audience the game is designed for... And unfortunately, with a character who's been popularized like Slender, it can mean the game's audience is potentially very small, as some have come to ridicule or dislike his popularity and character, and those that like him may not like the way the game is designed differently and more aimed as a playable cinematic horror game.I feel fond of it though, and it happens to be my favorite Slender-based game for the very reason of how its different. I find it to be enjoyable to play, and to experience, and craft an interesting world and scenario that was immersive to go through.This all said, the best parts of the game maybe came out of the optional content. The 'bonus stage I mentioned is simply a recreation of the original Eight Pages game you can play outside of the main story, but a lot prettier. The game has difficulty levels and randomized features through all of its stages which is interesting. There are a variety of secrets and Easter eggs in the game, including a hidden ending.The two post-patch stages based around a village and a farm take criticism from the game and made really moody set-pieces that add extra elements to the story, though finding them is a bit tricky as they require specific actions during the game's main story.And for me, the absolute best part of the game was the secret level. I don't want to spoil it here, but at least for me, it was definitely the creepiest part of the whole game, but a shame most probably wouldn't find it without looking it up... It's pretty well hidden.Slender The Arrival isn't for everybody and ditches the minimalist direction for something more akin to a game version of a found-footage horror film, but during its short duration it delivers an interesting different take on both Slender and cinematic horror games. I'd say worth a trip for those who think the idea of playing a found-footage horror film sounds appealing.			"

Slender: The Arrival 
A Screenshot of Slender: The Arrival
By: SABINA




Was really impressed with this little horror treat. Beautiful graphics, great suspense building and effective jumpscares. Only downside, was very brief, could realistically finish it in 2 hours. Took me 3.6 because I'm a thorough explorer and I died a lot... first time I saw Slender I just ran right up to him to say hi... But other than that, it's much better than expected. And well worth it at the sale price of 3.99. I would place it somewhere between The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and Outlast, as far as style and gameplay. If you like either one of those, and a good jumpscare, you'll like this one. The story seemed like a prologue, so hopefully it's just The Arrival and we'll see some fully fleshed out sequels. Definitely tracking this studio to see what they come up with next.			"

Posted: March 25, 2014
												I play a lot of horror games.  I mean A LOT.  I'm always in search of that thrill which horror MOVIES can rarely give me any more, which means I want a game to SCARE me.  Slender: The Arrival is definitely scary.  In fact, it's possibly the single scariest game I've ever played.  You want to know why?  BECAUSE IT CHEATS.   Okay, a confession before I go on.  I'm seriously beginning to suspect I'm actually really BAD at video games.  I mean, all that hand-eye coordination and lightning reflexes stuff...it's just not me.  I have the reflexes of a snail (a fast and lively snail, perhaps, but a snail regardless), and I can barely even shoot straight in first-person shooters.  I'm pretty crap, honestly.  So how, you ask, do I manage to complete so many games, some even on the hardest difficulty levels?  Because I'm not afraid to go back to the last save/checkpoint and redo sections a bit better than last time (waste less ammo and medkits, etc), and I'm smart enough to learn from my mistakes.  THAT'S IT.  Nothing else.  Enough of talk of ME, then, and let's get back to this game...   Let's start with save/checkpoints.  There AREN'T any, basically.  You complete a Chapter, and you unlock the next one for future play.  But not much of anything DURING said Chapters (of which there are a mere six).  Which means if you manage to turn on FIVE out of SIX freaking generators, then DIE, you have to go back to the FIRST generator.  I know this is some people's idea of a ""challenge"", but personally, it just infuriates the living CHRIST out of me.  But hey, you know what?  Sometimes this style of game design CAN work, up to a point, as long as the player:  a. Doesn't get thrown back a full TWENTY MINUTES of gameplay, and b. Can apply what they've learned the last time to the new round of play.  Say, for example, in the scenario I've mentioned above, you can learn WHERE the final generator is, just before you are unceremoniously snuffed.  The problem here is...THE LOCATIONS OF THE GENERATORS ARE RANDOMLY CHOSEN.  Which means that while the game does arguably still have a ""learning curve"" of sorts, such as vaguely getting to know your way around the humungous bloody mine complex, the learning curve is very limited because you still basically have to stumble around blindly looking for the next blessed generator.  So it's that kind of situation where you'll activate three generators the first time you try, four the next time, TWO the time after that, FIVE the time after that and then all the way back to TWO for the, what are we up to, FIFTH BLOODY TIME?!?  In other words, there isn't much of a feeling of PROGRESS, something which I'm afraid I need to feel in ALL aspects of life, or else I just feel like GIVING THE ♥♥♥♥ UP.  A well-designed game will make you feel like you're getting gradually CLOSER to conquering the bit which is troubling you, and DOESN'T give the impression that whether or not you make it through THIS time is just down to sheer blind LUCK...   Which brings us to the NEXT problem with this game.  Far from feeling like it's all your own dumb fault when you DO cark it, this game is basically like playing a game of hide-and-seek where your pursuer has a distinct advantage over you, like being able to basically just APPEAR RIGHT NEXT TO YOU when they damned-well feel like it.  Not to mention, as each successive generator/note/whatever is found, the stakes are upped, which means that if generator number five is in a confined little room, activating it will in all probability cause your antagonist to immediately appear in doorway of said room, thereby reducing your chances of escaping them to precisely ♥♥♥♥-ALL.  All because of the sheer, dumb luck of where the generator randomly generated.  Sure I could probably try to muster up the courage to carefully stake out the entirety of the mine complex before touching a single generator, but by now my patience is LESS THAN ZERO and I could almost STRANGLE A PUPPY, and besides, I'd probably DIE before I even laid eyes upon all six generators, and really, IT'S JUST A ♥♥♥♥ING VIDEO GAME, NOT A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH, AND I HAVE OTHER THINGS I'D LIKE TO ACHIEVE WITH MY REAL LIFE BEFORE DYING IN IT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.     The bottom line is this: Yes, I seek a decent ""challenge"" in a game, but I'm really not seeking the video game equivalent of banging my head against a brick wall.  Or if I do, I want to feel like that wall is gradually crumbling under MY weight, not the other way around.     Now, you ready for the biggest shock of all?  I'm about to give this game a RECOMMENDATION.  I'm going to recommend it to all the people out there who believe that games SHOULD be stupidly hard, and believe that a game tossing in ""unfair"" random elements to make things harder is a perfectly legitimate way of creating a more ""challenging"" experience (and making a rather short game somewhat lengthier, I might add).  I'm also recommending it to anyone who, like me, enjoys a game which is♥♥♥♥♥♥scary and relentlessly atmospheric (which this is); though I would certainly suggest caution to anyone who requires things like STORY and LOGIC in order to enjoy a game (to wit: ""Here I am looking for pieces of paper in the woods, for no apparent reason, while some tall demonic being is zipping about trying to kill me...and while I do this, I have a flashlight in one hand and a video camera in the other, the latter seemingly just an attempt to emulate the vastly superior Outlast, in which the video camera WAS the only light source, and the protagonist was at least a journalist willing to risk it all to get a great story, not just some girl looking for her sister...which I think is who I am and what I'm doing here.  Something like that.  To be honest, I forgot about fourteen retries ago"")...   No doubt about it, this is definitely one game which will ""frazzle the nerves"", in both a good AND bad way.  For now I'm giving up on it, roughly half-way through, in spite of the fact that looking at other people's reviews/criticisms suggests that the third Chapter which I'm stuck on is by far the HARDEST of all the Chapters, which would suggest more inherent problems in the game's design which I'm yet to enjoy.  Maybe I'll feel the bravery to tackle this one again some day...or maybe I'll just decide to live out the rest of my years without the guilt of being a crazed PUPPY KILLER (see above, about fourteen frustrated paragraphs ago).  To anyone who hasn't yet bought this...make sure you buy Outlast first.  That's a game which knows how to RESPECT its players, without resorting to heavy-handed, bully-like tactics to make sure the experience is indeed a ""scary"" one.  So close, but so far...Verdict: 7/10.			"

												Compared to all the other Slender games, This one is a masterpiece, instead of relying solitarily on being jump scared by slender, this one uses the entire mythos to create a rather suspensful game.  While it does contain the standard  ""Walk around and collect things"" scheme, it doesn't really take you out of the experience. And the design choices deffinately go a long way to add to the scares.Not to mention, this one is Story driven to some extent. I loved this game, loved the story, and loved the scares and I reccomend giving this one a try.Long story short, I love this game Slender: the 8 pages was an introduction.

												Wasn't a fan of the original slender. Found it too boring and lacking attachment. Decided to give this one a go and it was far superior. Warning to those who scare easy, it can be intense at times. Found it short and fairly linear. Another level or two would have been nice. The linear aspect isn't that restrictive allowing exploration if desired. Playing in the dark with a headset on is recommended for those who want a thrill. I found myself checking directions even more than I did in Alan Wake. Audio is nice and while I have read about people having running issues or bugs I noticed neither.			"

												Game name: Slender: The ArrivalReviewed by: WolfIn Summary...Slender: The Arrival is a superb horror game made in succession to the popular indie game Slender: The Eight Pages by Mark J. Hadley in 2012. The story follows Lauren, who is investigating a disappearance of her friend Kate, after arriving at her home late one evening to find her missing. Racing through the levels uncovering more clues via pages, the story begins to unravel and you will soon learn Kate's fate. With 8 chapters and a secret level, this game delivers a horrifyingly stunning grasp on the tale of the Slender man. Controls:WASD - move character. Mouse - look around.Left click - interact with objects.Escape - pause. Sounds:Slender: The Arrival is filled with horrifying sounds. If you've played the orginal title, you'll know when Slenderman gets near or is pursuing you, the screen becomes distorted and sharp noises peirce your ears. This can be especially jump-scare worthy in high-pressure moments, such as collecting the pages in Chapter 2, or turning on the generators in Chapter 3. Not only in addition to Slenderman, new characters are added in pursual of Lauren, meaning it's literally twice as scary! (bad pun intended)Graphics:Substantial. If you have the time, feel free to check out the screenshots I've made with this game, they're absolutely phenomenal. I do, however; wish the graphics were supported to double the resolution such as the option in games like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter have. Game Balance:It is very easy to win this game. I have played multiple times through, so I've learned which paths to take and how to avoid Slenderman and others in a proficient way. Newcomers may find it more difficult, and if playing on hardcore mode, adds a little bit more of a challenge to the game. Still hoping for a mode beyond hardcore though, preferably a veteran mode of some sorts with more appearances, no lighting, and no sprinting. OtherFix achievements please. Currently there's a bug with the cloud saving, where if you resetstats in console, the game does not reset scrapbook nor steps, and deletes all achievements. This causes you to not be able to obtain the 10k steps achievement or the collector achievements. Easy fix = disable cloud saving. There's literally no need for a single player game like this. Final Rating:8/10In Conclusion:Absolutely a must have for any horror fan or veteran. This game offers a much more enticing tale and rivveting experience than the predecessor, The Eight Pages, as well as a much more stunning visual experience. Please feel free to follow my curation page for more recommendations. Thanks for reading!			"

YouTube™ Video: Slender The Arrival video review - WTF just happened? 

			Views: 716		

			http://cramgaming.com - A look at Blue Isle Studios' psychological first person horror game available now via Steam.		

To conclude, Slender the Arrival is an interesting but short-lived psychological horror experience, that's worth checking out if you like a bit of  tension and meaningless scares. The vagueness of the game won't be agreeable for some people, and for others, the lack of hand holding will be a godsend. On a technical level, the game could be better optimized and it's a shame some extra effects weren't used to add to the atmosphere.  That said, there's some genuine fear on offer here,which shows that the most simple of concepts can work but at the end of the game it's likely you'll be none the wiser as to what just happened.Score 7/10 - Review by Robert Cram			"

												Rule number 1. Dont look behind you.Just like outlast, it has a storyline behind it, you collect notes, you collect pages, and you collect alot of other things, Its only you, Slender man, and his proxies, Really good background music for the eight pages part, The *thump thump* noise when you get your first page, but the music escalates with every 2nd page gotten, 3 to 5 to 7, the music gets higher, making you rush to get that final page.Rule number 2. dont go to the house in between pages, like on 3-5 pages^^^ doing that will just get you killed, I dont reccomend going into the building while your on your 3rd 4th or 5th page, I would instead Recommend going there first so thats out of the way. (This should be a guide not a Review LOL)Graphics, and Atmosphere are good, depending on your graphics card, Storyline is somewhat good, but still a good way to get that adrenaline pumping, Slender man popping out of no where (atleast around 10-20 feet in front of you) thus scaring the fudge out of you.10/10 Reccomended!  (Not for small children, or elders who can get scared real easily, and get a heart attack)			"

												A reasonably good horror game. It is easy to lose the plot a little but it almost does not matter as it is pretty obvious your aim is to find someone and not die in the process. Beyond that the atmosphere is great and the scares are well delivered. It tends to build up the tension slowly, allowing you to wind yourself up more and more until the game feels ready to jump out on you and see if you snap.My play through was pretty short, but I am told there are a number things I missed and it is possible another play through would let me find some different areas.If you love horror games this is a must have game really, but keep your expectations at a mid level.

 EDIT: Spent few more hours on the game, rewrote parts of the review, fixed up some grammaryour comments and feedback matter, so please keep commenting :)Remember Slender: the Eight Pages?It basically was a level where you collect 8 spooky pages with child drawings, while being chased by so called Slenderman. And while nothing really special, it was pretty fun, atmospheric and scary.Now, this game is basically the Eight Pages on steroids, which is both a good and bad thing... Let's start with positives:  1.  Game is very atmospheric and it gives you feeling of hopelessness. Since you only have a flashlight and a camera, your only options of defence is running away with your tail between your legs. 2.  Sound design is pretty good. Wind blowing through trees, camera static, creepy ambient sounds and echoes sound pretty great. 3.  There is also a new enemy type that you will meet on a few levels, adding some variaty. 4.  If you are easily scared, you'll probably get your heart and adrenaline a nice little workout. 5.  Game got some love with patches and some new (and old) levels completely for free, which is nice Now let's go over negatives and man, are there lot's of em:  1.  Story is basically non existent. You're there to find some boy or a girl, but why, where and when is never really explained, unless you find and read all the collectibles.Even then I had to go to on the internet to get my story fix. I know, it's a ""scary simulator"" but it is such a shame we don't get to know any of the rich lore behind Slenderman or ingame characters. 2.  If you're into horror games, have played a few, or are not so easily scared - you will get bored pretty quickly. This game relies heavily on jump scares and spooky sound effects, which, while scary at first, will get repetitive pretty quickly 3.  Difficulty is way to easy on easy (no pun intended) and medium but WAY to unforgiving on hardcore.On medium you're pretty much unstoppable, save for a few spots, but on hardcore some levels are so EXTREMELY annoying and unforgiving, you'll be sent to the retry screen so fast, you'll think that the game has crashed and got stuck on the same screen.Protagonists movement speed is something of the worst I have ever expirienced! Your movement speed is comparable to a turtle and sprint makes no sense at all, since it's completely random... Sometimes when you spot Slenderman, your character will run like a Nascar vehicle on a rampage, but other times (especially when you really need to) you really start to wonder if main protagonist you play as has a death wish or something, since her run speed will be so bad, a toddler would crawl past her while he was asleep...It also doesn't help that the game is just so dark 90% of the time, which lead to... 4.  This game is so friggin dark... I mean brightness cranked all the way to maximum but still dark - dark!But don't give me flak about that, I know Slender: the Arrival is supposed to be dark and spooky game, which is the point, but I mean really? This games darkness will give a black hole a run for it's money! Even with brightness at maximum, you are blind as a bat without you flashlight. You won't see crap and  it is really frustrating, especially on hardcore, because you flashlight have limited battery.Got 7 out of 8 pages but you flashlight depleted the battery? Might as well restart, since there is no way you'll be seeing anything, except maybe Slendermans buttcheeks rubbed against your face anyways if you're lucky. 5.  Graphics are pretty terrible, even for a indie game. I mean, most of the game is dark and you won't be seeing much anyways. It still isn't good excuse for this game to look like Half Life 1. Textures looks old, muddy and dated, animations are just... basic, and water, trees and grass will probably make a senior pc enthusiast cry. 6.  Game have been out for a year now, and it ran pretty terribly back then. Well, 1 year and 3 days later and it still performs somewhat terrible, even after patches...While not nearly as bad as before, on some spots however, this game will really live up to it's predecessors name, the Eight Pages since your top notch gaming beast machine will  cry and sweat  proficiently to spit 8 FPS out of this game 7.  For me personally, Slender: the Arrival got repetitive pretty quickly. While game started out really great, jumpscares got old and missions became repetitive and just plain boring. But It's hardly a problem though since Slender: the Arrival is so amazingly short... 8.  Yes, this game is alarmingly short. I mean REALLY, REALLY short. There is even an achivement for completing it in 45 min. Don't worry, it isn't hard since you can easily ace through it in no more than 30 min with some practice. TL;DR and/or conclusion: All in all, Slender: the Arrival is hit & miss. While some people will enjoy it, for me, it got boring really, really quickly.I was hoping for a really scary game with rich lore and lot's of exploration, but what I got was a boring, short, walking simulator with a lot of jump scares, bad graphics, non existent story which was way to easy on normal and way to frustrating and rage indusing on hardcore.My honest opinion?Try it at friends house, get it on sale, or spend your money on something else			"

												This game is a lot like the original slender game, but has a (weak) storyline that will be sure to freak out your friends, but took me only two and a half hours to beat. The game gets increasingly frustrating as you get closer to the end, and most of the time spent playing the game is trying to figure out where you are supposed to go, or dealing with enemies that apparently do no damage... I would suggest playing with the classic mouse and keyboard because I had a very hard time with a standard gaming controller; the sensitivity is either too high or two low and learning the controls is a frustrating feat for such a short game. I would not reccomend buying this game UNLESS you are a die hard fan of the original Slender, or if you enjoy scaring your friends. Overall ""Slender: The Arrival"" was an experience I did find myself enjoying at the time, but now wish I had my money back to send on a lengthier game or DLC.			"

												Slender: The Arrival is an incredibly short game that, while capable of building an appropriate horror atmosphere, falls flat because of the fact that it relies almost exclusively on cheap, rule-based jumpscares to terrify its audience. As a result, just as in the original Slender: The Eight Pages, the potential horror quickly dissipates, giving way to the simple and shallow mechanic exercise of avoiding an exploitable enemy while collecting certain items to complete the level.The jumpscares that this game relies so heavily upon can indeed be horrifying the first few times you experience them, but, because of the unavoidable repetition that they are condemned to, they rapidly become more of a nuisance than anything else.

												Slender: The Arrival is a very spooky horror game with an excellent coordination of music, sounds, atmosphere, and visuals that keep the chill factor high throughout. The story provides 8 different locations to explore, and offers a fair amount of clues that slowly unfold a sinister evil that has taken over the land. The game does a great job of presenting scares in moderation which creates a prolonging sense of anticipation of what's going to happen next.Although the game can be relatively short, an initial playthrough should take several hours. Slender: The Arrival felt almost like starring in my own Blair Witch Project movie. One of the better horror games I've played that doesn't involve shooting.			"

												Slender The Arrival is a worthy successor to Slender The Eight Pages. More beautiful, immersive, still scary, the title gives chills and cold sweats the most courageous of you. Unfortunately, the player becomes accustomed too quickly their graphics and sound effects. In addition, the life duration is low and lack of variety in the objectives prevent him to rank among the essential of survival horror. Absolute fans of the genre can still be tempted.			"

												While I can understand the hype behind the Slender myth as a social phenomenon I can't say the same for the game. Sure, Slender : The Arrival looks and plays better than its freeware counterparts but overall it's a disappointing game, especially if you put it next to Amnesia : The Dark Descent, a game that helped the renewal of the horror genre.The first chapter managed to set up effectively a scary mood. Exploring the house and its surrounding was really stressful and made me felt really vulnerable. I always expected the worse. The second chapter is more like a remake of Slender : The Eight Pages. While the scare factor was still there the experience felt repetitive. The third chapter is certainly where the game went downhill. The little child is creepy the first time he jumps at you but after a while it gets repetitive and at the end we don't care anymore. The chapter where the events unravel from someone's else perspective was really surprising but at the same time it was too short. At the end of Chapter 6, we are left with an unexpected but disappointing conclusion. The game just lasted 1h 30min.To summarize, the lack of work on the game design is what hurt Slender the most. Playing the game feels more like walking on an alley of jumpscare than facing dangerous threats.Don't get me wrong. I'm not against the idea of a commercial Slender game. I just wish the game could be more polished since it has so much potential.Hopefully, the next commercial Slender game on PC will get everything right.Rating :5.5 / 10			"

												Whether you'll enjoy this game really depends on whether you're still aboard the Slenderman train. Given that I'm writing this review in 2016, I'm going to assume that you aren't. It's weird to look back and think that a faceless guy in a suit had everyone scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ five years ago, but the entire horror genre was in a rut at the time, so I guess that helps explain it.I digress. The game itself is almost exactly two hours long, and does nothing that Amnesia or Outlast don't do better. It can, at times, be more frustrating than scary, since the basic mechanic it operates on is ""look for something while being chased."" In theory, this leads to the player being forced to enter every dark corner, knowing there's a chance what they're looking for might be there. In execution it leads to you running around like a chicken with your head cut off. It doesn't help that Slenderman teleports. A lot of these games rely on spatial awareness, knowing where your enemy is to avoid them, but that's not useful for an enemy that doesn't adhere to time or space. It sometimes feels like the game could kill you at any point if it just felt like it, which, again, is more frustrating.To be fair, other enemies come in that are suspectible to space-time, but these have their own issues. The initial appearance of mask-guy is fun and creepy. But then the game starts pulling in burnt zombie/ghost children, which there really isn't any precedent for in the Slenderman lore. The most annoying part of all this is that at the end of almost every scene in the game, the monster gets you. Which leaves the player wondering: ""Why did I have to retry when it caught me the last five times just so it could catch me in a scripted event?""I will give the game this: while it's only two hours long, it never does the exact same thing twice. Each scene plays by different rules than the others. Which keeps the player confused, yes, but also on their toes.If you still have some affection for Slenderman buried somewhere, this is recommended.			"

Slenderman, a tall man in a suit, without face. From the description it sounds like it can be quite scary but it's not true. From the game ""the 8 pages"" the slender progressed quite well with graphics but that's all. In this game you have to find a girl named Kate. During your searching, you will come across with various buildings or places in which you can find boring jumpscares. The Arrival consists of nine levels in which you have to collect a variety of objects. In the second level you have find nine drawings with slenderman behind your back. If you die, you have to go again, but drawings will no longer be as before, what is for me really bad. The gameplay is seriously short and at that time I flinched maybe 2 times. I think, I have played a lot of horror games and that's why I haven't fear. Anyway, I have to mention dramatic music which gives the game a great atmosphere. Also screams and screeches are a good addition.+ better graphic+ a lot of good places and buildings to explore (not just a forest)+ screams, screeches

												The game starts out strong, very strong. Good atmosphere, right level of terror an puzzle solving that i was expecting. It then slowly degenerates from there. There's really no puzzle solving mid way through the game other then get from point A to B without dying. Some people maybe fine with this, but what made this unberable for me is that it's a short game. My playthrough without rushing was a few minutes over 1 hour. I was not expecting the game to be this short. As well as being short the game doesn't have a story to it. You get a few pickups that give you a few tid bits of what could be a story but frankly you don't even need to pay attention to the story one bit to progress. The ending is very weak as well. No explanations are given, you aren't even given a cliff hanger. It just ends. I picked this game up for $5 so don't feel too cheated. But i would not have gotten it for $10 nor have boughten it again for $5 if i knew what i did now.			"

												I personally had really liked Slenderman as a horror character/myth or whatever you wish to call him. I found his design and behavior to be very intriguing, that was the original reason I picked this game up. I didn't expect too much from it since I had seen a playthrough of it when it first came out, BUT this game has truly stunned me! They added soo many bloody new things to enjoy! New levels, more story, another antagonist, and soo much replay value. I was very surprised at how satisfying the gameplay was, and it did quite a good job of making an erie atmosphere. Now being the manly man I am, I wasn't even scared for a second! But to some people I suppose this game would be considered pretty freaky. So in the end, if you like Slendy and horror games, I would suggest you give this one a go!			"

												Are you too afraid to play Slender: The Arrival, sequel to the PC horror hit that taught us to associate evening-wear with fatal outbreaks of screen static? Well, here’s how to overcome your terror: imagine that Slender Man himself is that awkward person you don’t want to talk to at any given party. As with any social space invader, the guy's core tactic is to materialise silently in front of you, perhaps peeking shyly from behind an object, in hopes of catching your eye. The trick is to let your gaze slide over him to something else in the environment - hey, isn’t that so-and-so from Marketing in the corner? - while stepping casually but firmly to one side.OK, so it’s not quite that simple. For starters, whenever Slender Man appears the screen goes nuts, stretching and splintering as though in the presence of an undersized black hole. Throw in all but perpetual nocturnal conditions and landscapes that are cluttered with loose objects, and you’ll often struggle to pinpoint your adversary’s precise location.More troublingly, Slender Man’s the pushy type. The longer you succeed in escaping his clutches, and the more mission-critical items you collect, the more frequently he’ll show up and the closer he’ll get. And have we mentioned the context-sensitive score and audio effects? Because if that spidery, faceless guy in the suit doesn’t give you the willies, the cacophonous, grating report that sometimes accompanies his entrance certainly will.But what if you’ve butted heads with Slender Man before? Well, The Arrival’s, er, arrival on Xbox One may struggle to impress. It’s largely the same game as on Xbox 360 with negligible visual enhancements and the same problem of diminishing returns. The jewel in the crown is the second level, a re-imagining of Slender: The Eight Pages in which you hunt for notes scattered around a forested area.There are eight notes in total but 10 locations to investigate, some of which swap places between playthroughs, plus a selection of possible starting points, so no two sessions are alike. Prioritising areas in accordance with Slender Man’s aggressiveness is critical: when he’s at his most annoying, the last place you want to be is the Visitor’s Centre, with its plethora of single-exit rooms. There’s a run button to help you out of a jam, but it’s tied to an invisible stamina bar that’s easy to exhaust when the pressure is on.Sadly, the scenarios (some accessed by collecting or interacting with certain objects) that make up the remaining hour or two of playtime consist of slightly limp variations on a gambit that isn’t nearly substantial enough to stand comparison with, say, fellow indie offering Outlast. The third level introduces a second foe who can be kept at bay with the beam of a flashlight; the echo of her footsteps through the depths of an abandoned mine is unnerving, but the basic explore-avoid-collect pattern is the same.A later, more intriguing chapter takes place on a farm estate with some catacombs at one end and a deceptively picturesque cornfield in the middle. It’s relatively elaborate, but it won’t keep you busy for long.If you like horror, but you’ve yet to have the pleasure of Slender Man’s company, his Xbox One incarnation is absolutely worth its budget price tag. The Eight Page template loses its bite with repeat exposure, but the game’s volatility remains invigorating given the genre's continued reliance on scripted scares and sheer grotesqueness. If you’re a veteran of Slender, however, it’s probably best to avoid eye contact. There’s not enough meat on these bones.This review is based on the Xbox One, Xbox 360 and PC versions of the game.

												This game is based on the phenomenon called Slender Man which was born in 2009 as a result of a photo contest announced in a forum. The name perfectly sums up who the antagonist is in these games - a slim, tall man wearing a black suit. Moreover, the creature in question is completely faceless just to add an even more terrifying look to it. Its author claims he was influenced by H.P. Lovecraft, Stephen King and even by the Tall Man from the Phantasm horror films when making Slender Man.Now, the first game was titled The Eight Pages and was released in 2012. Parsec Productions developed and released it on Windows completely independently from Steam. Blue Isle Studios, a Canadian developer company saw even more opportunity in the concept and released it under the name The Arrival. This now has a backstory to the game and, of course, includes the levels found in The Eight Pages. This ""sequel"" was released in 2013 and since have become available on PS4 and Xbox One, too.Now, the gameplay is very simple in Slender The Arrival: we move around in abandoned places (houses, caves, mines, churches) trying to find a way out. In certain levels the objective is to collect something (see The Eight Pages)  - in such cases we have a limited time to complete our goal. Although the game does not give us a time limit the sound of the closing enemies becomes more and more frequent. Not doing anything for a long time or simply getting closer to the completion of our task provokes Slender Man. Our flashlight and the ability to run both remain our best buddies. Greater difficulty levels allow the flashlight batteries to completely run out and our stamina also depletes much faster. While the game has around 10 levels these do not provide us with increasing difficulty levels. In fact, I believe The Eight Pages remains the most difficult level, plus, it is the one that perfectly captures the phenomenon of this Internet-created antagonist.The game has decent graphics thanks to the good-old Unity engine. Nowadays more and more Steam games appear utilising the same technology (e.g. Forest). Still, its atmosphere is where The Arrival shines. Its sound design and the constant threat of Slender Man appearing behind us can easily drive any player crazy. There's no blood / gore in this game unlike in Outlast - once Slender Man is in our perspective the screen gets distorted. The closer he gets the more distortion is applied. The only downside for me was the added levels / backstory. The story did not make Slender Man more interesting. I felt it was unnecessary to include the characters as well as the many collectibles that are scattered throughout the levels and serve as the backbone of the game's story. Additionally, level number 2 (The Eight Pages) is simply so good that the rest of the game can't even come close to it.Still, The Arrival is a superb horror game with a great soundtrack and some pretty neat jumpscares. If you liked Amnesia, Forest, Outlast or similar survival horror games then you should give this a chance.			"

												I've tried playing this game several times, and was let down each and every try. It's not the gameplay that annoyed me, oh no, it was fairly standard for a game of this genre. But the game fails in what it was made to do. Scare you. Now, I'm very easily scared, especially at jump scares. Unfortunately, though, that's all this game comes down to. Jump scares. If you want a quick, cliche horror game for some cheap thrills, then I do recommend this to you. But all in all, this game set out to do something, and fell very short of the goal.			"

												This is one of my favourite horror games on Steam. The graphics are beautiful and the intro level genuinely made me close my game the first time through. Slender is done justice with a faithful recreation of the gameplay from the flash game. My only complaint is that the game is a little too short but with the free DLC recently released I think it is just the right length for the game :).			"

Intro:Slender: The Arrival is a survival horror video game developed by Blue Isle Studios. One could say that it is a sequel to the well-known Slender: The Eight Pages. It was released on March 26, 2013 for PC with a PS4 and Xbox One version released in March, 2015. The game is obviously based on the Slender Man.Story:Unlike The Eight Pages, Slender: The Arrival does have an actual storyline (kind of). You are Lauren, a woman who went to see her friend Kate. Kate's mother passed away just a short time before the events of the game are actually supposed to happen. There's a fallen tree that is blocking her path, but, just like in all other horror games, she, for God knows what reason, decide to continue.The Arrival is built around the ideas of the original game (Slender: The Eight Pages) but with a basic story divided into 5 chapters, all of which require you to find certain objects hidden throughout the chapter. At first, this doesn't sound like anything bad, but after you get killed all over and get more-less the same goal in every chapter you play, it becomes really annoying.Gameplay:Eventually, the game will introduce you to a ""new"" enemy - The Proxy, a creepy kid who blindly follows Slender. Giving you no chance to defend yourself and having both Slender and Proxy awaiting you behind every wall, every door and every corner, you're given almost no chance to defend yourself, much less to escape. This becomes obvious in the 3rd chapter where Slender could camp in a room with the last generator you need to activate.A really positive thing about the game is the combination of the background music, environment sounds and the atmosphere itself. Every now and then you will experience that great combination of those three which will mostly mean that you're about to run into quite a few problems. However, the moment when you hear and feel all of it, that moment is the one that gives you a dose of excitement and it is something you simply can't describe with words. If possible, try it out using the headphones.Sadly, no matter how good the claustrophobic feeling works in some areas, the effect of it is often ruined by pretty crappy and stupid controls. Most gamers understand that you usually do particular stuff with one particular key, but what I couldn't stand in this game is opening doors using the MOUSE1 button which you have to hold and move in a certain direction. Theoretically, that might be a good idea, but when you end up trying it out in the game, it will be really annoying.Graphics:The game is running on the older version of the Unity engine. The graphics don't really stand up when compared to the games from its period. The models and the textures are a bit blurry and are pretty basic. When the camera, however, is twitching and your flashlight is wobbling while you are running through the woods, the final result does look pretty decent. Other than that, though, the game doesn't have much graphically to offer.Verdict:While Slender: The Arrival is a really decent horror game experience in which you spend almost every moment thinking whether Slender himself will be behind this wall or not, it simply relies on the original Eight Pages' game mechanics and goals, be it either the wood with its eight pages or the generators in a mine. It just shows how The Arrival feels simply too repetitive and even though some people will be able to finish the game in around 30 - 35 minutes, it likely will take most people up to a few hours to finish the game. All in all, the game's horror experience is really decent and more-less unique, but due to some of the problems mentioned in the review, the game tells us that even the greatest ideas shouldn't rely on the concept only, but should be expanded and improved where that is possible.

												Slender is arriving but are you ready to stop his arrival ? In Slender The Arrival you play as a girl by the name of Lauren. She gets a distress call from her friend Kate that shows she went missing. So as Lauren you find was taken by the mysterious figure that she named Slender. So its up to you to find Kate and stop Slender. Now hows the gameplay ? Its pretty simple all you do is walk around with youre flashlight and do the diffrent goals to escpape Slender. Its really hard to explain hows the gameplay works because theres many diffrent enviroments and goals to achieve but mostly all you have to do is turn on 6 of that or collect 8 of something. Which i found cheap for a game thats 10 dollars. The game will take you an hour to beat which isnt a bad thing. This games has many easter eggs to find as a hidden level that shows the identity of Slender and many notes to find. Overall this game is a fun horror game and will grant a good hour of fun and much more if you are willing to do a 100% run, it has a great atmoshpere which makes some of the levels really creepy and the Slender enemy terrafying but no matter what i suggest you wait for a discount i give Slender the Arrival a 7/10For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

Slender: The Arrival Introduction – Slender: The Arrival is a true survival horror game that focuses on atmosphere, creepy audio and mystery to set the player on edge throughout the duration of the game. The mystery will draw you in to make you want to learn more about what you are getting yourself into. It sticks to a very basic control scheme anyone can use. You can expect to finish the game in 3 hours of play, but there is decent replay value.1.	Story – 4/10 After fully beating the game once, I was still confused at what I just experienced. You read notes throughout the game which give little pieces of information about what is going on and if you do not collect a large majority of them good luck figuring this story out! I could make some good guesses at what I think the story is, but I could easily be wrong on these also.2.	Difficulty – 4/10 While there is one particular area of the game I thought I might never beat, the rest was relatively easy. In fact the last half of the game I did not get a single game over.3.	Visuals – 7/10 The graphics in this game are decent. If you run the graphics on a higher setting it looks pretty nice and adds a slight touch to the atmosphere which is always appreciated in a horror game. Speaking of visuals, your flashlight will be your best friend in this game. When it is dark, it is DARK!4.	Audio – 9/10 This would have to be the best aspect of this game. If you really want to experience this game play this game with the volume turned up! The game is often quite and subtle which leaves the player feeling on edge as if something is about to jump out at any moment. When the pace picks up a little though, so will the background music. You will often here the antagonist movement long before you see him and in some scenarios hearing a baddie before you see them can be life or death!5.	Replay Value – 7/10 The game is short, but there are pages of plot hidden throughout the game that once you find, are added to a scrapbook you can view at anytime. Items on the map are randomly placed each time, although it does not vary much. This game is also great fun with friends because face it, who doesn’t like to see their friends pee their pants in fright. There are also steam achievements and steam trading cards to be found in this game.6.	Final Verdict – 6/10 The gameplay is very basic, the graphics are decent and the audio excels! The story is very confusing, but does not hinder the scare factor. Playing alone with the volume high is sure to give anyone some good jumps. It is a very short game but I enjoyed it all the way through.			"

												This game is the scariest one I've ever played! It's very dark and frightening, the fear is inside of you all the time because everything is able to happen in the forest, or in the house, or anywhere! Slender is always near and he's watching you. He can appear just in front of you, or on the top of the far mountains ... or in your back. The graphics are EXCEPTIONAL and it's really awesome to play this game. If you like to play horror games alone, this one is made for you!! There is a little negative point though : the story is nice, but very short... and the game is only composed of 9 short chapters so if you are a fast and good player and if you understand quickly what to do in each chapter, you can finish the game in 15 minutes haha. Personnaly I have been a bit disappointed when I realized that the game was over. The end comes very quickly so you have to enjoy every minutes of the game!!76 / 100			"

Screams and screeches around every corner keep you on edgeThis game almost gave me a heart attack.

												StoryIn Slenderman The Arrival you play as Lauren, on her way to visit Kate at her home tucked away in the woods. Upon arrival you find that she is nowhere to be found, in the distance you hear a woman's scream, armed with nothing but a flashlight you head in it's direction. (Arguably a foolish direction to go but hats off to Lauren's ballsy determination) As you progress through each chapter in search of Kate, you will uncover clues and entries that point to darker forces at work than originally thought.GameplayThe Arrival is simple in controls and arguably just a walking simulator, however I don't mean that in a bad way. Each chapter is rather brief but offers a unique environment/atmosphere with clues and entries scattered along the way. Enemy mechanics are rather shallow yet there spawns are random each play-through/death, creating tense moments every time. Glitchy HUD effects add to the scares but at times feel unjustified or ""cheap"" like the games saying ""Alright enough of this running around BS."" Casually simple but certainly scary.SoundsNot entirely notable but definitely chilling. On a rare occasion some sounds clips came across like they didn't fit in the given situation, meaning foot steps when no one was around (Spooky, I know) or rustling leaves that overpowered all other sounds. GraphicsMuch like the sound effects and music, the graphics aren't much to write home about but exceeded my expectations during purchase. Character models and animations are clunky, but when you're gripping your mouse like it's Wonka's last golden ticket and twitch from fright, you tend to let the graphics slide.Replay ValueRandom enemy spawns and objective locations grant more replay value than previous thought. Increasing the difficulty requires a slightly different play-style, but as previous stated Slendermans appearance and HUD glitching feels cheap and at times frustrating.Wrapping UpFreaky and enjoyable. For the price it's a good game that deserves praise for it's ability to scare in what you could argue is a rather casual first person horror.			"

												The start of the game is basically the free 8 pages demo as the first level right after the prologue. I got stuck quite long there, even after recording this video, and that became very repetitive and frustrating to do over and over. However the last scenes, levels, had me on the edge of my seat the whole time, I found them having less repetition and much more exciting than the start of the game.Games like Amnesia found ways of eliminating grind and repetition like that, which reduces scariness, by clever level design. I'm not holding it against Slender, the game was very influential when it came out, but if you want to get it yourself then know it is not perfect. The audio is great, slow drones and ambient sounds, distortion coupled with visual glitches when the Slenderman is close raise the tension to unbearable heights :pSlender: The Arrival My first impression video (my last levels to the end vid is more exciting, but I suppose more spoiler-heavy so I'm just putting the first impression vid here instead).

												If I had to describe this game in one word, it would be ""Flawed"". It's not a terrible game by any stretch of the imagination, absolutely not - it definitely takes what The Eight Pages has done, and makes it even better, upping the spooks, the immersion, the atmosphere, and the detail as well as adding a nicely knit story (well, nicely knit for Slenderfans familar with vlogs like Marble Hornets and TribeTwelve, anyway) into the mix. There are some definitively terrifying scenarios there - being trapped underground with something chasing you, or having to close all the doors and windows in your house in the hopes that something doesn't get in. The game design, the game soundtrack, and the character models are all detailed and gorgeous, making you feel like you're really stuck in the woods alone as the sun goes down. The soundtrack really is stellar, seriously, you owe it to yourself to listen to it at least once - its ambient, eerie tones and soft undercurrents of dread really set the mood. Easily one of the best video game soundtracks of all time in my opinion.However, the game is still, very much so, flawed.Why say it's flawed? Well, the premise of the game is the same idea we have seen so often in Slenderman games - run around, collect things, get jumpscared by Slenderman, rinse, repeat. The game definitely tries to frame this formula in a different light with different scenarios, but I suspect many people will not be able to get over the fact that the first three or four levels, barring the prologue, have you locating items and collecting them while all the while Slenderman is after you, or the Proxy is after you, or both. To be fair, the game does now, after the update, have about as many collection as non-collection levels to it, making it more even-handed, but it still relies on jumpscares, and that's where the other part of its flawed nature comes in. Jumpscares can be done well, or done very, very poorly. Whether or not you think the game handles it well or poorly is a matter of subjective interest, as everyone reacts to jumpscares differently. Generally, people who like Slenderman stories are also people who like jumpscares and psychological horror, and this game treads the line between those two falteringly. Chances are if you're not a Slenderfan, not influenced by jumpscares or dislike them entirely, or do not find psychological horror that frightening, you will not like this game. At all.So do I recommend this game? Overall, yes - if you're a Slenderfan and you like jumpscares. For the Slenderfans in the audience, there is a lot of backstory there, and it being written by the same crew as Marble Hornets is sure to make you bring to mind that vlog's most famous, eeriest scenes while playing the game. For those who find the idea of being hunted and toyed with frightening, or the concepts the game is trying to get across frightening - like being trapped someplace with something dangerous, or being followed by something malicious - there's a lot to like here. However, if you just do not find Slenderman, jumpscares, or psychological horror of the kind Slendy is known for frightening, you aren't going to enjoy it, and there's little the game can do to convince you otherwise. It's kind of like a found-footage film - the way it's designed and shot is not for everyone, the way its story plays out is not for everyone, and the tropes in it are definitely not for everyone. The game is fun, and definitely a decent horror game, but it's flawed. Whether or not that flawed nature adds to its charm or chafes you to no end is a matter of opinion.			"

												A full, immersive horror experience that goes far, far beyond the simple experience of the original. This game will ease you in with beautiful scenery, haunting music and a tense atmosphere, then gradually lead into the paranormal investigation into where the player's friend has gone and what the thing that took her is. From suspenseful searches through abandoned locations, to shortlived breather moments, to intense chases, this game has all the elements needed to excel as a horror.There are some downsides unfortunately. A lot of the scares are jumpscares, the enemy AI can be cheap at times and there are some bugs in need of ironing out. The main problem is the jumpscares, which there seem to be a lot of, in addition to the moments of genuine horror.If you can forgive some of its cheap scares and fully immerse yourself in the heart-pounding experience that is Slender: The Arrival, you will have a short but altogether riveting time playing. Choose to get the terrifying experience over with as soon as you can or spend time gathering clues as to what happened - which in itself is an extremely interesting story.For horror fans, this is perfect. You will dread continuing on, in fear of what is to come. At times there will be nothing, at others your worst suspicions will be confirmed and something horrible will come at you from the darkness. But always the game will be gripping and have a lot more to offer past the first playthrough, from extra content to undiscovered clues.			"

												Made me pee myself. Would play again. Also made me drunkenly yell ""♥♥♥♥ you!"" at my computer more times than I'm proud of.If you played ""The Eight Pages,"" this definitely draws influence from that, but is much more. I was worried that this would be just a more repetitive version of the original game, but I was pleasantly surprised when it expanded on it a ton.Good atmospheric horror - there's really not a whole lot in terms of jump scares (it does have its share of jump scares), but instead does a really good job of building tension. I found myself getting nervous even after figuring out how to solve a given puzzle, because the atmosphere is very effective.If you like the general atmosphere of Myst, this is basically that with more emphasis on creepy.Replay value is also good because certain items are spawned in different places each time, and certain game events/scares change between plays.

												Before playing this game, I've heard and knew a bit about Slender Man and other related stuff, but not much. So that said, I was curious to give this game a go, especially since I love horror games and giving myself a good scare once in awhile. Let's just say that this game did not disappoint. Although it was a bit of a short game as I clocked in around 2.5 hours, completing it in two sessions, I've got no regrets about purchasing or playing the game. It was a good experience I enjoyed, which is what matters. And if I must say so, I was quite a fan of the soundtrack for this game, which I also purchased as well. I find it goes well with the game itself and definitely adds in that scare factor. It can also be creepy as well. I was impressed with the graphics. And controller support was a nice bonus too, as I was initially unsure if this game had it or not.  And finally, I think this game has a pretty good story as well, which is an important thing I look for when I play video games. This game definitely has my curiosity of Slender Man intrigued now as I'm pretty sure I'm going to be looking more into this Slender Man stuff more. All in all, I enjoyed this game and I'd recommend it, especially if you want a good scare. And keeping in mind, I played the entire game in a pitch dark room with headphones.			"

												Creepy, atmospheric and clever game. It's way scarier than the original Slender (The Eight Pages) but it keeps the magic within. (I must mention this: What surprised me the most was the BIG update the creators provided for free. That was like a year ago but it was so nice.) It's got some mistakes like the way doors are opening and the secret level - once you get to it, there's basically no way out. But the story is good, I like all those scary little collectibles and generally the game is just pretty and fun to spend time with. Also, Slenderman freakin' rocks! (And his proxies too.)9/10 - Would play more.			"

												Slender: The Arrival utilizes two basic gameplay mechanics: ""find X of Y in this level"" and ""avoid this monster"" which worked so well in the original Slender: The Eight Pages. Unfortunately, the execution of the second mechanic falls flat compared to the free predecessor: Slenderman often chooses to aggressively teleport in front of the player instead of silently stalking him - a small detail which ruins all the suspense that defined the original. Because of this new feature and several other ""this is not fair"" moments, the game alternates between being cheesily scary and annoying, with the second trait being a lot more common on more challenging game difficulties.It also delves into it's own vision of the Slenderman lore, working hand in hand with the previous game - which could be interesting for Slenderman enthusiasts. Game's own share of secrets and Easter Eggs also helps.Going commercial certainly helped Blue Isle Studios achieve it's goals, because the game looks and sounds amazing. I have a big screenshot folder which I made during the game's initial release back in March 2013. Unfortunately, the optimization leaves much to be desired.Overall I recommend this game to the people who liked the original, because it's more of the same, and from purely consumer standpoint, it's really cheap. If you are unfamiliar with The Eight Pages but interested in the indie game market, I recommend you to play the original and dive straight into this.			"

												Not bad.  Kids are calling this the ""scariest game evar"", although since I'm over 30 I would disagree.  Truthfully, once you understand all the baddie's patterns, it's simple to avoid them.  It is a bit unnerving to see Slendy silently watching you from a distance, but if you've played any ""Half-Life"" games, you'll know what that's like (thanks, G-Man!  Slendy even resembles the G-Man a bit, now that I think about it..)Anyway, the game's ""scare"" factor is all jump-scares, which to me is a bit of a cop-out: of COURSE you're going to jump when the ambient soundtrack abruptly blasts in your earphones whenever Slendy appears.  Just to experiment, I turned the sound all the way off in my headphones and the game was 85% less scary: the tension seems to come from its soundtrack.It's mostly a hunter-survival game with collectable elements, very similar to ""Sir, You Are Being Hunted"", only without a sense of humor.  Still, I enjoyed the game, it's short and entertaining and I bought it on sale for cheap.  Fun to play with a beer after a long day at work and the kids are in bed.  It's not the ""scariest video game evar"", though; no, for me, that would be ""Shadow Man"", a pc game I only play in the daytime, preferably when I'm not alone in the house.  (Sadly, I can't tell you why because I only own it on retail so I can't review it on Steam.)Short version: Slender's short and entertaining (but not for the kiddies.) Grab it on sale only if you aren't rattled by somewat repetitive jump-scares. "

												From the makers of ""Slender: The Eight Pages"" comes ""Slender: The Arrival"" the first commercial Slendy game on steam.Well, the gameplay is simple and similar to the eight pages objective but the visual are greatly improved. The game is pretty short so I will just write a list with the good and bad thing in this game.What I like:+Interesting Story+Nice landscape and decent models.+Good sounds which fits the tense atmosphere+New threat+Difficulty with additional challenges+Achievements are not broken+Has secretsWhat I don't like:-Particle effects are ugly-Some recorded voices are hard to understand-Slendy is still a none moveable teleporting entity with almost no animations.-Slendy tentacles looks like black ink and is not scary at all, only the sounds which feels cheap.-Using a lot of tricks to replace animations.ConclusionWell, it is their first game (at least according on their website) so I think it is a decent horror game and for Slenderfans a must buy!

												Stay away from Slender: The Arrival, even if you are a diehard fan of the Slenderman mythos. It's barebones gameplay, nauseating visual distortions, generic story and average audio it simply does not earn itself a place in your library or your hard earned money. There are far superior horror games with much better stories and mechanics. And, not only does it do all this, it also demands compensation. It is a clear cash in on the hype over the Slenderman mythology. If you need to get a fix on Slenderman, read his stories or go and play Slender: The Eight Pages (it is free at the very least), and if you want to play an actually good horror game play any of the Amnesia series. This game has nothing to offer.For a full report, read here: http://xshadowsaurgaming.wordpress.com/2014/06/28/slender-the-arrival-first-impression/ "

												Honestly, I enjoyed the game but it wasn't what I was hoping. I finished it rather quickly. The prologue is good, a bit of fun and tension, generally quite enjoyable. No real threat.The eight pages wasn't much of a challenge either, slender was around but he couldn't do much harm. It was as easy as looking the other direction.The next part is what stopped me from loving the game really, ""into the abyss"". The games logic is poor at this stage, I can understand that the developers wanted to make it scary but they could have done a better job than simply making the character wander into a mine. I bought the game hoping for some gameplay invloving mostly slender, it would be hard and intense, that's what I wanted. Instead I ended up with lots of little zombie things that would run twice your speed, you couldn't beat them and only stop them from running for a bit. You couldn't hide or run away from them, this would be fine of course if the objective was ""Stay Alive For 5 Minutes"", instead you had to venture around the mine finding six generators. It is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥The ending is extremely poor and the storyline didn't have much going for it. Sure, the game was scary and intense but it was far from what I expected.All that aside, i'm recommending this game because it is still very good regarding the horror genre.			"

												This game is defintely a huge improvement from the original game. Slender the Arrival has a story that's interesting and terrifying, rather than collecting pages. The game also contains many new characters other than Slender-Man, which adds more scary content to the game. The atmosphere itself of the game is to intense and suspensful, unaware of what could happen next. And even if you do finish the game, playing it again is still just as fun. Sounds, characters, landscapes, equipment, secrets, and the graphics are all huge improvements from the original 8 pages. Its a game worth playing, or trying at least.			"

												Overall a thumbs up, but with a few caveats.Firstly, it hasn't aged well. The game is one of those that has been copied, ripped off, homaged and improved on to death. You can find dozens of games that follow Arrival's basic structure, some of which do it better.That's not really fair on the game, though. It's an important creation. Horror games almost died in 2005, when Resident Evil 4 proved a smash hit using horror themes but pure action gameplay. Mainstream studios just buried the idea of horror, and games like Dead Space, Resident Evil 5 and Silent Hill Homecoming all started copying the RE4 formula. It wasn't until Amnesia: The Dark Descent in 2010, and then Slender: The Eight Pages in 2012, where small indie studios proved horror was still immensely popular and was just being ignored by large studios. Between them, a whole cottage industry of Unity-engine first person horror games arose. The Arrival was one of the spearheads of the movement, being a less janky remake of Eight Pages. Go count up all those first person horror games where you have to collect a set number of items from random locations within an arena whilst being stalkd by a monster. Love it or hate it, without Slender, it's likely the horror genre wouldn't be nearly as healthy as it is.But enough context Kalma, how's the GAME?Well, as I say, you've probably played a lot of games like it, and honestly Arrival's not the best. It's short, even after a couple of bonus levels were added. The AI of the entities can be really glitchy, with you being attacked where you really shouldn't be, which can be frustrating and force you to replay large sections. The graphics are ropey, trying for a photorealistic approach but with a low level of detail.What DOES it have going for it, besides its legacy?The audio is fantastic. Deep rumbling, distant unidentifiable animal noises, silence when all you want to hear is *anything*, it works brilliantly. There's a full soundtrack used incredibly sparingly, in tiny snippets. The storyline, while not great, is very in keeping with what general fans of creepypasta will expect. It also manages to cram a tiny bit of variety in its short playtime beyond the 8 Pages formula.End verdict? Buy it on sale, play it with an open mind.			"

This game is sure to leave you with Nightmares and the feeling of being watched (speaking from eperience). I believe this game should be enjoyed and to be owned by people who can handle; intense moments, jumpscares, incredible horror, and more. If you can't handle games with horror, ignore pier pressure.

The biggest problem with this game is yet again, it's another hide and seek spoopy ghost game.  However, there is indeed a LOT of attention to detail to the environments and a few legit decent jumpscares.  Scary atmosphere?  Check.  Weird sorta kinda antagonist?  Check.  Actual, legit horror?  Hmmmm...not sure on that one.  Still, if you're big into creepypasta and Slendy anyway, you probably don't need me to influence you one way or the other.			"

												While maybe not as immersive as games like Outlast, Slender: The Arrival does an exquisite job of setting the mood to the point that the atmosphere alone can be enough to make players hesitate on moving onward through the game, only to super-charge that tension when it becomes apparent that there are very clear and frightening threats to be avoided at all costs in the midst of various isolated and lonely settings, ranging from a simple forest in the dead of night to the dark abyss of an empty mining facility and more.Throughout the game, there are a number of moments and levels far more scary than the others, with occasionally a little silence in between to let you catch your breath. The enemies you shall be running from are frightening and very well designed, each with their own unique mechanics and characteristics.Slender: The Arrival has a very simplistic story on the surface, starting with the player character, Lauren, visiting the isolated home of her friend Kate, only to find her missing and sets out in search of her. However, as the game progresses, small and even subliminal clues can reveal the nightmare fuel behind the horrors you witness.Unfortunately, the game was somewhat short upon release, but a healthy dose of extended and new levels from Blue Isle Studios certainly made up for that problem. It is still not as long as games like Outlast, but the various difficulty settings, achievements and small level of randomisation in the levels will always be alluring for those with the courage to go again.Slender: The Arrival is a worthy adaptation of the original Slender: The Eight Pages game and does an excellent job of making you feel as if Slenderman could be right behind you at any time. The tension and atmosphere are exquisite, the story is chilling and the scares are unforgettable. After all this time, I can still not get enough of this game, and can certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a good horror experience.			"

												Guys!Just want to know, why in version 1.5.6. qality was much more better than in v 2.0.1. The grass is much better painted;2. In v 1.5.6. The landscape in the distance is drawn in 3D, in v 2.0. the landscape is drawn in 2D;3. In the new update has problems with Slender's walk animation (he's just not moving when he approaching).I hope you fix it. ;)			"

												I saw there was an acheivement for beating the game in 45 minutes so I thought to myself: ""I can handle 45 minutes of terror. Lets just jump in the game and run as fast as we can and beat this thing."" 30 minutes into the game, after stumbling upon the ruins of an abandoned house and hearing someone crying inside, I pulled up my big boy pants, turned on my flashlight and ran into the house. Then something jumped out at me causing me to jump out of my chair. I may have peed a little. Will not play again. 10/10			"

												My god. It is one of the best horrors ever. Why?It's got a lot of reasons for this:At the first, I'd like to advice, that this game can be repeatable many times, because bigger part of game is randomized.At the second, Slender man is very mysterious and horrible person, that can freak you on all 100%. This game can send you in the deeps of the ""rabbit and hunter"" role.At the third, ""remake"" and new things. That game has got all things for everybody who's loving the first part, including ""the eight pages"", random, cool slender stuff, and sure... Pages. :D This game has got better graphics, and now it's not so annoying in graphics as other games.And the last one is non-repeatable atmosphere. You will can't just sitting without emotions.Sure, It's got some bugs, but it's not throwing in eyes. Hope, my recomendation helped you!			"

												*Note: this review was written before the 2.0 update and many issues have now been fixed*This is one of those odd games to review. You see initially i was having an enjoyable experience and wondering why this game got lower scores but now that i look back i see some of the outstanding issues. At the beginning of the game I was pretty freaked out, you know, taking my time looking around every dark corner. This was good, the opening prologue level was probably my favourite part of the experience. But after the end of this level that's when things start to fall down. Slowly as you progress through each level the fear factor actually decreases. With brighter lit enviroments as you progress the game it took away some of the worry that i had since i no longer needed to worry about what was in the dark.(BTW i love darkness in games but when you make it so dark it's impossible to navigate i have an issue) Not only does the scare factor drop with the lighting system but when i first watched the Chaser from a distance i was more laughing than scared since the animation was jerky and the AI seemed to be in a state of pants-on-head ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. This strikes me as odd though that an enemy that you will spend a lot of time looking at has crap animation while the Slenderman(the creature you'll want to spend the least time looking at) has proper and well designed animations. The other creature, Charlie, seemed to have near-non existant animations and when he was sitting still it looked more like a something from Doom where it's a 2D images worked into a 3D enviroment.The sound design feels well done with creature and enviroment noises adding to your already tense state. But i stopped for a minute when I heard the sounds from Slender: The Eight Pages. I guess it's supposed to be a callout to the last game but this is a new game and i'd like to hear improved versions of these sounds.Speaking of the last game, I did enjoy the Eight Pages remake level, which did a good job of calling out to the last game while still keeping a sense of originality.Now here's the big one besides the ending, the glitches. Now I only had one real gamebreaking bug but in horror games even if a bug isn't game breaking it can still absolutely ruin the immersion for a player. For example, the first time I played the Eight Pages level I had 7 pages and was freaking out ,worrying about the Slenderman but then I saw him and was baffled when he was about to kill me and then just left. I didn't see him like a retard and walked right into him and ♥♥♥♥ all happened. And I know this isn't supposed to happen since I tested the level other times. Other Slendy bugs were dying from him even though he was nowhere to be seen, him teleporting inside other objects and a weird one where he hovered above the ground. My gamebreaking bug was when I was caught by the Chaser and waited to die but the camera just sat there fixated on the Chaser's face like it had grabbed me. After a few minutes the Chaser started running away with the camera following it's face from the front. This continued for about 7 minutes before i gave up and had to restart the level.We now come to the ending. Now I feel like I could spoil the ending here and not ruin it for you at all but I won't for the sake of fanboys everywhere. What you should know is the ending is a major cliffhanger with nothing being resolved. It just kinda ends. Maybe I could have overlooked this but with the game being obnoxiously short it makes it un-compensatable. It feels like after the ending was actually once a level just a leading to the next level and they were just like, ""♥♥♥♥ it we can sell it like this"" and then just folded in.So all in all,PROS:-Nicely designed enviroments-Atmospheric SFX and music-Very well directed opening-Small enclosed enviroments(buildings, etc...)-Scary and well designed creatures-Interesting secret level-Some genuinly scary momentsCONS:-Embarrasingly short-Buggy creature animation-Poor AI-Massively well lit sections-Repetitive objectives-Too much audio taken from S:EP-Many glitches and bugs-The door opening mechanics-Extremely aggravating to get the secret level-Unsatisfying endingI wish there was a maybe button on Steam because that would suit this perfectly since there are good sequences but it is overall lacking so I'm afraid I can't recommend this unless it's on a decent sale.

												While the game is short, the story is strange and hard to follow, and the game is repetitive, Slender: The Arrival is still an amazing game.You play as a woman named Lauren, who is searching for her friend Kate. While in her house, you find she has gone completely insane and has started drawing Slender Man related pictures all over the walls. Finding a message telling you to head to a radio tower, you begin to walk there, being chased by Slender Man and various 'proxies' of his along the way. You must collect various pages left behind by Kate, then you must enter a mine and activate various generators to escape, while being chased by The Chaser, one of Slender Man's proxies. After that, you begin your ascent to the tower, and upon entering, you are chased by a skeletal figure named Charlie Matheson. Slender: The Arrival is a great game, and the upcoming content looks fantastic. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking to get scared.7.5/10			"

												A decently put together horror game that is far better than the original Slender.Slender games have killed any scariness to Slender-Man, but it was only a matter of time.While the game looks absolutely amazing for a Unity game, there are frustrating aspects to it, such as the absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ai of the proxy that chases you in the tunnel, the repetitive gameplay and scares, and sprinting is slow as♥♥♥♥♥♥ but the story is written by the team who films Marble Hornets and the soundtrack and atmosphere is pretty chilling.  The game previously had problems with optimization, but the Steam version seems to run far smoother.For only 10 bucks, it's at least worth one playthrough, especially the Steam version, with achievements and bonus content. Beyond that though, I don't think I will ever play this outside of the new content added. The gameplay is rather repetitive with the Slender-Man's pop-up scares becoming less scary every time. Still I comend Blue Isle Studios and the rest of the team in making an enjoyable game.			"

												Horror games are often over looked due to bigger AAA titles, and this is sadly one of those games. Slender The Arrival has TONS to offer. I was so sad when IGN and Metacritic only gave it 6 / 10 reviews when this game is actually scary and very well mad. Its a must own for horror buffs, and people looking for something new.My Review: 9.3 / 10 Scary and very graphically detailed, but is very repetitive and short. Still worth It!			"

												This game is very scary, the only complaint I have is the third level, where not only does Slendy try to kill you, but Charlie too...I find that kinda unfair I had all six generators and had encountered Slendy, then had to swerve and get killed by Charlie and start over, maybe update so we get to keep a certain amount of Generators running when we die, other then that I love it, I also am proud that I did the eight pages in 25 mins without dying once, I kept having trouble with that one on the water tower, but none the less I love this game.

												This is the third version of Slender I have played and it really caught me off guard. The first was a demo that consisted solely of the ""8 Pages"" level, which I could not beat for the life of me. The second was a version I downloaded off GoG.com, which ran like absolute garbage. This version is the newest and most stable yet, running like a dream even on the highest settings with my admittedly low-budget graphics card.If you are not familiar with the monster that is Slenderman, well, don't worry, you can still enjoy this quality horror adventure to its full extent. This game got a ton of hate upon release by 2kool4skool pleb-trolls who were fed up with the Slenderman following, labeling it ""shovelware"" because, well, it's fun to hate stuff. Without spoiling too much, Slenderman is a ""Creepypasta"" creation, a.k.a. a Reddit story made up for fun that caught on and inspired an entire mythos of horror fiction, including several fleshed-out YouTube series like ""Marble Hornets"" and ""Tribe Twelve"". Slenderman is a cryptic, extra-dimensional entity that feeds off the energy of children, following them throughout their lives and infecting the timelines of their families and future generations like a supernatural cancer. He has the ability to teleport, and alter the sanity of his victims, up to and including turning them into malevolent slaves. His ultimate motivations are unknown.The game itself is a solid first-person horror adventure, about 5-6 hours long, wherein you play a young woman investigating the disappearance of her best friend. The game-world is littered with high-quality collectibles that flesh out the back story, often vaguely, adding to the creepy and foreboding atmosphere. Levels often contain a commendable day-to-night cycle. In other words, you will start with a sunset and end with pure evening as you progress. The sound design deserves special mention; while the soundtrack is sparse and effective, what is really unnerving is the way everything retreats to an ominous, muted tone when entering interior spaces. You'll know it when you hear it.As far as infusing dread in the player, this is the best game I've ever played. The presentation makes you feel alone, vulnerable and confused. It's never totally clear what is going on, other than you are being baited and hunted. Every new discovery takes you closer to the edge of chaos.It's not without it's flaws, of course. The main character is a woman, but she sounds like a man when she runs. What's up with that? Also, many of the achievements are an unfair test of patience, forcing you to redo certain levels over and over to trigger certain events. Considering there are no saves and death results in a restart, this seems like an intentional middle-finger on the part of the devs.But I digress. If you are looking for an above-average horror game with great presentation and lore, look no farther.			"

												On normal difficulty this game can be completed in around 3 to 4 hours. Factor that in when deciding if the price is worth it.Having said that, this is a disturbing little jaunt into the Slender Man nightmare. The creators deserve a pat on the back for making such a picturesque and harrowing atmosphere.Gameplay is extremely straight forward: explore, read letters, do a certain thing a certain number of times, and (most important of all) RUN AWAY.I would love to see more of the same, except this time with a decent budget and a better variety of tasks. Puzzles, riddles, maybe a little combat with 'infected' people. All in all, this is worth throwing a few quid at. Play it in the dark with head phones on. Times I shrieked or squealed (rough estimate): 10.			"

												I've only played a few Slender games, but this one i can say is the scariest but also the best. The graphics are amazing, the story of the game is really grippping and you feel like Sherlock Holmes. But I can't expalin that without giving away the whole plot of the game, Did I mention this game had me turning to cartoons because I made the mistake of playing "" 8 pages "" at 2 am ? The only annoying is the acheievments are really hard to get, and half don't make sense. This game can be pretty scary but that's what keeps me palying it because I'm not letting a  screaming skeleton girl running at me scare me. Not a game to play if you have anxiety problems, you feel like you are in the game in some levels the jumpscares could possilby make one♥♥♥♥♥♥themselves, my heart pounds even walking around in broad daylight levels. Despite this game being pretty creepy  I can't stop playing it. So, in conclusion, this game is freaky ( well it's a selnder game) but amazing at the same time. Highly  recommend it, just don't do  the 8 pages level at 2 am.			"

												I pre-ordered Slender: The Arrival last year after enjoying Slender: The 8 Pages. As with every game there is good and bad, however mostly bad for this game.First of all the good:The game has a very good horror atmosphere and you are likely to get scared at several points throughout the game. The story was well thought out and when it's sunny in the game, the area does look beautiful. For an indie game the graphics are well done, even on the lowest settings. Also Slender isn't your only enemy too. The music also has variaty too, which is something you don't see much in games. This is where the good ends.The bad:As you can see on the ""popular user-defined tags"" one of them is ""Walking Simulator"". This describes the game pretty well in my opinion. The game also heavily relies on jump scares, which gets repetitive and you just expect it after a while. The only level which actually scared me was level 3-however you soon become aware of the tactics used by the proxy in this level (I won't reveal much more about this NPC as it will spoil the game's twist which I thought was great!). The game is also INCREDIBLY short. LIke most people, I completed it in a little over an hour on Normal mode (keep in mind I am TERRIBLE at games) however when I decided to play through the game for a second time shortly after activating the product on steam instead I did notice they added in a little extra which was great, however it didn't really do much to increase the game's length. The levels are reptitive, it's always collect or do 8 ect. ect..Overall I suggest only buying it on sale (like it is as of me writing this review- it's £1.74 right now) as it's great for a night in with friends and I do regulary make guests at my house play it and it also comes with achievments, steam trading cards and occational contests (the recent one being the Easter Egg contest) however the original price I paid to pre-order this game (which was £20 I think? Can't remember) wasn't enough, even with all the extras.Would I buy the sequel? Yes, but only if the price is reasonable and there is variaty. However Slender: The Arrival is a poor game with very little replay value and you'd probably find yourself quiting about half way through.			"

												Slender the Arrival is a constant reminder of what was and what sould've been for the games predecesor and the game its self. Its few and far between scares, lack of clearly visible story, and lack of any additional content. Make Slender the Arrival a tough buy for any fan of trhe origional Slender the Eight Pages fan, and fans of survival horror games in general. Performance wise, the game is a mixed bag, with a quad core i7, 2 gig nVidia GPU, and eight gigabytes of ram. I got between the pitiful realm of around twenty FPS to what felt like about fourty. It is not a welly optomized game. With this in mind, the graphicaql quality of the game, maxed out on my rig, dosen't really meet the current bar for the genere. It's muddy, and lifeless, despite its seemingly large world. I got very few scares out of the game, and finished in about an hour or so, on easy. Raise the difficulty, and the game batters you. Glitches, unfair diffulcty curbs, and an overall bland narrarative. I was looking forward to this game, for some good scares with slightly upgrated visuals. I got almost no scares, little tension, and sub par performance. Buy this game if you must, butI do regret mu purchase.			"

												Oh man. I wanted to like this game. I'd always heard how supremely creepy the Slender mythos was, and I'd heard good things about the Eight Pages when it was free on the web (though I'd never played it). Alas. Yes, there are a few decent jump scares, but that's about it. Honestly, the most frightening thing about the game is how hot it makes my computer run. I couldn't focus on the prologue because I was too busy wondering if my PC was going to catch fire. In terms of gameplay, there's not much to it. You run around, pick up or turn on things, and try not to die. Funny thing about that, though. Running wears you out pretty fast, or something - I don't know. It's hard to say. You'll be trying to run away from something, and then you're not running fast anymore, and then OH GOD IT'S ON MY FACE. Retry. Retry. Retry. Since key objects are - in most cases - randomly generated around each level, all you can really do is hope they spawn close enough so that you can activate them before whatever thing is after you tries to kill you. Sound like Outlast? It's a lot like Outlast. Except you can't hide from things, and as far as I can tell, turning off your flashlight doesn't dissuade them from running over and clawing your face. Fun! Except not. Also, about that story: you are someone, apparently, wearing a hoodie and recording everything, because found footage, or whatever. And it seems you're trying to find your friend, or something, who apparently is a nut case and likes to draw with chalk on every surface for hours at a time in big scribbly letters. You get hints of something or whatever, but that's about it. Despite a decent score, and a few pretty vistas throughout, this game is really not worth the hour or two it takes to complete it.			"

												This game could've been a really good horror game. Shame it was wasted. Slender: The Arrival is a ""remake"" of the original Slender game, which I found boring as hell, but tons of people praised it anyway. After it blew up, a company tried to make a Slender game, knowing it would sell. They were right about the selling. Unfortunately, there's not a lot to offer here.The game is incredibly short, I beat it in a sitting. You basically just wander through a forest and♥♥♥♥♥♥ and often times run away from things. The two ""panic"" levels included The Eight Pages, and some Generator start up thing. The Eight Pages part is your typical, lame, Slender thing where you find the pages in a poorly randomized world. It's okay, but there's not really a sense of urgency considering you can outrun him easily. The second part, the Generator section, was awful. You get chased by the human like thing who, like, chases you, sits on your face for 3 seconds, then leaves, I guess. I don't know if it was supposed to kill you, but it sure as hell didn't kill me. It's too easy and can be quickly done, first try. The rest of the game drags on in uninteresting walking phases, with a forest fire with Slendy trying to catch you. That's about it. There's a story somewhere in there, about you trying to find your friend, but it just didn't click well with me and all the Collectibles I found I immediately put them away and never looked at them.This game could've been something. It could've been a really soild horror game. Instead, it relies on the jumpscares and the ""look I'm spooky I'm gonna get you"" kinda stuff. I really wish millions of stupid kids never praised the original Slender game. If you're looking for a good horror game, don't bother. The 12 year old kids might think it's scary, but in all honesty, this game didn't make me flinch. The villain is a 10 foot tall guy with no face and a suit with ♥♥♥♥ing tentacles. If you think that's scary, you need mental help.			"

												The most barebones, unscary and uninspired example of a ""horror game"" I can think of. A series of screenfilling unavoidable jump scares and slow AI's chasing you as you ""collect 8 _____"". The fact that people consider this to be a shining example of what scary games are both baffles and disturbs me.			"

												As if Slender: The Eight Pages wasn't scary enough. Slender: The Arrival has taken the original concept of the horror game and took a few more steps further. The jump-scares are certainly worth it, now that you actually HAVE to worry about Slender Man grabbing you with his tenticles. Not only that, our tall friend has a little companion, which adds on to your worries. You are no longer looking at a bleak forest each time you play. You have different levels you can get to, let it be finding the original 8 pages or turning on generators. The atmosphere has certainly become creepier, and I absolutely love it. Not to mention, you have a back story to this whole thing. It isn't like in 8 pages where you are sent off on a quest to find 8 drawings for the heck of it. This game has been promising from the start, and I'm certainly thrilled to have bought it.			"

												I would recommend this game to those who enjoyed playing ""Slender: The Eight Pages"". Or to players who enjoy playing horror games. Similar to Amnesia: The Dark Descent, you have to ""run away"" from Slender in the game. Don't look at Slender without losing your sanity while trying to find pages. This is particularly from one chapter of the game. There are 6 chapters you can play, each dealing with a new ""enemy"" or ""creature"" that you must avoid while turning on or collect whatever it is within the chapter.The only issue with this game is that you may lose lighting. My friend tried to play this game and the game was very dark. The lights within the house and all other lights didn't work. So far I don't know the solution to this problem.			"

												If you like the Slenderman character. Cool. If you liked the original indie game Slender. Cool.Slender The Arrival is the sequel to the massively popular indie game by Parsec Productions. Which to be honest I wasn't too in to. The main problem with this game is how repetitive it is. Almost every level is finding a certain number of items, be it pages or generators. And that's pretty bad when there are only FIVE LEVELS.The game actually has more monsters that just Slenderman, which I commend them for. However, they are rarely seen ingame, which is slightly dissapointing. But for the levels they are on. It's a nice addition.So, overall. Slender: The Arrival isn't the worst horror game ever made, it's got really cool visuals and a decent atmosphere. But it's not the long quality experience that I expected from the game. For the price, you won't be that dissapointed. But it could be a lot better. I would say to give it a look, and judge it for yourself.			"

												A true horror story that chills me to the bone.  Every time I play it, I feel that I shouldn't because I would be too scared, but I also feel like I should because the horror is intense.  I enjoy playing it, but not alone because I scare easily.  I am saving for the oculus rift, so it's going to be much more terrifying when I get it.  The story is a little confusing, but that's not such a bad thing.  Overall, I love the game!			"

												Oooooh, Spooky Slenderman is coming to touch your butt with his ticklefingers!But seriously, this game looked half decent in the trailers and screenshots and what not, it looked like it could make the Slender games actually scary to me, if done right. But unfortuantley, this game is not done right, far from it.You're all familar with Slender right, the free horror game built with unity that was about you running away from the Slenderman, a tall white guy from Internet campfire stories, while collecting pages for some reason. It was ok I guess, despite it being the very defention of jumpscare fest, but it was atleast free. Not anymore. With Slender: The Arrival now you can get chased by a tall white man while collecting pages. But with prettier graphics!This game tries to set up a plot, starting out with you jogging threw the woods to a childhood friend's house, but when you get there she isn't there. Just a buttload of scribbles on the wall. You walk around for a while and eventually Slendypants pops his head up threw a window. Then you have to collect pages, that cause the Slenderman to attack you.First off, for a game that's trying so hard to set up a story, it does a pretty poor job at explaining what we're doing and why we're doing it. Why do we need these pages, what could these drawings by a 4-year old tell us, and why do we want them if they make Slendy attack you? Secondly, I don't really find Slenderman himself that scary, he's just a tall white guy to me,  so it might be  the fact that I'm also very tall and pale thats putting me off. If you were more enriched in the lore of Slenderman then I guess this could be scary. Maybe.But thirdly, and most importantly, the gameplay is just awful. I like to judge horror games partially by how much they can hold up after all the spooks end. Game's like Amnesia and Five Night's at Freddy's I managed to like as I did find them fun to play after I stopped being scared. But Slender isn't one of those games, every single level is walking around, collecting or turning on X of a certain object, while Slenderman jumpscares you, or on one level, you get chased by a human. Rather than running away, from it, you get to stand still for a second and flash your light at it stop it from running at you.Over and over and over. This game was so grating and just plane boring to play  that I couldn't even bring myself to get to final level. The point where I stopped playing was when I burnt to death in a forest fire level, where slenderman appeared several times but I didn't notice because he blened in with the trees. In conclusion, just stick with the original Slender and all it's spinoff games if you found them scary, rather then throwing 10 bucks at this and getting basically the name thing with some pretty graphics.

												Slender The Arrival is based off of Parsec's Original Slender: The Eight Pages. It's much better than other Slender games because there's a story to it and it's more realistic regarding to graphic. The game also has more than Just Slender himself. I DO NOT recommend this game for people under the age of 13, unless you want to have  nightmares or be scared to death. Slender The Arrival has many jumpscares and fast movements. So This is the perfect game if you like Slenderman! Even though this game is pretty much dead now.			"

The final twist is when you realize that the rustling of leaves around you is not from Slenderman lets just say there are others. My final thought is for 10$ nothing can't beat this game and for all you Oculus users this game will scare you to death.			"

												Slender: The Arrival may be short, but the quality of graphics and gameplay make up for It. Appart from the glitches and the fact that 90% of the scares in this game are jump scares and you have the same objective's just like the eight pages did. But  the good thing about this game is now there's a good back-story to this game and i hope that they improve more in the next game if there is going to be a sequel. (Fingers crossed)Rise and take control			"

												A true horror story that chills me to the bone.  Every time I play it, I feel that I shouldn't because I would be too scared, but I also feel like I should because the horror is intense.  I enjoy playing it, but not alone because I scare easily.  I am saving for the oculus rift, so it's going to be much more terrifying when I get it.  The story is a little confusing, but that's not such a bad thing.  Overall, I love the game!			"

												A lot of people who liked this game seem to have played the first one and liked it.  Maybe that's where I went wrong.  I felt that it was extremely short on story combined with wickedly confusing level design and over burdened with jump scares.  When I finished the game I looked at my watch and said to myself, really that's it?  You're mileage may vary, but I would suggest getting Outlast and Whistleblower, Daylight, the Amnesia series, and the Penumbra series instead of this one.			"

												Pretty solid game. Short but effective. The tension builds at a steady pace right up until the end. I loved how time would pass as you progressed, going from day time to night. Was a nice touch, as was the audio. Graphics are slightly dated, but still gorgeous. Of course it has its flaws. Maybe its intentional, but a save function would have been nice. The mine thing felt slightly out of place and a tiny bit forced (to me anyway). I ran into a couple bugs I found related to clicking letters and pausing while they were still open on the screen. Unpausing would cause the screen to go black and stay black. Happened most often at the very end of the prologue going into the next chapter. Not a huge deal, just annoying.Overall, its a pretty awesome game and I hope to see more from the devs.			"

												Slender: The arrival is a fun yet terribly horrible experience. There arent many good horror games these days some examples of some good one are amnesia and outlast amongst others. This game comes at a close top. It has a good mix between tension and jump scares most are well placed and not repeating every 3 seconds. For a short game it gives you a lot of fun moments. It does have some drawbacks as the prive is too high for a game thats 2-3 hours worth of content and has no replay value. It also does come with its fair share of bugs nothing game breaking but you sometimes have to restart the game due to a missing object or getting stuck in a loading screen. I do recommend this game but not at full price pick it up at 50-60 percent off. 7/10 Great game.			"

This update gives a Flashback to how it began, which was needed regarding the mystery above. Apart from that the update also gave the ability to replay the level found in the VCR, as well as a completely new place.This game now has a bit more to discover and play, and I really enjoyed it.11/15 - ""Nice and short horror experience""			"

												Slender The Arrival is the sequel to The Eight Pages. This one is at least 10 times more scary. While some of it is SLIGHTLY repetetive, the game is Great! The graphics are amazing! There are 3 enemies in this game Including Slender Man, A hooded creature (Spoilers if I told you what it was) and Charlie. I was unsure about getting this at first but recently in October there was a HUGE updade and it added a new ending, extra levels, more music and bug fixes. So it is worth your time and £6.99 price tag (unless your from America or some other country that isn't the UK). The story is good and you are better off getting this than downloading The Eight Pages. After all this game contains a level once you complete the game called 'Genesis' which is the original Eight Pages game but Blue Isle Studios has edited it! Which is AWSOME.9/10 - Graet Story, Scary, Amazing Game!			"

												I was really impessed with this little horror treat. Beautiful graphics, great suspense building and effective jumpscares. Only downside, was very brief, could realistically finish it in 2 hours. Took me 3.6 because I'm a thorough explorer and I died a lot... first time I saw Slender I just ran right up to him to say hi... But other than that, it's much better than expected. And well worth it at the sale price of 3.99. I would place it somewhere between The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and Outlast, as far as style and gameplay. If you like either one of those, and a good jumpscare, you'll like this one. The story seemed like a prologue, so hopefully it's just The Arrival and we'll see some fully fleshed out sequels. Definitely tracking this studio to see what they come up with next.BIG RECOMMENDATION!			"

The fact that he's following you the whole time and that you can hear him rustling in the bushes, see him hiding behind the trees. It's like a long wait for him to kill you, because you know he's going to. Brilliant storyline, best atmosphere I've seen in a horror game for a while, terrible jumpscares! Thanks for reading!			"

												Let’s state right away that if you are not interested in Slender Man’s particular brand of horror this is not the game for you. Not much about the mythology is ever properly explained, and without prior knowledge of it you only get half of the experience out of the game. Sure, it’s a slow moving walking sim with some repetitive item hunts and cheap jump scares. But the real horror here comes from the atmosphere, you can never shake the feeling that whatever you do is empty gestures - the Slender Man is already planted in the mind of the protagonist and escape according to the mythos will be impossible. That underlying desperation and hopelessness is what makes the real horror here, not the jump scares. This is something that the game does very well in presenting with its empty and desolate yet beautiful settings, some fantastic lightning effects and of course the nail biting soundtrack. It’s not often you get a horror game where walking in a beautiful sunset feels like an unavoidable death sentence. There are some tedious parts though, especially the second chapter that is a remake of the original freeware title, due to the large size of the map and randomization of the item locations it can take forever to complete. There are only two of these big maps though and when you are past them some of the truly great chapters await.It’s an experience very much recommended for anyone crying from anxiety when watching the Marble Hornets series. Others may not be as forgiving to the uneven quality of the chapters or the cheap way the story is presented through scattered notes, but as a fan of the mythos it's one of the best walking sim horrors you can find.

												Runs MUCH better after the patch, whoever patched this, thank you very much. The game is pretty great but it's criminally short with an unsatisfying ending. Personally it is pretty scary to me, I feel like anyone who wasn't scared at least once is a liar or is tough as nails. the only parts where I got stuck is the vhs part (because of the game not registering myself beating the first video) and parts where it is literally too dark to see what to do. the story itself ties in well with the first game but is also unique in its own right, slenderman is pretty spoopy especially when you're just starting to notice him in the background and he then disappears from sight. the first time he disappeared I was 100% sure he was behind me waiting for a jumpscare but strangely enough the game is pretty restrained for the first couple of minutes, it reels you in with the back-story and the mysterious disappearances. through the hidden level, it's implied that Charlie Matheson (the boy on the lost poster) is, more or less, the slenderman himself though this somewhat contradicts the optional level ""memories."" though this could actually imply through the ending of memories, not that he was killed by slenderman but somewhat acquired by the powers of the slenderman, it is also possible he becomes one of the proxies which could explain their ability to be seemingly everywhere and the fact that one of the proxies appears only after you pick up a train set and a rather familiar stuffed bear. That’s what makes this game interesting and fresh, not just the haunting, yet beautiful visuals, or the interesting story, or the homage’s to series like marble hornets and everyman hybrid, or even the ""scary"" internet slenderman, it's the amount of unanswered questions to be debated. i really hope for 10 or 15 dollars or whatever it is you give this game a spin, maybe if it's on sale and you're interested. This kind of game will simply keep you looking over your shoulders and the tree topped hills for weeks to come, looking for that mysterious, faceless man. Also as a side note, ♥♥♥♥ that cellar and give me back my twenty dollars spooperman.			"

												Slender: The Arrival is good but really dark game. For example the ending part where your at the tower it's pretty dark, you can't see and all the stuff like that. I recommend this game because it has objectives like eight pages, you have you find eight pages to finish the level.What I really don't like about Slender: The Arrival is that you only get a flashlight no weapons. What I also recommend this game for is that there is detail in characters and the terrain. But what really bugs me is the shadows. It's all block like, kind of like Minecraft. So I don't recomend putting shadows on your game because it's like putting Minecraft in Slender: The Arrival.The Chaser (Kate) will chase you around the whole map in the 3rd level, you might want to watch out. Lauren is the main character of this game, she is your player. she looks for Kates strang dissaperents. Thats why shes the, she has a reason to be there.  "

												This game...I very much like this game. Slender: The Arrival is a basic survival horror game that relies heavily on jumpscares. But that is not a bad thing. I found myself being caught off guard at moments when I believed Slender nor his Proxies were going to show up. The way this game has impeccable and building atmosphere definitely adds to the stress and pressure the game puts out, also while increasing the creep factor. The way it has subtle story telling, and links itself in a major way to its predecessor, Slender: The Eight Pages, is amazing. I would definitely recommend this game to Slender fans and horror fanatics alike. 8.75/10			"

												Let’s state right away that if you are not interested in Slender Man’s particular brand of horror this is not the game for you. Not much about the mythology is ever properly explained, and without prior knowledge of it you only get half of the experience out of the game. Sure, it’s a slow moving walking sim with some repetitive item hunts and cheap jump scares. But the real horror here comes from the atmosphere, you can never shake the feeling that whatever you do is empty gestures - the Slender Man is already planted in the mind of the protagonist and escape according to the mythos will be impossible. That underlying desperation and hopelessness is what makes the real horror here, not the jump scares. This is something that the game does very well in presenting with its empty and desolate yet beautiful settings, some fantastic lightning effects and of course the nail biting soundtrack. It’s not often you get a horror game where walking in a beautiful sunset feels like an unavoidable death sentence. There are some tedious parts though, especially the second chapter that is a remake of the original freeware title, due to the large size of the map and randomization of the item locations it can take forever to complete. There are only two of these big maps though and when you are past them some of the truly great chapters await.It’s an experience very much recommended for anyone crying from anxiety when watching the Marble Hornets series. Others may not be as forgiving to the uneven quality of the chapters or the cheap way the story is presented through scattered notes, but as a fan of the mythos it's one of the best walking sim horrors you can find.

It is a huge improvment over the original slender game, largely for it's addition of a real story. If you take a little more time to investigate you find a much deeper story than the game appears to have, with hidden collectibles all over the maps.

												I'd start by saying I used to be a huge fan of everything slenderman, I triend making my own slender game, I played this game like 5 times. But it took me until now to realize that this game shouldn't still be $10. Sure it's not much but the game overall is short. I beat it in one sitting and although the scares are pretty good you shouldn't expect a ton of content. But on the brightside the story is pretty good and you'll find more story if you pay attention to detail. One annoying thing is that although the game doesn't look... great. And there isn't much other stuff going on the game can still be a bit taxing on slightly older hardware. I currently have an HP Pavilion G6 which isn't a bad laptop but it is from about 2013 or so and because the Unity 3D engine isn't greatly optimized the game didn't run very amazing. Although I have said all of these negative things about the game I'd still go ahead and reccomend getting it but only if it is on sale. I don't believe it should still be $10.			"

												NOTE: I had to set some custom launch options to et the lighting to work AT ALL in this game, so if you're looking or a game to quickly install and work flawlessly right away, you should wait until these errors are resolved by the devs. This game does a good job at reviving The Slenderman as a creepy and mysterious being, unlike the Slenderman we're bombarded with on all corners of the internet, generally in the form of poorly written crepypastas or a pony fan-fictions. This game takes the basic gameplay mechanic from the original Slender: The Eight Pages and gives it some beautiful scenery, smooth graphics, and new environments and scenarios to make it a fresh, (and eery) new experience. The story is very cut and dry, but the lack of backstory creates a feeling of unknowing, which adds to the uneasy and creepy atmosphere. When I bought this I was expecting a slightly modified version of Slender: The Eight Pages, quite honestly, but when the screen turned bright and I was suddenly in the middle of a beautiful forest at dawn, I was slightly surprised. I was even more suprised as I suddenly realized it was dark, as I walked deeper into the forest with no flashlight. The atmoshphere this game creates right off the bat is amazing, and left me wanting to play more. I would definitely reccomend this game despite its bugs.			"

												Slender: The Arrival (S:TA) is a game with a history that maybe well-known to web enthusiasts. The story of Slender, or Slender Man to be precise, was originally an internet phenomenon that had people grasping for the story of this illusive Slender Man that has been ""found"" in writings, pictures, and videos. People have collectively created or contributed to a character of horror through the internet by way of social networks, YouTube and word-of-mouth. S:TA is the next medium in the mythos of Slender Man as it allows you to explore a world where Slender Man exists. You're objective is to uncover the story, piece it together and above all, survive! This game is very atmosphere and has a great level of detail for an Indie game so dive in and let yourself be taken by Slender. It should be noted that the original game, Slender: The Eight Pages, is presented as a bonus campaign called, ""Genesis.""			"

												It is a wonderful horror game. Based on Slender: eight pages, this game enhances everything include visual presentation, sound effect, special effect...etc. If you like eight pages, don't miss this one.Attention: This game adopts JUMP SCARE technique heavily, if you can't accept, then skip this one. Players in this game have to achieve certain goal, collect eight pages for example, in dark environment, and the freaking Slender Man will WARPS around to hunt you. When you wander in dark forest, you don't know when it will appear, all you can do is complete the goal as fast as possible and pray, you will be nervous all the time. When you see it, the screen will distort with freaking sound, a creepy man with no face, unusually slender body that definitely not a human, stand still in darkness, it will freak you out, and you can't look at it too longer or stand still too, run for your life, otherwise it will capture you. The tension, the uncertainty, the pressure to complete goal under creepy atmosphere, all of these make terrifying experiences outstanding, it works perfectly to scare people.The more you approaching the goal, Slender Man will warps more close to you and more frequent, you will be capture easily one step before achieving the goal, you may retry many times to walkthrough a episode, it somewhat difficult and it's on purpose, ""How long you can last"" is the core intention for this game, but sometime it may cause frustration, repetitive gameplay due to diffculty may ruin your terrifying experience, I suggest play it on easy if you are casual player or want to keep terrifying experience FRESHLY.

												Good to see the game is fully optimized in the 2.0 update.  This is a great follow up to the 8 pages with updated graphics and atmosphere.  Initially the game seemed to aim at a more photorealistic approach but with bugs and poor optimization.  Along followed updates to the game with better optimization but with sacrifices to the games photorealism and effects.  Hopefully another follow-up to the game will hit that mark of photorealism.  Overall the game is still great and the developers deserve recognition for putting the effort into keeping the game updated and fully supported for optimization on 3 platforms now (not many small development teams do this).

												This game is a great game for anybody that is into the legend ""Slender Man"" and i highly reccomend it to the average horror lets player. I think that Slender: The Arrival, was a huge step forward into the horror game franchise. If you have not tried Slender The Arrival i reccomend you do asap. If your steam wallet is looking empty, there are times when you can get Slender The Arrival on sale around most of the holidays. This game is a great game for anybody that liked Slender: The Eight Pages. If you dont have the minimum system requirements and own any console like Wii u, Xbox 360, Playstation 3 then you are able to buy the game later this year. Also, if you own the oculus rift it has a setting where you are able to play using the Oculus Rift. All you have to do is type this in the console: toggle VR, when you type that then you will enable virtual reality/ Oculus Rift. This game comes out with updates that add on to the original game so that you always get a new experience. The graphics in Slender The Arrival are phenominal for a horror game too. Again if you haven't tried Slender The Arrival, i would reccoomend that you do so now.                                             Game Score: 9.8 out of 10			"

												9.99 is a bit much, but if you're a fan of Slender it will probably be worth it. The game is certainly creepy. It's not as elegant as, say, Amnesia, but it still has its moments.There's just something about a non-moving, faceless monster that almost looks human that just terrifies me to my core. The music and sound are perfect and the story is cool to figure out. I don't know if it's because I bought it before it was on Steam, but you can use the console with ~ to access cheats. You won't get achievements, but hey, it's available if you want to explore the game's design.			"

BUY IT! (If you have the braveness and 8,99€ left!)In ""Slender: The Arrival"" you play as Lauren, a friend of Kate, who disappeared in one night.You, as a good friend, try to find her - but you notice that you be followed...by Slender.There is one way to kill him - but you don't know how.!SPOILER ALERT! Another friend, called ""CR"" trys also to find Kate and he knows how to end this!Slender: The Arrival - you are special, but not that special. You have about 3 scary things - Slender. Playtime. Soundtrack.++ It's Slender++ It has finally a kind of a (good) story+ the soundtrack is good and creepy+ the control isn't that good, but not too bad+ you can find notes, letters (which are important - to understand)+ the graphic is really nice+ you can play 6 levels with a nice atmosphere+ EXTRA: If you play with a friend => much more fun!+ Easy achievements (in my opinion)- playtime of about 1 hour (if you run through the sh.it) which isn't worth 8,99€- Hardcore modus isn't so extremly hard...made it in 3 attempts- story is hard to understand...in the first or second run- no more fun to go into the forest... THANK YOU!- not really a big replayability factor- ""Shift+W""-buttons are dead- don't use the soundtrack as alarm clock.- 6 levels with Slender...it hears nice, but you will get bored fast (if you play more than 3 times the whole game)""Slender: The Arrival"" you deserve 6/10!

												7.7/10 - One Of The Scariest Games You Can Play! Top Horror Contender!This game is pretty impressive; it uses elements I really don't like such as dark areas to explore and the use of flashlight. These are both usually recipes for failure but this game executes these features really well. It's still cumbersome to navigate the maps and find the clues though, so if you are easily frustrated with that like me; be prepared.The controls and graphics are definitely the best part; the maps are brilliant in color and lighting which really sets the mood and creates a fear factor.I'd pay $10; usually on sale for $2 which is a steal!

												I must admit, this game looks and controls very, very nicely. However, the gameplay reuses the original Slender's ""Collect all the pages"" in levels far too many times, the story feels rather shallow (they introduce several characters that you never meet, all of which who hunt for and are then hunted for the fabled Slenderman- and you're just another one of them), the graphics- although they look nice- look to have all been taken from various free asset packs I have seen before, and... who was that guy in the hoodie who chased and attacked me?Overall, the game CAN be fun, but all-in-all, it's rather bland and repetitive. This is one of the few games where I'd reccomend you watch someone else online play (without commentary is usually best)- you'll probably get the same experience either way.			"

												Because of the shortness of this game the developers decided to make this game super cheap. especially the third chapter. Even on easy difficulty. I am a kind of person who do not remember roads easily and how chapter 3 level is made like a maze with two enemies who run much faster than you do doesn't help it.Overall it was a very frustrating experience for me rather than scary.

												Slender the arrival is a horrible game. Almost everything in this game pisses me off to no end, and made me angry that I wasted 10 bucks on this awful ""horror"" game.THE GOODThere are a few good things about this game. One is the graphics. The graphics, while unimpressive in the lower settings, looks GREAT in the higher settings. The best parts of the game were walking around in the lit areas, exploring the forest at your own pase, as slender does not appear in these sections. It is a shame that they are very short. The last thing I like is the is the very first level in kate's house. You start out in the sunset, walking to an abandoned house as the sun slowly goes down. Once you get in the house, it's pitch black. You then find a flashlight, and can explore the house as much as you like. One of the rooms is locked and once opened, causes a great scare involving the slender man watching you explore the room outside from the window. Its a very creepy opening and makes a great first impression. Shame the other levels were not like this...THE BADHere's the fun part. Lets start out with it the biggest flaw that will ruin every horror game. IT IS NOT SCARY AT ALL.all the game consists of are cheap, and I mean CHEAP jumps scares that did not startle me at all. Now let me explain something: Jump scares can be well made. If the game uses the features and mechanics found in the game to make the jump scare, it can be done extremely well. Great examples are: Resident Evil 1-4, Outlast, and SCP containment breach. This game however, does not do that and goes for the cheap jump scares found in most♥♥♥♥♥♥horror movies like Insidious and the new Paranormal Activity movies. Another thing I hate is the gameplay.  I could explain it to you but ill just summarize the games objectives for you. In the second level, guess what you have to do? Get 8 pages. In the third level, guess what you have to do? Turn on 6 generators in a large map. In the fourth level, guess what's next? YOU HAVE TO CLOSE 8 DOORS AND WINDOWS!!! Its just the same task over and over and got boring very quick. now lets talk about difficulty. This game is hard. But not the good kind of hard that tests your skills or anything, Im talking about INSANELY cheap deaths. There are times were a character who is not slender man (whom I cannot say the name of as that would be spoilers) chases after you and jumps on you, leaving you limping for a few seconds. But sometimes out of the blue, SHE WILL KILL YOU WHEN SHE JUMPS ON YOU! There's nothing that tells you ""Hey, your going to die if you get attacked again"" and  also, you do not have a certain amount of times you can be attacked, believe me, I tested it. The same applys for the slenderman himself. Sometimes he will appear and give you a chance to escape, or sometimes he will say ""♥♥♥♥ it"" and insta-kill you. This is extremely frustrating in the final level where he appears right in front of you, making you either barley come out alive, or escape, but to then be insta-killed by his damn tentacles. Finally, the game is very short. wanna know EXACTLY how long it took me to beat this game? 58 MINUTES. Sure, my recorded hours say 2, but that is only because I spent a hour testing the games settings to see which would run best on my laptop. While I was happy as this experience was over very fast, its bad for the people who somehow enjoy it, as there game will be over in a flash.THE VERDICTThis game is honestly, the worst horror game I have ever played. Don't even buy it on sale, unless you somehow get it for free, or get it gifted from a friend,it is not worth a penny. 2.5/10 AVOID AT ALL COST!For more reviews, go to our true reviewers group:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/truereviewI apologize for most of the poor gramar found in this review.Also, lets face it, the only reason this game is popular is becuase that retard Pewdiepie lets plays the slender games 24/7.

												A terrifyingly unfrightful game which has you, a silent protagonist, look for his friend ""Kate"", investigate an area while picking up 8 pieces of paper while you're stalked by a mentally challenged individual who wears a sock on his head and a suit. Lots of static for the faint of heart, plenty of eerie low rumbling sounds in dark areas and a generic world that forces you, the player, to ""immerse"" yourself into is something that the game offers. If one were to look for a decent horror title which does not base it's horror of a drearily paced, monotonous environment flicking switches and travelling as if the main character has a third of his thighs removed thus causing a wobbly running effect then it would be better to go back to Resident Evil. Or Evil Within. Or Amnesia or Penumbra! Those are nice titles.TL;DR avoid if you find Five Nights at Freddy's boring, purchase if you are easily frightened by lame indie titles.Now, give me those downvotes now you rabid fans.			"

												A bone chilling game to the end. Gamers will experience what true psychological horror is like when they play this game. The game itself will not let you keep thinking about it, it's the origins that will letyou think about it. Slenderman is a very popular mythos spread across the web, especially on some well-known forums, such as Creepypasta and many others. This game, however, completes it by making it a chilling experience to finally complete the Slender sage. What's more is that the slender saga is not even completed yet. They say there's about to be the sequel to this soon. Anyway, they added more content to the levels, in order to make the experience even more epic. I really recommend this game to many people, especially horror fans. This game may be of the same horror class as Outlast; a lot of jumpscares, but from a totally diffrent perspective.			"

												The Arrival features true survival horror gameplay; forcing players to explore human emotions in an unsettling, haunting world. This is a game about survival - use your instincts to get out alive. The Arrival pushes gamers further over the edge past what they experienced in the first game with more levels and improved visuals as well as an engaging storyline.			"

												If you're looking for a fruitful, new, graphically amazing version of Slender, then this is for you.I enjoyed it immensely. I was actually able to follow the story even with being distracted by my stream since I streamed the whole 4.2 hours I currently have on it.I was able to jump right into it and understand it and enjoy it, so that's a plus for a simple minded person like me. xDRatings:Gameplay: 4/5 (I would have to say 4/5 because it was an amazing story but short lived game! I really hope that they make more since it is titled ""The Arrival"", but who knows! Still great gameplay though!)Graphics: 4/5 (Putting this game on top quality makes it beautiful, sometimes at night with the flashlight things look a bit funky but not enough to affect the score greatly. Slender and Charlie definitely had me running away with how good they looked.)Storyline: 5/5 (I personally really enjoyed the story and I was able to keep up with it. It immersed you in every part of the story to so you could either relive it or create it. For such a short timed game, it was definitely a good story keeping in mind it incorporates Slender.)Sp00ki level: 5/5 (I'm easily scared but I would still even give it a 5/5 because Charlie is VERY spooki when you're trying to do stuff and he comes and screams in your face. Slender is a little unfair and unkind at some points, he wouldn't even square up and fight me... BUT oh well. All the characters are definitely spooky and will rustle your jimmies.)			"

												Not too bad of a game. The game is actually quite scary, mostly jump scares but the atmosphere is really good too. The sound can be set to surround by many of the ambient sounds like the wind dont come from the rear channels, and so the surround sound is a bit lousy. The graphics are surprising realisitic. The atmosphere of the game is what makes it really good and the lurking enemies can be quite a challenge. i had to set it to easy to make it through getting the eight pages. Finished the game in one day, but it wasnt bad for a low priced game. Not much replayability but good once through. The story is interesting enough.			"

												A bone chilling game to the end. Gamers will experience what true psychological horror is like when they play this game. The game itself will not let you keep thinking about it, it's the origins that will letyou think about it. Slenderman is a very popular mythos spread across the web, especially on some well-known forums, such as Creepypasta and many others. This game, however, completes it by making it a chilling experience to finally complete the Slender sage. What's more is that the slender saga is not even completed yet. They say there's about to be the sequel to this soon. Anyway, they added more content to the levels, in order to make the experience even more epic. I really recommend this game to many people, especially horror fans. This game may be of the same horror class as Outlast; a lot of jumpscares, but from a totally diffrent perspective.			"

												A fantastic remake of the original Slender game. The graphics and sounds have been remade and Slenderman has never looked better. The maps are big, well detailed and beautiful.But the game has lost some of the original charm that made it so awesome. The scariest thing about the original Slender game was its simplicity. Find 8 pages, that is it. Slenderman was truly frightning and I often crapped my pants when he appeared. The graphics are beautiful, but the downside is that you are not as frightened. You can easily break Slendy. He will rarely ever appear in front of you. All you need to do is walk straight and only look back a couple of times. I spent 40 minutes walking around the 8 pages level searching for the last page, with Slendy behind me. Not once did I feel scared and when he appeared in front, i just turned around and said nope.avi.Granted, the abandoned mine was compensation. That was a truly horrific experience. Worthy remake of the original, with beautiful visuals and sound, but a part of its original charm is gone.			"

												Slender: The Arrival is truly a jump scare master piece, from grapics to gameplay, It has it all. Seeing how a 7-16 feet tall (said to be actuly estimated hight) Suit wearing blank white face man is truly creppy, disturbing and frightening most of the time. Slender man phisicly is showing what he can and will do you, like chaseing you around a park looking for eight pages, sending in   his PROXY helper who is really your childhood friend, To even hunting you down endlessly in a forest fire. Even he has special moving animations spicifcly triggerd when you get more objectives compleated, like a huntching over animation or A very freakishly tentacle(s) appearingout of his back when almost caught. Not jumpscarey enough? Play on HARDCORE as he will NEVER let you run away from is grasp......I truly recomend this game to any Slender fans or people who like to play just for jumpscares. 4.5/5......9/10. Just perfect.

												Slender: The Arrival is an expansion on Parsec's original game and a much better one at that. The story is expanded into episodes/levels, with no save sections in the middle of a level meaning you must complete the level for the game to 'save' your progress.Its use of a handheld camera POV makes the game feel very Blair Witch and when the Slender Man appears, I dare you not to soil your pants! A great frightening game.			"

												Slender the arrival is a nice horror game, no matter how many times you've played this game, there will always be something new everytime you load a level, that bloke called Slender isn't slender at all or maybe his suit makes him look a bit chubby, I don't know. On a brighter note, that chick, Kate, looked good, but that squirtler named Charlie was as annoying as the Slender. If you don't like horror genre, play this game, you'll change your view about horror games10/10 Would punch Slender in a face, but the pitiful knobface doesn't have one.			"

												Two years after this game was released, it's still an incredible, chilling experience.Slender: The Arrival is THE Slender game; a simple story with a backstory that leaves you with more questions than answers... but that's what makes the mystery all the more enticing. BEAUTIFUL graphics with such simple details. You view the world through a video camera in a 'Blair Witch Project' atmosphere.The environments are stunning during the day; a beautiful forest in what looks like upstate California with fall leaves, sunlight filtering through the branches and lensflares on your camera. But then at night, the beauty is tarnished as you're alone and hunted in an ebony black wasteland of wood, isolated and with nothing but a flashlight to protect you.Slender isn't the ONLY one after you in this game either...A bit of a scavenger-hunt game with find-it tasks, but it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Slenderman approves!			"

												The Arrival features true survival horror gameplay; forcing players to explore human emotions in an unsettling, haunting world. This is a game about survival - use your instincts to get out alive. The Arrival pushes gamers further over the edge past what they experienced in the first game with more levels and improved visuals as well as an engaging storyline.			"

												I don't scare easily at all. Horror movies make me laugh most of the time. The last time I can remember being terrified was when I watched Poltergeist as a kid--my brother had clowns on his side of the room. Well...screw you, Slender! This game scared the♥♥♥♥♥♥outta me (and my 14 year-old son who was watching). Played for about 15 minutes and had to stop to let my nerves calm down.I'm only on the second ""level/chapter/whatever"", and it's just brilliant. Best scares I've had in a game ever (Silent Hill previously held such honor).I don't know what the original version was like, but this updated offering is gorgeous. The bloom effects and lighting are quite nice. I will say that the character model shadows are pretty pixelated, and the ground seems very low-res, but otherwise it's a terrific looking game.Seems like there is controller support, but for some reason mine wouldn't work (Xbox 360 controller for Windows). Not a huge deal, but could be a deal-breaker for folks that only play controller-supported games on their own makeshift ""Steam Machines"" (like my brother).Excellent game, with superb atmosphere, lighting, sound, and CREEPINESS! If you're looking to be scared, then this will do the trick.			"

												A fantastic remake of the original Slender game. The graphics and sounds have been remade and Slenderman has never looked better. The maps are big, well detailed and beautiful.But the game has lost some of the original charm that made it so awesome. The scariest thing about the original Slender game was its simplicity. Find 8 pages, that is it. Slenderman was truly frightning and I often crapped my pants when he appeared. The graphics are beautiful, but the downside is that you are not as frightened. You can easily break Slendy. He will rarely ever appear in front of you. All you need to do is walk straight and only look back a couple of times. I spent 40 minutes walking around the 8 pages level searching for the last page, with Slendy behind me. Not once did I feel scared and when he appeared in front, i just turned around and said nope.avi.Granted, the abandoned mine was compensation. That was a truly horrific experience. Worthy remake of the original, with beautiful visuals and sound, but a part of its original charm is gone.			"

												I'm really not into survival horror and even I fell for the ambiant creepiness some of the time. At first when you don't know what's going on it's great, and if you can suspend disbeliefe enough to ignore the obvious mechanics- hear footsteps, shine flashlight, see static, run- it would be great for a while. Unfortunately, after you have the monster figured out he's just a bit of an annoyance in locating the sometimes frustratingly well hidden quest objects.Good for an hour and a few jump scares even if you generally dislike the genre, fantastic if you're actually into horror games.

												The Good: An incredibly scary game that will make you jump out of your seat more than once. Great atmoshpere and one of the creepiest antoganist in gaming. The Bad: Very short game. Your looking at 1 hour to beat the game. Their is a hardcore playthrough but that only takes you so far. In addition the game can be very frustrating with a lot of cheap deaths, the game seems very dependant on trail and error and luck. Conclusion: A 'good' very short game that fails to really live up to its potential.			"

												When I first came across this game, I was extremely excited. Finally, a Slenderman game with an actual story other then some random chick gathering pages. Slenderman himself looks amazing in this game, (The only complaint I have is that the tendrils are lacking in their appearence.) and also, he's not the only one you deal with. The effects of coming into contact with the Slenderman are intense, much so that if you're not even expecting it, could rip you out of your seat instantly. You CAN get trapped. Slenderman does more then just teleport. Though, I do give this game a definite thumbs up, there is room for improvement. Falling through floors, Slenderman freezing in place and ruining cutscenes... there's some mishaps. But over all, definitely give this game a try. Beware, Slenderman can instantly kill you in this one; But isn't that realistic? ;)			"

												Slender: The Arrival could have been something great. With a much larger dev team than the original Slender: The Eight Pages, and a story written by the creators of the wonderful Marble Hornets YouTube series, you'd think it would be pretty awesome. But unfortunately, while the graphics may be very beautiful, and while the atmosphere may at first feel very foreboding and creepy, the actual scares aren't very, well, scary. The Slender Man isn't a threat, he's an annoyance. To overcome him, you simply have to look away from him, and keep your distance. As long as you adhere to those two rules, there is NO WAY you can fail. And The Chaser isn't any better. All you have to do is simply shine your flashlight at The Chaser repeatedly to stun her, and then run away. These two characters aren't enemies, they're pests. The only things standing between you and your goal in a horror game are the antagonists. The point of a horror game is to be scary. When you can avoid your antagonists so easily, it makes the game not scary. And when your horror game isn't scary, that mean's you have completely failed. Not only are the scares lackluster, but so is the gameplay and story. The missions consist of finding eight items or activating six generators while avoiding the Slender Man or Chaser (which, like I said before, isn't very difficult), or simply walking from point A to point B. The objectives are very repetetive, and combined with the lack of tension aside from a few cheap jump scares, the missions are boring and not very fun. Slender's story fails as well because everything feels very pointless. Why is your character trying to find eight pages? Why doesn't she just turn around and leave? Why are we supposed to believe that a radio tower is a safe place aside from the fact that the game just tells us that it's safe? All of these questions (and more) are never answered. The writers of the story (Troy Wagner, Tim Sutton, and Joseph Delage) said that the development team warped and manipulated their original story which, if true, might explain the poor narrative quality. Combine the lack of scares, shallow story, repetetive gameplay with the short time it takes to complete the game (45 minutes-1 hour), and you have one huge letdown of a game.			"

My In-depth ReviewI played the Unity Prototype when it was first release. Comparing it to this is like comparing how a Bike to a car. So there is some hardcore difference! it is exciting that the original developer got to bring this title to reality & sell it on steam.I was little bit disappointed with the result, but kind of was not expecting much.... so here is my review. enjoy Visuals  Were great, the outdoors had a very beautiful feel/look.  but Indoor environments the textures were extremely buggy. With low res images and lack of detail in geometry. The problem with first person games is that you are going to see the environments up close… technically meaning that attention to detail is important.But with Slender: The Arrival it heavily lacked the amount of polish and overall looked a slighty improved version of the prototype. (Talking about Gameplay/feel, not the features they added ontop)GameplayAt its core, it has extremely simple easy to follow gameplay. There are at times when you wish there was alittle more. But overall it pulls it off. Replay ability? Not really that much, the game is really empty at its core once you have completed it. Nothing really new you could gain by playing it again. The only thing is if you wanted to get all the achivements. But even that is a feels like a grind/chore when you have nothing new to keep your interest. Final thoughtsThe game is a fantastic achievement, however I don't really think i can justify it as a finished game. Gameplay and mechanics... Yes that is finished. But lacking a good solid art direction in the indoor sections hinders my decision on it been finished. (ie: less repeating assets, less pixelated textures, more detail in the Architecture structure of the buildings. (for example in the mine). as there really was no story to tell in that environement that you could see. It was dull uninteresting environement with typical random decal textures of Graffiti  sprayed everywhere. and repeating assets, no evidence  what so ever of who lived/worked here before. it seemed the developer simply duplicated assets around the level and rotating them around a bit. without thought of level design from the players perspective.If you do end up getting this game. I guarantee you will get a fright out of it during some point of gameplay however you will eventually see the small holes that shine through that strip it the title of a ‘AMAZING game’ but rather calling it a good game.Thank you.

XD I can recommend this game to everyone who is interested in:- (Supernatural) horror- Games with a deep lore- Hunting achievements- Taking screenshots (I definitely liked the sceneries, they really add to the 'creep-factor' of the game).- Jumpscares			"

												Slender: The Arrival could have been something great. With a much larger dev team than the original Slender: The Eight Pages, and a story written by the creators of the wonderful Marble Hornets YouTube series, you'd think it would be pretty awesome. But unfortunately, while the graphics may be very beautiful, and while the atmosphere may at first feel very foreboding and creepy, the actual scares aren't very, well, scary. The Slender Man isn't a threat, he's an annoyance. To overcome him, you simply have to look away from him, and keep your distance. As long as you adhere to those two rules, there is NO WAY you can fail. And The Chaser isn't any better. All you have to do is simply shine your flashlight at The Chaser repeatedly to stun her, and then run away. These two characters aren't enemies, they're pests. The only things standing between you and your goal in a horror game are the antagonists. The point of a horror game is to be scary. When you can avoid your antagonists so easily, it makes the game not scary. And when your horror game isn't scary, that mean's you have completely failed. Not only are the scares lackluster, but so is the gameplay and story. The missions consist of finding eight items or activating six generators while avoiding the Slender Man or Chaser (which, like I said before, isn't very difficult), or simply walking from point A to point B. The objectives are very repetetive, and combined with the lack of tension aside from a few cheap jump scares, the missions are boring and not very fun. Slender's story fails as well because everything feels very pointless. Why is your character trying to find eight pages? Why doesn't she just turn around and leave? Why are we supposed to believe that a radio tower is a safe place aside from the fact that the game just tells us that it's safe? All of these questions (and more) are never answered. The writers of the story (Troy Wagner, Tim Sutton, and Joseph Delage) said that the development team warped and manipulated their original story which, if true, might explain the poor narrative quality. Combine the lack of scares, shallow story, repetetive gameplay with the short time it takes to complete the game (45 minutes-1 hour), and you have one huge letdown of a game.			"

												When I first came across this game, I was extremely excited. Finally, a Slenderman game with an actual story other then some random chick gathering pages. Slenderman himself looks amazing in this game, (The only complaint I have is that the tendrils are lacking in their appearence.) and also, he's not the only one you deal with. The effects of coming into contact with the Slenderman are intense, much so that if you're not even expecting it, could rip you out of your seat instantly. You CAN get trapped. Slenderman does more then just teleport. Though, I do give this game a definite thumbs up, there is room for improvement. Falling through floors, Slenderman freezing in place and ruining cutscenes... there's some mishaps. But over all, definitely give this game a try. Beware, Slenderman can instantly kill you in this one; But isn't that realistic? ;)			"

												Slender the arrival is a nice horror game, no matter how many times you've played this game, there will always be something new everytime you load a level, that bloke called Slender isn't slender at all or maybe his suit makes him look a bit chubby, I don't know. On a brighter note, that chick, Kate, looked good, but that squirtler named Charlie was as annoying as the Slender. If you don't like horror genre, play this game, you'll change your view about horror games10/10 Would punch Slender in a face, but the pitiful knobface doesn't have one.			"

												Two years after this game was released, it's still an incredible, chilling experience.Slender: The Arrival is THE Slender game; a simple story with a backstory that leaves you with more questions than answers... but that's what makes the mystery all the more enticing. BEAUTIFUL graphics with such simple details. You view the world through a video camera in a 'Blair Witch Project' atmosphere.The environments are stunning during the day; a beautiful forest in what looks like upstate California with fall leaves, sunlight filtering through the branches and lensflares on your camera. But then at night, the beauty is tarnished as you're alone and hunted in an ebony black wasteland of wood, isolated and with nothing but a flashlight to protect you.Slender isn't the ONLY one after you in this game either...A bit of a scavenger-hunt game with find-it tasks, but it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Slenderman approves!			"

												I wish this would be a little cheaper. There are only ten levels which are not worth it. It has a good story line and a terrifying experience. I personally think a little more levels could've been this price. But ten dollars for ten levels isn't worth it. That is my opinion. But hey, spending more then one hundred dollars on TF2 might be too ridiculous. But still almost half of them are short levels. I think this is a little overpriced. Good graphics though.

												To be completely honest, I really, really dislike the note collecting mechanic that was populerized with these games. But Slender was innovative and frightening for its time and so this remake at least deserves a fair shake in the wake of the many knockoffs on the market since. As far as Slenderman games go, this one stands a head above. The graphics are fantastic, the sounds and music very atmospheric. The story branches across several different points of view that develop as you play through the experiences of a number of people that have been hunted by Slenderman and have come together over time. While the note collecting (and now generator-activating) shtick is still there, it's not the only mechanic present, which is a refreshing change. While I'm not sure it's worth the full price, picking it up on sale isn't a bad deal.			"

												It is a scary game. Short perhaps and sometimes hard. The story is everything in this game. I think this is one of the only game I really dig into every source material I can find in-game to getting clues about what's going on. It's a fine game overall. Worth playing if you like psychological thriller games. Not the top scariest imo, (Amnesia, the dark decents still win by miles there), but still scary enough that you leave all the lights on before going to bed.			"

												Slender The Arrival is a very short horror game that you are more than likely to complete in one sitting. The only enemies ever encountered are the Slenderman and the Chaser. There's a few spooky moments, but it is fairly demure when it comes to jump scares. There are very few tactics in this game other than running away and shining your flashlight. You can't hide, you can't sneak, and there's no weapons. This game leaves so much to be desired. Especially when I compare it to other horror games such as Cry of Fear.			"

												I personally found that the only good thing in this game is sound, they had professional sound master, who made it sound really scaring. Lack of modern graphic and strange lighting makes it look weird, although some people may find it as a feature of this game and like it. They managed to make good grass and sunlight though, but in compare to dark corridors it looks like there is another graphic engine is used :-)This game does not save current level progress, so if you ike to play a game which has a reasonable plot development, you may be dissapointed there is set of levels which are barely linked to each other, so you may only imagine why all that is happening where and why you are going, is your protagonist sane or not. If you have strong imagination and patience with time to run for miles, this game is for you.			"

												To say for all you slender noobs, this is not a sequel. Slender: The Arrival trails off to the story of Kate, as she suffers slender's little nightmares. She is forced to try and escape what she has gotten herself into. What was really odd is that it feels like Kate actually made slender in her head, like she is the orgion of slender. To experience the thrill of jumpscares, knowing someone is stalking you, and being chased is amazing. I would recommend this to anyone whos played Outlast or Amnesia. "

												The game starts of as a decent title, but as soon as you figure out how simple and nonsensical the gameplay mechanics are everything seems just too shallow. It has a few good scares and the whole concept of a supernatural entity stalking you is very interesting, however, game lacks depth. There are also some irritating difficulty spikes and the game is simply unfair in some instances. Few levels are memorable and to the game credit creepy as hell, unfortunately tyhe game seems a little bit too short and extra content is nowhere to be seen so far.Overall Slender the Arrival is a mediocre game, which relies too much on oversimplified game mechanics combined with creepy atmosphere. On the plus side music is great, and ambient sounds are perfect at creating tension, however, there are better games fo play so save your money or wait for extra content to be added or a discount price.

												Slender: The Arrival is a short game where the player takes control of Lauren who is searching for her friend, Kate, in the middle of the forest controlled by the omnipresent Slender Man. With players viewing the action through Lauren's video camera, the game is at first deeply atmospheric but flaws that hinder the experience soon become apparent.The majority of Slender: The Arrival involves the player walking through dark, open environments where the Slender Man can appear from anywhere. On a first playthrough, Slender: The Arrival is very tense, with each step forward making the player feel uneasy. The overall atmosphere is bleak with finely presented environments, eerie music and collectible notes helping construct an unsettling experience. Players familiar with Slender Man lore will undoubtedly find the experience more unnerving than those who are not. Despite the rich atmosphere and tangible tension, Slender: The Arrival turns into a trivial, almost dull game once the Slender Man actually appears. The first time a player observes the Slender Man, their inital response is most likely one of fright. However, each time the Slender Man appears on screen, the frightning effect is diminished. Players will soon realise that the game consists of a foe that can teleport around the environment to provide cheap jump scares and little more. It soon becomes tedious and if one were to turn around and see the Slender Man merely floating toward them as if it were on a wire, it all becomes easily managable.Slender: The Arrival is good during the first hour but it soon becomes a tedious collection of jump scares which fail to fright and interactions with a folkloreish entity that strips away all creditable mystery or menace. Even harder difficulty settings fail to improve the frights in a lacklustre horror experience.			"

												Performance wise I'm getting screen tearing when I look around too quickly. Fraps shows I'm getting a smooth 60fps so I think it might be just part of the asthetics of the game. Maybe they are trying to make it really look like you are viewing it through an old cam corder, but still it's annoying and detracts from the graphics quality of the game.Gameplay wise it's kind of spooky, although too dark in some places and easy to get lost or turned around. Since there are very few landmarks I ended up back-tracking for a while before realizing I was going the wrong way.The atmosphere is kind of creepy, and the first time I saw slender it kind of spooked me because I wasn't expecting it.  Also there were a few other decent jump scares. Other than that, Meh.Although I did buy this on sale for $2.50, and I already had $2.22 in my account from selling trading cards. So did I get $0.28 worth of enjoyment from it? Yeah probably and then some. Weather or not its worth it for $10 you decide.			"

												This game really does bring back the old video games full of scares. Your heart will always be pounding because you never know what will happen. The story is also really amazing and pretty much answers all of the unanswered questions we had in the orginal slender eight pages game. In case you feel like you would miss out on that eight pages experience, there is no need to worry because they have that too. I strongly recommend buying this game for any horror game. Even though on my windows 8 it was a little laggy. It made the experience even more fun and even more scary.			"

												Slender: The Arrival was developed by Blue Isle Studios in collaboration with Mark J Hadley, the developer of the original Slender the Eight Pages in 2012. The Arrival is an excellent psychological and atmospheric, story driven horror game in which the player takes on the role of Lauren, who is investigating the disappearance of her friend. As well as facing new enemies such as Slender Man's Proxy, the player can immerse themselves in an all-new, unique and innovative storyline. Players are introduced to a 'scrapbook' feature in which they can view the collectibles that they are able to find throughout the game. The Arrival is a truly interactive and immersive experience. Players will also be rewarded with longer gameplay, stunning visuals and a soundtrack equally as beautiful as it is terrifying and tense. Fans of the original Slender game are presented with a remake of The Eight Pages. Chapter 9 'Genesis' contains all the original landmarks and page locations from the 2012 game, the only difference is that of much improved graphics and lighting for a greater gameplay experience. I recommend this game to all fans of horror whether they be new or familiar with the genre. A must have; 10/10[NOTE: CHAPTER 9 'GENESIS' IS NOT PART OF THE 'SLENDER THE ARRIVAL' STORY LINE, IT IS JUST A REMAKE OF 'THE EIGHT PAGES' FOR FANS TO ENJOY!]			"

												This is a real improvement from the first Slender game. The first Slender game was very scary. But the objective is just to collect the 8 pages, survive with out Slender ripping your face off and congratulations, you have successfully beaten Slender. But this game brings it to a whole new level.You start off as some kind of adventurer, seeking in the woods just like normal people would do. But you come across things that you've never seen before like this house and of course the old fashion 8 Pages. And some tall guy with no face chasing you down of course. You get the 8/8 Pages easier on this Slender because there is just so much more to it. You then travel a bit more and then their he is. Not Slender, but some other kid that you have to blink the torch with in order for him to go away. Instead of getting 8/8 pages. You need to turn on the things with out the little kid trying to brake your legs.But I won't ruin the rest of the game or the ending for you. But there is much more to this game then meets the eye. If you're into scary games and trying to figure out the storyline of a game at the same time. Then this game is for you.			"

												Slender: The Arrival is good...for an indie game.It's probably the best Slenderman game to come out of the hoard of other games that tried to capitalize on the success of the original, but that's not saying much.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Slenderman: The Eight Pages, and I even liked the idea of having Slenderman's aggression dependent on the amount of pages you'd collected. It was a fresh idea, but it wasn't exactly compelling or fleshed-out enough to warrant spending any more than 30 minutes to an hour with it.Slender: The Arrival aims to lenghten, and provide greater context to the original idea, but it hardly manages to do either successfully.The story is presented to the player through signs and notes that are scattered around each environment in the game, and its your job to collect them and determine what happened in Slenderman Land. Who (or what) is Slenderman? What happened to the family who lived there? Who are they, and why is Slenderman targeting them? The game definitely raises more questions than it answers, so be prepared for dissapointment if you were expecting a decent payoff. Even if you do manage to piece it together, the story is textbook horror, and it doesn't offer any significant surprises or revelations.The game is dissapointingly short as well, clocking in at 2 hours or less on normal difficulty, depending on how often you need to retry the difficult sections of the game. If you go into to Slenderman: The Arrival with low expectations, you might find it enjoyable. The visuals look nice, and the audio design is suitably creepy when it needs to be. In all honesty, it's impressive when you consider that this is Blue Isle Stuidio's first game, but at the end of the day though, Slenderman: The Arrival is undone by its cryptic storytelling and ridiculously short length. I'd only recommend that you pick it up when it goes on sale. "

												Slender the Arrival does it's best to give you a creepy experience but it just keeps falling flat. It is a very nonintuitive game. It's standard first person shooter controls (without the shooter) and places you in the creepy woods of a park. One of its main shortcomings is that it lacks the ability to deliver the story properly. We are supposed to make assumptions about everything. Assumptions that are probably wrong. I kept finding clues about a person and assumed that person might be me. Then it took reading some backstory in a walkthru to discover that I was a completely different person baguely mentioned in one of the notes. The first few times I played it I was throughly creeped out and some of the presentation helped with that. It uses a method of ""steady-cam"" view that looks like you are filming this which can also be viewed that you are someone else watching this person's footage (a la Blair Witch Project, CLoverfield, or Paranormal Activity). What you find does heighten the tension and when odd things are seen it really creeps you out. But then it feels like a grind. Where am I supposed to go next you ask. Oh over there. Wait I think I've found everything. Do I go back? Where to next? There is a decisivve lack of direction and instruction. It gave me a goal but the goal was so vague that I didn't know whether I was finished nor did I know if I was finding the right things. I wandered around doing nothing SLOWLY for a half hour and then quit the game. Why? HEre is the biggeswt problem. There is no save feature. It saves once you finish ""THE CHAPTER"". I was stuck in the ""prologue"" for days. Every time I tried it I had to start from the beginning. So by the 15th time I tried finding all the clues or whatever I was not afraid of the woods nor the creepy things. So far all I've seen are creepy things but none of them are harmful things. Don't get me wrong. This game has figured out that in horror you can't just in-your-face all the horror like Dead Space or Doom 3 etc. But it has to be subtle. But it hasn't fuguyred out pacing, story, furthering the adventure. It also relies a lot on camera glitches and sound effects and music. THose things are very important in horror. But in this case I am never sure if these elements actually appear in the game world or just in the game ""providing atmosphere"" like I'm being followed around by a 40s radio SFX guy banging pots together and breathing heavily. It reminds me of the scares in the movie The Ring where Ehren Krueger hit us over the head with loud noises and in your face weird cut in pictures to scare us and when you got to the end all you could say was ""Huh?""I would be interested if this studio tried it again with horror as this was an improvement over its predecessor but it still isn't there. The controls and gameplay are still lacking. Your RUNNING mode isn't much faster than your WALKING mode. You can neither jump nor go in water so you feel like a child in one of those wheelie guides. The story needs a bit of polish. There needs to be a definite indication who I am and what I'm doing and how far I've gotten with it. Because leaving it up to my imagination is unacceptable in a game. How am _I_ supposed to know when I am done with a chapter if I don't know what I'm supposed to be looking for, etc.This will keep you entertained for a couple playthroughs until you give up and look through the readthroughs. (which don't really help as the items keep moving around) You want to get really scared, go for Five Nights at Freddy's.			"

												Pretty much my most favorite horror game EVER. (Keep in mind I haven't played Outlast yet so my opinion might change) I don't care how short it is, is fun, scary, and f*cking Slender. Kind of complicated story line, but a very interesting one. AI is the best we've seen in any Slender game. But, in most cases, Slendy will be the least of your worries.If you want to see some gameplay I have a full Let's Play of the game here:

												Very innovative gameplay, but TOO short, too little things to do, and an unclear story! :( Still though, it's worth the try! You get the feeling of being chased, of being completely on your own, there's no one else in the game besides you, and the evil creatures chasing you! I think it would be an awesome MOBILE game!			"

												This is a real improvement from the first Slender game. The first Slender game was very scary. But the objective is just to collect the 8 pages, survive with out Slender ripping your face off and congratulations, you have successfully beaten Slender. But this game brings it to a whole new level.You start off as some kind of adventurer, seeking in the woods just like normal people would do. But you come across things that you've never seen before like this house and of course the old fashion 8 Pages. And some tall guy with no face chasing you down of course. You get the 8/8 Pages easier on this Slender because there is just so much more to it. You then travel a bit more and then their he is. Not Slender, but some other kid that you have to blink the torch with in order for him to go away. Instead of getting 8/8 pages. You need to turn on the things with out the little kid trying to brake your legs.But I won't ruin the rest of the game or the ending for you. But there is much more to this game then meets the eye. If you're into scary games and trying to figure out the storyline of a game at the same time. Then this game is for you.			"

The game is certainly creepy. It has its moments.There's just something about a non-moving, faceless monster that almost looks human that just terrifies me to my core.

												Slender: The Eight Pages, is the scariest game I have ever played. The gameplay is simple, deiliberately repetitive, and frightening. Slender: The Arrival, is a very scary game - but not as scary. That is how to describe Slender: The Arrival in a nutshell for fans of the original game. For those unfamiliar with the horror masterpiece that is Slender: The Eight Pages, I will explain. Slender: The Eight Pages, drops you into the middle of the woods, in a disturbingly eerie nighttime filled with fog, bushes, and worst of all: undescribable darkness. Your goal is to look for 8 pages. As you collect each page however, you find that you are slowly pursued by a strange and creepy stalker, known only as, The Slender Man. The game recieved universal praise for it's minimalist horror elements, sound design, and ambition. The game was released in June of 2012 as a free game. However, after more than 2,000,000 downloads were reported of the sleeper hit, a sequel from the original developers immediately began production. It was no later than March of 2013 that Slender: The Arrival was released - a highly anticipated ""sequel"" to Slender, only this time, for pay. No one knew exactly what to expect, so when Slender: The Arrival only recieved lukewarm reception from it's many hungry fans, I personally was disappointed. I with-held from playing the game for a long while, until I saw it was available on Steam, and decided to give it a try. I'll say though, that despite Slender: The Arrival being well worth your time, there still is much disappointment to be had. The story this time around focuses on Lauren, a young lady visiting her friend Kate in order to help her clear out and sell an old house in the woods belonging to her now deceased Mother. Once Lauren arrives at the home though, after a mild car collision, Kate is nowhere to be found. As Lauren investigates, she realizes that Kate may have been kidnapped by a supernatural entity. Soon, Lauren realizes that she too is being stalked, and must work her way through the forest to a mysterious radio tower. Once again, the sound design is superb, and the gameplay is simple, but effective. However, the element that took me most by surprise was just how beautifully rendered the settings were. After completing a tough challenge that requires difficult work and replays over and over again, there's nothing more rewarding than a pleasent stride through the great outdoors, even if they are being occupied by The Slender Man. The biggest problem with the game is, unfortunately, it's length. Though Slender: The Eight Pages is obviously a very short game, it makes up for it in the difficulty. I personally have never beat Slender, but I still try. The problem in this games design is the fact that it's only made out of 6 short stages, but each is made to be extremely difficult, and take a trial and error process. In addition, the story feels lacking as well. Though written by the superb Marble Hornets team, the story still feels anti-climactic, and unfinished, giving us hints of a much larger puzzle, but only revealing limited pieces. In the end though, the gameplay is scary, and fun, and I suppose that's all that matters. Recommended.			"

												It took me about 2 1/2 hours to finish the game the first time. I played on ""easy,"" because I wanted to experience the game settings and ""mythos"" elements. I found it to be very atmospheric, creepy, and surprisingly pretty. As a fan of the Slenderman mythology, it was very satisfying.It is certainly story-lite, I would say. There is a common thread running through the levels which is supported by documents and a couple of clever flash-back mechanisms, but the story is definitely not well fleshed out. If it had been, and if the game had been longer, it would have been gold. As it stands, if you like Slenderman stuff, or if you just like creepy, atmospheric games, this is a good one, I would catch it on sale because its very short, but in general its worth a shot. I am currently playing through it a second time on ""normal,"" because a little more challenge would be nice, and because I failed to get all of the documents the first time through. So, it also has replay value, which is nice, especially in a short game. I should also mention that I happily had no technical issues with this game, which is rare enough these days, It seems to be solidly made by people who were interested in their subject matter. Kudos.			"

												As a large fan of horror games, I have a huge problem with them. Most horror games rely on the initial shock of whatever it is you're dealing with. In this case, the whatever it is you're dealing with is Slender Man. He's creepy and extremely startling. He'll scare you to death the first run through this game. Slender, or better yet the mechanics that make up Slender, rely on the unknown and the confusion that's conjured in your own head. Being lost AND hunted make for a stressful situation. And they only lay it on thicker as you continue. But after the first playthrough, you know exactly what to expect and you know exactly how Slender and his hooded companion are going to react to you and your actions. The shock wears off and you're left only a little startled every time your camera lense gets a bit of static. All of that boils down to the lack of any real replayability. Nothing is left to keep you wondering except a few collectables. If you are looking for story in this game, almost the entire narrative is found within the many collectables found in the game. The collectables and the narrative found within those collectables adds a very miniscule amount of replayability. Which brings me to my conclusion; I think this game is very worthy of its $9.99 price tag, but doesn't have much more to offer after the experience.			"

												Slender: The Arrilval is good clean scary fun.Slender Man has got to be one of the ultimate boogymen, and he is out to get you. You can hide, but you better run. At all costs. Because if he catches you, zzzzt zzt 'pop. Your gone.You find yourself wandering dark and lonely places with nothing but a flashlight whlie Selendy or his creepy little buddiy's pursue you with the intent to do to what all boogymen do. Make you ""go away"".The game's fun. You should give it a go.I give Slender The Arrival six out of eight pages.If you've heard stories of people disappearing while playing this game. They're just stories.			"

												I love this game, and believe it or not I'm actually pretty big on Creepypasta and whatnot. The story of Kate the Chaser is one of my favorites, and I'm not actually sure if it's been fully solved, I even had some trouble with that one.I've seen a lot of people mistaking Kate for Jeff the Killer. That's uh, cute. Jeff is mentioned nowhere in the game, the only Creepypastas in Slender: The Arrival are Slenderman himself, Kate the Chaser, and Charlie.Now to review the game itself. Is it scary? Not to me, but then again, I'm not scared easily, and this game is pretty old anyway, so the scare factor and fandom has died down a lot. This game has a great story, and this makes a great follow-up to Slender: The Eight Pages, which is also a part of Kate's story. I find this game to be amazingly challenging though, at least when you actually meet Kate as an antagonist, and you have to deal with her AND Slenderman. I also really like the music to this game, it's a bit depressing, but it fits the game. If you're looking for something with a good mystery, and you like Creepypasta, then this game is for you. I highly recommend it.9/10.			"

												When the slendy man grabbed me and started to slightly irritate me with screen distortion it really spooked my guts off. The epitome of horror is slight irritation and sound design so exact that noises simply stop playing once you leave the area.

Они запихали туда режимы сложности, это влияет на поведение монстряков. не совсем понятные задания, иногда можешь не понять чего хочет от тебя игра(1 глава). Вывод: Если играть на ""Normal""  или ""???"" игра становиться в разы страшнее. Как обычно играть лучше в темноте и одному. в целом 7.5/10.			"

												Slender starts off decent enough but quickly devolves into something pointless and irritating. The repetitive gameplay is only slightly improved from the first game, and the story, while it certainly has potential, is rushed and just doesn't quite make sense in the end. The atmosphere is eerie enough, but the game doesn't use that to its advantage. There's no slow build of suspense or horror. They just throw everything at you, repeatedly, to the point where there's just no scare or thrill to it anymore (if there ever was). In the end, I was mainly relieved the game was so short.			"

												A horrible copypaste galore of jumpscares and random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.The prologue of this game is actually the scariest part, seeing that you don't know what to expect if you haven't played it before. But after that, the game just takes you back to a remake of the old ""find the 8 pages while running from slender"" game.It should be needless to say, but this is only remotely scary one time because you don't know what to look out for. But as the gameplay escalates after finding more pages, it immediately turns into tedious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.You may be looking for the final 8 page several times just to have slender magically teleport from behind you right in front of your face and block your only way to get to the last part. This is not scary, this is not thought out gameplay. This is just complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t when you suddenly have to trek around the map until luck decides that you may pass to the last part without getting randomly instakilled by something you can do absolutely nothing about.I had hopes that the game would turn into something with more and better gameplay after the 8 pages part, but it's the exact same formula repeated yet again. Except find the stated number of the new type of item while avoiding slender and yet another extra monster at the same time.It's not funny, it's not scary and it's just a randomized game of tag where you are chased by a no-clipping hacker with teleport.

												Ok, graphics and sound effects, I will give a total PLUS! I had the chicken skin going and everything.But as  a gamer with ADHD, this really is a challenge. It should feature a god dam RUN button.. Walking is really time consuming and I find that I was losing attention quickly.Especiall when you die and restart. That is just torture in itself.But the run feature as well to avoid confrontations. Seriously, in real life, one would run away from danger. But this character when you confront danger, you still just ""walk away"" like tomorrow is another day.As for defence... Well there is nothing you can do, you get attacked and you are dead. Simple.Would be cool to have something. This would probably be a better game as a fps game. I know that it's not designed to be that way. Just a suggestion or a mod added to it would make this more fun to play like Alien VS Predator 2... Also, achievements. Gaming companies need to stop making achivements like completed NIGHTMARE level. Not everyone can do it and don't want to do it. The fact that you finish the (any) game is and achievement. Sometimes, a person wants to play the game once and that's it they move on. Achievements like this is just making people play the game again for nothing on a level they don't want. Also achievements where you need to see how you die, or fail x amount of times and what not. That is really annoying. It seems they lacked imagination and focused on how to get achievements for playing bad instead of playing well.Although these are what I believe would make it a better game, it is designed for what it is and if you have the patience for it then this game is good for a good scare.

												It's half scary and half frustrating. The game does make you feel uneasy but at other times makes you feel frustrated and doesn't do the best of jobs of telling you what just happened or how to move on. Also on the farm level, there was lag which I found strange as there was no lag anywhere else in the game. It's still alright though so thumb up.			"

												The game is good.Its not that people say its repetitive, its that the enemies make it that way. If anythihg, Blue isle and Midnight City should control the Al of the enemies so people would find it good. Also, make us see live interaction to some of the characters, and a more explainable genesis of how this all happened. Mabye you should team up with Red Barrels and make a more awesome and excruciating game!			"

 My Rating: 6.5/10 I mean, honestly, the game could've, and would've, been better if they would just make it longer. I played the game once on my friends account, and I finished it a little bit pass the one hour mark.Sure, there was a relatively good plot, amongst its amazing graphics, great gameplay, and many many more, but the length is just way to short. That's basically it.Gameplay - 8/10 - there was a variety of different objectives throughout the game, which is awesome, but it gets a bit repetitive, first there was the ""walk-around-the-house-and-explore-and-avoid-the-spooky-as-fudge-Slenderman"" part of the game, then, you get the best part, the part where you get to walk around the forest looking for notes, then you start looking for generators (just like what you did in the first part), and you end with running into a burning lighthouse. It gets a little bit repetitive, and it is a bit short, but it was a good experience.Graphics - 9/10 -  the amount of attention they put in the development of the game was absolutely stunning, the details are extremely realistic, there's nothing more I could say.Story - 6/10 - meh, its okay.Length - 3/10 - OH MY GOD, NO.Overall - 6.5/10			"

												VERSION 2.0 Review:Slender The Arrival has certainly had shifts in quality between updates, and I am pleased to say that v2.0 is literally perfect. First off, the new levels are TERRIFYING. And I mean Amnesia terrifying, Homestead and Memories (the two new levels) are very memorable and are a great addition to the game. The Arrival looked amazing upon release, and yet v2.0 makes it look even better. There are better textures and models in some areas, and Genesis now looks fantastic rather than being a carbon copy of The Eight Pages with some of The Arrival's entities. The biggest flaw to S:TA before v2.0 was the gameplay; it was ridden by bugs and problems such as the overly frustrating mine level, terrible interaction physics, and the simply god awful fire sequence. Everything has been fixed in 2.0. The interaction is now smooth and comfortable, the mine level's main NPC (the source of the frustration) has been perfected, and the fire sequence is now an intense but fair climax. Some gamers may be turned off by the ten dollar price tag for a 3 hour game, but guys, come on. A group of inexperienced indie developers worked their asses off for this and they deserve the money. Not to mention, this is one of the horror greats in gaming - I liked it almost as much as the Amnesia games. This is also the first game by Blue Isle Studios, and for an indie game group's first game this is amazing. Overall it's an amazing game with a great story. Give it a go.			"

												When I first played Slender: The Eight Pages however many years ago it was now, I was instantly smitten. And also really scared. So being the typical consumer that I like to think I am, I bought this game before it came to everyone's beloved platform, Steam. Let me say one thing: It has come so far from then. New levels, bug fixes, level edits. The list goes on. All of these things have made the game a more enjoyable experience for players like me. It is not comparable to something like Outlast, at least for me, due to the factors of human nature brought up in that game (humans have the capabilities to be far more monstrous than any supernatural beings, in my humble opinion). However, the game is still terrifying. And short. I am saddened to say that I think my time playing may have been my whole playthrough. Not on hardcore, but on regualr mode. That said I had played through the game before, so much of it was already known to me. All in all, a top-notch Slenderman game. As a horror game, probably around the middle to upper-middle class, the kind that still would have qualified for the guillotine in the French Revolution but only by the length of their necks. As a story, its a bit weak. Gameplay is your typical run and hide without the hiding and with a lot more of the running. I definitely recommend this game to horror fans, although due to its length maybe consider getting it on sale (I ain't telling you how to live your life, just a thought though).			"

												I was playing this game late at night ( I live in a rough neighbourhood ). So as I was saying I was playing late a night and was very into the game I live with my wife and 2 kids and we are known around the neighbourhood. So a couple jump scares go by but I waltz though it and then a huge jump scare comes up I scream louder than a women giving birth which then causes a chain reaction throughout my house hold to the point where we all are screaming as not too sure what it happening and then about 1 min 30 later our next door neighbour smashes through our window and shoots me in the leg 3 times as he thought I was attacking my family... I dont really know if im able to get a refund or anything but I am going to try to get a refund to now be able to afford a wheelchair as I am now paralyzed. However not a bad game good fun until a bullet hit me.			"

												When Slender: The Eight Pages was released in the summer of 2012, horror fans praised its short, experimental, and completely free take on the genre. Manically dashing through the forest and trying to snag all eight pieces of paper before the creepy Slender Man finds you remains a surprisingly unnerving experience. Cut to spring of 2013, and we now have Slender: The Arrival on PC. This paid-for sequel attempts to pump up the horror experiment into a bigger (though still quite short) game, but it quickly becomes apparent that the simple mechanics of the original Slender crumble under the weight.Most importantly, The Arrival remembers that the core of any good horror lies in its boogeyman. The Slender Man himself still stalks you with the same terrifying persistence he has in the original, exuding a menacing presence that evolves throughout the story in some unexpected ways. Though his iconic design may be simple, I still got freaked out every time I spotted his silhouette in the distance. You can't fight him, only run from him, and that in of itself makes him more frightening than most game monsters.The world he haunts is larger and denser, as well. Instead of a dark forest, you’ll wander through abandoned homes, creepy mines, and sunbaked hillsides. Some of the better-lit areas look genuinely great. Trekking through autumnal forests and rummaging through homes that actually feel lived in make the world of Slender an interesting environment.Some impressive sound design surrounds you with an ambient soundtrack and jarring noises, and it really adds to the already creepy atmosphere. Boards creak, children whisper, and there are some truly terrifying moments that wouldn’t exist without the impeccable use of audio. Like all great horror games, Slender is best served in a dark room with a pair of headphones.These parts, at least, are done pretty well... but it's simply not enough. While I appreciate the lengths that developer Blue Isle went to flesh things out, The Arrival relies far too heavily on the rudimentary game mechanics of the original, which was only ever meant to last for a few minutes. Like its predecessor, the vast majority of The Arrival essentially boils down to finding a certain number of objects while an increasingly dangerous enemy stalks you. Whether it’s pieces of paper in a forest or generators in a mine, you’re repeating the exact same actions in every part of The Arrival. It feels like being asked to finish a Where’s Waldo book while your house burns down around you.The fact that I got tired of it during a game this short shows just how repetitive The Arrival is. While a lucky player can dash through in about 20 minutes, it’ll probably take most people a few hours thanks to the unfair nature of the enemies. Slender Man and his minions don’t mind warping directly behind you and causing instant game over. The worst offender of this comes once you reach the abandoned mine and are introduced to a second enemy type. The Proxy, a creepy knife-wielding kid, stalks you throughout the level as you (yup, you guessed it) once again attempt to find a series of objects. He continually killed me with no warning whatsoever, which as you might imagine, gets pretty frustrating.Although the mine level was genuinely spooky at first, it and many other areas quickly lose their terrifying charm once you’re forced to replay them dozens of times. I appreciate games that are tough yet fair, but those that arbitrarily punish their players sabotage their own fun. This problem persists throughout Slender: The Arrival. The horrifying atmosphere that Blue Isle manages to create is consistently squandered by dull mechanics and unfair difficulty spikes.The VerdictSlender: The Arrival manages to deliver some truly impressive scares, but you’ll have to wade through the muck of repetitive tasks and unfair enemies in order to experience them. I found more enjoyment in playing the free original installment, which delivers a powerful horror experience without the annoyances and filler. By trying to stretch the initial concept over five separate scenarios, Slender only succeeds in proving that some ideas are better left in the experimental phase.~cmaexi 24.06.2016			"

												If you have VR, and you catch the game on sale, it will be a good buy.  Otherwise, the game is too linear and too atmosphere centric for me.  The devs do a great job at setting the mood and freaking you out though.  It's also quite short as I beat it in 3.1 hours.  20 minutes of that was having to redo an entire chapter because it said it saved progress but didn't?			"

												Honestly I didn't enjoy this game. It's only 2 hours long so don't pay more a buck and a half for it. This game should have been free. It isn't that the game is scary in that it makes you sick to your stomach. The graphics are so bad that they hurt your eyes and make you feel woozy. This kind of game is supposed to scare you not make you feel like your going to vomit. Plus it has almost no story and I have no idea about the characters or the idea of the game itself. If you want to play a truly scare game that has a story and great thrills then play outlast or FEAR. This game sucks and I think I would have been better if I hadn't play it at all. It's a good thing this game had trading cards or I never would have played it.			"

												So, You're watching a Youtuber Play this. You say ""If I play this, I wouldn't be scared at all"" You are a huge liar. You know what will happen. But you can't do anything about it, You're trapped, he's standing right there at the door. You have nowhere to go, you can run, scream, and hide. But None of that will help you. You WILL not be brave in this. Your only survival is fear. You know you are going to die, He is everything. He Is Everywhere. You can't do anything but just run. This game is a perfect game to make you feel real fear, real challange. You know what to do, But you can't. Out of pure fear.... You should get this game now.			"

												If there's such a thing as a casual horror game then this is it. The first half of the game is much more ambient and thus scarier than the second half. Gameplay boils down to you rummaging around the forest/abandoned dark mines looking for the piece of paper/generators that will help you escape, all while being chased of course. Trying to find your magical level ending macguffins is more frustrating than spooky. They're randomly placed in the map so if you die don't expect them to be in the same place. Very short game overall.To the devs responsible for putting in leaderboard achievements--end yourself.			"

												This game is insane. I can't bring myself to play past the forrest. It's dark, the heartbeat rythm going on and the thought that the Slender Man may be rite there on the next turn while you're trying to find all 8 pieces of the letter or whatever it is that was left behind. It gives me the full bodies chills. From either the point that it's that creepy or the fact that I know that the paranormal is there and it does happen and based on personal experiences with the paranormal. Umm. I'll try to get through it but I need a couple boxes of Scooby Snacks to help me along for courage to do so. If I could rate this game with a star system I would say that it far surpased stars to the point of being Super Nova. If you like being freaked out, creeped out, or just to have the feeling of your blood running cold then you need to get this one. Good luck and watch out for The Slender Man.			"

												This game DOESNOT WORK ON OCULUS RIFT DK2It was released back when the DK1 was the thing and the dev's have not updated it to work with the DK2 even thou they say they are working on it and that it is coming after the DLC it never did.The game just updated with yet more DLC 26/10/14 for halloween but still no VR Support for current VR hardware.This is being sold under false pretences lots of poeple aare buing this thinking its gonna work for them when it doesnot.shame on you and your attempts at a Activision style cash grab support your paying customers and label the game in the store correctly as supporting only the DK1			"

												 WOW this game is a massive piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ There is absolutely NO indication on where you are supposed to go or what you are supposed to do. The story is half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥from what I could see. The graphics, The shading and the textures are all HORRIBLE, Every time anything at all happens you get punted back to the main menu for (SOME STUPID REASON). This piece of crap is so poorly designed and executed that it literally looks like no more than three people worked on this game at any point and time. I found a missing child poster that put me into some horrible looking mirror world where textures appear and dissapear like magic and I kept teleporting around for some stupid♥♥♥♥♥reason until I eventually found myself in a lock room that slender appeared in which ended that dumb♥♥♥♥♥whatever the hell it was supposed to be thus putting me in the main menu instead of back into the actual game. So THEN I select a mission from the menu where apparently slenderman was hunting for me and I never even saw him all I ever heard were a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ noises as I explored the house until I died and had to sit through a long♥♥♥♥♥bunch of nothing until the game said that I somehow had died and now every time I try to start the game up I see clouds followed by static followed by being punted back to the main menu. Needless to say this game is no longer installed. WHY steam continues to allow unfinished pieces of♥♥♥♥♥♥like this to be sold is beyond me. This game isn't worth a dime!			"

This game starts off right when your friend Kate (eight pages) has invited you to look after the house but when you enter you here a scream in the forest and see a dark figure in the distance, you must find out what happened to your friend kate and what is the dark slender figure following you.

												This game is a pretty good sequel to the Eight Pages, which everyone knows and loves. In this game, you play alongside a decent, albeit short, story of Slender's torment. Gameplay is solid, and there are two levels that are pretty similar to the first game (excluding the remake level at the end). There are other filler story chapters, but chapters 2 and 3 really stand out amongst the rest of them. Although Slender is definitely more aggressive (you'll more than likely see him more often this time around) and there are new enemies, I've found the progression to be much easier. Now, that being said, I'm sure thats for story purposes, so you can finish the game, but even the remake level we got all 8 pages on the first try without seeing Slender even once. This game is definitely interesting and chapter 3 definitely caught us off guard the first time around, but for pure entertainment purposes, the first game is superior. All that said, my largest gripe with this game is that most of the story has to be obtained by easily missable and ignorable collectables. There is almost no story if you don't find and interact with the various collectables throughout the game. If you love the Slender lore this is a decent buy, but otherwise if you are just playing for the Eight Page level, stick to the first. 7/10			"

												Graphics: The graphics were perfect, it made the game so much scarier when you see how realisitic slendy and the environment was, it makes you feel like you are there sometimes.Music: The music suits the horror genre really well, with a quiet bass in the background and some wind sounds. It also changes depending on how dangerous the area is.Plot: Okay... here it is... *sad music plays* the storyline was depressing, I know writing a storyline for these games are difficult but it could have used more effort.Controls:  I got frustrated when i tried to open a door then it closed again.

												This game was quite above average. It has a good plot, and a scary atmosphere. But, there are two things I don't like about this game. 1: The antagonists are easy to avoid. All you have to do is turn and run, or flash a light in their face. A horror game needs scary. Scary is made by scary antagonists in their meth lab of scary. Scary antagonists are hard to avoid. Slender is not. 2: There is a really short story. I finished this game in about 30 minutes. Sure, it does leave a lot of mystery, but there is a limit on how much mystery you can have. Too much mystery leads to confusion. Confusion doesn't sell.Overall, this game may leave you up all night, curling up on the floor, and crying into your carpet, but I still give it a 6.5/10.0			"

												This game is really cool. The fact that Troy Wagner, Tim Sutton, and...that other guy (sorry, I forgot your name) helped with the story was awesome. I have yet to beat Chapter 2 without cheating...don't know why, but I can't. Everyone else I've seen on YouTube has finished it with ease. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Anyway, I highly suggest this game if you like horror games!			"

												This game is full of mystery, wonder and enought jump scarys that challenge movies like Parnomal Activity and The Conjuring but it also has some call back to Slender The Eight Pages in the first 5 minutes of game play. This game starts off right when your friend Kate (eight pages) has invited you to look after the house but when you enter you here a scream in the forest and see a dark figure in the distance, you must find out what happened to your friend kate and what is the dark slender figure following you.

												As a fan of the original Slender game I absolutely loved this game! It was great to see the huge improvement from the original in graphics, story and everything in general. The only issue that I would say I have with the game is it does feel a little bit short, but that can be forgiven for how immersive the game is because it does make it feel a bit longer.			"

												I think the creators of this game might have got the name slightly wrong.  I have managed to play the game in 5 minutes chunks. The game itself is nice; the setting is a quaint nature area outside a brick home. I manage to walk around this area watching the sun set, and really enjoy it. Sadly as night sets in creepy things start up and the game must be closed soon after. I think that if they were to rename the game Nature Simulator 2014 and maybe add some DLC that cost say $5.99 where maybe we got 10 minutes until the creepy darkness set in, they could really have something good, not that I’m unhappy with my 5 minutes of sunlight, just a simple suggestion.

Watch it. Do it) With that combination in mind, Slender has fleshed out in various lengths, better graphics, a creepier atmosphere, a storyline, but keeping to the origional gameplay of collecting or turning on things. After the first level, if you're used to Slendy, be prepared for Masky charging at you at full chilling speed. BRB, I need to change my pants.			"

												Found the game to be quite enjoyable. The graphics were amazing comprared to older versions and the addition of a ""Chaser"" was something special that hightened the tension. The story is portrayed via the notes you find and the secret chapters you play in, which makes an explorer type like me happy since I really like to look around and find every little hidden item. The soundtrack did a very good job of immersing me into the game and the ambient noise from the scraping to the water droplets was well implemented and complimented the atmosphere that the various areas had. The game is well worth any price you find it at today and has great replay value. Highly recommend the game for anyone who is a fan of Slenderman or anyone who wants to try something different. Have fun and enjoy the ride as you get to explore a world of danger and jumpscares.			"

												This game really has nothing going for it. Give it a try if it's ever free but it's definitely not worth your money. Maybe this is due to the fact that I've played through plenty of games that do what this game tries to do but far more successfully, such as Amnesia or Outlast. Or maybe it's that everything is extremely predictable. Or perhaps it's the fact that on a first run you'll beat this game between 1-2 hours.  Those issues aside the main issue lies in the enemy(s) your running from. Neither of which leave you feeling the urgency to run. Slenderman himself is laughably predictable and easy to evade while the second enemy you encounter both runs slower than you and can be stunned indefinitely with just your flashlight, so the entire time never feeling like much of a threat. I think the scariest part of this game happened when the level broke due to a glitch and had to be restarted.			"

The only thing that really scared me was Slendy's proxy. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥that thing is horrfiying! I refuse to replay the third level just because of it. The game's graphics are stunning, and the level design is well thought. The game can be slow and a bit laggy at times, and at times I didn't know what to do or where to go.

												You leave your vehicle as you begin your search to find Kate with the sun sinking beyond the horizon, leaving you stranded in an ominous environment, where you are far from being in control of things. From the beginning He makes his point to let you know that he is upon you since the darkness has swallowed the woods, and you, who is completely at his mercy, must scavenge through the abyss of the dark thicket to find the classic 8 pages, only to find that there is more horror than you could imagine.This is a wonderful game, with some new twists on the classic Slender. The game has the classic ominous feel as Slendy stalks you thought the woods and you gather the 8 pages, with each page another layer of soundtrack and a more aggressive foe, building up the anticipation of the end, only bringing you to more discoveries. In which new discoveries you get to encounter a new foe that hounds you more violently than our beloved classic.			"

												This game has rather good graphics considering the fact that it comes from some lesser known developers and the such. It's a nice addition to the original game and is great for creeping out friends. The jump scares do eventually get old however and the lack of knowledge of your surroundings can cause you to easily become disorientated and lose your way often. Overall, not a bad buy at all, especially when it is on sale.			"

												There are parts of this game that are not that scary. Then there are parts that are absolutely horrifying. One in particular is the ""Into the Abyss"" level. I can take Slender popping out unexpectedly and giving me a jump while I look for pages, but there is something about being chased by a masked psycho on foot through dark hallways while hearing their footsteps and breathing, especially when you don't see them yet, that terrifies me down to my core. I've only been able to complete that level once, but I get the urge to shut the game off each time I re-enter those mines. I hear the steps and that breathing, and I lose all composure I had. That right there is the sign of a great horror game. Slender: The Arrival is short, but what is there is wonderfully presented and paced, with some fantastic visuals and chilling atmosphere. With free DLC on the way, Slender: The Arrival is looking to become one of the best indie horror games in years. For fans of the original Slender: The Eight Pages and the Slenderman's Shadow series, it is a must play.			"

												Definitely one of the scariest games I've ever played.  When the original Slender came out, I nearly poo'ed myself, then it was re-released with higher production values into what is ""Slender: The Arrival"".  The mechanics of the game are fairly shallow and it really has almost no replayability, once you know the scares and story, but it is definitely worth the single ride.  Play at night with the sound up and lights out.  You'll be hard-pressed to find a more intense horror experience outside of Alien Isolation ;-)			"

												It was rather short sadly, the graphics are amazing for a 10 dollar game, but there is way better horror games which are better and longer and are lower then 10 Like Five Nights At Freddy's for 5$$ or Five Nights At Freddy's 2 for 8$$$ Still a great game with a great story, Here are the goods and the bads. The Goods: As I said The graphics are amazing for a Unity game, The story is amazing and deep, The monsters are very scary we have Jeff the killer,Slender and a zombie girl---thing, and the game made me scream like a little girl xD. The bad: the game is more of a playable movie then a game,The game is rather short it took me 2 hours to beat this and it took me to beat Five Nights At Freddy's 11 hours, and the game is to strick Like a movie as I said.Do I recommed this game??? YES but buy Five Nights At Freddy's 1 and 2 first ;)			"

												Simply a great horror game.An 'expanded version' of the indie horror classic Slender: The Eight Pages, developers Blue Island managed to keep the dread feeling the from the first game.Containing better graphics, more variety of levels, and some surprises, Slender: The Arrival somehow manages to keep the feeling of dread, of being watched, of being stalked while being out in the woods. Although it's a short game (about 2 hours if you wander through the levels to find all the collectibles) the pacing is good. The horror Slenderman causes on us this time is backed by a story. It is quite basic, but it helps to build the tension until you reach its climax. The game has some memorable moments, like a tense section in the mines and a re-make of the classic 8 pages search. In overall, it offers a solid gaming experience for the fans of horror games, it's worth replaying it to get all the collectibles that expand the story and has different difficulties available.Oh, and this time, Slendy comes with some friends. And you will not want to play with them.			"

If youre thinking about trying it out, do it! Here's a Let's Play we made of it over at Digital.Flash.Fire  If you wanted a peek at the game before you grab it.

Not at all, but it does its part in being one of the top Jump scare games!			"

												A few minor spoilers if you can really call them that are ahead:Let me make one thing perfectly clear before a few of my sentences are taken wrong: I absolutely love this game. I like how we had tat like Silent Hill Homecoming (just for the record big fan of the SH games, just not Downpour or Homecoming, or even The Room for that matter though it was nice.) and we had stuff that was basically jumpscare after jumpscare.This game restored my faith in the Survival Horror genre. I was terrified all the way through, even that first walk to the house in the beginning scared me quite a bit because this game has ATMOSPHERE. Jumpscares, scares in general, are mostly effective when there's an atmosphere. The main setting (outside) is absolutely beautiful but my main problem with the game is the Into The Abyss level.I was so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥the first three times of dying that I nearly tore my hair out. I played this, regrettably, on Xbox before I got it here. When I got past Slender Man I was happy as a f***ing peach and then... then Into The Abyss happened. It was absolute hell for me to get through, but admittedly it felt rewarding to get through. The level was quite hard to do, yes I realize this was meant to be but this could have been toned down a little. Other than that I have absolutely no problems with this game. The scares are effective and frequent enough to make me yelp but not too frequent to bore me, the atmosphere is dripping off the screen, the story is interesting, and the design for both level and characters are friggin' amazing. All in all, I would rate this game 9/10 in total for atmosphere, mechanics, graphics, and story. I especially loved seeing Slender man after his original game Slender The Eight Pages come back in even more slender glory. Would I recommend this game? Absolutely. Despite the inevitable frustration with the ITB level the rest of the game, while very short, made it all worth the time I spent in it. As soon as you can get your hands on this, no matter what platform, make sure this is on your list.			"

												This is a great little extension of the free ""Slender"" game, which improves on the graphics and sound and adds more levels, tied together with a storyline that, frankly, I didn't really follow. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the game for the most part; it creates a really tense and scary atmosphere and manages to incorporate enough variety that it maintains that atmosphere. Some of the levels were just a bit too mazey though and sometimes the objectives were a tad unclear.			"

I admire The Eight Pages because it was the original, but I was kind of dissapointed to see that it was so low-quality. This is not the case with Slender: The Arrival. I enjoyed every terrifying second of playing this game! I would give this game a 10/10!			"

												Pros: Good graphics. Doesn't have a woman who f#cking pants so loudly and annoyingly like the original 8 pages. Realistic environment. *Spoilers* Slenderman has a little boy/girl, who assists him in murdering you, by jumping on you and stabbing you. Cons: Slenderman is extremely easy to avoid, isn't as hard as the original 8 pages. Veeery long and boring walks to all these different places. Gets veeeery boring after an hour or two. Jeff the killer is in this game. Eh, 7/10			"

												Slender the Arrival, the follow- up to Slender The 8 pages. A fantastic game to say the least. I still enjoy playing it. It has links to some of the fan made lore which I highly reccomend! This game kept me on edge for the duration. (I had to finish it in one sitting.) If you like atmospheric horror games this is the one for you!  talks about the proxies which are used heavily in the aforementioned lore which honestly you should check out. Some of it may be convoluted but you have to give it to them on their dedication. Several of the series are still on-going and definitely worth a watch!  "

												If you were a fan of the original freeware Slender game where you just find 8 pages in the woods before you're caught, you might walk into this expecting more, but there really isn't.  There are a few cool scares, some new areas, and nice tension in the environment, but as a whole there just isn't enough content to warrant its cost.  Save your money or buy a different survival horror game.			"

												I was first introduced to ""Slenderman"" by a co-worker back in 2010 when the original Something Awful creepy-pasta contest entry was just starting to gain some meme-level ground.  I spent a late night after closing at the drug store we were employed at looking over all of the classic photoshops of a tall, thin man holding the hands of children and appearing just out of the foreground in old black and white photos.  Browsing creepy-pastas and looking at a picture trying to find ""the monster"" somewhere in the trees became a bit of a spooky ""Eye Spy"" game.  My curiousity in the concept of Slenderman would eventually lead me, like many intrepid fans, to Marble Hornets.  This isn't the outlet to critique THAC's series, but if you're interested in the writing style employed in Slender: The Arrival (STA), I would suggest looking it up on YouTube.  About two years later, Slender: The Eight Pages (STEP) hit the scene and started blowing up online when ""Let's Play"" style shows and streams started to pick up steam in the gaming community.  I'll admit, STEP often lead me to facepalm when a professor would ask inquistively to the class ""what's a slender man?"" and a half dozen classmates would respond ""its this game-"", etc.  My roommates and I still ended up downloading the game and plugging a laptop into our 36"" Vizio on Halloween night 2012 to properly get spooked out.  The screams eventually died out by midnight as the novelty wore off and we started to figure out how to game the AI, but I digress.  I'm offering all of this information up as I feel that my familiarity with Slenderman (the creepy-pastas, the various YouTube shows, the movie, etc.) greatly impacts my reccomendation for this game.  If you're unfamiliar with the whole concept of Slenderman this might not be the best way to start into those (sometimes super spooky) waters.  STA, while not a perfect execution, really manages to nail a few of its key components.  The levels go back and forth between variations on the original STEP gameplay with ""collecting"" something randomly placed around the map while avoiding a stalking, and increasingly aggressive enemy, and what some may ""lovingly"" refer to as a ""walking simulator"".  Both gameplay styles are evenly paced out so neither have enough time to grow stale in long bursts.  The exploration levels, and well, the entire game looks gorgeous.  The environments stay with you in this game, even after a week after I completed my playthrough I still remember the striking landscapes more than anything else.  Various collectable pamphlets, emails, etc. dot the maps and help build out the core cast and their history.  I would reccomend tracking these down as they provide most of the world building and really highlight the writing contributions provided by THAC for the game's script.  The player controlled character can feel kind of clunky and slow at times, and I undestand the limited endurance was a design decision to prevent constant sprinting away from enemies but in the portions without something to avoid this can feel somewhat limiting.  The graphics for props, buildings, etc. aren't anything to write home about, but the wilderness and skyboxes always manage to look gorgeous.  Finally, I think my main issue with this game is that after my first death at the hands of Slenderman (or The Operator, or whatever) the scare factor had mostly worn off.  Again, I attribute this to already being burnt out on STEP and other Slenderman series.  The model's head just doesn't seem right either, especially with the more defined cheek bones.  I prefer Slenderman to only have a human silohuette and no other details in the face, but again, that's a personal preference.So, if you liked STEP (and speaking of which, this game contains an HD remaster of that level unlocked after beating the main story), or are just a fan of anything Slenderman I'd reccomend this.  Its no AAA horror game, but its a competent couple hour romp.			"

												The graphics are nice, and I am a fan of the Slenderman.  I can never fully rationalize away my fears, because he strongly resembles a childhood recurring nightmare that I had.  (A long, pale figure, with empty eyes looking into the window, unmoving, unblinking.)  I think this may be some kind of universal brain-glitch that we have as human beings.  LOTS of people feared similar creatures, whether things they imagined themselves, or things from various mythologies in different parts of the world.But having gone through the introduction, and knowing Slenderman, who is by now a meme, I was not at all frightened, when I could flick my flashlight on and off at him in the first stage, and even stare dead at him, without so much as a flicker of movement or threat.  This is a great way to yank me out of any sense of suspense and tension.  And the way you start a game really has a great deal of impact on the way the rest of it feels.  So eh, 2/10.  Good graphics, story seems like it'd be good?  But poor setup, and stage 2 is a rehash of a free game.  Shouldn't have to go through an hour of boring/ rehashed material to get to the good stuff.

												Good game. Can get really creepy at moments. Especially the mine level. However the game can get a tiny bit tedious and repetitive. May get frustrating as when you're usually at the last item to turn on/grab/shut, it forces you to take steps back or play the level longer. Game may be 1-2 hours long at first but the second time you play it, it literally could only take you 30mins-1hr long. Altogether, good game but not great. Gameplay is creepy but can get tedious. "

												A few minor spoilers if you can really call them that are ahead:Let me make one thing perfectly clear before a few of my sentences are taken wrong: I absolutely love this game. I like how we had tat like Silent Hill Homecoming (just for the record big fan of the SH games, just not Downpour or Homecoming, or even The Room for that matter though it was nice.) and we had stuff that was basically jumpscare after jumpscare.This game restored my faith in the Survival Horror genre. I was terrified all the way through, even that first walk to the house in the beginning scared me quite a bit because this game has ATMOSPHERE. Jumpscares, scares in general, are mostly effective when there's an atmosphere. The main setting (outside) is absolutely beautiful but my main problem with the game is the Into The Abyss level.I was so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥the first three times of dying that I nearly tore my hair out.

												Well it was fun while it lasted, wasn't as scary as I thought it would be, I guess after awhile seeing a faceless guy with tentacles coming out of his back gets kind of old. It did have my heart racing at certain moments, and not because I was afriad of being captured by Slendermen, once you get further into the game you realize at certain levels that Slendermen is the LEAST of your worries. I f your a fan of the original Slendermen then this game might not be for you, its taken a completely different direction then its predecessor, if you have no idea what the heck Slendermen is (sham on you!) and expect to buy this game hoping to be scared senseless then I'd advise you to buy with caution as well; like I said the game really isn't all that scary BUT it has its moments where it really get your adrenaline pumping!

												A Spectacularly Terrifying Game. The Slender Man mythos has caught my attention since I first started reading creepypastas. The 8 pages game was scary for its time but this game seriously adds so much terror. The addition of a new enemy, Kate the Chaser, just makes the game even more frantic, because while your wondering if Slender is behind you, you're also wondering if Kate will jump out in front of you. The Slender Man is much harder to escape, and looks much more creepy. The beautiful scenery is great to look at, and when its dark out, the atmosphere gets extremely creepy. Great game.			"

												If you enjoy mistery horror this is deffinantly a game for you. It borderlines between forest stroll simualation and a gorrer game quite often although it never fails to bring some thing inturesting into play. Even on hardcore mode I found this game increadibly easy and the ending seemed almost cut short. Its deffinantly not a real horror game seeming how only one level counted as ""frightening"" but never the less it was really inturesting and fun to play.			"

												This game accomplishes what it set out to achieve... it's creepy and really shouldn't be played late at night. For a low budget title, the graphics are perfectly adequate, you can see the developers paid attention to detail.Graphics options are sparse but again adequate for 1080p.   Colour gamut seem overexposed but that's likely to be a deliberate artistic choice.Certainly this game should be considered more as a thematic novel than a deeply interactive game.			"

												Easily one of the scariest games I have played. Am interesting twist on the original slender game and a decent storyline. To make it a really scary/thrilling experience while playing, definitely wear headphones or have surround sound speakers and play late at night. Still need to complete it, although so far, the atmosphere the game has gave me is scarier than outlast, and I have a completed the game and DLC, so this game is definitely worth giving a shot :) Don't play this however if you are easily scared, as you will waste your money as this game is terrifying			"

												Such was the massive success of the 2012 hit Slender The Eight Pages, Blue Isle decided to follow it up with a sequel, Slender The Arrival.The game begins beside your car, Lauren has arrived to visit her friend Kate who has decided to sell her mother’s house after her passing. You soon find yourself running down a road leading to Kate’s house and by the time you reach the outside walls daylight has transformed into total darkness. You find the front door of the house wide open, inside completely empty. Your first action is to search for a flash light to lift the darkness and then set about investigating Kate’s disappearance. The whole idea of being alone in this game can be pretty daunting especially when you know there is a faceless man stalking you.Slender doesn’t really appear too much in the Prologue but he makes enough of an appearance to let you know he is there and watching you. You’ll be standing still and hear gravel shifting or footsteps behind you and then my personal favourite, a door shutting by itself!.You will find clues throughout the house in the form of scrapbook items which you can collect at any point and view via the Book in the main menu, these items give you some insight into what is going on within the game.In total there are nine stages, eight of these are story related with the extra stage being a revamp of the original Eight Pages and for those not familiar with the previous game, the aim is to collect eight pages scattered around a wooded area but you have to find all eight before Slender kills you. Pages can be found tacked to objects like trees and cars and you can very quickly find yourself running in circles looking for them while praying your flashlight doesn’t run out.The game also introduces two brand new stages namely Homestead and a secret stage only revealed after finding a secret object while in the stage Flashback which itself has been split into two stages to accommodate Homestead. Now the end of Flashback is called Escape.There is also a new enemy to deal with, one that does not appear in the original release and you’ll find him on the third stage.Overall the game is very short and can be easily completed in less than an hour. Maybe what it needed was a longer and stronger storyline, one that wasn’t so repetitive. But seeing as it was already a well known game across the steam community it was to be expected that not much would change coming across to the consoles. Though with new content there is something to look forward to and of course there is the main protagonist Slender who without a doubt will make you jump when he randomly appears throughout the game and trust me, turning around to get a face full of him, turning my screen all distorted and full of static was enough to give me goosebumps or attempting to make my way through a burning forest with his tentacles appearing in front of me trying to grab me, made me wonder why I didn’t just remain in the cave.The game is a lot of fun to play, especially in a darkened room by yourself or maybe with friends I would also recommend playing it with headphones in or if you have it surround sound because it makes the experience that much scarier. If you are a fan of the games and all things Slender you shouldn’t be too disappointed and if you’re someone who has only ever heard about Slender it’s definitely worth checking out. To sum it up, if you’re looking for a storyline forget it but if you love being scared senseless while wandering around in the darkness then this should suit you down to the ground. Hopefully in the future Slender will get the retail game it surely deserves.			"

												------------------------------------------------------Cons & Pros:+++ Not jumpscare reliant (defines the quality of a horror game imo)++ Good graphics++ Strong atmosphere built with sounds and lighting++ Creepy villain and level design++ The only game that doesn't let you pause at random times which CREEPS ME THE ♥♥♥♥ OUT+ Collectibles if you're into that kind of thing+ Different difficulty levels- Short. I know slender games are not meant to be long but still, a game of this quality should/could have had a little more story to it. Maybe.- A little bit expensive, as you will probably play it only once or twice.Hardcore horror game players might not get scared about the stuff in this game but mediocre and casual horror players like myself can get creeped out occasionally.This game includes the original slender mechanic of collecting pages and some additional polish. Like safe areas with strong atmosphere or more background on the story.I would give this game a10/10 on graphics11/10 on sounds6/10 in length9/10 in general. Grab it on sale.			"

												I cannot recommend this game enough! It's a perfect and well implemented horror story about a famous creepypasta. The enviroments are beautiful and well crafted, the lights and shadows are setup to give a good, uneasy vibe, and of course the experience wouldn't be complete without the monster, the Slenderman. Though the story itself is a little difficult to follow at times, especially if you cannot find the notes, its easy enough to write in your own story- to be the character, rather than pretending to be someone else. That, above all, is what drags me into this game and holds me in the tight, vice grip of fear.			"

												Fun experience if you like spooky games.  Eerie atmosphere, decent jump scares.  Some parts get annoying once you know what's going on (like the static screen and screeching noises), and there's not a lot of replay value.  But overall a worthwhile experience if you get it on sale.  It's short, maybe a few hours of gameplay (most of my time played wasn't actually playing), so $10 seems overpriced, but for $3 or less I'd say it's worth it.			"

You can unlock The classic game style of slender man when you finish the game wich is a nice touch. you can choose a Higher difficulty of gameplay if you please wich makes the game way more exciting in my opinion !

												This is one of the best horror games I've ever played. Although it's not very long, it definitely has replay value. The story was written by the cast of Marble Hornets and is very well done. But if you don't find all of the notes scattered around the levels it might not make much sense. The game is not very well optimized so you need a really high spec PC to run it on high settings.			"

												Created by the same team behind the originial, experimental, slender: the eight pages game, Slender: the arrival is a full, nerve shredding experience, which may as well have a reward for depriving me of sleep. Both from playing, and also from not being able to sleep afterwards.While it is a very short game, there is plenty to find, after hours of playing around I still have not got all the notes. There may even be secret areas I am unaware of.Since it's arrival on steam there has been new content, which fills in some loose gaps in gameplay, while adding to the experience. It has a great atmosphere, nice graphics, is really scary and has a decent story. The one problem; it could explain more. I get that it's trying to create a sense of mystery, and it's up to you to find out the lore behind the game through fidning notes lyting around, but it could at least explain your charecters role and their backstory more immediately,  we are playing AS them, so why not know what they do?!Other than shortness and a few optimisation issues, it's a great game, and seeing as it's the first commercial release by it's creators, it's a great effort!If you love horror, go for it!

												Fun experience if you like spooky games.  Eerie atmosphere, decent jump scares.  Some parts get annoying once you know what's going on (like the static screen and screeching noises), and there's not a lot of replay value.  But overall a worthwhile experience if you get it on sale.  It's short, maybe a few hours of gameplay (most of my time played wasn't actually playing), so $10 seems overpriced, but for $3 or less I'd say it's worth it.			"

												The only thing scary about this game is the carpal tunnel you’ll give yourself by holding down the Shift key running around a dark forest. Only came across the Slender once and he felt so sorry for me for the $1.59 I wasted that he didn’t even kill me.			"

												READ!!!If you liked the eight pages, this is a good game to get. It has more content and better quality too. It is, however, a bit too easy. Also, the game keeps failing near the end of part 5 (Homestead) and I am forced to redo the part on a pretty good computer. Overall 7/10, maybe 8. (It's not exactly worth 10 bucks, so try to get it on sale.)			"

												* what universe is this that people build houses without light switches in them.* Hate invisible walls. If you don't want me to go there, come up with an in-game reason.* I will always love a survival horror game that can cause legitimate chills.* In line with the previous comment, it has an anxiety inducing soundtrack.* First time I saw the slender man, I turned and ran...feeling my characters survival depending on it...and he wasn't even holding anything threatening...* Thank you for not being the only town in a 50 mile radius that uses batteries created with a child's chemistry set. Flashlights do not only last 10 minutes...ever.* I am now running away lost to avoid the slender man...help me!* I really can't stand search and rescue, especially when it is to rescue pieces of paper* Did I mention the soundtrack? Yes? Well, it goes to show you to don't need to send pop a rabid walrus out form the ceiling every 10 minutes to keep a player on edge.* Oh, ya, I hate search and rescue, especially when you can die after getting the last item. Could place for a save point.* Recommend it for the scare factor and I play a lot of survival horror.			"

												Worth a play if you like creepy games. This game isn't terribly twisted or gross like a lot of horror games, it's just all about keeping your anxiety level high! Don't get me wrong, the story and atmosphere keep you creeped out, but what's really creepy is that, for much of the game, the slender man can appear anytime, anywhere, and all you can do is run as fast as you can in the opposite direction.It only takes a couple of hours to play through, if you're not trying to get 100% everything, but it's worth the ride.A negative would be that the story isn't all that interesting or coherent. Maybe it would make more sense if I 100%-ed the game and was able to read all the notes laying around, but really, a game should make sense without requiring that.			"

												Are you the kind of person that can stomach screamers all day long flashing sponstanously in front of your eyes randomly? Then you ought to be able to handle what this game has to offer. This title is based on the freeware version of Slender but remixed with a full story and tons of surprises. This is possibly one of the best survival horror games I have every played. It is very challenging and I reconmend getting cheat engine to disable Slender from cacthing you via a free cheat table file that can be googled online. When I did this, I was able to play the game more like a horror simulator without worring about getting sent back to the start of the level. I reconmend getting this title if your into horror and screammers.			"

If your buying this expecting a real game then you will be disapointed, it only has high reviews because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ little kids who thinks its fun for an hour then they go back to playing other games again.thankfuly i got this on sale for like 4 bucks....heres the shortPROS-scary at times-good visuals, and soundCONS-game is 1-2 hours... tops-mechanicly its the same as the first one, all you have is a flashlight and movement-no map or inventory or real story-line or cutscenes or anything at all-its basicly the first game with a few extra jump scares for 10 dollars			"

												This is the definitive game for the Horror genre. Psychological horror at its finest. This is like a scream of fresh air in a dark, underground cave -- compared to the unimaginative games that claim to embody fear in the form of gore. In this game you will find almost no gore. You will be scared because you are scared of fear itself. You have no big guns to protect you, no base-building or crafting that will distance you from this inevitable horror. Your skills will be put to use running, hiding, weeping with sheer terror, and piecing together the mystery behind the horror.When you're too scared to move on, load up a nice, comforting zombie shoot-'em-up to reassure yourself that it's all just a game...

												Slender: The Arrival was a rather great game. It had a complete story line to lore you in, a beautifully building atmosphere, and the graphics where absolutely STUNNING. There are little few bugs from what I've found(And trust me, the second I get a game, I like trying to break the maps to said game.), and a nice map to free explore. But by far, the best thing I found about Slender: The Arrival, HAD to be it's atmosphere. It had a great build up that left the player on edge, which made the jump scares all the more better. The rustling of the forest around you, the crunching of the leaves, or in the case of the generator level, the sound of footsteps running at you, all help immerse the player. The game uses rather nice functions of forcing the player to do what they don't want to, such as entering a building or going down a hall to grab a note, knowing they'll have to go back and he might be standing there. Although, I will say, the complaint I have about this game is that the enemies themselves often get stuck on objects while coming after you. It subtracts from the game play to know if you angel yourself right or quick turn a corner, you could get them stuck there for a moment. In Slenders case, He'll become unstuck the second you move to far away and instead transport away, but in Kate/Jeff The Killer/ Whoever the one running after you is, They could get stuck there for a good while.This game is best played in the dark, with either surround sound or headphones in for best possible outcome.Overall, I'd give it a 8.9 of 10.

												Built up from an elegantly distilled core of exploration and vulnerability, Slender: The Arrival asserts the brilliantly masochistic joy of fear.Slender: The Arrival takes its name from a relatively new urban legend: the Slender Man. Created from whole cloth by an Internet denizen, this information age monster is a far cry from anything in the classical pantheon. His unique mythology and strangely broad appeal meant that it didn't take long for the eerie figure to make his way to video games. Slender: The Eight Pages, The Arrival's predecessor, was an exceptionally well-made title of a concept that became somewhat of a YouTube sensation.  Thousands of individuals posted videos of themselves wandering through an eerie forest coveted in fog, searching for eight pieces of paper with only a flashlight to guide them. An approximate successful run took about thirty minutes, but the pure sense of helplessness in the face of an unknown threat became the foundation for this well-realized sequel.The primary focus on weakness and exploration, The Arrival expands on the ideas of its predecessor with a basic story, and the creative application of familiar mechanics. The game is broken up into five chapters, each one with its own focus. You play as Lauren, a young woman driving to see her friend, Kate. Shortly before the events of the game, Kate's mother passed away. On Lauren's journey to Kate's house, her path is obscured by a fallen tree. Committing hte worst sin in any horror series, she continues the rest of the way on foot, carrying a high definition camcorder with her.Two hours into the game, it isn't so long that the constant apprehension becomes tiring. There is a smattering of collectibles to flesh out hte backstory, however because taking extra time to carefully scrutinize for them places you at even greater danger, you are forced to weigh narrative cohesion against survival. The lure of these collectables is subtle at best, however it adds value and keeps you from becoming too comfortable with the world. After all, if there was no real, tangible danger, the Slender Man would not be an effective monster.As a sort-of myth born from the Internet, Slender Man is likely one of the first genuinely compelling monsters to grace pop culture in a long time. The related games and their variants and mods, as well as the stories and the YouTube series surrounding them, shows the genesis of 21st century folklore. A little rough around the edges, The Arrival is simply fascinating because it plays on modern fears through a modern medium. For that, it has managed to breathe new life into a genre once through to be dead. Slender is not an experience you will soon forget, and priced at ten dollars, its just about right for its short lived tale. A word of advice, be sure to play at night with headphones for the full effect. Best regards!			"

												If your looking for a short but sweet horror game, look no further then Slender: The Arrival.When I played this game I got pretty scared and frightened at times by not enough to make me jump out of my seat, I also like how this game comes with a remade version of the original Slender The Eight Pages map under the title of ""Genesis"". But I will have to say that The Arrival is easier then The Eight Pages because of its inclusion of difficulty settings, I never beat The Eight Pages (Best attempt was 5/8 pages before quitting the game out of being fright and I probably never will with The Arrival on my PC.

												Great atmosphere and tension. One of the more polished Slender games as it had help from the creator of ""The Eight Pages"". I'd highly recommend a change of pants. Also try playing after a few beers for a more enhanced experience.			"

												You leave your vehicle as you begin your search to find Kate with the sun sinking beyond the horizon, leaving you stranded in an ominous environment, where you are far from being in control of things. From the beginning He makes his point to let you know that he is upon you since the darkness has swallowed the woods, and you, who is completely at his mercy, must scavenge through the abyss of the dark thicket to find the classic 8 pages, only to find that there is more horror than you could imagine.This is a wonderful game, with some new twists on the classic Slender. The game has the classic ominous feel as Slendy stalks you thought the woods and you gather the 8 pages, with each page another layer of soundtrack and a more aggressive foe, building up the anticipation of the end, only bringing you to more discoveries. In which new discoveries you get to encounter a new foe that hounds you more violently than our beloved classic.			"

												The game is just....bah.One of my major problems with this game is the fact that you walk sooooo slowly. They give you big forest but expect you to take 6 hours to get around. The headbob gives me a headache, and there is no option to reduce it or turn it off. What were they thinking.Who shakes that much when you are walking so slowly anyway?The game is pretty scary, but Slenderman doesn't really jump out at you much, he sort of just watches you. Well, that is only in the first couple of episodes, before I had to take a break and rest my eyes.Just, don't buy this game.			"

												The jumpscares in this game are great! Especially the Chaser's. I like how they added more enemies. The sounds and music in this game along with the creepy environments make for a lot of suspense and a great atmosphere. Although I do have one little issue with the game, you can't save. I know that you can go back to the last stage you played, but you have to start the level over again. I wish you could resume where you left off. I would give this game a solid 9/10.			"

												Slender: The Arrival is the official expanded version of Slender: The Eight Pages. It meant to have a story behind why the Slender Man is after you, and a few others. What do I think of this game you may ask? Well, this review will cover that.First off, I will start with the setting and character's. The game take's place in an unspecified state of America. Most of it take's place in park with a radio tower and a mine complex. Now on to the character's. The game's protagonist is Lauren, a woman looking for her missing friend named Kate, who has recently disappeared. A man only known as CR can be read about in the in-game collectibles.He apeared to be somehow involved with Kate and the Slender Man, whom does not need an introduction.The next thing I want to cover is the overall gameplay. I think it is both good and bad. I will start the good. The atmosphere is probably the best part of the the game. It gave me an unsettling feeling throughout the game. Another great thing about The Arrival is the genuinely creepy music. It gets more and more tense as you complete the objectives. And also, not being able to fight back can also keep some people on edge.Now for the bad. Unfortunately, there are more bad aspects than you might be thinking. Let's start with the objectives. Pretty much every level involves somehow interacting with a certain amount of objects. It does'nt take very long for the game to start feeling quite repetitive. While a recent update added two new levels to branch off from this, those two levels are'nt very good and may leave quite a bit of gamers feel pretty unsatisfied after completing them. Another thing I will cover is the overall scares. They start out great, but lose their charm less than halfway through the game. The Slendern Man himself begins to dwindle as the as the game progresses. While he seems terrifying at first, he later starts to become less and less scary to the point that you can easily walk past him and not have even the slightest sense of fear. The two new enemies added also begin to have this effect. The hooded person at first seems pretty scary, but it's cheap jump scare attack becomes pretty un-scary and rather just annoying and cheaply animated. The skeletal figure is also pretty unsettling, but soon just apears to be a generic horror cliche. Another thing is the game's incredibly short length. The game can easily be finished in less than two hours, incuding the bonus level.The VerdictSlender: The Arrival simply feels rushed. The music and atmosphere are great, but the repetitive gameplay, cheap scare's, and extremely short length just ruins the experience. If you want a cheap and short horror game, buy Slender: The Arrival. If you want quality scares and fun gameplay, look elswhere.  Overall, 5/10			"

												Easily one of the scariest games I have played. Am interesting twist on the original slender game and a decent storyline. To make it a really scary/thrilling experience while playing, definitely wear headphones or have surround sound speakers and play late at night. Still need to complete it, although so far, the atmosphere the game has gave me is scarier than outlast, and I have a completed the game and DLC, so this game is definitely worth giving a shot :) Don't play this however if you are easily scared, as you will waste your money as this game is terrifying			"

And that's coming from a guy who's played both Amnesia games and the original Slender game. I highly recommend this to anyone who's looking for jumpscares that will stay with them a while.			"

												Slender the arrival takes you on a wild ride right from the start to the very end. The game begins with you in a forest not knowing why or how you came to be there. Slowly you make your way through the forest weary of spooky noises coming from all directions, and, if you are like my brother, get completely lost and concede to the world while running into the same fence for 3 hours. A smarter player would turn around and stay true to finding something else but instead he manages to get himself turned around once more and, despite all odds, finds his way back at the god forsaken fence.

												Well it was fun while it lasted, wasn't as scary as I thought it would be, I guess after awhile seeing a faceless guy with tentacles coming out of his back gets kind of old. It did have my heart racing at certain moments, and not because I was afriad of being captured by Slendermen, once you get further into the game you realize at certain levels that Slendermen is the LEAST of your worries. I f your a fan of the original Slendermen then this game might not be for you, its taken a completely different direction then its predecessor, if you have no idea what the heck Slendermen is (sham on you!) and expect to buy this game hoping to be scared senseless then I'd advise you to buy with caution as well; like I said the game really isn't all that scary BUT it has its moments where it really get your adrenaline pumping!

												Probably the scariest game I have ever played. Don't expect complex gameplay or intense puzzle-solving or anything like that, you should just expect to wet your pants after a while. Most of the game is just spent exploring and looking to collect a set number of items (similiar to the mod this game was based off), however don't think that means this game is boring. The game developers excel in knowing how to properly f%$k your mind while you attempt to avoid being scared. I actually have difficulty playing this game for very long at once, because I get so nervous.One of the most outstanding parts of this game is its replayability. You would think that a game like this would have little to none; you would be wrong. The developers again excel at finding ways to make each playthrough unique, hiding items in different locations and having scares randomly generated during your playthrough. Just because you were safe in an area before means nothing the next playthrough!! One of the only downsides to this is that the game is a little bit more difficult than you would expect. Finding the locations of the items before getting killed (or giving up in fear of having a heart attack) can be frustrating when their locations change every time you die, however there is usually a pattern that can be discerned eventually.While this might not be the most 'fun' or 'addictive' scary game I've ever played, I would say hands-down it is the 'scariest'. I still enjoy watching my girlfriend play it and watching her scream when she turns around and slenderman is standing right behind her. If you are someone who enjoys torturing yourself through voluntary fear, THIS GAME IS FOR YOU!			"

												I cannot recommend this game enough! It's a perfect and well implemented horror story about a famous creepypasta. The enviroments are beautiful and well crafted, the lights and shadows are setup to give a good, uneasy vibe, and of course the experience wouldn't be complete without the monster, the Slenderman. Though the story itself is a little difficult to follow at times, especially if you cannot find the notes, its easy enough to write in your own story- to be the character, rather than pretending to be someone else. That, above all, is what drags me into this game and holds me in the tight, vice grip of fear.			"

It's a nice addition to the original game and is great for creeping out friends.

It also changes depending on how dangerous the area is.Plot: Okay... here it is... *sad music plays* the storyline was depressing, I know writing a storyline for these games are difficult but it could have used more effort.Controls:  I got frustrated when i tried to open a door then it closed again.

												One of the greatest (if not THE greatest) Slender Game I have ever played. As you can see by my icon I am a slender fan. The game produces a definitive anbience and compelling antagonist that haunts you and makes you watch your back contstantly. I strongly anticipate a sequel. A 5 star game, two big thumbs up.-Vangyx			"

												I would recommend this game, it's short but quite terrifying at some parts. If you already own this game the Steam version adds a lot of new features, including a massively extended first chapter as well as many other additions to other chapters.			"

												Game is fun, but on all the high settings possible, and even with higher gamma, the game is too dark sometimes. My flashlight would go out and it was literally all black on the screen. Yes, I recommend it, but this 100% blackness during certain parts of the game without my flashlight needs to go.			"

												It's not a BAD game, but it isn't anything special. The plot is kind of generic and the gameplay isn't much improved from the original Slender:  The Eight Pages. If you REALLY want this then wait until it goes on sale. I'm pretty sure that Good Old Games has it DRM free for about $2.50 as I write this. Though, if you want to have it tied to your Steam account then the $5 sale price isn't too bad either.			"

												This game is a pretty good sequel to the Eight Pages, which everyone knows and loves. In this game, you play alongside a decent, albeit short, story of Slender's torment. Gameplay is solid, and there are two levels that are pretty similar to the first game (excluding the remake level at the end). There are other filler story chapters, but chapters 2 and 3 really stand out amongst the rest of them. Although Slender is definitely more aggressive (you'll more than likely see him more often this time around) and there are new enemies, I've found the progression to be much easier. Now, that being said, I'm sure thats for story purposes, so you can finish the game, but even the remake level we got all 8 pages on the first try without seeing Slender even once. This game is definitely interesting and chapter 3 definitely caught us off guard the first time around, but for pure entertainment purposes, the first game is superior. All that said, my largest gripe with this game is that most of the story has to be obtained by easily missable and ignorable collectables. There is almost no story if you don't find and interact with the various collectables throughout the game. If you love the Slender lore this is a decent buy, but otherwise if you are just playing for the Eight Page level, stick to the first. 7/10			"

												I have certain ""phases"" that I go through on the internet. I find something that I think is interesting, I obsess about it for a few months, then find another interesting thing, etc. Currently, the phase for me right now is Slender Man. For the past few months, I have gone through all of Marble Hornets, all of DarkHarvest00 and all of TribeTwelve (in that order). I plan to binge on EverymanHYBRID next. My Point is, I wanted an interactive version of these stories. Not just ""Find x amount of pages,"" no. I wanted a Slender Man game with a story. And this game gave me exactly that.If your not that into the Slender Man/Slender Man Mythos, then the story for this game might be confusing. Very confusing. I have seen many people say that the story is bad, that it's one of the low parts of the game. I disagree. I love the story behind it, as it's vague and only creates more questions. That's what a Slender Man based story should do- it should make you think. It should stick with you, long after you finish the game/show/book.Now, I'm going to stop blabbering about the story, and actually give a review:First off, the graphics. From what I've seen, the graphics are great. The way the sun falls though the trees, the leaves flowing through the breeze- it's wonderful. And the Slender Man himself has much more detail than in ""Slender: The Eight Pages."" He doesn't look like he has an egg for a head, which is a plus. He looks creepy and just that feeling of something that almost looks human, but doesn't. The graphics on lower settings look crappy though, but thats to be expected.Next is audio/sound effects. Great as well. The game has a great soundtrack, which really gives you that feeling of dread and isolation, but at the right moments. There are even parts of the game where you can hear crunching leaves, as if someone- or something- is following you. It adds to the game's atmosphere a whole bunch, which is very important for a horror game. The audio distortion (that occurs when Slender Man is nearby) is scary and is much better than just static.Next is Gameplay. This part of the game was sort of a let down. Pretty much all throughout the game, all your doing is ""collecting x amount of pages"" or ""turning on x amount of generators."" It gets boring and repetitive, and sometimes annoying. I've rage quit multiple times because of this. Hopefully it is worked on in the next patch, which will add 2 more levels.And finally, Atmosphere. As said before, the audio and visuals really add to the atmosphere. You hear the eerie squeaking of violins play, as you run around in an abandoned mine, hearing the footsteps and strange coughing-like noises of someone behind you. You walk through an abandoned house, doors left open, strange scribbling on the walls. The radio is left on, and all you hear is a song filled with static echo throughout the house. This game can be terrifying, even if you are collecting pages.All in all, I find Slender: The Arrival to be a good game with flaws; the game could be longer. But still, I recommend this game to any fan of the Slender Man Mythos.01110011011001010110010101110011011110010110111101110101			"

												If you follow the mythos and are a Slender junky, this game is for you. It's essentially a remake of Slender : The Eight Pages but with a story. The begining of the game is drawn out very well and does an amazing job of giving you that feeling of massive paranoia. I love Horror and this game is truely a favorite now. Allthough later the game starts to get more irritating due to the game becoming more difficult, it still has the scare factor. I would reccomend this game for anyone who knows the lore and is looking for a scare. Solid 7/10			"

I think what they were aiming for was a spooky, haunting sort of game that provided a challenge and made you shiver and alot of the time jump out of our skin. I love this game because it has a rich spooky element to it and I would highly recommend this game if you are into spooky horror games. I rate it 8.5/10.			"

												If there is a game more or the same feel and atmosphere as Amnesia, as Silent Hill (along those pretty classic horror lines)...THE ARRIVAL is among those games.- First off the game has beautifully composed music, greatly developed ambient sounds, the look and feel. Even with barely anything else other than ""search, collect and survive"", the game never fails to disappoint or bore (how could it possibly do that?) - Helplesness is the key element here...terror is the main goal directed towards us (the player) and shocks, oh don't worry....there are aplenty.- I don't wanna spoil it for people who haven't (or are for some reason scared to play the game), but know one thing...all future buyers...if you love horror (SURVIVAL HORROR) minus the firearms and meaningless combat implemented, you will certainly love and are gonna get utterly scared (or pleased in a perverse way^^) of Slender: THE ARRIVAL. You will like it...you might love it....you are gonna JUMP from JOY of it...He's...waiting...for....you....END OF REVIEW...			"

												Let's begin with this,You drive to your friends house, the house is almost pitch black aside from a few very dim lights spread across the first floor of house, one in the living room, one in the dining room, and the last in the kitchen. Thankfully you have your trusty flashlight, and your video camera. Not a sound could be heard in the entire house, you carefully walk up the stairs into the second floor, and into the last room down the hall. You walk in, and pages are scattered across the room and the window broken. you pick up one specific page that tells you to go to the woods, then you hear a loud scream coming from behind the gate in the backyard, you run to the window to investigate and see a tall slender man, standing there watching you from outside the window. as soon as you attempt to readjust your eyes, it is gone.And so we now know what we are going up against, the terror begins.Slender: The Arrival is a brilliant horror game that add's so much to what Slender: The Eight Pages lacked, a story, stunning graphics, more scares, and a whole lot more to do, with secret levels, collectibles, and fun achievements to go after. Slender is a very good horror game that brings much to the table, and on par (and possibly better) than Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs but not as involved as Amnesia: The Dark Descent. All in all, This game is definitely worth playing8/10			"

Simple game play, you try to find clues while the ""slenderman"" is hunting you.  I bought this during the halloween sale.   (I'm not sure it's worth full price, but a good pick up on sale.)			"

												""Pussiez!"" I yell when I watch slender reactions to see if the game is going to be any good.That was before I experienced 3 consecutive sleepless nights that I most certainly will never get back.What got me really hyped while playing this game is that fact that most of the time there are NO sounds other than your abnormally loud footsteps, the groans of whatever the hell is chasing you and the cringing buzzing of your camera.10/10 nearly broke my mouse.....mkay?

												Would I recommed this, YES! Yes, I would. The game is very horrific, well at least to me, because I have watched all the youtube videos so playing this was very creepy and very nicely done. (Sorry for my spelling.) But if you played the other slender games it will feel like a cash grab because it's basically that, but the game isn't laggy and it doesn't crash every five seconds. The game over all is a bit sensitive, when I try to turn around the game totally goes way to far, and what the heck is with the sprint meter? It works against slender but not against the girl in the mines. But over all, if you want a good horror experience this game will not dissapoint you, you just have to pay a lot of attention. Over all score: 75/100			"

												I ran out of clean pants to wear playing this game. I woke up with stiff muscles because I'd been so tense. It's not just Slendy anymore. There are new enemies, new challenges, new graphics, and new music. All of these add to the suspence and diarrhea inducing climate of Slender: The Arrival. If you have the money hanging around and you enjoy horror games, I recomend this. Games like Amnesia are scary, but they take time to get you into the game. Slender: The Arrival throws you head first into a vat of ""Omfg it's getting dark out and I have no idea what I'm doing"". This is a game where you know something's chasing you, you know something's going to pop out at you, but you still jump and scream like a cooked lobster when it happens. The game stays true to the original but adds other aspects, other levels of scary. I highly recommend this game if you want a heart racing experience and you're into wearing diapers. Just when you think it can't get worse, it does. Worth every penny.			"

												I've played it, I like it, and yes its creepy.  I think if you like horror with unexpected creepy tall guy turning up, sometimes on a hill in the distance (creepy) whilst the gloom of a forest hinders your way towards your goal, whilst lights lit only by some dodgy old generators that could give out at any minute (which you have to switch on along the way)... ok you get the point.  Its good, very good.  It isn't a top budget game in terms of graphics but I think for what it is in terms of budget.  It is enough to scare.  Cleverly done.  I definitely recommend this game, defintely NOT a multiplayer.  You must ban family members from entering the room whilst playing and lights must be turned off, speaker on loud or headphones should do it.  I am not giving anything away. SO just buy it and see for yourselves ;-)			"

												Well, when I say I recommend it, I mean I recommend it if you're looking for a horror game.  The story is kind of confusing, but the gameplay and graphics are pretty well done for this sort of game.  Sure, it's kind of short, but that doesn't mean it's bad (take Portal, for example... short but great).  I liked it.			"

												It's actually not half bad but not super scary I guess. Typical scary Slender and some other not very intimidating monsters make it creepy enough feeling to enjoy. Still a short game but much bigger than the first (The first was remade and made into a chapter of this version)			"

												If you were a fan of the original freeware Slender game where you just find 8 pages in the woods before you're caught, you might walk into this expecting more, but there really isn't.  There are a few cool scares, some new areas, and nice tension in the environment, but as a whole there just isn't enough content to warrant its cost.  Save your money or buy a different survival horror game.			"

												I was first introduced to ""Slenderman"" by a co-worker back in 2010 when the original Something Awful creepy-pasta contest entry was just starting to gain some meme-level ground.  I spent a late night after closing at the drug store we were employed at looking over all of the classic photoshops of a tall, thin man holding the hands of children and appearing just out of the foreground in old black and white photos.  Browsing creepy-pastas and looking at a picture trying to find ""the monster"" somewhere in the trees became a bit of a spooky ""Eye Spy"" game.  My curiousity in the concept of Slenderman would eventually lead me, like many intrepid fans, to Marble Hornets.  This isn't the outlet to critique THAC's series, but if you're interested in the writing style employed in Slender: The Arrival (STA), I would suggest looking it up on YouTube.  About two years later, Slender: The Eight Pages (STEP) hit the scene and started blowing up online when ""Let's Play"" style shows and streams started to pick up steam in the gaming community.  I'll admit, STEP often lead me to facepalm when a professor would ask inquistively to the class ""what's a slender man?"" and a half dozen classmates would respond ""its this game-"", etc.  My roommates and I still ended up downloading the game and plugging a laptop into our 36"" Vizio on Halloween night 2012 to properly get spooked out.  The screams eventually died out by midnight as the novelty wore off and we started to figure out how to game the AI, but I digress.  I'm offering all of this information up as I feel that my familiarity with Slenderman (the creepy-pastas, the various YouTube shows, the movie, etc.) greatly impacts my reccomendation for this game.  If you're unfamiliar with the whole concept of Slenderman this might not be the best way to start into those (sometimes super spooky) waters.  STA, while not a perfect execution, really manages to nail a few of its key components.  The levels go back and forth between variations on the original STEP gameplay with ""collecting"" something randomly placed around the map while avoiding a stalking, and increasingly aggressive enemy, and what some may ""lovingly"" refer to as a ""walking simulator"".  Both gameplay styles are evenly paced out so neither have enough time to grow stale in long bursts.  The exploration levels, and well, the entire game looks gorgeous.  The environments stay with you in this game, even after a week after I completed my playthrough I still remember the striking landscapes more than anything else.  Various collectable pamphlets, emails, etc. dot the maps and help build out the core cast and their history.  I would reccomend tracking these down as they provide most of the world building and really highlight the writing contributions provided by THAC for the game's script.  The player controlled character can feel kind of clunky and slow at times, and I undestand the limited endurance was a design decision to prevent constant sprinting away from enemies but in the portions without something to avoid this can feel somewhat limiting.  The graphics for props, buildings, etc. aren't anything to write home about, but the wilderness and skyboxes always manage to look gorgeous.  Finally, I think my main issue with this game is that after my first death at the hands of Slenderman (or The Operator, or whatever) the scare factor had mostly worn off.  Again, I attribute this to already being burnt out on STEP and other Slenderman series.  The model's head just doesn't seem right either, especially with the more defined cheek bones.  I prefer Slenderman to only have a human silohuette and no other details in the face, but again, that's a personal preference.So, if you liked STEP (and speaking of which, this game contains an HD remaster of that level unlocked after beating the main story), or are just a fan of anything Slenderman I'd reccomend this.  Its no AAA horror game, but its a competent couple hour romp.			"

												Slender: The Arrival is one of my favorite horror games I have ever played. It is incredibly terrifying and still frightens me now, even after I have beaten it, something few horror games can claim. Here is a Pros and Cons list for this game:PROS-Partially made by the original creators of Slender: The Eight Pages, and even incorporates the original game into this game's story-Terrifying antagonists. The Slenderman may be scary, but he can get a bit repetitive at times. To counteract this, two additional enemies (his proxies) exist in the game. The Chaser, and Charlie. Both of them are terrifying and nasty.-Sound design can make or break a horror game, and this game nails it on the head. The Chaser's scream will haunt you.-Pacing in this game is great. Most modern horror games go for the jumpscare, but Slender: The Arrival knows how to instill paranoia. -The mines level. You will know what I mean when you play it.-A great party horror game. You know what I mean, get a few friends together and play it, just like the original Slender.-Graphics are pretty nice in my opinion, even on low settings.CONS-I am legitimately having difficulties coming up with negative things to say about this game.RATINGSStory: 10/10Gameplay: 10/10Atmosphere: 10/10Total: 100This game is very very very good. Buy it.			"

												The graphics are nice, and I am a fan of the Slenderman.  I can never fully rationalize away my fears, because he strongly resembles a childhood recurring nightmare that I had.  (A long, pale figure, with empty eyes looking into the window, unmoving, unblinking.)  I think this may be some kind of universal brain-glitch that we have as human beings.  LOTS of people feared similar creatures, whether things they imagined themselves, or things from various mythologies in different parts of the world.But having gone through the introduction, and knowing Slenderman, who is by now a meme, I was not at all frightened, when I could flick my flashlight on and off at him in the first stage, and even stare dead at him, without so much as a flicker of movement or threat.  This is a great way to yank me out of any sense of suspense and tension.  And the way you start a game really has a great deal of impact on the way the rest of it feels.  So eh, 2/10.  Good graphics, story seems like it'd be good?  But poor setup, and stage 2 is a rehash of a free game.  Shouldn't have to go through an hour of boring/ rehashed material to get to the good stuff.

												I personally dont find this game worth it. Its really fun (altough very easy) but once you complete it you just have to move onto another game. Yes you can replay it but it gets old and its not very scary. For 6.99 (pounds) its not worth 2 hours of gameplay and thats why i dont reccomend it.Hope you find this useful.			"

												So, I have finished Slender: The Arrival in about 200 minutes.I am not gonna start with ratings. No, ratings are not really my favorite thing and I do not see the point why one does have to rate every single piece of ♥♥♥♥. Most of those reviews are usually very oppinion-based, therefore, how can one take those reviews seriously (with a few exceptions, of course).So I am trying to caputre what this game actually is, following up with a conclusiong with a small insight of my own impressions.First of all, about the overall graphics in this game. It is a game developed by an indie-studio, so you may think the visuals are not really good. They look similiar to other games, though there are a few things that make it outstanding (blurry, how your character runs, the sunrays,...), so it is not a poorly designed game. The animations are stiff though.The atmosphere swaps from tense to relaxing quite often, giving the player a few breaks.Tense because if you are being haunted, you feel haunted. That is something not easily accomplished in horror games (I like to relate to Cry of Fear or Outlast). The relaxing parts are surely needed, since calming down is important - You feel your blood pumping over and over again, making this a worthy experience for someone who likes those tense experiences. I also have to mention the game gives you a few jumpscares (While I do not think they are necessairy in this game).Controls and environment in overall are simple, while rather strict. That means you can not really interact with your environment. You can not climb outside of windows, neither can you jump, or anything else like that. What you can do is focusing your flashling + zooming it in/turning it off alongside moving around and sprinting/crouching. That works suprisingly well for this game, thus not even making one miss any acrobatic or environmental interactions with your world.As you can see (or read) I tried to be mostly objective there. Finally, I would like to add a few own thought about this game though,I played this game pretty much in one go. I only died twice in the end, since it was really unclear where you had to run to and that there actually is a goal there....that is about the only real complaint I have about this game. That chapter was not really necessaire in my opinion (No, not even that boy catched me off guard).While there are few aninmations regarding the beings haunting you, the environment itself is beautifully designed. Especially the sunlight made this game unique to me, it was well implemented in this game...while the nights revealed very, very sinister feelings in me. Had me pretty hard in its grip, the atmosphere is really great.I will surely play it another time, because I missed a few collectibles (7 I think). So it is a rather short game....paying around 10 bucks for this surely is ok, although I recommend buying this one on sale. It is pretty short, with a rather low replay-value. What is really interesting though is that you play very different parts, mostly just one chapter, with people you read about in the game itself. While the end of the game is not that interesting I would say, it all fits together in the end.Thanks for reading, I will just stop here now....what?...Rating you said? Alright, 8/10 "

												One of the most annoying games I have personally ever played, every time i read a piece of paper it sends me to the main menu which usually results in me having to go extremely far back in the game, and the experience was generally boring having to go round in circles trying to work out how to get through an area. However, the game had some nice aspects despite this, and is a great horror game for those who like random jumpscares, and for a horror game it is quite big and lots of play time. My problem though was the constant setbacks, which is the only reason i wouldn't reccomend this game. However, if you like horror games and have lots of free time, you might find this game good nevertheless.			"

Slender turns the victim into his proxies / his servant. This game has a special feature which is a renewal of the story, adapted and made ​​in such a way that the story is made to deliver an unforgettable experience of horror and push us to the edge of sanity.

												It's a pretty cool game with a good basis on the whole: ""slender creepy pasta."" (at least, i would hope so since marble hornets worked with the creator in order to create this pretty chilling and fun game) Any who, yes this game is fantastic but is also lacking in some sense.The game fluidity is somewhat... lacking? if that is the correct word. The game seems to be a bit buggy, and the fluidity of movement is a bit... jaggy? (Since this is an indie game i cant really blame them, but they do seem to have a lack of focus on the actualy movement of the human body and how this little but important factor can totally distract the user, player, or viewer from sinking into the game itself) all in all this game is fun for the money, and i would really like to commend creator for the scares which i partook of in this game. thumbs up from me!

												Pretty good fun - I never got around to playing the orignal Slender game, but for an indie horror game; this was was pretty good.The basic idea is that you have to interact with objects, read letters, and avoid being capture by the evil Slender and his friends.  Some of the levels appeared to be a little bit randomly generated.  The enviroments were good for an indie game but I did feel that ""getting lost"" was a part of the gameplay but it was also a bit annoying during a fire level.Overall though it was a bit easy the first play through, a little over an hour even with pauses/retry ect.  It did have a couple of cheesy parts that were goofy and not scary.I'd recommend for anyone looking to play a small horror game in place of a horror movie.  But don't expect AAA; its clearly an indie with indie level gameplay/graphics.			"

												It has some scares and a creepy atmosphere but it's an extremely short game that's best moments are in its first stage. The game is so short that I ended up getting the achievement for beating the game in under 45 minutes on my first playthrough. Only buy this if you're ok with the price tag knowing that it's maybe an hour of gameplay without much replay value unless you're dead set on collecting all the random notes scattered throughout the stages.

												I love hating that game.  This is more than I can handle.I watch horror movies, from gore to creepy, and I know most of the tricks.  But there is a HUGE difference between watching a movie and playing a game: the interactivity.  Suddenly, you really ARE the one to make choices.  No more hiding behind your popcorns.I did not even know that I could feel that way, and in a twisted way, I am glad that I found out.  None of my experiences so far, in real life or with movies, comes close to what I feel when I play this game.  I thought I would be strong enough to deal with all that over-hyped Slenderman meme.  I am not.  It could be Slender, it could be anything, it hardly matters, I have never felt so helpless and terrified in my entire life.  I am 36 years-old.I have not gone very far, I believe I am half-way through the second level, although it feels much more.  I pressed Escape and Exit, then turned on the lights in my living room again.  My heart beat is slowing down; I will try again, later.  Tomorrow maybe.I need a drink. "

												The game remains very true to the youtube series such as Darkharvest00, EMH, marblehornets etc, which I love, as I am a huge fan of the slendy series. The settings are all very similar, and the camera overlay was a nice touch.It has a good atmosphere, with creepy sound cues and lighting. This could have been improved with more buildup of tension as seen in amnesia and in the slender vlogs, where you anticipate that something will happen around every corner. Still, the environments are well designed, and the graphics are very good, including shadows, hdr and a nice touch of colour distortion from slendy at various points in the game. The game also runs very smoothly, unlike the first game (8 pages) which had serious fps issues.The jump scares are fantastic, and really make the game. To see slendy in front of you and then turn around to find him behind you is terrifying, and is a good change from other horror games where you can just lock the door and know that you will be alerted to the monsters arrival when he tries to break it down.The proxy is a questionable addition in my opinion, and not well designed. While its good to have another enemy to run from, there seems to be no way of getting rid of her or to combat her. She will just stand there indefinetley when you point the torch at her, and when you runaway, she will suddenly appear out of nowhere behind you and kill you. Initially she is scary, but after the 5th time she gets you in a few minutes, she becomes more of an annoying obstacle than a terrifying monster. Overall, while the game does have its faults, it is still a fantastic horror game, and also a must have for any fan of the slenderman mythos and videos.			"

												Slender: The Arrival is the official expanded version of Slender: The Eight Pages. It meant to have a story behind why the Slender Man is after you, and a few others. What do I think of this game you may ask? Well, this review will cover that.First off, I will start with the setting and character's. The game take's place in an unspecified state of America. Most of it take's place in park with a radio tower and a mine complex. Now on to the character's. The game's protagonist is Lauren, a woman looking for her missing friend named Kate, who has recently disappeared. A man only known as CR can be read about in the in-game collectibles.He apeared to be somehow involved with Kate and the Slender Man, whom does not need an introduction.The next thing I want to cover is the overall gameplay. I think it is both good and bad. I will start the good. The atmosphere is probably the best part of the the game. It gave me an unsettling feeling throughout the game. Another great thing about The Arrival is the genuinely creepy music. It gets more and more tense as you complete the objectives. And also, not being able to fight back can also keep some people on edge.Now for the bad. Unfortunately, there are more bad aspects than you might be thinking. Let's start with the objectives. Pretty much every level involves somehow interacting with a certain amount of objects. It does'nt take very long for the game to start feeling quite repetitive. While a recent update added two new levels to branch off from this, those two levels are'nt very good and may leave quite a bit of gamers feel pretty unsatisfied after completing them. Another thing I will cover is the overall scares. They start out great, but lose their charm less than halfway through the game. The Slendern Man himself begins to dwindle as the as the game progresses. While he seems terrifying at first, he later starts to become less and less scary to the point that you can easily walk past him and not have even the slightest sense of fear. The two new enemies added also begin to have this effect. The hooded person at first seems pretty scary, but it's cheap jump scare attack becomes pretty un-scary and rather just annoying and cheaply animated. The skeletal figure is also pretty unsettling, but soon just apears to be a generic horror cliche. Another thing is the game's incredibly short length. The game can easily be finished in less than two hours, incuding the bonus level.The VerdictSlender: The Arrival simply feels rushed. The music and atmosphere are great, but the repetitive gameplay, cheap scare's, and extremely short length just ruins the experience. If you want a cheap and short horror game, buy Slender: The Arrival. If you want quality scares and fun gameplay, look elswhere.  Overall, 5/10			"

												This game is unlike any Slender game. This one is story driven. Its not just find 8 pages, escape (maybe), over, however you do have to find 8 pages in one chapter. But, most Slender games dont have a story. Most are just you're stuck in a forest with some creature from hell(?). No story. Slender: TA is completly different. It has an amazing story, great mechanics, and you can even play a song on the piano. 10/10 would play piano AND get an achievement again.			"

But now that I have played it again with the other stages, it just got better for me, I had a lot of fun going through them from a different view everytime since everything is placed randomly each time, making me want more.

												Worth a play if you like creepy games. This game isn't terribly twisted or gross like a lot of horror games, it's just all about keeping your anxiety level high! Don't get me wrong, the story and atmosphere keep you creeped out, but what's really creepy is that, for much of the game, the slender man can appear anytime, anywhere, and all you can do is run as fast as you can in the opposite direction.It only takes a couple of hours to play through, if you're not trying to get 100% everything, but it's worth the ride.A negative would be that the story isn't all that interesting or coherent. Maybe it would make more sense if I 100%-ed the game and was able to read all the notes laying around, but really, a game should make sense without requiring that.			"

												Being a huge horror game fan, Slender was one of my favorite series of games. There was never really a GREAT Slender game, but there was also never really a terrible Slender game. Slender: The Arrival is Parsec Production's (the original creator of Slender: The Eight Pages) first attempt at a story-driven horror game. Let me say, it's definitely an experience.The story's introduction is kinda slow, but the game's pretty so its no big deal. Your friend, Kate, has been missing. You travel to her house in the middle of the forest, and when you get there, the doors are open and the house is a mess. After finding clues and her room key, you see that Kate was terrorized by something for quite some time. Obviously, there's a TON more to the story, missing children, looking for pages (of course), and you even get to play as Kate for a mission.These missions aren't always ""Collect 8 Pages"". Sometimes it's just looking for clues, other times you have to start generators, but I won't spoil any more.Slender: The Arrival is a spot on attempt at a horror game. I pooped myself and jumped out of my seat a couple times, and I can't wait to see what else Parsec Productions and Blue Isle have for this game or the series.9/10			"

												I am unable to play this game. My best friend is unable to play this game. We roped one of our other friends into playing this just the other day, and all three of us♥♥♥♥♥♥bricks. I wasn't even playing, and I was still curled up on the couch whimpering from this damn game. Also, I was terrified to turn my head to the left and look out the large picture widows that overlook our pond and surrounding timber for fear that Slendy would be standing there, watching me. Needless to say, this game achieves its goal. If that goal is to scare the pants off anyone who plays it, of course.			"

												Probably the scariest game I have ever played. Don't expect complex gameplay or intense puzzle-solving or anything like that, you should just expect to wet your pants after a while. Most of the game is just spent exploring and looking to collect a set number of items (similiar to the mod this game was based off), however don't think that means this game is boring. The game developers excel in knowing how to properly f%$k your mind while you attempt to avoid being scared. I actually have difficulty playing this game for very long at once, because I get so nervous.One of the most outstanding parts of this game is its replayability. You would think that a game like this would have little to none; you would be wrong. The developers again excel at finding ways to make each playthrough unique, hiding items in different locations and having scares randomly generated during your playthrough. Just because you were safe in an area before means nothing the next playthrough!! One of the only downsides to this is that the game is a little bit more difficult than you would expect. Finding the locations of the items before getting killed (or giving up in fear of having a heart attack) can be frustrating when their locations change every time you die, however there is usually a pattern that can be discerned eventually.While this might not be the most 'fun' or 'addictive' scary game I've ever played, I would say hands-down it is the 'scariest'. I still enjoy watching my girlfriend play it and watching her scream when she turns around and slenderman is standing right behind her. If you are someone who enjoys torturing yourself through voluntary fear, THIS GAME IS FOR YOU!			"

												If there is a game more or the same feel and atmosphere as Amnesia, as Silent Hill (along those pretty classic horror lines)...THE ARRIVAL is among those games.- First off the game has beautifully composed music, greatly developed ambient sounds, the look and feel. Even with barely anything else other than ""search, collect and survive"", the game never fails to disappoint or bore (how could it possibly do that?) - Helplesness is the key element here...terror is the main goal directed towards us (the player) and shocks, oh don't worry....there are aplenty.- I don't wanna spoil it for people who haven't (or are for some reason scared to play the game), but know one thing...all future buyers...if you love horror (SURVIVAL HORROR) minus the firearms and meaningless combat implemented, you will certainly love and are gonna get utterly scared (or pleased in a perverse way^^) of Slender: THE ARRIVAL. You will like it...you might love it....you are gonna JUMP from JOY of it...He's...waiting...for....you....END OF REVIEW...			"

												(mini-review)A fun little minigame that would work well on iOS. As a PC game, despite great graphics, excellent atmosphere and some legitimate scares, the game feels superfluous. Everything you saw in the original Slender, is present here...just...prettier. The game loses its intensity as multiple villains are introduced and by the time the ending credits roll, you realize you've been roped in by excessive promises to experience a really weak ending...A scary game for the first hour.  Not much after that. Worth the purchase for 3 dollars or less. 5/10.			"

												Slender:The Arrival had good atmosphere, and the ""attacks"" were well done, tense moments that occasionally startled me enough to get me to jump out of my seat a bit and get the ol' heart racing. Graphics are so-so, but sound design is well done. I am still not sure what the story was really supposed to be about, aside from a way to get you into a position to be jumped by some beasty or another. But, that is really what this is about - the scare. So, I dont regret spending 10 dollars on it, and it was fun. if short. I would have been happier paying $5, but I would still recommend it if you like a good startle and would like to spend 3-4 hours getting it. Think of it as a movie, but one that is better than most of the sub-par stuff being passed off as horror in the theater these days.			"

												I love this game. No matter how many times i play it the game still gets to me. I can understand why many people would not like this game. It is short but this is Blue isle studios first major commercial game. I guess it depends on the individual player on how well this game is. Personally i think that once you get into it, play it on hard, play it a couple of thimes to get the story down then you're all set. I also think horror games should not be played on a regular basis otherwise players of the genre will be desensetized by them. Even though the arrival didn't get as much recgonition as the eight pages it still get's major recgonition for being the first and finacially successful commercial Slender man game. It gets and 8.7/10 rating in my book. :D			"

												Walk around in unenspired environments and collect notes while there's essentially an ""enrage timer"" rushing you to collect notes faster.  Not very mysterious, not very scary and not very atmospheric.  There's potential for this formula to be done in an entertaining way.  Better sound design and directional cues would have helped a lot, as it feels like a bit of a sloppy experience.			"

												If you liked the original 8-pages Slender, this game is for you. Some complain the story is short, and that's true. That being said, it's a good story, and it will get your adrenaline going. The story is more of a bonus, with the 8-pages (which can be played as a single game-mode at any time) still being the most exciting mode with the best re-play value. Among some of the story-mode levels, there are a few gems, such as a level that takes place in an abandoned underground mine where you must turn on a series of generators in order to escape, all while being pursued by Slender AND an unknown assailant! This level plays just like the 8-pages mode, so it' really just for more variety.My only ""complaint"" about this game is the seemingly random level of difficulty. Occassionally I will play a round of the 8-pages or abandoned mine level and run into Slendy and his friend at every turn, while the next round I'll find all the generators and never even see my pursuers. This is not an entirely bad thing, however, as I truly never know what to expect, and have been caught off guard too many times to recall. "

												This game..... ooohhhhh this game. It starts out at a good pace, keeps you curious. A lot of the time you feel like you are walking on egg shells. There are still a few achievements I have yet to obtain from this game, but I'll give my heart a day or two of rest before I return to it. If you play this game alone, at night, lights off, headphones on like I did... you will get scared. In conclusion, if you enjoy the feeling of your stomach completely in knots, heart pounding out of your chest, insane paranoia... I recommend! I loved it!			"

												TLDRGame starts out slow, picks up quickly.  Not really jump scares, but overall constant fear.  You will almost certainly♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants in fear. 10/10 Too scared to play past part 1Let's paint a beautiful picture for the people.  You're 1987 Volvo is driving down a wooded road on the Appalachian Trail (Or somewhere along the lines of that), when all of the sudden your car loses control and slides into a tree.  Your phone isn't getting any reception and there's no other cars or buildings in sight.  You know your friend Kate's house is right down the road and so you make your way down the dusty pebbled pathway. Down this longwinded path you notice a long brick fence, and contemplate: just who exactly can afford such a fence, and who exactly are they trying to block out? For there is no other houses or population for that matter in sight.  Regardless, you wonder down this road and find a 1998 Range Rover abandoned on the path and make nothing of it whatsoever, because the only people that own Range Rover's are divorcees who ran off with their lawyers. I'm getting carried away now. You reach the end of the path and see Kate's house (Her mother's in reality) and in a remarkable 5 seconds it goes from day to night and you nonchalantly carry on with your way into her house.  It's dark, the bass is heavy and there are scribbles of trees and Slender himself on the wall.  You wonder around this dark and lustrous house in search of clues and wonder just where your friend Kate is.  Among further investigation you notice a pamphlet from Kate's mother's funeral service, as well as a letter (clue 2) talking about how weird things have been happening around the house lately and they aren't really explainable.  From there, you head outback after covering everything in the house and you'll find another clue (not disclosing its location) and off you are into the woods to help find Kate.			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation of the original slender man game.

However overall I would highly recommend this game as it was a fun experience.			"

												Before I jump to any conclusions that the game is good or bad, I would like to say I did enjoy this game...'s story.  The game mechanics and the story are amazing. The game definitely has a kind of creepy factor to it. Plus, the art designs, and little details throughout the game are perfect. Yet, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, other than maybe an artist who wouldn't care about the story, rather just the art. I had heard that the game was coming out on my birthday of 2013. I was excited after watching the trailer. Until I bought the game and downloaded it. The start was ok. I thought, ""No action yet. But it's better to start Slender games by setting the mood, right?"" And then I got to the house, and found that Slender wasn't there, just clues, and the sense of horror. I wasn't that happy that I had no adrenaline in the first 10 minutes. Then we had to go outside! I thought, ""OK Here comes the scares!"" I didn't see Slender for about 7 more minutes. After I did see him, we played, ""Slender The Eight Pages: Better Graphics Edition""! I was not happy at all. Why should I pay $10 to have a copy of, ""Slender The Eight Pages""? ""Maybe they just want to start off this way!"" I said slightly worried. Then we were running around a terminal with a demon girl and Slender chasing us. ""Oh my gosh! I can't wait to play, 'Follow The Leader:Kind Of Scary Edition'!"" I'm not here to say what is and what isn't scary, but I can guarantee you... I was only mildly creeped out by the story. Throughout the rest of the game, I was either bored.... or... bored. The ending was kind of: Meh. I actually played the game 2.5 times to see if there was any parts that I missed to make the game better, there wasn't. If I rated this game, I'd give it a 56%. Not that good.			"

												Slender: The Arrival is Parsec Productions' ramped-up successor to their definitive Slender: The Eight Pages. Pairing everyone's favorite scary meme man with some fresh gameplay and writing from the crew behind the Marble Hornets series on YouTube, The Arrival provides the Slender Man with a fresh coat of paint that, in all honesty, it may not have needed.Instead of the somewhat-randomized page-grabbing romp through a dark and mysterious park that encapsulated the original Slender game, Slender: The Arrival offers much more of a narrative strung through several environments. From a suburban home to a construction (or logging? I'm not sure) site in the woods and an ever-beckoning radio tower, you're thrust into a quest to gather information on a child's disappearance and the Slender Man himself while avoiding him and several other menacing creatures along the way.I'm gonna be honest: I was never entirely sure just what I was looking for or why I was supposed to care about what was going on, save for self-preservation. Despite the Marble Hornets people penning the plot, Arrival lacked a lot of the subtle hints and well-hidden clues characteristic of their YouTube work and the expanded material around it. Or, if there was such context, most of it was easy to overlook while trying to avoid whatever was chasing me on a given level. The narrative could have been much more well-established, to say the least.It was, however, nice to stretch my legs in some new areas with Slendy riding my behind, and the last level or two before the finale did some things I thought were neat. It's also nice to know the ""bonus"" level, which supposedly offers a little extra backstory but mostly just lets you putz around a bit more, actually works in the PC version rather than being completely broken like the console ports.Slender: The Arrival isn't fantastic, but it isn't completely awful, either. If anything, I'd say get it on sale.			"

												Let's begin with this,You drive to your friends house, the house is almost pitch black aside from a few very dim lights spread across the first floor of house, one in the living room, one in the dining room, and the last in the kitchen. Thankfully you have your trusty flashlight, and your video camera. Not a sound could be heard in the entire house, you carefully walk up the stairs into the second floor, and into the last room down the hall. You walk in, and pages are scattered across the room and the window broken. you pick up one specific page that tells you to go to the woods, then you hear a loud scream coming from behind the gate in the backyard, you run to the window to investigate and see a tall slender man, standing there watching you from outside the window. as soon as you attempt to readjust your eyes, it is gone.And so we now know what we are going up against, the terror begins.Slender: The Arrival is a brilliant horror game that add's so much to what Slender: The Eight Pages lacked, a story, stunning graphics, more scares, and a whole lot more to do, with secret levels, collectibles, and fun achievements to go after. Slender is a very good horror game that brings much to the table, and on par (and possibly better) than Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs but not as involved as Amnesia: The Dark Descent. All in all, This game is definitely worth playing8/10			"

												If there is a game more or the same feel and atmosphere as Amnesia, as Silent Hill (along those pretty classic horror lines)...THE ARRIVAL is among those games.- First off the game has beautifully composed music, greatly developed ambient sounds, the look and feel. Even with barely anything else other than ""search, collect and survive"", the game never fails to disappoint or bore (how could it possibly do that?) - Helplesness is the key element here...terror is the main goal directed towards us (the player) and shocks, oh don't worry....there are aplenty.- I don't wanna spoil it for people who haven't (or are for some reason scared to play the game), but know one thing...all future buyers...if you love horror (SURVIVAL HORROR) minus the firearms and meaningless combat implemented, you will certainly love and are gonna get utterly scared (or pleased in a perverse way^^) of Slender: THE ARRIVAL. You will like it...you might love it....you are gonna JUMP from JOY of it...He's...waiting...for....you....END OF REVIEW...			"

												I am honestly speechless. I bought this game on xboxone and played it to the end with my friends. And I was scared to play it, however when I bought it on steam, my experience changed. first of all, the controls are simple and easy to figure out and use, the graphics are amazing as long as the gamma is right (And as long as you don't pay attention to the graphics of the humans). Also, the story is very well set out, I am still reading the notes from CR and other people. The story slowly unravels amungst 8 levels. However, after completeing the game you get the original Slenderman The Eight pages map sort of remade! This game might be 40 minutes for some, however it is definetley worth the time. Once again I still don't know the story, so I am going to read online now! I want a second one honestly!			"

												I personally wish the area was a tiny bit brighter so I could actually see where I'm going,and Slenderman looked kind of goofy, but it was pretty cool. If you have a lot of time alone and a good headset or speakers, I'd reccomend this. It's VERY creepy.			"

												Walk around in unenspired environments and collect notes while there's essentially an ""enrage timer"" rushing you to collect notes faster.  Not very mysterious, not very scary and not very atmospheric.  There's potential for this formula to be done in an entertaining way.  Better sound design and directional cues would have helped a lot, as it feels like a bit of a sloppy experience.			"

												From Slender: The Eight Pages to the new and improved Slender: The Arrival. Experience an all-new game with beautiful graphics and tension so thin that each jumpscare is far worse than the last! With an actual story, dig deep into the life of a young girl who's sister, I believe, has mysteriously disappeared, and travel across a large landscape. But you must, AT ALL COSTS, avoid the Slenderman! Later in the game, ol' Slendy has a proxy, a hooded creature who's also out to kill, and in Slenderman's name. Try out this game and see if you have the skills to out-wit and out-maneuver the grip of the Slenderman! MYAAH!!!			"

												This game is very cool but for some reasone it does not like to run very well I have a very amazing gaming pc that can run the game star wars battlefront at 1080p at 30 fps so wy cant i run this game on highest settings???? But besides it not running very well it has a very intriging story and is very emersive although if you are trying to get as scared as possible in this game then get a oculust rift to emmerse you even more. So i would probably give this game probably a 8/10 but it definitly must be owned so anyways buy the game and yee bye bye.			"

												This game..... ooohhhhh this game. It starts out at a good pace, keeps you curious. A lot of the time you feel like you are walking on egg shells. There are still a few achievements I have yet to obtain from this game, but I'll give my heart a day or two of rest before I return to it. If you play this game alone, at night, lights off, headphones on like I did... you will get scared. In conclusion, if you enjoy the feeling of your stomach completely in knots, heart pounding out of your chest, insane paranoia... I recommend! I loved it!			"

A year later, 2013, they made a remake/reboot.This is it.The game is very good, brings back good memories of what once dominated the internet.I suggest you try out this game.			"

												Slender: The Arrival is a game that relies on scare moments. The bad thing about this game is that it fails in that part after the first couple of chapters. The first couple of chapters are actually kinda good, things aren't hard to find but still hidden enough so you have to actually search for them. But after the first couple of chapters you won't scare of Slenderman anymore because he is predictable, you have already seen him 5120 times and he isn't actually that scary looking. There are some more characters besides from slenderman and some of them can give you a scare now and then but that's it. Some of the clues are pretty anoying to find later on and this gets really frustrating and anoying.Pros:-Some good scare moments in the first couple of chaptersCons:-Not that scary later on-Some clues later on are to hard to findRating: 5/10			"

												Slender: The Arrival is Parsec Productions' ramped-up successor to their definitive Slender: The Eight Pages. Pairing everyone's favorite scary meme man with some fresh gameplay and writing from the crew behind the Marble Hornets series on YouTube, The Arrival provides the Slender Man with a fresh coat of paint that, in all honesty, it may not have needed.Instead of the somewhat-randomized page-grabbing romp through a dark and mysterious park that encapsulated the original Slender game, Slender: The Arrival offers much more of a narrative strung through several environments. From a suburban home to a construction (or logging? I'm not sure) site in the woods and an ever-beckoning radio tower, you're thrust into a quest to gather information on a child's disappearance and the Slender Man himself while avoiding him and several other menacing creatures along the way.I'm gonna be honest: I was never entirely sure just what I was looking for or why I was supposed to care about what was going on, save for self-preservation. Despite the Marble Hornets people penning the plot, Arrival lacked a lot of the subtle hints and well-hidden clues characteristic of their YouTube work and the expanded material around it. Or, if there was such context, most of it was easy to overlook while trying to avoid whatever was chasing me on a given level. The narrative could have been much more well-established, to say the least.It was, however, nice to stretch my legs in some new areas with Slendy riding my behind, and the last level or two before the finale did some things I thought were neat. It's also nice to know the ""bonus"" level, which supposedly offers a little extra backstory but mostly just lets you putz around a bit more, actually works in the PC version rather than being completely broken like the console ports.Slender: The Arrival isn't fantastic, but it isn't completely awful, either. If anything, I'd say get it on sale.			"

												A Spectacularly Terrifying Game. The Slender Man mythos has caught my attention since I first started reading creepypastas. The 8 pages game was scary for its time but this game seriously adds so much terror. The addition of a new enemy, Kate the Chaser, just makes the game even more frantic, because while your wondering if Slender is behind you, you're also wondering if Kate will jump out in front of you. The Slender Man is much harder to escape, and looks much more creepy. The beautiful scenery is great to look at, and when its dark out, the atmosphere gets extremely creepy. Great game.			"

												Good game. Can get really creepy at moments. Especially the mine level. However the game can get a tiny bit tedious and repetitive. May get frustrating as when you're usually at the last item to turn on/grab/shut, it forces you to take steps back or play the level longer. Game may be 1-2 hours long at first but the second time you play it, it literally could only take you 30mins-1hr long. Altogether, good game but not great. Gameplay is creepy but can get tedious. "

												As of 2016, despite it's name, I think this is the only good Slender Man game. Surprisingly, the rest are trash. Quite forgivable, considering their budgets. If I'm wrong and there actually is another good Slender Man game, reply here ASAP. This is literally the only Slender Man game on Steam.			"

												It's a great horror game probably the second best one I've ever played it has great ambiance and build up to each scare. While it does get a bit dull half-way through the game due to the building of plot. It is still a great game with a good story and plenty of well done scares.			"

												This game is awesome. It's got amazing sound and atmosphere. The different levels are great, as well as the easter eggs levels. This game is, at times, terrifying. At other time, it is enraging. This game is a great addition to the Slender series. I had many heart attacks playing this game. I feel like this game is worth more than it costs, but I'm glad that it doen't cost too much. The achievements are very challenging. I highly recommend this game.			"

												This is the official spiritual successor to the original indie horror game that possibly inspired the countless ""jumpscare"" titles of the recent gaming era. Although small, it is very well made. The environments or beautiful, the sounds are detailed, and the story is interesting. It can also be frustrating at times, but that can be expected from any game, really. If you enjoy experiencing an atmosphere where you are defenseless and isolated, or have a thing for the paranormal, then this game will not disappoint... It's definitely worth experiencing at least once.			"

												If u like the feeling that ur being watched....this is for you. If u like getting lost.. another reason this is for you. I think the slenderman is slow, he sends other monsters to kill you since it takes him a minute to find you. HAHAH suck on that slenderman muahahaha... yeah.. good game.			"

												I played the original slender when it was just an internet game like many others, and it became a quick party piece to scare the crap out of everyone.This game? Matched it and I was glad to buy it off the creators website before its major release. Amazing how something so simple can catch that elusive scare factor.A little short? Maybe. But blimey it makes you want to turn and run away...which I may have done at one point.			"

For awakening me to such a wonderful genre of video games, ""Slender: The Arrival"" will always stand as one of my absolute favorites!			"

Story elements are decent, but i was hoping for something new. something other than hunting down mysterious pieces of paper stuck to trees. the easter egg hunt style game mechanic is way played out, and spending long periods of time going back and forth trying to find items that are necessary to push the story along isn't really my cup of tea.

												* what universe is this that people build houses without light switches in them.* Hate invisible walls. If you don't want me to go there, come up with an in-game reason.* I will always love a survival horror game that can cause legitimate chills.* In line with the previous comment, it has an anxiety inducing soundtrack.* First time I saw the slender man, I turned and ran...feeling my characters survival depending on it...and he wasn't even holding anything threatening...* Thank you for not being the only town in a 50 mile radius that uses batteries created with a child's chemistry set. Flashlights do not only last 10 minutes...ever.* I am now running away lost to avoid the slender man...help me!* I really can't stand search and rescue, especially when it is to rescue pieces of paper* Did I mention the soundtrack? Yes? Well, it goes to show you to don't need to send pop a rabid walrus out form the ceiling every 10 minutes to keep a player on edge.* Oh, ya, I hate search and rescue, especially when you can die after getting the last item. Could place for a save point.* Recommend it for the scare factor and I play a lot of survival horror.			"

												Fun experience if you like spooky games.  Eerie atmosphere, decent jump scares.  Some parts get annoying once you know what's going on (like the static screen and screeching noises), and there's not a lot of replay value.  But overall a worthwhile experience if you get it on sale.  It's short, maybe a few hours of gameplay (most of my time played wasn't actually playing), so $10 seems overpriced, but for $3 or less I'd say it's worth it.			"

Also, the game keeps failing near the end of part 5 (Homestead) and I am forced to redo the part on a pretty good computer. Overall 7/10, maybe 8.

												I love this game. No matter how many times i play it the game still gets to me. I can understand why many people would not like this game. It is short but this is Blue isle studios first major commercial game. I guess it depends on the individual player on how well this game is. Personally i think that once you get into it, play it on hard, play it a couple of thimes to get the story down then you're all set. I also think horror games should not be played on a regular basis otherwise players of the genre will be desensetized by them. Even though the arrival didn't get as much recgonition as the eight pages it still get's major recgonition for being the first and finacially successful commercial Slender man game. It gets and 8.7/10 rating in my book. :D			"

												Slender is a beautiful and intense experience. The atmosphere is really nostalgic, intriguing and remind me of those 80s movies, when a good story really touched your guts and when we use to jump in out seats, to feel as if you had experience everyting that happen, when movies were, somehow, as reales experiences. Slender is very detail oriented, and most of the information and the background story is given in a very smart and indirect way There is the dynamics of looking for pages, and walk several times through the same places, but it doesnt matter, because its part of the agony of being followed by something evil that may have captured your friend... so you can only move forward. The game is short, though, you can have it finish in less than an hour, but it took me 4 hours my first time. Its a game I will play again, definitly, and its one of those experiences, as the 80s movies, that makes feel as if they have told me something profund.			"

												I'm a little put off by the fact that Blue Isle Studios stopped updating the game for people like me who pre-ordered it before it even came to steam. I got it for $2 during a sale, so it actually doesn't bother me terribly. This game is great for a couple hours of concentrated stress and fear in the most exhilerating way. I do quite recommend this as the best game about Slenderman out there. This is a fantastic game to have your easily-scared-but-still-likes-to-play-horror-games-for-whatever-reason friend play when you have them over. Preferably with other friends there to enjoy the show.			"

No wondering about in the dark with a flash light that is so useless you still can't see where youre going while using it.  This is like a bad movie where the punchline isn't even funny. Don't care if this offfensive or not,just giving out a firm warning. Anyone who defends this game is either a shill or a moron who loves walking in the darK with no sense of what gameplay is about.

												The most stunning part of SLENDER: The Arrival, is the visual improvement from it's predecessor, SLENDER: The Eight Pages. As a potential triple A title, the visuals enhance the horror aspects of the classic slender experience. A full fledged story keeps you invested in characters and progressing overall, but without taking away tension and suspense when actually playing through the game. The animation and soundtrack are just as suspenseful, keeping me on my toes and ready to throw my headphones off my head in time for a jumpscare.			"

												I've enjoyed this game on ps4 and ps3 and now finally did it again on steam, I like this game a lot. Hardcore makes it fun too especially on the level ""Into the Abyss"", where you not only have to turn on the power but you have to even find gas to power the generators up.			"

												Slender is a beautiful and intense experience. The atmosphere is really nostalgic, intriguing and remind me of those 80s movies, when a good story really touched your guts and when we use to jump in out seats, to feel as if you had experience everyting that happen, when movies were, somehow, as reales experiences. Slender is very detail oriented, and most of the information and the background story is given in a very smart and indirect way There is the dynamics of looking for pages, and walk several times through the same places, but it doesnt matter, because its part of the agony of being followed by something evil that may have captured your friend... so you can only move forward. The game is short, though, you can have it finish in less than an hour, but it took me 4 hours my first time. Its a game I will play again, definitly, and its one of those experiences, as the 80s movies, that makes feel as if they have told me something profund.			"

												Slender: The Arrival was great at release. It revealed a few glitches and some issues when it came to open doors and windows, but it was still a pretty solid game. The ending was open to interpretation and left viewers intrigued. Sadly this new release destroyed the ending as we knew it. The updated version of the game did fix many things, that is true. The game is still enjoyable and scary. It just feels pointless at the end.			"

												It's very hard to like this game. That's why I don't. Slender: The Arrvival is a short game which I payed £15 for. That was about £5. When I say short, I mean short. A campaign which can take under 20 minutes to complete, the game is filled with missions which all add up to about 1 hour of gameplay. Unfortunately, your given little knowledge of how to activate some of them. For example, the scariest chapter in the game, Homestead, can be played by clicking on the TV screen after playing a recording in which you play as the main charaters Mother. Most of the Chapters are pretty short as too. If your looking for a scare then this is the game to buy. I genuinly♥♥♥♥♥♥myself playing this game. It is an excellent blend of jumpscares, atmosphere, and a truly-terrifying story. The mission where you play as Charlie as a child undoubtedly disturbed me. However, if your looking for a fun horror game, then you should probrably look for another game. The gameplay is sticky and unevenly paced, and the scares mask over any type of enjoyment for the light-hearted. But out of all of this, the worst part of this game is each of the 3 endings. For players who bought the game without Steam, the game ends in the radio tower when you get jumped byCharlie. On the Steam version, the game advances to an old burnt down barn I had previously visited in the game. This is by for the best ending in the game.Unfortunately, it's all about waiting, but it does reveal the rest of the story. Within 5 minutes of this scary atmosphere, you die and.... game over.However, the final ending, which is activated by playing through the game in Hardcore mode, is so bad it's hilarious. For some reason the your character jumps off the radio tower and, dies. Yep, that's it.My personal review is a 5/10, because of how inconsistent the game actually is. It is far too overrated.			"

												While the game is not as long as other games, it still has a well-written story and pretty good graphics. The environments are very beautiful and the soundtrack is also really great but it's replay value is not as great. While i really like playing this game over and over again, it still could have been more extended. But even after all that i still recommend it.			"
