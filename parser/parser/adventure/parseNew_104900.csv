												Just so people are aware, this game's name use to be Orion Dino Beat Down, and they changed the name and re released it multiple times as a new game just to keep people from seeing all of the negative feedback it was getting. This is the same game that utilizes stolen assets and the head of Trek Industries, formerly spiral game studios fired the real team working on it just before release without paying them. I'm writing this review now because they are attempting to get out of a DMCA and possible suit of their new game ""Orion"" where they are literally doing the same exact thing and trying to play the victim. I bought this game before even knowing all of this, and felt so dirty for doing so, and im hoping and urging people away from buying into this mistake and scum of a company.			"

												If this game was priced at $30+ I would say avoid it like the plague.If this game was priced at $20 I would say don't bother waiting for a sale.If this game was priced at $10 I would say just buy anything else.If this game was priced at $5 I would say you could buy lunch instead.If this game was priced at $1 I would say you have no reason not to own this.So what I'm saying is you have no reason not to own this. If you even get one hour of entertainment out of it from soley looking at some nice graphics and laughing at some bugs and glitches that was a dollar well spent. It beats the hell out of paying $70 for a AAA-title for the same effect. The devs know this is not the greatest game ever made, but they have made leaps and bounds in progress from the days when this was considered ""one of the worst games on Steam."" And for precisely this reason they have dropped the price so much. They want to redeem themselves. They want people to play their game and give it a chance. What are you waiting for, you heartless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? It's only a dollar. Play their game.			"

ORION: PreludeThis game is like junk food. You know it's not the best quality, you know that you have over a hundred better ways of spending your time, and that's excluding your vast library of games, but you...just...keep...playing.What is this game about? It's exactly what it looks like. You are going to shoot that raptor in the face. You are going to get in a big stompy mech and force-feed a T-Rex a rocket sandwich slathered with molten lead. You are going to pistol whip a pterodactyl that's been annoying you for half the wave.All of this, for less than it costs you to buy a soda.----Now, onto the useful bits of this review:This game is geared towards five and ten-player matches. While the game offers a wealth of game mode options, you are primarily going to be concerned with PvE content, or Conquest and Survival, both of which are co-op.Straight out of the door, you are equipped with a pistol, and absolutely nothing else. There is a minute of downtime each round in Survival/Conquest, in which you can buy weapons and augmentations for your character. Pistols will never run out of ammunition. Secondary weapons consist of SMGs and shotguns. Primary weapons are automatic rifles, sniper rifles, and burstfire rifles, all usually with some form of scope for ranged shooting.Augmentations are permanent upgrades for your character that you buy with credits from killing dinos. Three augmentations are specific to your class, while the rest beef you up as the going gets rough.There are three classes in this game: Assault, Support, and Recon. Assault players have access to a jetpack with a generous amount of energy to use to get in hard-to-reach spots. Support players are equipped with a Medigun, with the ability to heal (and, with an augmentation, repair) other players and vehicles, as well as the ability to self-heal with right-click. Recon players have access to cloaking devices, allowing you to shed off your attackers as you run like hell slink away into the darkness.Adrenaline weapons are power weapons, supposedly unique to each class. It is worth saving up the credits to get one, trust me.Progression. This game has progression for yourself, as well as your three classes. The more you play, the more permanent upgrades you get for them. Things like 10% higher jumps, available weapons on spawn in PvE modes, and so on.Now, here's the thing. This game is, for better and for worse, a tad wonky at times. The menus aren't snappy, the third-person animations are offensive (and, in the case of certain taunt packs, deliberately so), and the game isn't exactly Crysis 3. The game also has cosmetic microtransactions (gun skin, armor color/skin, silly hat, cape, and taunt pack), but the vast majority of the items available are as cheap as $1. You know, like an actual microtransaction. This would normally be a huge turn-off for me, but the game's price allows it some wiggle room.TL;DR: for the money spent, this game serves as a good distraction, especially if you're not fussed about a sci-fi shooter in which you reenact the meteor that extinct-ified everything.

UPDATE : ORION PRELUDEThere simply aren't enough games with dinosaurs & even fewer of these that are actually worth playing! For me, Orion: Prelude (O:P) is that rare exception. Although not much in way of a story in the game (no single player after all), there is quite a tale on how Orion came to be the game it is today...The short version is, that O:P is an evolution of previous Orion titles, Dino Horde & Dino Beatdown originally dating back to a successful 2011 Kickstarter campaign. Although recieving early criticism (that would normally kill a game ..dead.. disappearing into obscurity), the game continued to evolve with constant updates (big & small) over the years from the developers. Spiral stuck with it! This dedication & gradual refinement of the game has resulted in an excellent first-person co-op experience, with a well rounded collection of modes, weapons, enviromental effects, vehicles & more to enjoy. PvP isn't forgotten; it's also selectable. PvP feels more alike to a retro deathmatches, than a modern PvP (in a good way!), but I mainly enjoy the co-op modes. In co-op, you essentially have to defend your power core against waves of bloodthursty dinosaurs. Dinosaur kills will reward you credits, which you can use to buy perks & weapon upgrades, in-turn helping you survive the later, harder waves. Some waves also have you securing objectives. Co-op doesn't feel ultra competitive, most of the time you don't watch your credits/kills, rather finding yourself just having fun surviving & helping your teammates! I've found the community to generally be helpful & friendly in-game too.One of the real stand-out features in O:P has to be the enviromental effects randomly cycling on the alien world. From the day/night cycles to the extreme variety of climates & types of weather. Adds so much to the atmosphere. Couple this with excellent lighting effects through what seems to be a thicker atmosphere and the results can sometimes be spectacular! Even overwhelming! You definitely get that feeling when your final wave gets a night cycle with heavy rain .. you know you are gonna see an epic close quarter battle!Along with the awesome effects, there are 3 distinct classes to mix-up the gameplay. Each has unique strengths & each you can progress/level-up in online play to unlock starting weapons, power-ups & perks. Initial learning curve isn't steep, so once you get the hang of the basic flow it becomes very easy to sink multiple hours killing dinos! O:P rarely feels like a grind; even at lower levels (without a lot of perks) you competently kill dinos & gain good XP. Plenty of dinos to go around too :)If you can't find a friend to play with, there is also bot-support added in O:P to fill the ranks. This can be helpful to get playing quickly if server populations are low (which regrettably does happen).The trilogy of classes are well balanced (no need for any other classes), as is the gameplay in general. Difficulty is super scalable. Weapons are mainly shared between classes so quickly become familiar, and vehicles are easy to use & offer a good range of practical & destructive uses. Repetitive? Sure, to a degree, it is the same thing over & over and despite there being a lot of 'accessories' to the spice up the character classes & tactics, modes etc, there are not a huge number of maps for each mode. I expect this will change soon with Steam Workshop support being added.The A.I. generally employed by the dinosaurs is a fairly basic 'rush' tactic, which can feel pretty predictable (there are a few surprises though), but I find the larger dino numbers to counteract this limitation to a degree anyway. There are also the occasional technical glitches like querky physics (flying Stegosaurus anyone?) or clipping inside a dinosaur. Nothing game-breaking that I have experienced, but sure does make for some funny moments! Just like my many failed attempts at some of the more creative 'Ride a Dino for 10secs' & 'Slap T-Rex 100 times' achievements :)O:P reminds me a bit of those classic, simple shooters like a Serious Sam or Left 4 Dead, but with a bit of high-tech sci-fi flavor. This future-tech feel across the game contradicts the jurassic era dinosaurs & remote wilderness landscapes nicely! O:P is not as complex mechanically or technically when compared to a top end AAA FPS, but its simplicity is also its underlying strength. It is great value ($1!), has strong replayability and the focused, balanced gameplay (some bonus ..ahem.. querks) offers a truely fun & intense, dino killin' co-operative survival experience! Too much to read? Yeah ok then (fair call lol)..  I'll let Dave Chappelle quickly summarise what O:P is really all about:

												The Metacritic score is misleading. That was for Dino Beatdown, not for Horde.The game has been changed a lot since the days of Beatdown. From the original 3, it has been updated to 10 different dinosaurs. 4 of which are playable in a game mode. Balancing patches, as well as optimization patches have been implemented and the game now runs like butter on my computer. There's a combonation of 50+ weapons and gear, customization of armor color and hats and other cosmetics. The Developers have been working their asses off making this game as fun as possible and it paid off.So, what is this game like? Halo + Turok + Killing Floor. You've got your standard pistols, machineguns and shotguns and then you get your rocket launchers, laser guns and heavy weapons. Each class has their own special abilities like Jetpacks, cloaking and healing beams, all which can be augmented to be more effective. You can also level your classes for better performance like in Killing Floor which lifts the burden of having to buy certain augments and use that money for other things. You've got player vs dinosaurs, player vs player dinosaurs, player vs player, player vs harder dinosaur waves and Conquest which is coming up soon.My only gripes right now with it are the animations being a little rough, dinosaurs can be a little derpy and the music is the same in EVERY map. I know that old music from Beatdown will be implemented once Conquest rolls out, but not sure if that's just for the Conquest maps or for all the maps.But other than that, it's a pretty great game that has my full love.

												Seriously, if you were paying 0.99$ for it, then why are you expecting a 29.99$ game ?As lots of you may have known that there are some bugs and immature 3D imaging issues, including shooting delay and broken graphics, but I actually have had a lot of fun in it.Killing dinos with friends is simply fun, with various choices of maps and gameplay mode. If you don't see it as a dedicated gun game, you'll probably make it easier to enjoy.In short, personally, paying 0.99$ for a 200-hrs+ game, that was just worth enough to me. Would like to see how this game improve in the future.ORION: Prelude[7/10]			"

												Ah yes, Orion: Prelude, or as it will always be known to me, Orion: Dino Horde! This game has been quite criticized through the years (and in all honestly quite rightly so). they game if filled with bugs and lots of tedious grinding achievements. Still, despite all that I can't help but to love it. In fact it is the only game which I haven't uninstalled after reaching 100%.So, there's no story to follow in this game and it's a pretty straightforward king of game. You're dropped as one of three classes (assault, recon and support) into a base where you're supposed to defend a generator against incoming waves of attacking dinos that don't enjoy your presence there. If all teammates dies or the generator is destroyed (a timer starts when it reaches 0% health and if it isn't repaired before time runs out it's destroyed) you all loose. If you survive all waves (10 for normal games and 30 for conquest games) then you win. Pretty simple. To your help you can buy a quite big assortment of weapons and perks and each class comes with a specific perk of their own (assault can jetpack, recon can cloak and support can heal).This game has a lot of various pvps but there are only a couple which I really enjoy such as king of the hill and team elimination. The place where this game really shines is in regular Survival mode when you play together with a good, tight and cooperative team. This is where this game is at it's best! I don't think I've made as many friends in any game as I've made in this one.So, in conclusion, if you want a good cooperative game and don't mind a few bugs here and there and can either ignore, or work through all the grinding achievements then yes, you will enjoy this game!

												It's bad... In the best way possible. Will Dinohorde go down in history as an innovative piece of gaming? Not in any sense of the phrase. Will it be remembered for its cutting edge graphics, intuitive gameplay or captivating story? Negative. What you will remember about Dinohorde is the unreasonable amount of fun you will have playing it with a few of your best gaming buddies. Its difficult to describe why, and it might just be how ridiculous the whole thing is, but Dinohorde is one of the most fun games I've played in 2014. The quality isn't quite there but you won't regret dropping a couple dollars on this inexplicable gem.			"

												Some advice:1) Kill the flying jerks first. The larger ones can pick you up and drop you out of the sky. Very disconcerting.2) If you get picked up by a large flying jerk, melee it. It will drop you.3) T-Rex's can 360 no-scope you with rocks. Keep your rear end in motion.4) Save up your dough and buy the greedy perk first. Then buy stopping power. Life gets easier after that.5) When you buy this game - and you should buy this game - remember that stealing your teammate's speeder bike is a big no-no.6) Keep the generators up and running. Because reasons. Also because the game will end if it stays offline too long.7) The vampire perk is gross but cool.8) T-Rex's that 360 no-scope you with rock throws... Did I mention that? Pretty sure I mentioned that...			"

TLDR version;Co-op or versus horde mode shooter with dinosaurs. Some bugs and lacks polish, but for its price (50 Euro Cents thereabout?) this is a shockingly FUN game.  If you're looking for a co-op game to play with up to four other friends, I'm giving this game a glowing recommendation!In a bit more detail:What's good: Dirt cheap Large maps with obvious inspiration from the Halo games Surprising amount of depth thanks to the three classes, gear choices, augments and vehicles Competent and frantic horde mode gameplay Dinosaurs Silly wavesWhat's bad: Some obvious bugs here and there Some nice shaders and lighting effects but ultimately not a great looking game, player models in particular are butt ugly Poor volume normalization, you'll know what I mean when you hear the gatling guns fire Solo play with  pretty basic bots is supported but feels very lacklustreVerdict:I'm quite frankly blown away at how many hours of very entertaining horde mode shooter action my friends and I have had with this game already, value for money wise I don't think I've ever seen any game quite like this.  As such I can't recommend this game enough.  If you compare 'ORION: Prelude' to 'Killing Floor 2' it doesn't hold a candle of course, but that would be silly, wouldn't it ?  I love this game! "

												OLD REVIEW IS OLD. AND NO, I'M NOT GOING TO UPDATE IT BECAUSE I'M A LAZY♥♥♥♥♥br>First off: Metacritic score is wrong as it's for the previous game ""Dino Beatdown"". Now, let's go with the review:The game is awesome, I've never seen a dev team update a game this much. Since release they added lots of weapons, maps, game modes, dinosaurs...Sure, it's rough around the edges and some things could use some improvement, but the overall experience is good. Really good.Just imagine a team of space marines flying around and shooting at dinosaurs in various settings, jungle, forest, desert, you can even shoot dinos in the snow now!The game modes add a lot of variety to the game, there's Survival (where you have to defend a base against the horde), Rampage (classic survival, just stay alive) or Conquest. Conquest is the newest game mode and it's like Survival x10, multiple bases, open world, day-night cycles...Then there's the PvP for all you guys tired of shoot at dinos, you can shoot your former teammates or even challenge them into a duel (1v1 pvp mode) where you use laser swords to kill each other like the Jedi.Oh, and there's this game mode where you can play as the dinos. From the Spinosaurus to the Compy.There's level progression too, leveling up unlocks starting weapons and habilities like, for example, in Killing Floor.I give it a 8/10, really fun and addictive.

												Many people asked me about the game „Orion: Dino Horde“. So I have written a review now. ^^First I have to say that the game has just 36/100 Metascore. But the Metascore was for the game ""Dino Beatdown"", not for ""Orion: Dino Horde"" and the game hasn’t only changed the name, its totally different now.For many people it’s still not a good game, because of a not perfect graphic (uff.. for me the graphic looks alright – I would give for it 7/10 points. – You can take a look at my Screenshots), some bugs (really the most Shooter Multiplayer Games have bugs/glitches…) and the not so realistic weapon sounds or I DON’T KNOW WHY!Really… I LOVE THIS GAME! For me it’s like a mix out of “Primal Carnage” (Jurassic Park Style) and “Killing Floor” plus you have more possibilities in this game. The aim of the game depends on the mission you choose (but in general it’s about shooting dinosaur (1st Person shooting view / 3rd Person Hybrid Gameplay), surviving and protecting the base).Possible Game Modes: Slaughter (lots of enemies)Survival (protecting base, activating objects and surviving the growing waves of dinosaur)Rampage (like in “Primal Carnage” there are 2 teams “Dinosaurs” and “Humans” who play against each other and switch after that)1v1 Duel • Team Duel • Team Elimination • Free for all Duel • King of the Hill • Instagib • Conquest • Gun GameYou can play it solo, friendsonly (Co-op) or public (Multiplayer).You can choose the difficulty (Noob, Easy, Normal, Hard, Insane, Redikulous) you want to play and one out of 40+ possible maps!During the game you earn Credits to buy other weapons (50+ weapons, Tech & Gear) and (depending on the game mode) you can also use 7 different vehicles.But you also earn EXP with killing dinosaur which increases your level. Yeah your level – there is also a level system in this game and the different human classes have all unique abilities.Classes:Assault He has a Jetpack which makes him able to fly for a while (That’s freaking awesome! It’s so funny when the T-Rex is really nearly to eat you and you just fly away BYE BYE T-REX lol). But back to the topic the Assault starts with a CV-10 Pistol (better weapons you get with killing and purchasing). His Grenade is “Frag Grenade”.Recon The Recon has the ability to use his cloak which makes him invisible for the enemies for some seconds. He starts with the CV-10 Silenced Pistol and uses the EMP Grenades.Support The Supporter people have medic guns. They can heal themselves or other teammates whenever they want but they really need it because they can’t just fly away. They start with the M-40 Magnum and have Smoke Grenades. I like those Smoke Grenades because when you get into trouble with the Supporter because you have to reload your weapon but you can’t - because too many dinosaur are attacking you - and you are just healing yourself the whole time, it’s possible to throw such a Smoke Grenade and the dinosaur run away. Good time for reloading and healing. ^^Back to the level system:You unlock more abilities with a higher level (for example less fall damage or more jump height). The current maximum reachable level is 50. Achievements: Oh it’s just HEAVEN for achievement hunters! There are 250+ achievements and the most of them are not that hard to get. There is really for everything an achievement.. for kills with all weapons, healing, flying, riding, surviving and and and.So all in all.. what should I say… this game offers much and makes a lot of fun! Sure it’s not perfect (e. g. weapon sound isn’t realistic) but who cares.. which game is really that realistic? In Left for Dead 2 you can shoot through a wall but not through a TENT! LOL So I tell you to give this game a try and maybe you join my games and we smash those dinosaur together! ^.~			"

												Orion: Prelude is the revised version of Orion: Dino Horde, which itself, is a revised version of Orion: Dino Beatdown. Confusing, isn't it?Orion: Dino Beatdown; the original, was a terrible game that launched as an alpha, with terrible netcode, and justly received a Metacritic rating of 36. Ironically, if you check the Metacritic rating, it'll be for Orion: Dino Horde. Apparently Metacritic hasn't received word from the developer that they've changed the name yet again.But enough about how Spiral Game Studios keeps trying to reinvent the game by renaming it and patching problems that should have been fixed at release; what is the game like? Orion: Prelude is a team-based, cooperative, sci-fi, wave-based, FPS where your goal is to kill dinosaurs and complete objectives. The game is essentially what you'd get if you took Killing Floor and Halo and mixed them together. It's borrows Killing Floor's wave-based combat, where every kill gives you money to better arm yourself, and every wave gets progressively harder; and it borrows from Halo in the Shield mechanic, the vehicular combat, (although this could be atributable to other games as well) and the overall look of the game.Up to five players can play together on a single server. Within the game, there are three classes which further distinguish your role from the role of the other four players. The classes are Assault, Support, and Recon. While I'd normally explain in depth the differences between these classes, I can't because there really isn't much of a reason. If you're playing this game, you're playing it in either Survival or Conquest. Sure, there are other gamemodes to choose from, but they're all variations of standard PvP gamemodes that exist in better incarnations in other games, so you'd be better served playing them there. If you bought this game, you bought it for the dinosaurs, which means it's Survival or Conquest for you. In that case, pick Assault if you want to kill things, and pick Support if you want to keep teammates alive. There's no reason to pick Rogue in these gamemodes. It seems as though the developers made it for PvP only, as in Survival and Conquest, it suffers greatly.The differences between the classes really come down to the single class skill you get at spawn. The Assault class gets a jetpack ability which can be improved by purchasing augments. (more on this later) The Support class gets access to a medigun which can heal a player, and with the proper augment, replenish their ammo supply. The Rogue class can turn invisible which can act as an effective temporary invulnerability, as all Dinosaurs will immediately de-aggro from you and never attack you while stealthed. Those are the differences. There's also some weapon differences, but all weapons can be bought by purchasing an augment that allows you to purchase class restricted weapons.What are these augments I keep referring to? Just like in Killing Floor, at the end of a wave which is usually around 20-30 dinosaurs, you have a minute to buy weapons or augments at their respective shops. Weapons are divided into four categories: primary weapons, secondary weapons, pistols, and Adrenaline weapons. Primary weapons are your standard rifles, LMG's, and Sniper Rifles. Secondary Weapons are SMG's and shotguns. Pistols are pistols, and Adrenaline weapons are class-specific weapons.Augments provide boosts to your character's fighting ability; from double jumping to boost jumping, to additional armor. There's even an augment which allows you to feast upon dinosaur corpses for health which sounds neat, but is utterly worthless. While Augments are important, there's really a select few which are far and away better than the rest which you'll find yourself buying in the same order every game, irrespective of what class you are. There are a few class-specfic augments which I alluded to earlier, but most of the desired ones are shared amongst the classes.Onto the dinosaurs. There are tiny dinosaurs like Compies, medium sized dinosaurs like Raptors and some larger spitting dinosaur, then there are large Dinosaurs like Triceratops, Stegosaurus, and of course, the T-Rex. Instead of being smart and making the large dinosaurs the primary objective of the game, the entire game focuses around killing the small dinosaurs, because the waves are determined by a specific number of dinosaurs that spawn, not the type of dinosaur. A dinosaur killed is a dinosaur killed no matter what type it is. So your best bet is to just kill all of the easy-to-kill dinosaurs, and leave the large ones alive to clean up after the wave has ended, assuming you don't have anything pressing to buy. This is the main gripe I have with the game. The main pull of the game, fighting giant dinosaurs, has been relegated to a mere distraction and nothing more. If you stop and spend time killing the large dinosaurs, you're opening yourself up to a whole lot more damage by the smaller raptors.When I refer to the large dinosaurs as distractions, I really mean annoyances. They'll hone in on one particular player, then constantly harass that player until one of the two dies. The T-Rex is especially annoying because it has this weird snare effect when it's damaging you which prevents you from getting away from it, so you just get caught and repeatedly bitten until you go down.When you lose all of your health, the game borrows the downed system from Left 4 Dead, where you can be helped up. I say they borrowed it because it seems to be a combination of the system from Left 4 Dead and Payday. Your character can fall three times. If it falls a fourth time, you're dead and can only respawn next wave. Killing a dinosaur while downed gives you a second wind, or you can be helped up by another player.The graphics are shockingly mediocre. It seriously looks like Halo 2 on Xbox circa 2004. The Source Engine has never looked as dated as this in a long time. The character models are all low poly count, and the environments are all bland and uninspired. They are large, so there's plenty of blandness to go around.Overall, Orion: Prelude is exactly what you'd expect it to be; a bland cooperative shooter which has no identity of its own. The developers apparently tried to ride off of the novelty of players fighting dinosaurs in a sci-fi setting, but the game requires more than that. On top of that, there's something rather deceptive about trying to hide your failure by re-releasing the game under a different name, as if to try and avoid that ugly metacritic rating.The game is nothing more than Orion: Dino Beatdown, just patched to be a working copy of it, rather than a buggy, laggy mess that shouldn't have been released. All these complaints aside, the game will provide you with a few hours of entertainment before the repitition and realization that all of these gameplay choices have been pulled from more successfull games. Considering that at the time of this review, the game is being sold on Steam for $1, with a 4-pack of it costing a grand total of $3, I struggle to think of another Steam title which you can get several hours of entertainment for four people, for just $3. Perhaps in that regard, Orion: Dino Beatdown/Dino Horde/Prelude succeeds.			"

												This game has made its way through my friends list like a sneaky case of cheap herpes. We all seem to have ended up with it somehow and now that we have it, we're stuck with it forever. Some of us were ashamed to have acquired it, so we thought we'd feel less lonely in our shame by giving it to someone else. Although the game is about as glamorous as herpes, it has turned out to be far more enjoyable. I won't defend the technical quality of the game (it is herpes after all), but I will defend its entertainment value. A survival co-op based on killing dinosaurs with cool guns and vehicles is just good fun. The gameplay is perfectly fine and lends itself well to many hours of pleasurable dino-slaying with a group of fellow herpes victims. The game even offers various ways of enjoying your herpes: several game modes that change things up and offer a good time even when you aren't in the mood for survival co-op. So the next time you see this on sale for a dollar, and think to yourself, ""I don't wanna join the destitute of Steam and engage in this nasty transmission of cheap fun,"" remind yourself that you probably have some variant of herpes in real life, and you shouldn't be such a judgmental, pretentious, snob who can't put aside petty scruples in the name of good fun. Buy the game when its on sale (don't you dare pay full price for herpes), and come join us.			"

												After 3 years and 3 Steam releases, I expected an improvement on the controversial game I had heard so much about.First released as Orion: Dino Beatdown for $15, then Orion: Dino Horde which dropped to $1, and now Orion: Prelude which has recently gone Free-to-Play. This is where I entered the picture.I had first heard about this game with such catchy headlines as ""The Worst Video Game EVER!"" and ""Is Orion: Prelude still the Worst Game Ever?"". I then saw trailers which showed the game in its new polished state and heard the feedback stating it was ""the best turn-around in video game history!"". Outside of these he-said/she-said discusions I didn't pay much attention to this game. ""It's Halo with Dinosaurs"" they said, ""Nonsense!"" I'd say. It wasn't until the game literally screamed ""I'm free now, please play me! It would be very nice if you would play me!""So I did, and while a awaited the game's download I decided to research the critisim of this game. What I saw was a buggy unfinished mess, multiple instances of theft of video game assets by the developers, and radical reactions to negative feedback by the creator. But that was for the older versions of the game, right?What I played in Prelude, and what I saw in Dino Beatdown/Horde, I could not distinguish. I really like the idea of this game and I wish it all worked, but ultimately the game lacks polish: it's horribly optimized, animations are amateur at best, Ai is atrocious, and weapon handling is nonexistant.The saddest part is, it seems this game will never be improved because the developers refuse any meaningful critisim and/or are incapable of coding a better functioning game. They have big plans ahead, but I don't know how they can realize them if they can't manage to properly make this.Try the game if you want, you're free to do so, but as someone who wanted to like this game I warn you of what I have experienced.EDIT:In light of some recent criticism I have decided to put a bit more time into this game,but my recommendation stays the same.To put into perspective: You hear your friend talking about this guy but all he keeps saying is how much of an ***hole he is. You think to yourself ""he can't be that bad"". Then you finally meet him and the first thing he does is slap you across the face. Do you stick around to see how many more times he hits you?This is a bad game, there is nothing objective about that. Programing is bad, animations are sometimes nonexistant, and it's difficult to run on some of the best computers. ""Can you still have fun with it?"" Of course you can! There is nothing stopping you from enjoying a bad game. I myself enjoy several bad games. That does not excuse the corners that this game has cut.There is a difference between a good game and a game that you as an individual can enjoy. Because I and many others do not enjoy this game, that does not render our opinions irrelevent.You Are Allowed To Like Bad Games! but after the amount of time I have played I cannot recommend this game.

												What can I say about ORION: Prelude? Let's start with what it's not...It's not a perfect game.It's not 100% bug-free.It's not a contender for Game Of The Year.But more importantly, let's go on to what it is...It's extremely fun.It's very well supported.It's extremely fun.It's got a great community.It's extremely fun.It's amazing value for money.Did I mention that it's extremely fun?For the price, you wouldn't believe that this is a fully-fledged multiplayer FPS with solid progression, numerous weapons and power-ups, a decent array of vehicles and goddam dinosaurs to gun down! But that's exactly what it is. You probably won't put hundreds of hours into it but it certainly doesn't feel like a £0.79p / $0.99c game. In fact, I reckon this is the single best value for money of any game in my entire collection. I've certainly got my 79p worth and then some - and I still keep coming back for more!If you like multiplayer FPS and you're not literally penniless, why are you still reading this review? At this price, just buy it already!			"

												Over the years this game has been bashed as one of the worst games to be released on steam, however now I'd say get it.For £0.79 game the graphics look like they are from a game costing £30, and the weather effects you get on your helmet is a nice addtion too, the main enemys in this game are dinosaurs and there are 7 of them and 2 flying reptiles and a giant Crocodile, all 10 of them feel unquie and fun to fight against.You can get vechicles in this game, theres the average jeep with turret, a jet and a tank, but best of all theres a MECH! YES A MECH YOU CAN FIGHT A TREX WITH A MECH! All of the vechicles are great to drive and are really helpful overall.Game breaking glitches like map glitches or crashes are very rare in this game, the only one I can think of is where you can leave a map by playing as a flying reptile or playing Assault with the jetpack and fly above the boundires, luckly this is only on one map and it's unplayed often.However this game does have a few downsides....1. A lot of weapon clipping, sound glitches and firing glitches, most noticeable with the default pistol, duo pistols and using reload speed upgrade.2. Ragdolls are really glitchy at times, however more tame then any from the Source engine.3. Playing as Dinosaurs is nearly impossible with the terrible camara angle and controls.4. Soundtrack is really stock.5. Small, but very friendly commuintyOverall the game is much more better then it orignally was, a fun CO-OP horde game to play with your friends!			"

ORION: Prelude is worth a look. It sells for 0,79€. I’d say the price is right. I’d also say the price point is probably another move by the developer to try and earn back some brownie points. It’s a fun little time waster and I can see it being a good game to play with friends over a few drinks.  Glitching through a building you have just climbed on to might be funny then.			"

												Yes, buy this game. Its Killing floor + Halo + Turok. It has its flaws, but the devs seem devoted and are present on the steam forums. If you played this game in beta and not again(like me) give it another shot, it is now playable(LoL) and quite awesome. The difference is uncanny. I reinstalled it yesterday and I'm already level 11. It never felt like grinding.Buy a four pack, get some friends who will play installed and have a blast together. For me the biggest con is the limited players. That easy to solve though, buy and play this WAY under priced game.			"

 About ORION: Prelude Prelude is a FPS where you primarily defend your base against waves of dinosaur enemies. It's not well-explained where you are or why dinosaurs are attacking your base especially the herbivorous ones, like Stegosaurus and Triceratops, but that perhaps misses the point: shooting dinosaurs. This aspect feels pretty solid; big dinosaurs are hard to deal with and can easily kill you, little ones surround you and can take you down in a short period of time. I'll tackle major aspects of the game below instead of a list of pros and cons. If you're looking for deep gameplay, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a little bit of fun, especially with friends, this is well worth your one dollar but perhaps not much more. GraphicsLooks solid most of the time, but things get wonky when dinosaurs die, and when playing in 3rd person. Switching weapons results in a very low-quality model for the first second or so. Dino models are solid, character models less so, bot costumes -> horrific. Environment looks good all around, weather effects look great, but hinder visibility in ways that are counterproductive to a FPS.The GameplayI've only ever played the standard co-op wave survival game type (with bots and/or friends), but there are other game modes. Each of three classes has a specific ability and set of weapons, which are adequately differentiated. Difficulty scales nicely over the ten waves, and rewards for defeating dinosaurs allows you to purchase weapons, turrets, and/or item upgrades. This all feels pretty good, but the weapons could be slotted into 4/5 categories which feel almost exactly the same. Vehicles (which seem mostly ripped from Halo's assets) are an interesting addition and are fun to use, but somewhat difficult to steer. Dinosaurs' models match their power level neatly, and you'd better be packing top-tier weapons when more than two at a time are nearby. Killing an enemy while downed allows a self-revive in addition to teammates' ability to revive you.One of my biggest issues with this game is the AI. The dinosaurs will not know what to do if you are outside of their attack range and will waggle back and forth below seemingly forever. Cloaking immediately breaks aggro of ANY dinosaur and seems to prevent re-acquiring you as a target for a few seconds. Teammate AI is even worse. They rarely revive you, fail to efficiently capture points, routinely fail to headshot dinosaurs sitting in front of their face, and have garish joke outfits like sandwich hats and wizard cloaks. Playing with bots is really only worth it for two reasons: they aggro dinosaurs and can for some reason accurately take down dinosaurs flying at/near the game ceiling.All in All ORION: Prelude is a really good Dinosaur-Action Game!8/10 From MeSweep	 "

												I enjoyed it since the dino horde update. It's like a mixture of killing floor, halo and dinosaurs, sounds silly but it's a really fun game to play with your friends. Good graphics, no story mode(single player), 5 different difficulties, pvp and co-op mods, three classes and many equipments to choose from, vehicles, simple serverlists, simple level system that rewards you boosts, ''starting weapons'' and more. This game is worth more than the price says, grab it and share with your friends! :)			"

												This game is a lot of fun, just know what you are getting. First, it costs $.99, and if that's too much wait for it to go on sale for $.49! Yes, the bots on your team are incredibly dumb, but they manage to get a few kills. Yes, there are some glitches and unpolished aspects, but this game is a lot of fun! The co-op is just great. My buddy drives, running down the smaller dinos, while I man the gun and go for the bigger ones. Great times... It is well worth the price (either price) if you get some friends to buy it too (don't think I'd care to just play solo). At that price, just buy it for your friends and make them play it!			"

												I have to say...when i first saw the reviews for this game a year ago, I avoided it deliberately. However, the developers didn't just sit on their asses while they got bad reviews. ""Games don't fail, only developers do"" (love that quote because it's so true). They did something about it, and now I find myself buying this game for my friends who aren't fortunate enough to experience this wonderful FPS.This game mixes dinosaurs, Team Fortress 2, and Halo. The skins are cool, the taunts are hilarious, the gameplay is a dimond in the rough, and it's only a dollar! So if you ever find yourself with a dollar after buying an expensive game, I would strongly recommend getting this game, because it may be better than the one you just purchased.			"

												Long story short ORION: Prelude (Competitive PvP) was the original game announced in 2010, a spiritual successor to the ORION: Source Beta. It was not able to release due to a series of events and we had to focus on a smaller scaled experience. This was called Dino Beatdown (Open World Co-Op). It was a disaster and so we continued to work on improving it using the revenue made and the next massive chunk was ORION: Dino Horde (Arena PvP, Duel). With the success of Dino Horde we were finally were able to deliver the experience originally promised (Prelude) back in 2010. And then some - considering the original Prelude was to be strictly PvP and only have three game modes (CTF, Vital, Deathmatch) compared to it's modern day predecessor (15 game modes and a variety of play styles). Comparison:Original Prelude / Modern Prelude3 Modes / 15 Modes5 Dinosaurs / 10 Dinosaurs (All Playable)30 Weapons&Gear / 50 Weapons&Gear5 Multiplayer Maps / 20+ Multiplayer Maps & SDKIt is now called ORION: Prelude because it *finally* is ORION: Prelude.You can read the full story here:http://artistryingames.com/spiraling-control-incredible-journey-spiral-game-studios/ "

 It's A Trap! Don't get confused, this game was actually called Orion: Dino Beatdown... And then called Orion: Dino Horde a year later. Hell if you were to open up the SteamApps folder, the main game folder is STILL called ""Orion Dino Beatdown."" Why the name changes? Well to hide all the negative reviews and feedback! The Devs have FINALLY updated the store page about this info. (Not exactly sure when they actually added it, but it's good to see they did.)""*Previous version names include ORION: Dino Beatdown (2012) and ORION: Dino Horde (2013).""The company Trek Industries (who used to be called 'Spiral Game Studios') fired the original Dev team, just before the release of the game, and did NOT pay them. On top of that, it has been proven multiple times on assets that were ""Stolen"" or purchasing assets and ""Flipping"" them to try and make a profit. *cough* TOON LEVELS *cough* They also tend to remove or ban any users that complain about problems the game has. They abandoned this game, is has issues that need to be fixed, but instead went onto making a ""new"" version of this game. Extra bonus though! Their new game got removed because Activision claimed a DMCA takedown and threatening to sue Trek Industries for stealing assets from Call of Duty Black Ops 3 and Advanced Warfare. (since been brought back on.)I will leave a link to all the juicy info here - https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/Now for the actual game.It sucks. It's a poorly designed and unbalanced horde mode/pvp game. The graphics are god awful and jump around in quality all over the place. The audio is horrible. Even turning off ALL sounds some sounds still play and are extremely loud. The FPS is all over the place depending on the maps and what's going on. Rain and lots of grass/plants will also drop the FPS to a low 10 or lower. The weapons are ok, but some suffer from impute lag and animation lag. Sometimes the gun will fire 1 or 2 seconds after you click the button, other times the actual animation is 1-2 seconds off from the actual shooting (you shoot when you clicked and see the pellets/bullets flying, but the animation starts a second later and looks really bad. Found that shotguns were the biggest offender for this.)Half the maps look like they were built from the ground up. They all are basically the same, just with different colors. They all play in ""canyon"" style maps, and either have a forest or desert aesthetic to them. The other half, like the ""Toon"" maps are straight out of an Asset Store, and don't really fit in with the game. They are just shoved in the game just to boast on having ""more content.""Playing as a human is super easy. All you have to do to avoid most damage is jump up onto a ledge high enough and nothing can touch you for the most part. The AI will either run around in circles, or sit below you letting you get easy kills. You can't play as dinosaurs unless you play PVP online (which no one plays anymore and I don't blame them.)The driving vehicles in this game suck. They either have poor handling, or act like they are driving on ice all the time, or get stuck on/in something too easily.The game uses Steam Workshop... BUT it's not in the main game. If you want that, you have to go into the BETA! Yes that's right, they never finished the game properly. They shoved stuff into a BETA and left the game to work on their next game.Looking for easy Achievements? NOPE NOT HERE! Avoid this! This has PAINFUL grindy achievements. Get 1,000 kills with each weapon. Fly around on your jetpack for 5 hours. Play each game mode 100 times (There is 15 gamemodes, so a Minimum of 1,500 games have to be played.) Kill 50k Dinosaurs. Get picked up 1,000 times. Spend 10,000,000 Credits. Find 1,000 Loot Crates. Spend 1 Game Year in the Arctic... Sounds like fun?This game also contains a ""cosmetic store"" that costs REAL money to buy the token credits to purchase hats/masks/helmets (all look terrible,) or armor/weapon color skins. Even some taunt packs were available to purchase, but as you would guess, the animation is top quality.Pros:- It's got Dinosaurs in it.- And weapons- Steam CardsCons:- Everything about the Devs and the bullchit they have done.- Everything about the game- Painful grindy achievementsYou see people, there is a reason why the game costs $0.50 most of the time! Don't let these guys trick you! It's not worth it! It's a trap!*I know some people will say I jumped on the hate bandwagon... But honestly I hated my old review and felt like re-doing it.			"

Product received for free
Basic InformationTitle:  ORION: PreludeDeveloper:  Spiral Game StudiosPublisher:  TREK IndustriesGenre:  First /Third Person ShooterGeneral ImpressionORION: Prelude could quite possibly be the most affordable game that involves both dinosaur hunting and multiplayer fun. It is definitely best played with a few friends by your side. The singleplayer mode features some pretty worthless bots so don’t expect much help from the AI. Graphics are a sight to behold, even with the occasional glitch popping in. The sheer diversity of weaponry and vehicles at your disposal as well as the dinosaur themselves, will have you entertained for hours on end while the inclusion of both Achievements and Trading Cards seems the perfect cherry on top, to an already great deal.Strong Points+ Beautiful  graphics.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.+ Great price for what it offers.+ MP mode is quite enjoyableWeak Points- Lack of tutorials and a storyline.- SP mode is less fun since the bots’ AI is weak.Rating 8/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews.

Orion: Prelude			* 7/10One day I saw this game on a ridiculous offer: 4-pack at 0,99€... Then I said why the hell not??!?!Orion: Prelude is a classic FPS set inside arenas with waves of... Dinosaurs! There are wide valleys/arenas to play in and you mainly need to protect your power generator (base) from the mighty dinosaurs! Occasionally you must conquer outer bases (by simply standing there for a few seconds) and from time to time one or more Big Dinosaurs will be spawned like the Triceratops, T-Rex or the usually quiet (and herbivorous...) Brontosaurus and stegosaurus as kind of boss enemies.Between every wave you can purchase inside your base new abilities and weapons (with ingame credits, this isn't a pay-to-win, absolutely), tools, automated turrets and so on. Parked near outer bases you will find different kind of vehicles you can use to drive over dinosaurs or shoot at them (this depends whether it has a machinegun already or not).There are more game modes including the classic ones as deathmatch and capture the flag.This game is strongly recommended for Co-op gaming or online gaming but if you don't want to you can still play on your own sidekicked by bots. It won't be the same but better than nothing. Actually I'm playing on my own because my friends refuse to play with it as they say it simply sucks. And they're not totally mistaken actually. I like the game but it's not... well, let's say ""polished"".The first thing is the Engine. Orion Uses The Omnipresent Unreal Engine But I guess it has been abused or badly optimized because in my laptop it runs as if it was the Cryengine 12, I had to set almost everything off and Mid-Low details to get a decent framerate... And I agree, my laptop is not a Top-Gaming gear, but it's an i5 with 8Gb RAM and Geforce 840M. It can run better games with way better details. Even the cursor in the main menu is kind of stuttering.Apart from the technical issues the worlds are quite nice and pleasant to see. The real problem is the confusing aspect when The dinosaurs kick in. I understand it has to be difficult, and dinosaurs must camouflage themselves but it really looks kind of confusing.But still I personally like the game. Sure, this isn't a masterpiece, but the ideas are good, the game himself is fun for me and I really love the epic musics, which is somehow unexpected. I like the gameplay, the classes, the jetpack and cloacking device, the Dino mode... Because you can play as a dinosaur and go around eating human players as well! XDI personally see some potential in this team.+++PROs+++ MUSIC. This was really unexpected, all the music themes are very beautiful and intense orchestral tracks, with epic tones and quiet tunes. There aren't many tracks unfortunately, but they're really good, and I perlonally love them. CHEAP. I usually never consider the price of a game because some people have the money and never care and other people like me are quite broke. Personally I never care too much about it because I always wait a year or two for a game to lower its price and then go into full sale until it has such a ridiculous price that even I can afford it XD. And here, with this game, I've found the biggest offer ever: 4-pack at 0,99€!  DINOSAURS!!! I'm not the kind of guy that goes full hype as soon as I see a dinosaur but Honestly this is really a breath of fresh air considering the abused Zombie themed games... This is a reason good enough to appreciate the game... Or the developers at the very least...---CONs--- BAD OPTIMIZED ENGINE. This game uses The Unreal Engine, and it's quite clear considering the landscapes and the evel of details in the environment. But it looks to me quite badly optimized as it's quite stuttering and resource-demanding, even for my laptop which has been able to handle much more demanding games. CONFUSED. I'm not sure this is something wanted or something just badly designed, but the look of ambience and enemies is quite confusing: I mean it's hard to see the enemies in certain grassy environments and this is kind of discouraging. REPETITIVE. There are just a bunch of dinosaurs species, always the same. At least there are different and various game modes that help with that.I played this game on this machine:Laptop Lenovo Z50Intel Core i5-4210U8Gb RAM DDR3GeForce 840MIntel HD Graphics 4400Windows 10 Home x64 "

												Short review: It's Killing Floor with dinosaurs and I absolutely love it.Longer review: Despite a bumpy start upon release and many updates, this game was developed into something great. You essentially fight wave upon wave of dinosaurs while obtaining credits (in-game currency). Using credits to purchase player upgrades, weapons, vehicles and useful items. Some gamemodes include a generator you must defend and other objectives.Nothing really feels over-powered but you will notice that player weapons seem a little more powerful than vehicle weapons. I really only use vehicles to turtle myself and/or as a light defense for the generator. Player vs player battles can be fun but it's easy to take someone out with even mediocre weapons.My only real negative for this game is vehicles are way too squishy to larger dinosaurs. A tank takes no more then 3-4 hits before being destroyed and yet can take dozens of hits from smaller dinosaurs before being destroyed. In a way, I appreciate it because it forces you to compromise. I'm all about compromises, it keeps things interesting. See? The only negative I have about this game I honestly turned it into a positive. Overall, I had a lot of fun.You'd think flying dinosaurs would be annoying and impossible but they're well balanced.Similarly to Killing Floor, every new experience level gives you a small reward like spawning with upgrades, weapons or items. A max level player can spawn with a full loadout of weapons and upgrades. Useful for higher difficulties so obtaining experience and gaining levels is actually worth your while. It's not terribly grindy either, you can reach level 25 in a day. Level 70 is max level.Pros:Well balanced gameplay.Wide variety of things to purchase (with in-game currency).Multiple gamemodes.Decent graphics with nice filters and effects.Large maps that range from canyons to open plains.Many different weapons.Useful voice commands.Rewards at each new experience level (Level 70 is max).Nice sound effects and environment sounds.Cons:Vehicle weapons are slightly weaker than player weapons. The difference is subtle but noticeable. Every game that does this has driven me nuts.Bots will occassionally get stuck on rocks or other objects when running toward objectives.Some objectives have too many dinosaurs which can drag it out for some time... Standing on the point and shooting the occasional compy or raptor until all 300 dinosaurs are dead. This confuses new players who think it's a glitch. It's not a glitch, the point just has too many dinosaurs in the spawn queue.Neutral:PreludeBots aren't always helpful but they're good at being punching bag defenders for the generator.AI is somewhat predictable but it can be fun to take down hordes upon hordes.TREX rock throw ability is OP but that also keeps things interesting. Dodging is easy enough.Vehicles are easily destroyed by large dinosaurs. But this makes it more balanced, I think.I once hid behind a rock from a TREX and then I saw a jeep hurdling past me. Classic Jurassic Park moment. 9/10			"

												So here is my review on this game. I was a bit confused when I first bought this game. EVERY review said this game was trash, worthless and not even worth playing even if it was free. Almost all reviews gave this game a 1/10, but since it was only 99 cents I figured why not give it a try.Then I started to play it with a friend of mine and I was amazed! It uses the unreal engine so it lacks graphics. Also the physics are quite terrible. However, if you look at the other aspects of this game, this is probably the most amazing zerg game that exists.The game offers A LOT of achievements. For every achievement run player this game is worth it even if it was 10 euro's. It offers great co-op gameplay with many different gameplay options. It's like risk or rain for example. The graphics are terrible but the game offers a system that makes it fun to replay the game, get achievements, unlock abilities and progress every run. For everyone that is not a graphics or storyplayer (read casual), this game is a MUST buy!One big thing with this game is the online play. So many people hate it and don't understand the great features of this game that the online play lacks quite a bit. It's hard to find a proper server with random people, so it's easier to play with people you know. I must agree, this game certainly isn't the best game in several aspects, but I'm still able to get a great amount of fun with the replay system. Get achievement, level you character and progress every time you restart a map.Also, another great thing about this game is the updates. DLC? What is dlc? ORION doesn't know the term DLC. If you buy this game you don't buy half a game that gets filled with ""updates"" like most games. ""You want to have additional maps or weapons? Sure, but you'll have to pay us another 5 euro's to get those items."" A normal way of selling a products in the game industry these days. ORION doesn't give a s**t. This is probably the most updated game there is atm and it won't cost you a single dime. It's all FREE, like it always was, until someone decided that everything had to be paid for. This is a complete game and it grows bigger every time there's an update. It might not be popular, but atleast ORION is a company that cares about their product, rather then screwing over the player base.Overall, this game gives a great amount of fun. Don't buy this game if you are either a casual, a storyline based player or a player that requires good graphics. For everyone else and especially the hardcore gamer that likes to complete the full game (100%, progress runs) this game is highly recommended.			"

												For the price it can't be beat.  To be honest i would have paid $10 for this game.  It's simple but challenging and fun.  it also, if accidentally, has a comedic side to it.  Though there are some bugs and the controls of the large dinos can be clunky it's still great.  Generally, the flaws are unnoticeable during play.  I highly recommend ORION: Prelude.			"

												As much as I absolutely despise games that try to be Halo, Doom and Dead Space all shifted into one blobby, stinking mess, I have to admit, this game caught me by surprise. When I saw the game on the Steam Store, and the big, hunky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with some sort of shiny, LED space suit caught my eye as he stood rather awkwardly next to the title, I thought ""Oh, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, not this♥♥♥♥♥♥♥again."" However, then I began playing the game and, over the span of about four hours, I realized what it was all about.Most games pride themselves on intriguing characters, amazing, scripted scenes and all-out fantastic storylines. But, nope. Orion Prelude isn't about any of those things. Now, I know what you're going to say. ""Hold on there one second, Contorted. If it's not awesome, intriguing or fantastic, how is it a good game"" Well, let me tell you. Usually when playing Call of Duty, Far Cry, Halo, you name it. I sometimes find myself thinking. ""Isn't this practically another one of those stories but just happening a different way? I mean, you start the game out not knowing what the ♥♥♥♥'s going on, a villian is introduced. Somewhere down the line he does something terrible and probably kills off one of your mates and then you ♥♥♥♥ him up for it and the game ends with you walking cockily into the distance?"" With Orion, that kind of every-day♥♥♥♥♥♥doesn't happen. It's the simplicity and almost childlike logic on which the game prides itself on that makes it somewhat charming. It's one of the only games I've ever played that actually exists simply for fun and, somehow, the lack of anything huge or emotionally powerful happening actually works towards aplifying that charming simplicity. It literally exists for FUN.However, the game isn't perfect. The lack of logic may work towards the game's advantage and atmosphere, but in some places it does get a little annoying. The slightest nudge from a T-Rex can send you flying to the other side of the map screaming ""To infity and ♥♥♥♥ you"" in the opposite direction. Also, the idea that a flying Dinosaur that's about the size of a large Human can push away an air-based vehicle that's about five times its' size never fails to floppify my action boner. But, once again, these annoying little pockets of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is what makes it all the more satisfying when you unload enough bullets into the Dinosaurs that are coming at you to kill them and they flop dead to the ground. Watching a flying Dino fall about five hundred feet and splat on a rock never fails to make me giggle. Also, one of the most, and I can't find another word to describe it, 'epic' game mechanics ever is the fact that, when a teammate dies, or you kill a T-Rex or Spinosaurus, the screen flops into slow-motion. Why? Because it makes killing a Dinosaur all the more awesome when its' body falls limp in slow motion.Overall, Orion: Prelude is a fun little game, which is very childlike, but also quite charming and adorable to play. It's like you're one of the Spartans from Halo, stuck into a game of Primal Carnage, but you have a jetpack, medigun or a massive, armoured vehicle to help you out.			"

												ORION: Prelude. Previously known as Orion: Dino Horde, and previously known before that as Dino Beatdown. It's a nifty little FPS about...well, the mass killing of dinosaurs.The name changes, despite what the developers will claim on their forums, are repeated attempts to avoid their perpetually low metacritic scores.Each iteration of this dino slaughter game is merely just a shameless repackaging, in an attempt to shed it's horrible metagamer score. Perhaps neither here nor there, but it does give you an idea of how dishonest this publisher is willing to be to ensure the game continues to sell.The game has a glaring lack of polish, tends to run at very low framerates, even on powerful machines, and has the nasty habit of crashing...repeatedly, for no apparent reason.Notably, some people only rarely experience these crashes, but for many people, the game is rendered unplayable. And of course, when you're not crashing, your friends are disconnecting.Playing through a single match of any appreciable length becomes rather difficult.Pair that with the repetitive music and downright embarrasing voices the humans feature, you get the distinct feeling that there was a notable lack of love going into the visuals and sound in this game.Seriously, though. The voices are reminiscent of an athsmatic in a bathroom with seasonal allergies and a horrible headcold. (Looking at you, support class! If you call me ""homey"" one more time...)Notably, the lag and the crashes and the disconnects are issues that have persisted for me and my friends over a year, since the game was called ORION: Dino Horde.If you are among the lucky people who can play this game without crashing non-stop, then I suggest you immediately stop to thank your lucky stars. The game features a variety of modes, but most modes involve slaughtering dinos. (There are a few that allow you to play as dinos.) The game contains 3 classses of humans you can play as, support, assault, and recon. (Think of a clunkier version of Tom Clancy.) While assault is fun to play as with his jetpack, and the recon is nifty with her invisibility, the support class wins hands down, with his ability to heal himself and others....to an extreme degree. He can tank just about anything with his healing gun.Even though the support class is massively overpowered, playing the game as any other class is quite difficult.Between massive dinos that create unavoidable earthquakes, or even bigger dinos that merely swallow you whole, ORION exists on a strange difficulty spectrum.So long as one uses the support class, and uses the turrets on the backs of the vehicles you can ride, the game seems relatively easy. If you, like me, decide to explore what else the game has to offer, you'll run back to your support class/turret combo relatively quickly, as you find that the world of dino horde is quite a cruel one indeed.In short, Orion: Prelude, under any name, is a glitchy, laggy, poorly thought out PVP shooter/dino killing game/dinos vs humans, that attempts to excuse its mediocrity with a low price point.Considering the legions of pvp shooters out there, you're probably better off picking up any one of those and leaving this one be.

												Considering the dark past, this game is well worth revisiting.  The crazy low price, and the flood of updates make for quite an apology that I can readily accept.  A game that was broken pulled back from the brink is a rare find indeed.  ORION: Prelude is basically the combination of Halo and Killing floor reimagined by a 10 year old.  (Not a bad thing)  I'm of course referring to the survival and conquest modes that make up 90 percent of the server list.  There are an overabundance of game modes, some of which I haven't even touched.  But I don't feel like I'm missing much in some of them; but the creators definitely have thought through every possible angle an arena FPS like this could offer.  With that in mind, Orion has a crazy amount of depth for such a cheap game.  With leveling, perks, loadouts, upgrades, the list goes on.  It's got all the bells and whistles of a AAA title, just without the pretty graphics, models, or polish.  And if you don't mind that and just want to cut down a T-rex with a light saber, pistol whip a raptor, or set a pteradon on fire; then this is the game for you.  Did I mention the music is fittingly epic as well?Unfortunately for this gem, the amount of available players is sparse, so if you do buy it, I would suggest doing so with friends in mind, or firing it up during sale time.

Boy, was I wrong. Nothing in this game works. It starts with a buggy main menu; sounds cutting off, the server list not refreshing, unable to even connect to anything or anyone or even starting a solo game. Finally after restarting the game 3 times I was able to create a solo game. It's supposed to be a tower defense sort of game, but deeper. But it's terrible. It's buggy, it isn't fun, it's glitchy, it's... It's probably the worst game I've ever played (and I've played quite a few, thank you very much).Virtual garbage bin material.

												I'm torn.  For the $1 I paid for it during the promotion, it's tons of shameless fun (I thought), and a nice deviation from the standard Killing Floor/zombie wave mods out there.  That said, I have to look at this in the context of if it's worth its asking price and...No.The game is high production value Unreal Engine modification, but it lacks the attention to detail that makes Killing Floor so fun.  Animations are janky, player textures frequently disappear mid-match (leaving behind their primary-colored models), hitboxes are off (why is a shot to the crest of the neck of a raptor considered a headshot, but shooting them in the head isn't?), levels are uninspiring copy-paste affairs (how many times am I going to see the same wrecked drill in a level?) with incredibly linear objective design (Base 2 is always the same spot, as is base 3, etc).  Capturing the bases in Survival mode itself does nothing but progress the game to the next wave of dinosaurs, as even the vehicles spawn at the start of the match - you could have a buddy run to Base 3 for the Mech while you turn on the generator to start Wave One!That's not to say the game is /bad/.  Are there performance issues?  Yes.  Is the attention to detail lacking?  Absolutely.  Is it incredibly linear to the point of boredom after a while?  You betcha.  But until you really start to notice those things (about thirty minutes in, for me), the game is still fun in a mindless sort of way, especially with friends.  That said though, for $15, I expect a lot more for my money than copy-pasted levels and textures, braindead AI, movement animations from the original Tribes (in terms of ""skating"" over terrain), and a linear level experience.For the $1 I paid for it, it feels like a discounted iPad app.  Shame that when it's off sale, the developers are still asking for $15 for this thing.  I'd like to see a lot more polish (and better netcode) before plunking down that much cash, especially when you're competing against similarly priced titles like Killing Floor, Starbound, etc, that are way better experiences overall.

												Terrible game. Fun for first five minutes. After that it's problems show. Firstly, the dinos are all very static. Static in the sense that all the dinos ever do is just run at you with the same animations straight at you to attack. No lurking, no ai intelligence. The dinos are like tracking missiles just running directly at you. Next the vehicles feel very basic. The game's mech is a clunky mech which you click to fire a turret which is pretty much the same turret on every vehicle with a turret. The vehicles feel slow and not fun to drive. It is just endless waves repeating after each wave of dinos increasing in number and doing the same thing until you die. The game's mechanics could do a little better at some things also, like when a ptero picks you up and flies if u kill it while it is flying it drops u and u die from fall dmg(wth?). Weapons in this game don't feel powerful at all. Imagine just firing at this dino and the dino does not even flinch or stumble. There is just the same blood splatter backwards and you grind him down until he dies. The music is loud and makes it feel like some arcade shootout. Even without the music, the dinos sound even louder than your guns. This game is actually just Dino:Beatdown but re-released to try to get more players to buy after dino beatdown got bad reviews.Now don't get me wrong the game is supposed to be co-op fun, but even with friends after awhile it will be just the whole team split up running in circles around the rocks shooting dinosaurs which are herded behind them.What's good about this game though is that it had a nice concept and could be fun sometimes, but either buy it now at $1 or don't buy at all.

												Ok so this is the best co-op game ever made. (Yes, even better than Killing Floor.) Why? It has what everyone wants in a FPS co-op; that being boiled down to one word ""FUN"". This game is pure awesome entertainment. With an easy learning curve and lots of different playing modes. Your co-op team never rage, bully or quit. Everyone is having too much ""fun"" for bad feelings to arise. There is so much you can do, there are three soldier proffesions or in the game ""Rampage"" you can be a dinosaur and eat other players! Then there is duel matches, king of the hill and much much more. There are also a good array of vehicles to run over or shoot dinosaurs with, as well as many weapons and heaps of augmentations and upgrades. I am completely addicted to this game. :)			"

												This game is very unique and one of its kind, in more ways than one. If you read the reviews of others who had been following this game since its beta/early access stages, you'll quickly notice that every one of them says that this game was practically a piece of garbage back then, and any games that get labelled as such will seldom get the opportunity to see the light of day years later.Enter a group of stubborn developers who refuse to back down and watch their work go down the drain, they salvaged whatever's left from the wreck of the cruiser and built a collosal aircraft carrier out of it. The story basically sums up the history of ORION: Prelude.With so many shooters involving zombies or aliens these days, this game's theme is very refreshing to say the least. It is a FPS where you get to shoot the long extinct reptile inhabitants of the universe that are dinosaurs. But that doesn't mean you're going to do that with makeshift bows crafted out of wood and stone-headed arrows. No no no no no, far from that. You'll be doing that with state-of-the-art futuristic gadgets and weaponries.Combine that with cooperative team action and you have yourself a top of the notch game that is teamplay-worthy. The audio is also impressive, sporting above average voice-acting comparable to some high-end games out there. For its price, this game is good. There aren't many other games quite like it.10 out of 10.I am aware of the recent, what could I call it, “scandal” that Spiral Game and TREK are involved in with the other game that is the spiritual successor of ORION: Prelude. However, I am only 2 things: a customer and a gamer. I purchased this game as a customer, and I play this game as a gamer. I’m not a game designer or a politician. Whether or not the game contains assets from games by other developers, stolen or otherwise unintentionally imitated, does not concern me as long as I get my money’s worth from the product I paid for. Even if the developers did mess up, it is up to the higher ups to settle the dispute. As gamers, you have the right to demand a refund or just boycott the product, but expressing your opinions on the developer’s actions is irrelevant because it is not going to change anything, and if you’re not an attorney who is going to represent either TREK or Activision in court, I’d advise you not to at all because it just makes you highly suspicious of being an employee of a competitor organization attempting to sabotage.Because let’s face it, having all the negative reviews arise after the incident is like having “this game now sucks because of that” written all over your review. If that is the case, it is funny how you still support games like Payday 2 by Overkill, Killing Floor 2 by Tripwire Interactive or Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide by Fatshark, because those developers are easily at the top of the  tier list. See, your duty as a reviewer is to determine if the game is good, and if the developer did a good job. If the developer didn’t implement anything that are detrimental to your gameplay, you need not whine about it. In which case I’m fairly certain that implementing assets from some other games does not affect your gameplay at all. I’m not saying I support the idea of stealing assets from other developers, but I’m just a gamer trying to enjoy a game I paid for.			"

												Right now i have played around 20 hours on it and I'm still enjoying it! If you just want to relieve some stress, just play this game. It certainly helps. The fairness between Man and Dino is in favor of Man. It depends if YOU like that, but i certainly do. Note: With friends it's MUCH more fun.PROS:- A lot of variety in weapons and vehicles.- A lot of different game modes. It never gets boring.- Very well-made maps.- Different classes. (assault, support and recon)- Augments where you can buy all sorts of stuff.- It is strategic. e.g. which augments and weapons should you buy first?CONS:- There are some strange bugs. But they can always be solved.- When playing Solo. It kinda gets boring after a while.Over all, I REALLY enjoy this game and now my other friends can join too bc it's F2P now!P.S. I see a lot of people complaining it's F2P now and they want their money back. Jesus Christ it was ♥♥♥♥ing 99 cents and you even get helmets for it. Stop complaining for ♥♥♥♥s sake.			"

Very few are game breaking)- Only three classes (not a huge deal cause the existing classes are great and fit in the game well)-Not much of a story (BUT who really needs stroy when you got DINOSAURS!!!)-Micro transactions (In game store for cosmetics only)=Summary=Overall this game is a blast with friends and leaves you satisfied after  blowing out a dino's brains! Also fun to take your teams vehicle and drive off (without them) and listen to the glorious sound of ""TEAMMATE DOWN!"" xD. If you are still hesitating what are you waiting for? You have nothing to lose, try it out!			"

												I have not played this game for all it has to offer but I feel like I have already gotten my dollars worth so I do recommend this game, for a dollar it is amazing!I was looking for a dinosaur game to play with my young son and found Orion: Prelude on sale for a dollar so with great reviews I thought why not? Only playing one of the several game modes that this game offers (survival) here is my experience.  Survival is a game mode where you defend your base against waves of dinosaurs that get harder as it throws different types of dinosaurs as you progress.  You can upgrade your guns, items, get turrets, upgrade your character with different perks, and drive vehicles to fight the waves.  One of the best experiences of playing this mode was when I was on top of a bunch of rocks trying to stay out of harms way a terrordactyl picked me up and was taking me who knows where (maybe to just drop me from a height) so I had to spin my character around to kill it.  I thought that was pretty cool.The game feels well optimized playing on max settings at 1080 resolution on a dated system I have had no performance issues.  The graphics are not the best but for a dollar with all this game has to offer I think this can be overlooked.My last statement, if you are even considering Orion: Prelude please pick it up.  I mean you can even fight others with light sabers, or be a dinosaur in an online pvp dinosaur match.			"

												Quite the underrated game in my opinion. Orion Prelude is a very cheap and controversial game as it had to face many problems with the Developers, their promises and the developement of the game. However, as i did not have any part in that and am not well informed - i won't be ""rating"" that  here.The game has a PvP and PvE mode. PvP i did not play too much, because i am not into the whole Dino vs Players thingie. However, i did play the PvE mdoe excessively, and i loved it! There are 2 versions - short and long. The short mode is set in different, small areas where you have a base to defend and have to attack smaller outposts once in a while. All that while killing different kinds of dinos, upgrading your weapons and skills and having fun. It's quite short, in a team very easy to clear and more like a ""tutorial"". Only in the higher difficulties this turns into a challenge.The longer PvE Mode is set in a huge open world where you have different bases to defend after each other, tons of vehicles to play (Tanks, Helicopters, ...) while the usual rules apply. Earn money, upgrade yourself, defend the base, kill dinos. This mode is so much fun! Together with a team you can spend countless hours in massacring dino hordes. Different classes, different weapons, different playstyles. Absolutely worth it. I really really recommend this game as a Co-Op Shooter!			"

A great summary here: https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/2 of many of their stunts...1. People on forums, discussing how the company is lying about various things to get good PR - get threatened with legal action and possible jailtime (nice try).2. Gives their game to a YouTube channel, with permission to even to give negative feedback, on assumption it would give good PR - doubles back on decision, and issues DCMA takedown request to remove the video.I believe an accurate description of David Prassel (of Trek Industries, developer of Orion) is that he is the filthy scum found in a gutter that can't be cleaned out.

												In just a little over 3 years, this decade of gaming will be coming to a close.  Eventually, when we're all just a bunch of nostalgiac old folks looking back at this era, what are we going to remember most?  In a discouraging period of unfinished games and broken promises, which productions will truly stand above the rest, leaving their mark on videogame history?  I've been a gamer as long as I can remember.  I've been waiting for that ""perfect game"", the one that grabs you by the shoulders and doesn't let go until you've experienced every little ounce of detail the developers so masterfully placed within its frame.  Today, I'm ecstatic to announce that my wait is over.  All the years of sifting through garbage have finally paid off.  ORION: Prelude is the game that I'm taking with me to my deathbed.  Even at surface level, ORION: Prelude is a beautifully crafted masterpiece.  Never before have we encountered such extensive level design that truly leaves the player breathless.  The first time I stomped into the world of ORION: Prelude as the bold, massive Spinosaurus, I was nearly brought to tears.  ORION: Prelude does not care that this decade still has a few years left.  It's fully prepared to present itself in all its prehistoric glory as the best game in recent history.  The intricately crafted but comfortable controls, gorgeous level design, and gripping story leave me yearning for nothing more.  It's all I've ever wanted in a game.			"

												I like this game, why? Well the developers never gave up in this game, I like that. The graphics are good and without lag, I like that too. The game is cheap but very good, I like that its cheap because you can buy in-game items that are cheap too! I don't understand why games have to be over 30 € because if you make a good game, and you want people to play it, DON'T PUT IT AT 60€ MATE, THERE ARE ONLY GOING TO BE A FEW PLAYERS THEN. Anyways, I like the price of this game, only 0.99€ or 0.46 when i bought it. I like the fast-paced style and killing the dinosaurs. I like dinosaurs.8/10 Why you no buy this game?			"

												I gave this game a chance, thinking it couldn't be as bad as people said it was; I was wrong.Let me put it this way: there are Source mods that have higher production value than this game, and that's not saying much when you consider that those very same Source mods have funding from their own pockets and not some Kickstarter. This game might be running on Unreal, but it looks and feels like a bad Half-Life 2: Deathmatch mod.Some could say that I can't compare this to AAA games, but I believe it's appropriate to add that I had more fulfillment out of both Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City and Aliens: Colonial Marines than I had with this.It's worth the $1 they're charging as of this review, but no more than that.

												Do you like killing dinosaurs and are on a budget?! Then grab your high powered bow cause its killing time.A simple arcane like defense came where you gain credits after every round to buy new skills and perks along with weapons depending on your class (and some neutral ones that everyone can buy) to help you survive the increasing hordes of small an large dinosaurs.Featuring a couple game types, you defend a generator from waves of enemies with vehicles and weapons. They perks allow certain feats to be obtained, like jumping high, being able to heal machines (as a medic) and many many more.Several different types of dinosaurs are present in this game, like pterodactyls, raptors, t-rex and spinosaurus. Depending on the round and which objective is present, certain dinos will spawn. These large giants are considered the bosses of the game, having very high health pools and insanely high damage.While the game isn't hard to master, and very easy to understand, I found it got boring playing by yourself or with random people online. I would recommend playing with a friend or two if you can.Its really cheap when its not on sale and a steal when it is. Give it a try, you will get atleast a couple hours out of it at the very least.

												Orion: Prelude is a FPS where you (primarily) defend your base against waves of dinosaur enemies. It's not well-explained where you are or why dinosaurs are attacking your base (especially the herbivorous ones, like Stegosaurus and Triceratops), but that perhaps misses the point: shooting dinosaurs. This aspect feels pretty solid; big dinosaurs are hard to deal with and can easily kill you, little ones surround you and can take you down in a short period of time. I'll tackle major aspects of the game below instead of a list of pros and cons. If you're looking for deep gameplay, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a little bit of fun, especially with friends, this is well worth your one dollar (but perhaps not much more). OVERALL: 5/10Gameplay 6/10I've only ever played the standard co-op wave survival game type (with bots and/or friends), but there are other game modes. Each of three classes has a specific ability and set of weapons, which are adequately differentiated. Difficulty scales nicely over the ten waves, and rewards for defeating dinosaurs allows you to purchase weapons, turrets, and/or item upgrades. This all feels pretty good, but the weapons could be slotted into 4/5 categories which feel almost exactly the same. Vehicles (which seem mostly ripped from Halo's assets) are an interesting addition and are fun to use, but somewhat difficult to steer. Dinosaurs' models match their power level neatly, and you'd better be packing top-tier weapons when more than two at a time are nearby. Killing an enemy while downed allows a self-revive in addition to teammates' ability to revive you.One of my biggest issues with this game is the AI. The dinosaurs will not know what to do if you are outside of their attack range and will waggle back and forth below seemingly forever. Cloaking immediately breaks aggro of ANY dinosaur and seems to prevent re-acquiring you as a target for a few seconds. Teammate AI is even worse. They rarely revive you, fail to efficiently capture points, routinely fail to headshot dinosaurs sitting in front of their face, and have garish joke outfits like sandwich hats and wizard cloaks. Playing with bots is really only worth it for two reasons: they aggro dinosaurs and can (for some reason) accurately take down dinosaurs flying at/near the game ceiling.Graphics: 5/10Looks solid most of the time, but things get wonky when dinosaurs die, and when playing in 3rd person. Switching weapons results in a very low-quality model for the first second or so. Dino models are solid, character models less so, (bot costumes -> horrific). Environment looks good all around, weather effects look great, but hinder visibility in ways that are counterproductive to a FPS.Music/Sound: 4/10I have only ever heard two songs in this game, both of which are rousing and I quite like. If you didn't like them, they'd get old fast.Sound is less good overall. Sound balance is wonky: one pistol is about twice as loud as every other weapon; T-Rex roars seem to badly clip the audio (and my eardrums); slow-mo start sound blares unreasonably. Could be better balanced and menu audio options don't seem to affect all sounds. Everything else is solid, but leaves something to be desired.Performance: 4/10The game seems to be very poorly optimized and freezes for a few seconds when awarding class level ups, and uses far more system resources than I would expect from a game like this.

												Since the original release (which I never played), the game has been completely remade. So the old scores aren't valid.It's a little rough at the start when you're figuring out how to play it, as there's no tutorial. But it's easy to pick up.Then you kill a stegosaurus with a bow to the face, mow down a pack of raptors with a supercharged laser beam, and shoot a t-rex in the face with a tank.Extremely fun, very frantic gameplay.""Run or shoot.

												Just played it for free, but I feel like they should have paid me to play it. It took me a while just to be able to play it. At first, I tried joining public games using the matchmaking option, but I was immediately kicked from the lobby every time. I finally got to at least try it out using the ""Play Solo"" option. The game is ridiculously glitchy. The game froze for about thirty seconds, I was constantly running into invisible barriers, which I had to jump over, I tried to purchase a certain augment and it purchased some random one I didn't want, and I spontaneously lost the ability to shoot or reload, despite it saying I had full ammo. Despite the PS2 era visuals (don't let the video previews fool you) I still suffered from a horribly low framerate. Oh, and all of that happened in less than 15 minutes.It was enough to make me think those giving this garbage positive reviews are either dummy accounts set up by the devs or they are just trolling me.

												The year was 1967. We'd just been deployed in the delta to keep the Cong and NVA from approaching some of the major trails. I was trudging through one of the tree covered marshes, soaked to the core, wondering what the hell I'd gotten myself into. We were two minutes away from setting up an M249 on a rigged turret when out of nowhere what looked like a pterodactyl flew down and exploded, killing four people in my unit. From there on out, it was hell, neon lights everywhere, and then the god damned t-rex had to come in and stomp our♥♥♥♥♥♥Either way, this is a 10/10 simulation of Vietnam War II's opening, with Far Cry Blood Dragon acting as a good reenactment of the end of VWII.

												 lot of people say this game is crap or weird, but everyone has different opinions, and everyone is entitled to their opinion. This game has more positive features than cons. I'd say that the only real problems with this game are that it's not well-optimized, it's somewhat repetitive, the animations kinda' suck, the graphics aren't impressive, not all the game-modes are good as horde, the dinosaur AI is extremely basic, some of the sounds are basic, and the dinosaurs aren't like their real-life counterparts. I also don't like the new name and logo, they should have just kept ""Orion: Dino Horde."" Looking past that, this is the best dollar I've ever spent. Dinosaurs, Jet-packs, guns, robots, vehicles, LIghtSaber, explosions?. And the soundtrack is freakin' amazing! Overall, I give this a 9/10. (Cheap But Way Better Than you Thinks) "

												I've fallen victim to made up quotes shown in the trailer. Where do I start? I'll start with the most trivial things - graphics.They are bad, like bad bad. Low res textures, game looks like late alpha/early beta. It's also poorly optimised and if you don't own a decent gaming rig (like you own an aging gaming laptop) then forget about your game looking anything close to what you can see in the trailer. Even setting everything out ot max makes you feel like all those blurs, blooms, dof effects are to cover how ugly this game actually is.Graphics are not deciding here, let me move on with the review.Gameplay is extremely boring and unsatysfying. Killing dinosaurs? That's cool. Well how about any progress, strategy, real objectives? All of that was replaced by run and fly tactic (also exploiting bugs and broken pathing of enemies), pretty much all the guns feel the same (like bb toys) and objectives are just to have a laugh at them every once in a while. Go the ♥♥♥♥ to the objective, stay there for 15 secs, get nothing but a vehicle so you can run back to the base asap. Wow, jesus!Enemies? All the ♥♥♥♥ing same, slaying a t-rex doesn't give any satisfaction whatsoever but some slow-motion for 15 seconds straight so you can meditate on your miserable life, since you're still playing this game and wasting your time.Audio is just crap. I think you can easily tell that by watching some gameplay video. I'm not going to ♥♥♥♥ around with onomathopeyas.Btw. Watching the trailer again - haven't you noticed this actually trolling? Who would believe this is ""the most fantastic game"" anyone ever played? It's not, unless it was this guy's first game. ""So cool I love it""? Now that's a cool quote. ""The metacritic score is misleading""? Of course it is, this game is 2/10 at best.Look, getting this game for its current price is kinda a bargain. But keep in mind you only want to get this if you're:-A hipster-A game collector-A suicidal maniac candy crush veteran who's got no cash in his pocket and wants to commit suicide during playing a co-op shooting game.

												This game is seriously the most fun I have had in a long time, it may not be as polished as some other triple A titles but cmon, Mechwarriors, Vtols, Dinos, etc! This game is like a bizzare yet awesome fusion of Jurrassic Park, Halo, and Killing Floor. Its not at all a serious game but I love that fact about it and playing with other people you are sure to have a good time and laugh at some of the bugs in the game which were never breaking the game or experience but only enhanced it with hilarity! As they come out with more updates the few bugs in it that did kind of bother me will be fixed. If you are looking for a cheap game to play with friends that isnt all serious its WELL worth your time to try this one out!			"

												Payed only 25 cent on a sell, 7 hours later, OH MY GOD BEST GAME EVER, I mean who the heck does not like dinos and halo like combat? The fact the developers stuck with this over the years shows dedication.

												Orion: Dino Horde is a big improvement on Orion: Dino Beatdown and is great to play. Many people buy games like this to play with their friends and such, but this game is great with and without friends. There is a diverse range of gamemodes and maps with a large selection of weapons and vehicles. Zoom around in your jetpack or revive your teammates or go incognito and tactically take out some dinosaurs or enemies. Customise your player model with hats and armour types. Who wouldnt want to do that? This game has great visuals and fantastic gameplay. Like seriously? Who doesnt have fun running dinosaurs over in jeeps and taking a t-rex down in a mech suit? Who doesnt love burning little raptors to a crisp? This game overall is fantastic and I highly recommend it.			"

												The Devs are extremely devoted to this game, and after seeing what they have in store for this game, i have nothing but gratitude towards these guys. I used to have a bad opinion of them after seeing some bad news on them, but it seems to have been nothing more than some raging internet idiot posting lies. I say get the game, and since it goes on sale so much for $1, you shouldn't have much financial problems from picking this up. What the devs have in store (Orion Prelude) looks amazing, and they'll evolve the current game into a much more beautiful and refined game for FREE. The devs are also producing free dlc, nothing you have to pay for. If anything, it would be the dev's devotion and effort to build this game into something beautiful and amazing that caught my attention and encouraged me to recommend this game.tl;dr - Great game, great devs			"

												In short this game is almost free, gets updated all the time, has dinosaurs, a ton of modes/maps and is one of the most fun online FPS games on Steam.And even if you don't like it, it's not like you're wasting a substantial amount of money or anything. Just skip lunch for a day and you'll be able to buy 2 or 3 4-packs of the game, you fattie.But I doubt you'll not enjoy it (I mean, you can kill raptors with a giant robot).I've heard that a long time ago this game sucked and was full of glitches, but apparently they pretty much remade the whole game from scratch, so don't worry about it.Oh, and you can play as a T.Rex. <- this was the major selling point for meBuy it.

												Though lacking in polish, it's a fun game, for $1 or $4 you can have a fun afternoon playing around with your friends for free. The UI is pretty bad as is the quality of many of the interactables and markers, but it's functional.Some of the modes like the (Player)Dinos VS Marines(Player) require lots of players since they can't be played with bots.The netcode could use some work, PVP between 2 computers in the same network was pretty laggy, so LAN play would be a nice addition.It's a pretty basic game and on the lowest settings practically any PC can run it. Overall, I'd recommend it if you are looking for some fun co-op if you know you can get past the game's lack of polish, and no there's no barrier to entry.			"

												Every time this game was on sale, the low metacritic score made me keep my distance. I was still skeptical when the developers offered it at 90% off, but it's hard to not try something for a dollar. And that was a good decision. Burnt out on Killing Floor? Give Dino Horde a shot. There's lots of different game modes, plenty of weapons and augmentations, a few vehicles, three classes of characters with different abilities, 50 levels of character unlocks, several levels of difficulty, and even Borderlands style second wind. I've had an enormous amount of fun so far with this game. Ignore the useless metacritic score and check it out--a welcome addition to the coop club.			"

												This game has a lot of bad press about it, and it doesn't deserve it as much as it did in the past. Things have gotten a lot better since ORION: Dino Beatdown, and even from the original release of ORION: Dino Horde (which people got for free if they already had O:DB, so check if you already have it from the previous name), and the amount of fun you have with the game is linked to your disposition to it. If you go in thinking it's going to be a terrible game, you're not going to have fun with it. If you think it could be good, then you'll probably give it more of a chance. There's been a lot of updates and additions that probably fixed something you didn't like about it before. (I'm looking at you, TotalBiscuit, and everyone that follows him blindly about his first impressions.)With that said, this can be a lot of fun with friends, playing by yourself is okay, but it really shines with more people. If you get on Skype/TeamSpeak with some pals (because who uses in-game voice chats anymore, really?), you can coordinate and assist each other in your fight against waves of dinosaurs who apparently find the noise/smell of your energy generators really annoying/tasty. I've found it to be an enjoyable alternative to Killing Floor or especially any of the modes in the CoD games (save for MW1 or BO2).Sure, it's had a past behind it, and there's some concepts borrowed from other games, but if you wait for a sale (namely right now, it's free to play for the week of Feb 20-27, and you can have it forever if you pay a single dollar), then maybe you can justify the purchase. Personally, I don't think that it's worth it at full price, but once it goes under 50% discount, that should ease the hesitation. Now go ahead and try it on a sale (maybe get a 4-pack to share), bring some friends along, don't be a filthy public match joiner.			"

												When this was Orion: Dino Horde, I would have recommended this game.Most of my time spent playing this game was when it was under the previous title, and I throughly enjoyed my time with the game during that time. I randomly decided to try it once more, after its update to the new title to see if it was still okay.The menu UI for the game, with the transition, feels like it under went a 15+ year regression compared to what it was previously. They had a fairly sleek UI previously, that overall looked decent for a modern age game, and it functioned well enough, and now the new UI looks like something that might have been taken straight out of the late 90s, maybe early 2000s.Aside from that, the views while in the game, at least to me, went from feeling like a decent first/third shooter to feeling just cramped.  I could be wrong on what I recall on this point, but I remember having a wider field of vision for both first and third person views, and even as a spectator floating around, I recall a wider view than what is shown.On the positive side, it is still a good game for the price.. it just feels more deserving of that price now, instead of feeling like an amazing game for the price. If you need something to entertain you for a couple of hours, this will certainly do it, especially for the price on it.			"

												ORION Prelude is a charming enough FPS with dinosaurs that only costs $.99 right? Wrong! while this game has some good qualities to it, there are far too many bugs/ issues with it to even consider playing in a more consistent capacity, with there being far more capable FPS for free on steam. You would think with the 99 cent price tag that the game is worth a shot and your right. But when you get in game and notice that the game also has in game purchases for cosmetics and everything else, bugs and very unrefined yet basic system. You'll be wondering why you even payed the $1 in the first place. Luckily I was one of the thousands of people who got this game for free and thankfully that means that I got free trading cards for my time spent playing the game. before I get to the pros and cons of this game, I'd like to put some of the comments in retrospect from my experience.This game has been compared to Halo, Borderlands, Killing floor, Jurassic park and a plethora of other AAA/ popular games.To clarify things for the hyped up buyer. This game is as similar to those games combines as power puff girls is to street fighter. To put some things into terms this game retains a cap of roughly 300 players per day, while the original Halo on PC still caps out at 400 users daily. So if your looking for Halo. Then just go back to the original PC community as it is still alive my friend.Sure this game has guns, but the shooting is generic and it's not realistic nor is it futuristic. The game can be played with the starting pistol and not challenge the user very much as he sits on a rock and kills all the boss dinos and everything in between. Even when I force myself to stay on the ground, the AI is poorly executed, even while on the hardest difficulties.Pros and Cons.Pros: *The game is fairly cheap.*The community is not dead for now.*The developers may fix all the issues at some point.*The developers give away thousands of copies of the game monthly, so you can expect new and exciting users to keep playing with while the fun lasts.*The graphics are quite nice for the price*You get a cute little shooter for 99 centsCons:*Even on a high performance gaming computer, this game does not function well in full screen what so ever.*The game forces it to launch in full screen no matter how many time you toggle it to windows.*The clipping isn't rendered correctly on full screen*The audio is horrible and often drops/ cuts out from gun fire to dino roars.*The vehicle control is highly generic and most often comparable to Halo 1(That's a lie) The vehicle controls are far worse than the original halo games, or almost any early shooter for that mater.*Full controller support is true, although it's highly glitchy and the controls don't always seem to register when using a controller vs mouse and keyboard.*combat is often boring and tedious as the AI is one of the worse AI's I've seen in a FPS.I could keep listing things wrong with the game but there is too many other games I could be playing during this time. I do hope that the developer takes the time to buckle down and release a good patch to fix most of the issues as the majority of them are common features in thousands of games that have way less funding/ following. My advice is simple, if you want a fps with dinosaurs in it. Then buy a game that has mods for dinosaurs in it. Like Star Wars Battlefront II or Arma II. Cheers and happy gaming			"

 You can't go wrong with that tag. Don't buy a 99c game expecting a   Triple A   title. It has flaws, it has bugs. BUT it is most definitely  fun!  Simillar to Killing Floor you get hordes of  Zombies   DINOSAAAAAUURS  AND ♥♥♥♥ EM' UP.. Halo style? Hell yeah! Jetpacks, tanks, helis, and... all the other rides. Not enough? THIS GAME HAS BOTH A LIGHT SABER AND A BOW GODDAMMIT!  That aside ^  This game was released in a horrible, horrible state. Developers like any other *ehm* early access developer just abandon it. They updated it with over 60+ FREE updates! They basically cleaned over the mess they made and supported it with heart.  With all these ""Updates"". The game now offers 15+ game modes, 20+ maps, realtime day/night cycles and a weather system, 250+ achievements, 150 levels of progression and unlocks (coop modes only), 10 playable dinosaurs, open world gameplay, coop gameplay, pvp gameplay, pvpve gameplay, duel gameplay, 50+ weapons and gear!

												If there ever was a game that combined Aliens, Dinosaurs, Space Marines and robots etc. It's this... People may say it's a bad game. That's because it ain't your avarage shooter. I love this game, and the first time I saw it, I said ""I want"". It may not have a storyline so far, and It may just be matches fighting people or Dinosaurs but it's so much fun and great all the same. Dino Horde is reguarlly updated and is about to 'evolve' into it's final stage, Prelude. And I can't wait, so far it's one of my favourite shooters. The company may be small but it has made a great game. There are tons of Dinosaurs you can play as and fight. Tons of customizations, weapons and weapons and vehicles. One thing annoys me though, you can only play team eliminations and free for all's a lot when it goes on sale for $1. When it's not on sale, all you see is survivals and conquests and very rarely a Duel or Gungame.It's still worth your money and attention. I would recommend getting Orion Dino Horde!(Also like how I heard T-mass on their trailers)			"

												I know that the first version of Dino Horde didn't get very good reviews, and many people pass this game up because of that. The game has had a revival since then, and has gotten much better as a game. Having not actually played the earlier version, I personally find it hard to believe that a game so creative and well made could ever deserve the terrible metascore and overall hate that Dino Horde has recieved. This really is a great game, it probably won't be on a top five FPS list any time soon, but for people that love science fiction shooter games with simple objectives and a gun purchase system like in CS:GO, then this is the game for you. It also has dinosaurs in it, so that's a plus.Edit: This review is for dino horde. Prelude is a terrible game; the creators messed up big time.			"

												If you are using Steam Enhanced and see that this game has many dislikes, dont act on that. This game, at launch was very buggy and needed a lot of content. The devs have made up for it and have cerrtainly improved the game a lot. I suggest this game A LOT. The metacritic is also another misleading score, it reflects the original games score, but the game has evolved quite a bit since then. Why should you buy it? This game is for people that like games like Killing Floor that send the players against waves of enemies that keep getting stronger wave after wave, occasionally there will be a boss dino which will be quite the destruction machine. My own suggestion is to play this game with stranger and/or friends, since the singleplayer can feel a bit devoid of hummanity.			"

												I was shocked when I saw this game being sold for 0.99 €, so I decided to write a review.This game truly made a great leap in development and is an acceptable, fun and fast shooter with many game modes, maps, enemies and vehicles. Playing with friends is even more fun, and if you're not interested in dinosaurs, you can disable them, receiving a normal FPS game.I'm very sorry for the developers, who optimized this game instead of just dropping it. It's sad that you are able to earn more cash with an unfinished, bad and buggy 'Early Access' game than actually with a real good game... :c			"

												Few times in one's life do they get the opportunity to do the things that you can do in this game. I have been blessed with the oppurtunity to shoot dinosaurs in the crotch while driving mech suits and tanks. Doesn't sound relaxing enough? Perhaps you enjoy pushing your friends and dinosaur corpses through the blood and feces of a now endangered species with state of the art ragdoll physics?And how can we forget about the CryEngine level graphics and in-depth storyline? I was hooked from the beginning of the 10 level massacre to the end. I became legitimately worried about the sanity and morality of the characters and even the dinosaurs. The game creates a player-glitchy NPC bond that can only be created on the incredibly diverse levels that the developers have created. Don't even get me started on the animations! They were ""Transformers"" quality and left me in awe every time I looked at them in 3rd person mode.  Basically, this game gives you an oppurtunity to achieve your goals and conquer your greatest fears in one incredible experience. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------26/10 would recommend to public----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Best game on Steam.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------			"

The first big problem with this game was that people expected too much from it, even when it was selling for $0.99 (or €0.99, or £0.99, whatever...). It looks tired, outdated and it's got glitches left, right and center, but for that kind of money, who cares? It's a nice, casual little dino shooter to play either solo or coop with friends and/or foes, that's all. And honestly, Orion is way better than most of the indie crap which is sold on Steam for way more than that, also not to mention that the devs are still updating it, surprisingly...Up until when I last played (a year ago or so), the second biggest problem was the lack of players (and servers, as a consequence). Because most people who bought it wouldn't take it seriously -- and I'm not sure if even the devs took their own product seriously, first selling it for that price, now giving it away for free --, it was always the same little community playing and a few newcomers in between. Hopefully now that it's gone F2P, things will change, and if so, I may be back playing it.Well, it's free now, so no excuse for anyone not to try it at least...			"

												its difficult to call this game a series because the game is pretty much a copy and paste from the first game. the controls are clunky in some ways and frame rate is jumpy even with a good rig, the options are decent but ive seen better. i was excited at firstbecause it is made on the UDK engine but the graphics BUT playing the game for just a couple minutes the game looks awful. and its not just the landscape ether. dinosaur models are horriable textured, attack animations are laughable, weapon modes look like theyve been made for a game published in 2001. and despite the lack of stories in which there are none at all, playing the game just felt weak. futuristic soldiers fighting dinosaurs, ""next wave"" do it again over and over until you get bored and leave the game.3/10			"

												After reading the reviews, I bought this game thinking I would get a few lolz with 3 friends for 3 euros. After playing for a while, I have to say that this game is ridiculous and looks funny, but it is also absolutely fun and awesome.Animations look weird, graphics are dated and some illustration are hilarious in a kitsch way. It can be confusing too and doesn't make much sense. But as long as you don't take the game seriously it's surprisingly fun. Just try it if you can without expecting too much. It does a very good job at making you forget its flaw.			"

												I played this game for 25 hours striaght for Extra Life 2013, and despite the obvious exhastion of playing a video game for that long, it was a surprisingly fun experience!  There was more than enough content to keep me occupied by myself for around 10 hours, and 10 more if you have friends to play with.  Of course it isn't perfect, the looping music can get very repetitive, but it does a good job of getting you hyped up.  As of this review, it is on sale for $0.99 and Free-to-Play, so at least give it an hour of your time, and be patient with it.			"

You could take it seriously if you wanted to, but it's more fun to treat it like halo with dinosaurs in it.  I mean, come on.  I can't think of a reason not to buy this game, especially for a buck.

												With 160++ hours on this game over the course of almost 1 years seeing this game in steam.Good game with high potential, sadly the devs take this game lightly. the game stopped developed after the 1$ promotion and later the F2P status. and lead to other kind of problems.I tell you with my honest point of view- no or too little guide for newcomers (in-game help)- bugs, frequent crashing problems and poorly optimized game mechanic.- time consuming steam achievements.- lags or high ping problems (if unlucky, mostly unlucky)- inactive community in forum- repetitive and easily get bored. nothing much to explore.- unforgiving for newcomers, you need to level up to get advantages on your characters.- too much game mode with each of them have under the mediocre optimization. (too little players play the game)- servers mostly empty. rarely seeing others game mode in play.- very bad radar display- glitched map.- bad optimization on rampage mode especially for dino part.the good things are:+ a lot of species of dino. flying one, small one compy, big one t-rex raptor, etc+ has fps style mixed with survival elements againts dino.+ vehicles. a lot of vehicles+ 3 classes to be played.+ it went F2P, so no harm if you regret playing this game.conclusion - no harm to try this game. sorry to say, due to its state i cannot recommend this game to you until the devs perform any responsible action to fix the current issues.

												I really love this game. The graphics, atmosphere, weapons, tactics, co-op, multiplayer, dinosaurs, and every other things are really awesome. This game reminds of Crysis sometime and other games too because this game is almost like it, halo, KF and others but having dinosaurs! You cannot only kill dinosaurs, you can also become a dinosaurs (rampage mode) which makes this game great fun to play with your friend. I started off with the DM mode which was quite good and after that I was basically playing survival mode with my friends, it was fun chasing the small dinosaurs, flying dinos, huge dinos, and others. I really recommend this game - the developers put alot of effort into this game. Really this game is not really worth $0.99, I should've spend more money on this!			"

At a very cheap price this game can last you a very good amount of hours. Getting all the achievements has taken me a very long time, and for the 69p I got this game for it was obviously worth the price. Great for 4 co-op fun, and is also good for other modes.			"

												Can't...Stop...Playing...Vehicles with weapons, plenty of guns, different play styles, and teamwork! Dino Horde gets a 9.5/10 because, unlike other dev teams, here development and new content never ceases. The community of players are great and you quickly meet veterans ready to help you out, share credits, and help you level. Not to mention there are a variety of game modes, the most exciting (for me) being survival mode, where increasingly large waves of dinosaurs arrive in game to munch on you. On harder game levels the battles are so intense you find yourself narrowly escaping with your life by killing a t-rex just before he chomps down on you, or getting ground stomped by a stegosaur that sends your vehicle flying through the air...but it is okay because you got a jet-pack!

												This game for me was more of a Yes/No thoughts about it. I usually found a match, so that was good; Gameplay gets boring after about 2.5hrs you just do the same thing over and over unless you change gamemodes which may give you another 1hr of gameplay. The weapon buying system is decent, you can buy Turrets, Flamethrower, Minigun, Swords, New primary weapons, Grenades, ect. Some of the reloading animations can be buggy, such as fingers going through weapon. Overall this game just went below average.			"

												So I see a ton of reviews stating that ""This game is fun! This game is Awesome!! Best Co-oop ever!"", but none of them give you any details at all. I see some that do, but it annoys me that they put up a 'release' video that has multiple reviews doing just what I hate. Don't get me wrong though, I do love the idea of showing the communities love for a game by putting their name on the video, but at the same time it's bad. I'll get to the point though, the review of the game via pro and con list.Pros:The game is 0.99c.It has co-op in so many ways.It has pvpve.it has hordes of dinos.It is satisfying to kill a bunch of dinos with a big gun/tank.There are lots of weapons.Conquest mode has a very interesting concept.It has the old announcer styled ""Double Kill, Triple Kill, ect"".Cons:There is a bug that allows your ""Private"" server to become a public server without warning.There is no way to change the audio for the Dino's seperately from the other audio so if your game volume isn't low the T-rex will kill your ears.For all the guns, there are really only about 10 you will ever use.If one person is killing all the dinos they get all the money, and can share it, but usually won't since the good weapons cost so much.Getting a tank is a savior just as much as a death wish, as you can die in seconds to anything larger than the acid spitting dinos.(T-rex, stega, ect.)Getting stuck on spots is very likely.The tank's machine gun is ear♥♥♥♥♥♥much like the large dino roars.The Mech is awesome looking but will die even faster than a jeep without a gun will.There are turrets, but they only last for 60seconds.They have an apc that does tons more damage than the tank, and has seats that are supposed to allow passangers to shoot from, but they do not, and it has a main gun that was apparently taken out so the main weapon has a non-functional cannon on it now.The most viable way of killing dinos is running them over, but that will get you far far far less credits so you will be less useful versus large dinos.There are still other bugs that have not been adressed.Controllers still do not function properly with the game.The new update has brought in even more bugs than before it seems.This is supposedly the 3rd time the game has been 'redone' or whatever they would like to call it, and the ammount of change is so pitifully small that it's not worth mentioning.So after putting all that in, I'll say this for my final words. I have played the game quite a bit, I'm lvl20+, which I didn't put as a pro or con because I didn't think of it as especially one or the other. I have used most of the weapons except for a select few that I just have not wanted to use at all. I've played all the co-op maps so far for survival and conquest. I can say this from my experience. I would not pay 99c to play this game. It is fun for a short while, but after you get frustrated with it, and after you realize how buggy and glitchy the game is. You and your friends will quickly move onto other games, and the fact that they have renamed it(for reasons I didn't look into as I didn't really care.) along side pricing it at 99c now, makes me feel like they have possibly given up on fixing anything with it, and just want to squeeze this lemon for it's last drops of juice. They put out a fancy trailer that recognizes the positive short review from the community, and left it at that.So I say keep your dollar, and buy something else. This game will most likely rot in your steam library like it has mine. It has become that game that me and a few friends play for about 1hour every 2-3 months then forget it again because we hate the bugs and glitches.			"

												Ignore the metacritic score.  It's freakin' awesome.  I'd say it's like Halo meets a Tower Defense game (with one one tower to defend, and I'm pretty sure it doesn't shoot), set in Jurassic Park after the dinosaurs broke out, but without all those pesky fences.In essence, X number of dinosaur waves come at your team (10-30-infinite I believe), and after each wave, your team has a chance to purchase weapons and upgrades.  There are also upgrades you can get for you whole account/player, but I've only gotten one so far, so I don't want to give any misinformation; I can't recall what I achieveved to get the upgrade.  That's how they work though, accomplish an ""acheivement"" and then in the future you'll always have that upgrade the ""acheivement"" granted you.I won't give too much away, but the vehicles are ALL awesome, and the whole game is loads of fun.  Not to mention, look in their ""recent updates"" area of thier Steam page: ""Buy ORION: Dino Horde, Get ANOTHER Game FREE!""  Read it.  Enough said.Buy this while on sale and you won't regret it.  If I knew it was this good, I would have probably already have bought it before Steam's ""Sales"" section got me again.It's the best game I've ever gotten on Steam for $0.99, and it's better than a lot of current FPS big name titles.Buy it.  Play it.  You won't regret it.  At least try the free 2 days!			"

>>_Summer-Rain_ has joined the game>>C0LDH4RT has joined the game>>R4V3Z3R0 has joined the game>>NOVA-FALL has joined the gameSo here you are again. Except this time,you're with your friends, Ravemeisterand his brother The Fatman, in a gamelooking very Halo-esque. Everyonespawns in a bunker with serviceablegraphics, before all of you run to yetanother bunker, buying your weapons.""Come on, let's go!"" Ravemeister yells,stepping out before suddenly gettingmauled by Velociraptors. ""RUN!"" Youscream, as Compsognathus and a huge,gigantic Stegosaurus lumbers towardthe base, spawning Compsognathus.ORION: PRELUDE.Panicking, The Fatman fires wildly atVelociraptors and Compsognathus,cutting a bloody swath in their ranks as Summer-Rain concentrates her fireon the Stegosaurus. You clamber abouton a vehicle and spin the mounted guntowards the large boss dinosaur, logicand biology be damned. The mountedcannon spins up and empties a volleyof lead into the Stegosaurus, sendingit to Reptile Heaven.The announcer yells that the wave isdefeated, and now a cooldown periodis in effect to stock up on weapons,ammo and upgrades. You attempt tobuy something with real world money,but the button in-game seems broken,and you shrug it off. Summer-Rain thenchecks up on you, her wizard hat thecolor of purple with yellow stars, boughtfrom a time before you were with her.""You ok? How's the game turning outfor you?"" Summer-Rain asks, checkingon her scoped rifle. ""It's cool I guess.""you begin, before Velociraptors saunterinto view from the horizon and a T-Rexlumbers towards all of you, spawning(you guessed it) Compsognathus again.""We got trouble! AIYAIYAIYAIYAIAYAI!""Ravemeister shrieks, wearing anastronaut's helmet on top of his spaceranger suit which looks like a sleekerversion of Master Chief's SPARTANarmor, while firing away with his rifle.You shake your head with a smile asSummer-Rain and The Fatman coveryou. The T-Rex goes down when TheFatman and Summer-Rain commandeera vehicle and use the mounted cannon,proving once more that anything thatis mounted and spits lead at a rate of600 rounds per minute is more thanenough to send any dinosaur toReptile Heaven.""That was good...!"" The Fatman sings,his armored, anti-bomb-like formshuddering as he exits the Warthog-lookalike. ""Yeah! This game isn't soboring now with you guys, and in a far better shape than it was in ascompared to when it was first released!"" Summer-Rain sighs, exitingthe mounted weapon from theWarthog-lookalike's rear. Ravemeisterfist-bumps you while buying ammoand a health upgrade when suddenly,the player prompt flashes across allyour displays.>>HOODED ANGST has joined the game>>KILLER'S CONSCIENCE has joined the game>>SHADOW OF DOUBT has joined the game>>MR. HOLLYWOOD has joined the game>>RA'S AL GOON has joined the game>>MRS. NOVOCAINE has joined the game""Oh boyyy..."" Ravemeister anticipates.""Oh damn..."" The Fatman shivers.""Oh no..."" you breathe.""Oh great."" Summer-Rain rolls her eyes.""STARBOY COLDHEART!"" All of themshout, seemingly in unison. Ravemeisterlocks and loads his weapon, while TheFatman hops into a randomly-spawnedVTOL. Summer-Rain leaps behind theWarthog-lookalike's mounted gatlinggun and gives you a curt nod whichmeans ""everything will be ok, baby.""You hold your rifle as much as you canattempt to be confident.""...you got married..."" you state in analmost deadpan manner, your chesttight at the sight of the former Ms.Novocaine, along with the person whom you thought was your goodfriend, the low-IQ Ra's Al Goon. Inbetween them is the devious villainMr. Hollywood, an inane director outfor the blood of innocents. ""Yes,Starboy! Your girlfriend is now mywife!"" Mr. Hollywood gloats, as yourprevious 'friend' Ra's Al Goon hunchesover and tries to fire at you like thedeformed arab that he is.Dodging, Summer-Rain fires the gatlingcannon into the air as a warning shot.""We're supposed to be on the sameside if none of us spawn as dinosaurs!""She says with annoyance, shootingdirty looks at Ms. Novocaine. As if sheknew what Summer-Rain was thinking,she fires at Summer-Rain's shoulder,making her shout in pain and fall fromthe warthog lookalike's platform.""SUMMER!"" you shout, rushing to herside. Ms. Novocaine squints her eyesevilly as the countdown timer endsand dinosaurs return, spawning.""It's 'Mrs.' Novocaine now, dear."" Mrs.Novocaine sneers, before the dinosaursapproach and the battle becomes anintense free-for-all.  ""...and Starboy?""You glare at Mrs. Novocaine amid thechaos and draw your rifle on yourex-girlfriend, her head dead center inyour sights. ""You were never goodenough."" Mrs. Novocaine sneers again.""DAMN YOU!"" You fire, but a runningVelociraptor gets hit between you andMrs. Novocaine before the dust kicksup and dinosaurs and blaster fire rainabout everywhere around the both ofyou. ""Summer?! Hang on, ok?!"" Youmotion for her again, and she claspsat your arm desperately. You see thatMrs. Novocaine's shot cut clean throughSummer-Rain's shoulder and neck, tearsin her eyes as she bleeds profusely.""H-help... help, Starboy-"" She collapses,and you quickly dispatch a Velociraptorclosing in on the both of you, with theSpinosaurus of this wave charging toyour location. ""RAVE! SUMMER'S HURT!""You bundle Summer-Rain close to youand run to the game's exit. ""I'll coveryou, Coldheart! The Fatman, get overhere bro! Starboy must get back to hisroom with Summer if it's the last thingwe do!""As you enter your home from the heavyrain pouring outside, Summer-Rain in your arms, you lay her on the couch inthe living room and stay by her side.You've applied a makeshift tourniquetwith your hoodie as the immersion fromthe game you've been playing togetherwith everyone vanishes, and her woundis somewhat stable. The blood soaks tothe couch and the floor, but all you canthink of doing is whispering sweet wordsand telling her that you are here, that you attended to her wound as much asyou can, and honored her wishes forno call to the hospital.""Let... let me die. Please Starboy. Letm-me die."" Summer-Rain whispers toyou through ragged breaths. ""No!"" Youexclaim. ""Never! Summer, I love you!""You hold her hand gingerly, and shereturns your grasp tightly. ""I know.That's... that's the problem, isn't it.""Summer-Rain mutters, her breathingheavy. ""What do you mean? If it'sabout killing the dinosaurs in Prelude,you did a great job with all of us-""""No Starboy."" Summer-Rain heavesa heavy sigh. ""She's right you know.""Your eyes go wide as Summer-Raintalks to you. ""I'm not good enough,not for myself and certainly notfor you."" She looks at you throughtired eyes. ""I love you so much,Starboy Coldheart."" she whispers.""Don't ever think that you weren'tgood enough for me, because that'swhat I was all this time for you. I loveyou Starboy Coldheart. Don't youever forget that."" Summer-Rain closesher eyes. ""Summer?"" you whisper.""SUMMER!"" You shout. Summer-Rainscrunches her face in annoyance.""Starboy, I wanna rest."" she responds.ORION: PRELUDE. "

												It's hard being a support class. Everytime there's a support class, you are expected to heal/support team mates while saving your own skin. If your team mate dies ""IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT"" , if you die ""IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT"", if your whole team dies ""WHERE THE HELL IS THE SUPPORT?"". RIP support class for being too supportive :(			"

												I realize this game has gotten a bad reputation from it's alpha stages, and people don't like how they changed the name to avoid ridicule.  But WOW!  It's improved a TON!  I don't see why anyone could complain about such a well done FPS Dinosaur game- Freaking Dinosaurs man!!!!  I love the game mechanics, and the multiplayer is surprisingly solid.  By far the best game I've played seen on steam.  So many weapons, vehicles, upgrades, perks and maps make this game a HUGE online experience that everyone should have the opportunity to play.  Almost flawless, and still coming out with updates, I think Spiral developers are some of the greatest developers out there!  Keep doing what you're doing guys!			"

												Well, i really didn't have high expectations when i first bought this game for 0,99€, which i consider pretty much ""free"". But this game turned out to be great, and not just great - I prefer it over 60€ games such as GTA V, which means something. This game is NO.1 on the ""Fun for the money"" List in my opinion. I don't know any other game where you can use your jetpack to power-punch a flying dinosaur, or blow up floating heads  with a grenade launcher (Gamemode called ""Silly mode"".  Well the graphics are...  are... Well, not so good, but that makes the game easier to run on low-end systems. For anyone out there with a low-end pc (laptop?) who does not want to spend much money on expensive 60€ games they cant run, this is the perfect game for you to buy. Its extra fun when playing co-op with your friends, even tho the game maybe doesn't feel ""complete"".So, fun for the money rating:7/10 -IGNKILL DEM DINOS!			"

												Orion: Prelude is really not a bad game like the price would suggest. It deserves a lot more players in my opinion. Parts of it remind me of the original Halo. The graphics are of course better than the original Halo, but still slightly on the outdated side if you compare it to something like Battlefield 4. ALTHOUGH, atmospheric conditions in the maps are some of the best I've seen. Fog rolling in, sunlight and rain, frost on your visor, day fading to night and then to moonlight; it all looks really beautiful in this game. There is a bit of a cartoonish appearance to the maps but I kind of like that. There's a good amount of weapons to pick from. I suggest playing the Gun Game mode first to figure out the controls and weapons if this is your first time. Start your own Gun Game server if there aren't any, preferably with a friend, and people will usually join. There is a leveling system but nothing that would really affect gameplay unless you were playing in a Deathmatch mode against some really high level/experienced players. Co-op against dinos is a blast. Co-op against Santa is a blast. This can be a really fun game.			"

												The Metascore given by critics to this game is very misleading as this game deserves somewhere between 80-90 score.

Slight bugs on the dinosaurs but its a great game to have.			"

												Review of Orion : Prelude!This game may seem dull at the first hour, but when you play enough of it, you can't stop.The graphics might not be very good, but it makes up for its gameplay, it has several vehicules, giant maps, Adjustable NPC difficulty, 10+ game modes ( only 2 are Singleplayer sadly ).Orion is basically Humans V.S Dinos, Don't see that much often eh? Anyways, Humans have 3 Classes, Each class with it's upgrades and special Skills! 7 or 8 Vehicules! 12+ Guns and taunts! = Fair Graphics + Good singleplayer- Microtransactions ( i really hate that! where's the time where skins would be unlocked by a special challenge/ mission?)+ Different gameplays+ Several modes+ Workshop+ Several maps = Taunts ( depends on your view of Taunts i personally hate them )+ Good XP system+ Cheap price ( well in my time at least! I heard it's going to be $20 in the next few months )So get it on sale or not, it is worth the money!			"

While it's not a AAA title game it is also not available for $50- anything below $15-20 for this game is something you cannot say no to. Whether you just wanna mow down a ton or Dinos with your friends or wanna mow down a ton of friends as a dino- this is the game for you.			"

												I don't know what's so satisfying about an FPS with temporary and permanent upgrades that's all about killing dinosaurs but I love it. The music is repetative as hell but catchy, it'll be the only thing you might not like and will probably turn off or at least lower it, it's pretty much most the sound. If you haven't seen this game, it has a Kickstater called the Orion project and they plan on making this game an entire precedural universe with story and such. I can't wait for that, I bought this on a Steam sale way before I heard about that and I'm glad I did. I can only run this beasty in 720p or my 440GT takes a duece but that just shows that it wants to have more graphical power. The game runs gorgeously with dynamic lighting and has amazing textures. I wish I had a better videocard.			"

Pure madness they are selling it this cheap.Also, these devs deserve way more attention and praise. They kept working on their game, kept releasing free patches and updates for years. In a world where abandoned Early Access games and bug-ridden triple A titles are daily routine, these devs are showing exceptional dedication both towards their game and their customers.			"

There is a leveling system but nothing that would really affect gameplay unless you were playing in a Deathmatch mode against some really high level/experienced players. Co-op against dinos is a blast. Co-op against Santa is a blast. This can be a really fun game.			"

												This game, like others have said, is a mixture of Halo and Left 4 Dead in gameplay, with maybe something else thrown in. My computer runs Left 4 Dead 2, Portal 2, and Team Fortress 2 just fine, but for some reason, struggles with this game. I had to lower the graphics settings in-game to their lowest just to even get close to a decent performance. And even then, I didn't find the game that fun. I can see its potential, though. It's just not working for me personally. So my recommendation only comes half-heartedly, but only because I don't think it would be fair to say I don't recommend the game.			"

												If you're like me, you know the meta-score is the first impression of any game. If it's between 70-80 and above, it's worthe considering right?Let me tell you this, ORION: Dino Horde is a good game. Maybe not so much the $15...probably catch it on a sale (sorry devs, but it's a consumer opinion) ORION is pretty damn fun. Really great shoot 'em up, an original concept, and although it has a bug once every 50 play throughs, it's stable. You know how you're on skype with friends and you're all trying to figure out a game to play because you're all bored? You scroll down your games list looking for games you guys both have and wanna play. Well lemme tell you this, ORION: Dino Horde is always a game that we agree to.Check it our, join in, be a part of the community, and shoot some dinos!			"

												This game has come a long way since it was initially released upon the public and made quite an impact for being a terrible game. At the time of it's release this game was clearly a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and unfinished game with uncountable amounts of bugs, only 2 or 3 maps and about 3 types of dinosaurs. This is all the past now, and though this may not be a perfect game it is a fun arcade style shooter to play with your friends.The game now sports about a dozen different game modes and maps, a nice selection of weapons and powerups, a working progression system with 3 class types, over 200 Steam achievements and most bugs have been fixed. If you have a couple of friends with you and you just want to mess around and have a fun time on a game with a silly premise and don't mind mediocre graphics and audio then this is absolutely for you, if on the otherhand you like to play a serious survival game then this might not be for you.This game as I mentioned is no where near perfect, the graphics are pretty mediocre as are the visual effects. The audio quality is quite good especially with the Dinosaur sound effects like the T-Rex's roar (you might want ear defenders for that), the voice acting however isn't the best but that's to be somewhat expected of this type of game. The game runs very smoothly for the most part with a couple of graphical artifacts here and there but nothing I've found gamebreaking yet, and there are lag spikes when waves end on survival.Taking a little step away from the technical problems of this game and looking into the gameplay though is where this game is great, it's perfectly fun to play for an hour or two every now and then prefferably with friends and just have a blast shooting dinosaurs with handcannons, shotguns, gatling guns, sniper rifles, lasers, flamethrowers, rocket launchers and so much more. It's great fun to try taking some risk with your friends and making bets like who can ride the T-rex without getting eaten or who can kill the spinosaurus with a knife and whatever else you can think of doing at the time. Theres plenty of objectives to keep you occupied in game and well paced time intervals between rounds and the large dinosaurs each have their own unique traits.Overall I'd give this game a solid 7/10 for being a great improvement on it's initial release and a stupid but fun arcade style shooter. I mean it's got jetpacks, dinosaurs and tanks! What more could you possibly ask for?			"

												If you hate dinosaurs, then this is your golden opportunity.Jokes aside, it's no doubt worth the money. It provides exciting and sometimes terrifying (spinosaurus, deinosuchus, t-rex) combat against various kinds of dinosaurs. You get to use many types of weapons and other tools of destruction such as VTOLs and tanks. Pros:- Surprising amounts of depth and customization via classes, their weapons and augments that let you play the way you want- Unreal engine means it runs smoothly and provides great visuals- Voice commands and taunts to help you communicate and annoy easily- Gigantic (and smaller) dinosaurs with very impressive animations and diverse approaches to combat- A leveling system to give you a feel of progression and achievement- An open-world game mode which I've not yet tried but sounds very interesting- The developers seem committed and appear to release updates frequently- Many large and beautiful maps to fight onCons:- It still needs some work, certain things such as player characters (and the mech) have lackluster animations- While it doesn't really hold any merit in deciding if a game is good or not, its ""Metascore"" is low (*)- I'm unsure of this, but it doesn't seem like you're able to earn any in-game cosmetics* = It depends on the person whether or not they think Metacritic provides an accurate review of the product. Dino Beatdown (the game's former name) didn't go too well and this most likely means that certain people will be discouraged from buying ORION: Dino Horde. There are rumors swirling around Metacritic, saying that the reviewers are paid off by larger corporations to make their product seem better. Besides, reviews are essentially opinions.			"

Sure, it's only a dollar, but I guess the guy behind it pulled some shady dealings, so I couldn't decide if I was okay with that.After much though, I came to the conclusion that a buck was worth giving the game a try, and I'm glad I did. While there are still a few bugs in the game, it's fun and refreshing. I didn't realize just how much we really needed a dinosaur game!]If you can overcome the moral arguement of the game dev, and overlook the outdated metascore, this game has a lot of potential.			"

The gameplay (survival) can become boring since you're playing it over and over again but if you're playing it with your friends it can be extremely fun. With all the current features that it has e.g. gamemodes, weapons, vehicles etc. that will definitely expand in the future I recommend it.			"

												A cooperative, wave survival, class based FPS that forgoes pomp and circumstance for a more pick-up-and-play kind of experience. Similar to games like Killing floor, but with dinos instead of zambos. You fight little dinos, get better weapons, upgrades and perks, collect xp to strengthen 1 of 3 classes, fight big dinos, get killed, rage quit, drink heavily, rinse and repeat. The game is a little clunky at times, but it's solid fun with frands for just a buck.			"

The game runs very smoothly for the most part with a couple of graphical artifacts here and there but nothing I've found gamebreaking yet, and there are lag spikes when waves end on survival.Taking a little step away from the technical problems of this game and looking into the gameplay though is where this game is great, it's perfectly fun to play for an hour or two every now and then prefferably with friends and just have a blast shooting dinosaurs with handcannons, shotguns, gatling guns, sniper rifles, lasers, flamethrowers, rocket launchers and so much more. It's great fun to try taking some risk with your friends and making bets like who can ride the T-rex without getting eaten or who can kill the spinosaurus with a knife and whatever else you can think of doing at the time. Theres plenty of objectives to keep you occupied in game and well paced time intervals between rounds and the large dinosaurs each have their own unique traits.Overall I'd give this game a solid 7/10 for being a great improvement on it's initial release and a stupid but fun arcade style shooter. I mean it's got jetpacks, dinosaurs and tanks! What more could you possibly ask for?			"

												Well, i really didn't have high expectations when i first bought this game for 0,99€, which i consider pretty much ""free"". But this game turned out to be great, and not just great - I prefer it over 60€ games such as GTA V, which means something. This game is NO.1 on the ""Fun for the money"" List in my opinion. I don't know any other game where you can use your jetpack to power-punch a flying dinosaur, or blow up floating heads  with a grenade launcher (Gamemode called ""Silly mode"".  Well the graphics are...  are... Well, not so good, but that makes the game easier to run on low-end systems. For anyone out there with a low-end pc (laptop?) who does not want to spend much money on expensive 60€ games they cant run, this is the perfect game for you to buy. Its extra fun when playing co-op with your friends, even tho the game maybe doesn't feel ""complete"".So, fun for the money rating:7/10 -IGNKILL DEM DINOS!			"

The fast-paced hordes of velociraptors, pterodactyls, and eventual T-rex is absolutely amazing with 4 of your friends, if not complete strangers. Not to mention the insane abailities and vehicles, like jetpacks and health stealing, or tanks and mech suits. Buy this game for a buck, and kill dinos without giving a ****.			"

												Killing dinosaurs in a futuristic environment sounds fun... and it is. Especially if you play it with some friends. Grab your guns, upgrade yourself with some augments and kick some a$$. Leveling up gives you some bonuses.You can choose between three different classes (Assault, Support, Recon) which only vary slightly. What makes every player different is how they customize their augments. This is by no means a bad thing. You are not stuck to a special weapon set depending on your class. You want to be a jetpacking shotgun maniac or a sniping medic? No problem. It's all up to you.I have to admit the weapon balance isn't that great. There is no effective automatic gun. To do good damage you have to pick either a shotgun or sniper rifle.The maps are huge and it can take a few minutes to arrive on the other side without a vehicle. That's great but therefore they havent many maps available. For each map there is a day and a night variation but this makes nearly no difference to the actual gameplay. Map objectives seem to appear on random locations every time so it's at least not exactly the same experience every time.Vehicles variety is awesome. There aren't many different vehicles available but they are all different from each other. Steering a minigun welding mech or fly around in a harrier... It's fun. Navigating left or right by using the mouse is something you have to get used to. Other controls are easy to go.So the overall gameplay is pretty solid but at some points it's a little bit glitchy when it comes to player positioning. In some cases you can get stuck in walls and the hitboxes of the tiny dinosaurs are a little bit weird.What drives me mad somehow is the ""Spiral Store"" where you can buy Hats and colors for real money. This would be perfectly O.K. for me in a free to play game but not in a full priced game. It doesn't affect gameplay but getting them as rewards for achievements would be way more appreciated. It can get boring after a while since it's the same again and again. It offers some different gamemodes but in the end it is PvP or survival... Since player positioning sucks it's only surivival for me. This is why I would recommend to get this game only if you have some friends to play this game together in Co-Op since this makes it a lot more enjoyable.This is my opinion about the game and may differ from yours...TL;DRPersonal rating:6 Fair | out of 10The good:+ Alot of different perks/augments+ Vehicles+ Huge maps+ Plenty of gamemodes+ Simple controlsThe bad:- Weapon balance- Glitchy hitboxes- Low amount of maps- Fancy hats from the trailer only for real money- Gets boring if you play it alone			"

												Hi. I'm going to review my thoughts on this game.Overall thoughts:This game is epic overall. It really sells the picture of a game you can enjoy. It's like buying a can of coffee, only this game keeps you awake for much longer. I wouldn't say this is like the greatest game ever, God knows this game is far from perfect. But this is the kind of game that makes you want to get ready to whatever you have to do later, like studying for a test, for example.Review:[ Note: Not just my opinion. Also using a critical standpoint right now. ]Pros:1: It's free to play.2: It keeps you awake, more than just coffee.3: It takes you to a place you've never been before.4: It has some really good customizable♥♥♥♥♥♥in the main menu.Cons:1: The game is full of glitches.2: No one really plays it anymore.Ratings and final review: I would say this game is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good. I reccomend it to ANYONE. It is far from perfect, but that doesn't make it a bad game. Nothing is perfect. And that's part of the fun, right?My personal rating: 8.2/10.			"

												If you're looking for a triple AAA platnum seller, then go look somewhere else, but if you're looking for a shooter that runs decently where you kill dinosaurs just for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles, then you've come to the right store page! First of all, the game has a really cheap price tag attached to it, but that doesn't mean it's not a good game. Again, it's no game of the year award winner, but you really get a lot out of this for the price you pay, especially if you're buying it for only $1. If nothing else, it makes for a great game to play on rainy days when you lose your internet connection. Just fire up the game, turn on bots, and have more fun than you might expect. I played this once a long time ago and wasn't that impressed, but recently I played it again and was surprised to see that the devs have been updating the game, which is really saying a lot when you think about how little most devs care once they get your money. So come on! Buy the game, install it, and have yourself some fun. It's $0.99 and I can pretty much guaranty that you'll get your money's worth out of it.			"

												I was hesitant to get this, because of its metascore, but it's actually worth it. This game is a great FPS that reminds me of Turok: Dinosaur Hunter (anyone else?), but I can guarantee you that this game is original and only reminds me of it. In this game, you kill dinosaurs with guns, something I've always wanted to do as a child.In spite of a few bugs here and there, this game is pretty good (very good if you got it for its sale price). With just a bit more development, this game has the potential to get its metascore where it schould be.I rate ORION: Dino Horde a 7.75 out of 10.			"

												You may expect a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game (as I did), but you are wrong - this is one of the best co-op shooters for a unreasonably low price. Futuristic soilders fighting dinosaurs is a weird combo, but it turns out great. Well-balanced classes, weapons and enemies is the most important part of a shooter, and this game has it. It's a little bit confusing at the beggining, but when you get used to it it's a easy to play.The only thing I dislike is the heavy GPU usage. It maxes out my 760 and only gives about 70fps, which is about the same as I get in BF4. The graphics are not something amazing, but good enough to not ruin the experience.Overall, this is an amazing game, well worth the 80 cents it costs. The developers are great people, pricing this game at such a low price, while it is surely worth at least 5x more and I respect that very much. Will be buying more copies for friends!			"

												This game, oh my my... Beyond the initial metacritic score for the earlier version of this game; it is worth giving a chance. I picked it up on sale; after seeing the game on sale for 99 cents; I was like: The hell with it, I am buying this. No I am not rich and no it is not disposable income; you can be unemployed and living on welfare checks and still understand the whole idea of impulse buying a 99 cent game.. It's like going to a restaurant and ordering a cup of soda, which adds 1 extra dollar to your bill.. So the game itself is actually pretty fun. Don't play this game for ""intense lore"". it is simply such a derp game in terms of atmosphere (storyline and background); simply because it is minimalistic. How about instead of writing a 7 paragraph review like I always do, I will give you this:Imagine being in the US Marine Corps, and you are in a Supercobra attack slick; and you are swooping over the marshlands in georgia bored to♥♥♥♥♥♥because you are bringing the chopper to a new base. Lets say you spot several crocodiles in the marshes; and you decide ""F**K it"", and start shooting them to millions of pieces.Now take this image and turn it into sci-fi, where space-dinosaurs are on some random planet; and you bloodthristy bored-as hell soldiers stationed on some remote planet want to have some action.. Well pick up em guns boys! We have freaking space raptors to murder!In a nutshell, the game is simply amusing. It is funny, and I think the developers have strong wit they intentionally put into this game. It is fun, jetpacking around the maps with guns and slaughtering dinosaurs with friends has never been so fun of a pastime before!Now.. Someone bring me a pizza!			"

I'm not 100% sure it would be worth 15 dollars though. If this game goes on sale for like 8 dollars, go ahead and snag it. I don't think it's great enough that you would want to buy it at the normal 15 dollar price.It's still a really cool game, especially with friends.Edit: Now that it's 99 cents, you really can't go wrong with this especially if you're new to steam and don't have many games.

												Pretty cool game. My friend bought the 4-pack when it was on sale for super cheap and gifted me a copy.It's a fun FPS game and it was definitely worth the 75 cents. I'm not 100% sure it would be worth 15 dollars though. If this game goes on sale for like 8 dollars, go ahead and snag it. I don't think it's great enough that you would want to buy it at the normal 15 dollar price.It's still a really cool game, especially with friends.Edit: Now that it's 99 cents, you really can't go wrong with this especially if you're new to steam and don't have many games.

												After wading into this game with unceremoniously low expectations and a halfish-hour of actual game time solo (the rest was toying with tweaks to get some enhancements working), I can at least say my expectations were met and there is a decent game underneath this. Disregarding the, um, troubled history that I found out after.Sure, there's no tutorial, motion blur is apparently not working, the trailer is an amateur looking montage of gameplay with quotes from who knows where, the animation is abyssmally 1999 (a F- I'd say), the visuals are some sort of bland thing reminding me of Serious Sam 2 and Halo: Combat Evolved and the gameplay is a mix of older Unreal, current class based affairs and Halo gunplay and vehicular antics, but with DINOSAAAAURS. Still there's at least a fundamentally good game at the core.The HUD needs some better iconography (I had to guess at what the heck the two bars were), the animation completely ruins the look for me and the sound effects are absolutely terrible. Gameplay-wise the general mode seems to be Survival (I just tried that solo) where you have to protect or otherwise secure objectives from marauding waves of dinosaurs, with opportunities to buy character perks or equipment as you go. There are also some PvP modes and an apparent laundry list of features in this here store page, but they aren't elaborated much in game.It's kind of like Killing Floor in a Turok setting, but with terrible production values. If you're looking for the next bit of fun to spend 99 cents on, I'd certainly say okay.Sure, it's artistically strongly inspired, but uncreative ideas don't necessarily mean bad ones.			"

												I bought it at $0.62. Why haven't you?Didn't expect much from a $0.62 game initially but after playing i loved the horde based gameplay.Wave after wave will try to attack your generator which you have to defend or repair with occasional objectives you have to accomplish. The map has vehicles scattered all around and each map is different and the effect that comes with it makes it more appealing.""Peak"" is a winter map and your visor can get frozen while playing and this forces you to search for a warm place to melt the ice off. The light reflecting off the snow also makes it harder to spot smaller dinos.""Raupi"" is a tropical map where rain starts to pour in mid game. Really gotta love the rain droplet effect on your visor and the weather makes it hard to spot the pterodactyls flying overhead.During each round you'll get to access upgrades and different weapons while they throw at you different types of dinos that range from velociraptors to T-Rexs.However, if you're playing in Asia, you might find the servers lacking in number. You can still host listen servers or play singleplayer with bots.I'd say i got my money's worth from this game at that flash sale price ^_^			"

												This game can be fun at times. Playing survival whilst flying in helicopters and blowing the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of dinosaurs is pretty fun, but this doesn't make up for the downsides.The graphics in this game is meh, just meh. The lens flares can literally be blinding on some maps and the textures for the dinosaurs make them look like Jurassic Park CGI (the first one). For some reason, this game is EXTREMELY laggy. Even with my GTX 650 and 8 GB of ram, this game can only run around 30 frames per second. Not only this, but it looks made for the Wii. The gameplay mechanics are much like Left for Dead 2, except worse. You survive wave after wave of dinosaurs trying to destroy your generator (sidebar, why the heck do they go for the generator?). Then you need to go ""hold points,"" after which you are awarded with different vehicles (ranged from jeeps with miniguns, jeeps with no point, a tank, a mech, and yes, helicopters). These vehicles have the absolute WORST driving mechanics...you control your vehicles...with your mouse. It's SOO HARD! You're constantly crashing into things which damges your vehicles quite a lot. You also are able to purchase weapons, upgrades for your weapons, and upgrade your character, which overall is not that bad of a system. Other than lacking a good variety of weapons. So there is one last problem with this game...the dinosaur AI. Literally the flying dinosaurs (my friends and I call them poops) are the most irritating mob in this game. They randomly divebomb you and have a possiblity of picking you up and dropping you from great hights. They for some reason put dinosaurs that we all reconize (ect triceratops) as bosses that try to kill you. But wait, aren't triceratops herbivores? APPARENTLY NOT!Overall this is a good game if you get it on sale. It's hilarous to play with your friends and get a good laugh at for it's attempt at being good. DO NOT BUY IT FOR FULL PRICE, NOT WORTH IT.If you want to watch gameplay to look for yourself, watch here:

If you're looking for the next bit of fun to spend 99 cents on, I'd certainly say okay.Sure, it's artistically strongly inspired, but uncreative ideas don't necessarily mean bad ones.			"

												Apparently the meta critic score is for the original of this game entitled Orion: Dino Beatdown. I'm going to presume that's true because there is no way this game is only a 36 out of 100! It's fun as hell, nice graphics, loads of weapons, different classes and perks, cool vehicles, AND FREAKING DINOSAURS WHO DOESN'T LOVE KILLING DINOSAURS WITH LASER RIFLES WHILST FLYING IN A JETPACK?!

												Graphics are great, but the gameplay is just tedious and boring. It is like Gears of War Horde mode but more crap thrown in. Weapon cost is extremely high, and the ""defend points"" are never near any actual defensible position. If you have 4 or more people playing it can be good, but it still seems very lackluster. In my opinion not worth $1.			"

												Hey it’s pretty fun!The game is actually pretty fun. By now it’s really damn straight worth one dollar. I like the sun lighting in the game as well as the ability to upgrade your character and use weapons like sentry guns and rocket launchers to mow down waves of enemies. The game does have some downsides as it's still kinda buggy.Now the “conquest” game mode is something to have a lot of fun about. Try beating that before you leave the game. The game gets even more fun when you level up your character and start spawning with weapons that you would normally have to buy. I also like the fact that you can customize your armor style and give yourself a hat and a cape so that you can look like a badass when fighting dinos. It gets pretty fun in high level games.The only downside to this game is that it's still kinda buggy. They aren't too much of a bother to me.			"

												Originaly this game was called ""ORION: Dino Beatdown"" and it was very rough around the edges. Meta gave it the lowest scores i've ever seen and it got bashed by critics all over the place. However, bought out by Spiral Games sometime in 2012-2013 the game evolved greatly! Dino Horde is an Open World, Class-Based Cooperative Survival Sci-Fi FPS. The game puts five players together in huge, endless environments in which they must work together to accomplish objectives and survive the devastating Dinosaur horde. Thisnew version sports fun classes and upgrades to choose from while you defend your base from all sorts of creatures. Its a blast playing with friends as it is 5 player COOP.			"

The game does get a bit buggy and really it still seems like its in beta version but overall the dinosaur-reking adventure is tops.

It's really cool if you like dinosaurs or shooters. There are many gamemodes, much classes with their unique abilities and you can customize your character.			"

												This is quite possibly the best cheap thrill you can pick up on Steam.It's everything and more than I could have ever wanted in a game this inexpensive: dinosaurs, guns, more dinosaurs, flying around shooting dinosaurs, destroying Robot Santa with a rocket launcher, music that you could swear carries a bit of the Mr. Clean jingle in it, and much, much more. The best things in life are apparently just about nearly free; snag this if you're looking to blow things up with friends and marvel at the masterpiece that is ORION: Prelude.			"

												I know this has a horrible Metacritic score and lots of bad reviews here on Steam. But for the price (which is currently $0.99), it is worth it. At a dollar BUY THIS GAME. It's sort of like Killing Floor with better graphics but not as good of a trader system. The maps are large and vast. The dinosuars, especially the freaking flying ones do give a challenge. If you like Co-op games and can get the 4-pack for $3 and have friends who will play with you, it's fun. You'll enjoy it when you kill that large croc with a barrage of missles and gunfire from the flying croc killer (sorry don't know what that flying thing is called but it's fun). There is a community of players and that should tell you that the game is at least worth $1 or checking out.			"

												36/100.The score you see upon entering this page, and trust me, this is NOT for this state of the game, from what I can understand,this game got that score when it was released in an early version that had many problems with graphics, gameplay, etc,from which it gained poor reviews,and caused people to hate the game, leaving it with that score.I choose to ignore that score, and buy it in the sale.Thank god I did.I can say from my experience, this is, THE BEST, multiplayer dino game to play with friends, other games such as Primal Carnage and Dino D-Day are fun, but I haven't had quite as many laughs and fun from those games than this one. Me and my friend agree that this has the most variety of any dinosaur game out there, (which I will list in the good and bad points of this game). Now, by no means is this a ""10/10 OMG BEST GAME EVARS"" game, this game certainly has it's faults, for me it's the store, which involves *gasp* micro-transactions to buy hats and taunts[where does that sound familiar?], but again, buying in-game items is not necessary to win in game,*cough*EA*cough*.Good Points: Well optimized -At least for me. This game runs at a great FPS on my PC, and my computer isn't the best in the world by any means, ;-;Variety - Oh god, where do I start? Ride vehicles,Be a dinosaur,Be a human,choose from a large choice of weapons, so many gamemodes to choose from, (adding more apparently)CO-OP/Online Multiplayer - The spiral community seems to be one of the nicer end of the web game communities, playing online with friends/random peeps is always fun, there is always so much going on.Sound- The dialogue in this game (while little), is just a JOY to listen to, the 3 human classes all have something funny to say at the best of times,the music can sometimes be good, and the announcer, oh , the announcer, I won't dare spoil what he says when you get a 10+ kill streak, but it had me laughing for at least 30 seconds.Updates- I have never see any other developer update the game in so many good ways in such a short period of time, whether it being open worlds, new weapons, more detail in-game. As soon as I see this game update, I play it, just to seewhat they've added, and usually stay in for ages as I get hooked into it.Bad Points: Single Player- Sadly, this is what kinda lets it down for me, it is advertised as a ""Single-player"" game, and for me, it really isn't all that special, as it's basically the same mode as in co-op, just, on your own, *Insert forever alone face here*, also, here are many modes you CANNOT play alone.Sound(again)- However, some of the sound kinda lets it down, the dino sounds are quite poor, and often lacking from some, the music is OK but some sounds really need to be fixed, (If you're wearing headphones, like I was, be readyfor a T-Rex roar, it will break your headphones)Well, this is my first in-depth review, and for a good reason; this game doesn't deserve that 36/100 stamped on this page, if your interested in dinosaurs, good online play, or just a variety of things to do in a game, here's my advice to you;1. Wait for this game to go for a F2P weekend/watch some UPDATED gameplay videos.2. Buy it in a sale (Last time it was 99p!)Final words; I paid 99p in a sale for this, I would gladly pay the £11.99 for it, if the updates continued as good as this, and just for the sheer joy factor :)Thanks for reading!

												Alot of fun for an odler game. Fun with friends and the ever so not safe for work chat and in game voip. Its a great 11 round shooter that has a similar set up and play style to borderlands but its a survival game with vehicles youd see in Halo or mechwarrior. If you ever played Sanctum/orcs must die etc youll like the game. It reminds me of alot different game mechanics from other games. Online is solid, lots of bots to help you :3 My only issue that is the interface to buying weapon and augments are not the same and some what complicated/confusing, augments you double click and weapons you have to click the green purchase.

ORION: Prelude ORION: Dino Beatdown ORION: Dino Horde ORION: Dino DLC is a shining light in an otherwise dark and gloomy sea of poorly thought out RPGs, Shooters, and MMOs. This game is completely flawless in every way, a perfect example of a 10/10 rating, a number given too often to sub-par titles such as Mass Effect and Call Of Duty. ORION: Dino Beatdown is an instant classic, and surely stands up to the best as an action adventure indie casual racing game. For only $8.99 $14.99 (Plus the price of any of the fabulous DLC you can purchase! I recommend the Gangnam Style dance pack myself!), you can't afford not to add this amazing title to your collection. Don't forget to donate to the Kickstarter for the upcoming ORION Project too!

												Honestly the concept of being able to play in various game modes along side your friends in this Jurassic slaughter house is a great idea. Personaly tho I found the controlls for the Dino's hard to manage and clunky. If you can get around some of the frusterating controll draw backs you could probably get a couple hours of fun out of it if you play with a buddy. ORION: Dino Horde shall remain a game full of quaint notions and maverick game modes.			"

												 I would recommend this game, for sure. But it has it's up and downs, and I'll go through both.Positives: -There's nothing that compares to battling a T-Rex one-on-one with only a pistol and a medigun that can recharge yourself.-Team-play is quite fun, too. The gameplay is simple enough that you can slaughter dinos without doing much thinking, which is exactly what it says on the tin.-It is pretty stable, I didn't see any gamebreaking bugs and it works just as it's supposed to.-The Killing Floor styled gameplay works really well with dinosaurs.-The vehicles are varied and quite fun. -The Adrenaline weapons are a nice touch.-Do I really have to explain how fun it is to fight hordes of raptors while using a Jetpack? Steam, you should know this.-None of the weapons felt 'Useless' in the sense that I could do decent damage with almost anything.Negatives:-The Support Class has VERY racist dialogue, I don't appreciate the fact that he calls his teammates ""Homies"" and ""Dawg"" just because he's of African decent. It's not even well-done voice acting so the point of including it at all is mediocre at best and it kind of detracts from the experience. Why couldn't they have race-neutral dialogue? I am kind of disappointed as it lessens the experience of an otherwise solid game.-The price is way too high, however I bought it while it was on sale for only one dollar so I can't complain of this personally. If whoever is reading this doesn't own the game already, pick it up while it's on sale.-There aren't many maps to choose from. It's not that big of an issue, but I could do with a change of scenery. To address this issue, allowing custom maps would be preferable.-The game is very unbalanced, Supports are almost invincible if they have the Iron Pecs perk and the upgrades that make it so you can't die from heights or chomping. On the other hand Recon is nearly useless in all situations. However, this doesn't bug me very much considering I bought this game to casually slaughter lizards, not to engage the finer philosophical and strategic aspects of warfare in a futuristic society. The unbalance is entirely made up for by the fact there's a minigun.Overview:For a Unreal Mod, it has a high production quality, and it definitely deserves a higher metascore than it has in my honest opinion. It deserves at least a 65. If you wish to buy this game, do so while it's on sale, and have fun with it. It's not meant to be a realistic fighting simulator like Counter-Strike, so I don't see why people would complain of the unrealistic setting of a game where you're a space marine fighting dinosaurs on some alien planet. It lost it's realness at ""Dino Horde"", and that's okay. Games are just meant to be played, and I enjoyed every minute of playing this one.			"

												This game is more of a ""so bad it's good"" kinda deal. For literally 99 cents, you really shouldn't be expecting something along the lines of an actual good game. But for some reason, despite me not playing it much (only 4 hours clocked at the time of writing this), I've had some actual fun with it. There's some bugs and graphical problems. Not to mention that on the topic of graphics, the graphics are just mediocre. The variety of weapons is pretty standard along with the option to pick up insane Adrenaline weapons. Essentially this game can be described as something similar to Killing Floor on a budget. The concept of surviving incoming waves of enemies is standard, but ORION takes some liberties in the form of objectives that need securing, the occasional mini boss dinosaur in the form of a triceretops/stegosaurs/T-Rex. There's also the option to select perks while in game to boost your chances of survival.In all honesty the gameplay is pretty much the same as a lot of FPS's. You get a selection of three classes which all serve basic, generic roles. Assault are front line gunners and carry larger weapons. The medic is just that, a battle medic with the ability to heal teammates. Finally there's the Recon, the obligatory stealth class. The only slightly unique thing about the classes is that the Assault gets a jetpack that only serves limited use.All in all if you're looking for a cheap game that you can fart around with your friends in, this is a good game to pick up. Just don't expect anything grand and don't expect to play this game much except for the off night you and your pals are bored out of your skulls.			"

												I love this game for what it is meant to be. Gotta get that out there first. If you are looking for a mature, story driven game with deep tactical combat, intelligent AI, and characters of any sort, you will be sorely dissapointed. This game is stupid fun, comically bad AI, silly unrealistic physics, oversimplified PVP, and less in depth than several of the games you might be used to.  It tries to do many things at once (it has PVP, PVE, open world, not open world, leveling systems, vehicle combat, augments like jetpacks and invisibility), and only does them all about half as well as it could. That said... The game is fully aware of what kind of game it is, and the developers know exactly what you wanted out of this kind of game, and boy do they deliver. The pvp is mostly laughable, but when you have been playing co-op with a group of friends it is perfect to switch to and just start murdering each other for a change. The game will make you laugh as you discover its secrets (you can surf dinosaurs and helicopters, and there are achievements for that too). The game is best when played with friends, but you do not have to bring any. I got the game alone and played random games without friends, but easily found a regular group of people to play with. People are helpful if you ask for help, and people WANT to be your friend. Be a little social in games and you will be rewarded. There are plenty of people that play this game, it has only gotten more popular with time, so you will never be in a situation where you cannot find an open game (or at least I have yet to ever be in that situation). Finally, the developers are active. They introduce new things all the time (like the open world Conquest mode) and apparently are going to upgrade everyone's game for free very soon (just like they did with their previous game). This game is easily worth the $15 price tag in my opinion, but goes on sale for less than a dollar all the time so you can just wait for when that happens. So all in all, 9/10 for the kind of game that it is and tries to be. Buy this game if you ever enjoy playing games for fun. You are sure to find many new friends in the game as you madly laugh like a wildman when you create a firey tornado of death with your flamethrower as you ride the back of a T-rex and hundreds of raptors flee before you in sheer terror.

												It's now a dollar, or 79p. Permanently. Definately worth a flutter. And it's come a long way since it's much maligned launch. Whilst not as polished as say, Killing Floor you can tell that the devs have been trying hard to be. And the game improved a lot thanks to their efforts. Hit detection occasionally has a silly moment but for the most part its fine and the game runs pretty smooth. I can even host games with everyong pinging under 100. And its fun. Good assortment of vehicles and weapons, power ups, plenty of maps. So if you like co-op shooters and have had your fill of zombies give it a spin!			"

												Alot of fun for an odler game. Fun with friends and the ever so not safe for work chat and in game voip. Its a great 11 round shooter that has a similar set up and play style to borderlands but its a survival game with vehicles youd see in Halo or mechwarrior. If you ever played Sanctum/orcs must die etc youll like the game. It reminds me of alot different game mechanics from other games. Online is solid, lots of bots to help you :3 My only issue that is the interface to buying weapon and augments are not the same and some what complicated/confusing, augments you double click and weapons you have to click the green purchase.

												This game has really mixed reviews everywhere, some people will complain because of bugs, and problems and because in their words the game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ but heres the thing, its 99 cents, its the price of a cheap burger from burger king or something.  You dont expect a whole lot for that 99 cents, that being said this game has a lot to it.  It has been around for a while as Dino Horde, but they finally got out the Prelude update and it was a free update and now its 99 cents.  If you dont wanna play online there are bots now so you can play by yourself.  This game has character loadouts so you can change them around, and it has tons of modes.  You have human modes like survival and conquest which are fun and now you have deathmatches and stuff like that to play as humans.  Then there are modes that let you play as dinos, and guess what its all for 99 cents.  This game has been supported for years with free content, updates and support throughout most games dont get that kind of support.  Also they have workshop coming to so there is another reason.  Plus how many games can you get where you kill dinos?  This game is well worth the price, dont listen to all the people ♥♥♥♥♥ing because really its only 99 cents, its not like its expensive, also it has cards too I believe so there's also that.  Its fun, its cheap its the best cheap co op game you can get and sink tons of hours into it.			"

												 I would recommend this game, for sure. But it has it's up and downs, and I'll go through both.Positives: -There's nothing that compares to battling a T-Rex one-on-one with only a pistol and a medigun that can recharge yourself.-Team-play is quite fun, too. The gameplay is simple enough that you can slaughter dinos without doing much thinking, which is exactly what it says on the tin.-It is pretty stable, I didn't see any gamebreaking bugs and it works just as it's supposed to.-The Killing Floor styled gameplay works really well with dinosaurs.-The vehicles are varied and quite fun. -The Adrenaline weapons are a nice touch.-Do I really have to explain how fun it is to fight hordes of raptors while using a Jetpack? Steam, you should know this.-None of the weapons felt 'Useless' in the sense that I could do decent damage with almost anything.Negatives:-The Support Class has VERY racist dialogue, I don't appreciate the fact that he calls his teammates ""Homies"" and ""Dawg"" just because he's of African decent. It's not even well-done voice acting so the point of including it at all is mediocre at best and it kind of detracts from the experience. Why couldn't they have race-neutral dialogue? I am kind of disappointed as it lessens the experience of an otherwise solid game.-The price is way too high, however I bought it while it was on sale for only one dollar so I can't complain of this personally. If whoever is reading this doesn't own the game already, pick it up while it's on sale.-There aren't many maps to choose from. It's not that big of an issue, but I could do with a change of scenery. To address this issue, allowing custom maps would be preferable.-The game is very unbalanced, Supports are almost invincible if they have the Iron Pecs perk and the upgrades that make it so you can't die from heights or chomping. On the other hand Recon is nearly useless in all situations. However, this doesn't bug me very much considering I bought this game to casually slaughter lizards, not to engage the finer philosophical and strategic aspects of warfare in a futuristic society. The unbalance is entirely made up for by the fact there's a minigun.Overview:For a Unreal Mod, it has a high production quality, and it definitely deserves a higher metascore than it has in my honest opinion. It deserves at least a 65. If you wish to buy this game, do so while it's on sale, and have fun with it. It's not meant to be a realistic fighting simulator like Counter-Strike, so I don't see why people would complain of the unrealistic setting of a game where you're a space marine fighting dinosaurs on some alien planet. It lost it's realness at ""Dino Horde"", and that's okay. Games are just meant to be played, and I enjoyed every minute of playing this one.			"

												This game is more of a ""so bad it's good"" kinda deal. For literally 99 cents, you really shouldn't be expecting something along the lines of an actual good game. But for some reason, despite me not playing it much (only 4 hours clocked at the time of writing this), I've had some actual fun with it. There's some bugs and graphical problems. Not to mention that on the topic of graphics, the graphics are just mediocre. The variety of weapons is pretty standard along with the option to pick up insane Adrenaline weapons. Essentially this game can be described as something similar to Killing Floor on a budget. The concept of surviving incoming waves of enemies is standard, but ORION takes some liberties in the form of objectives that need securing, the occasional mini boss dinosaur in the form of a triceretops/stegosaurs/T-Rex. There's also the option to select perks while in game to boost your chances of survival.In all honesty the gameplay is pretty much the same as a lot of FPS's. You get a selection of three classes which all serve basic, generic roles. Assault are front line gunners and carry larger weapons. The medic is just that, a battle medic with the ability to heal teammates. Finally there's the Recon, the obligatory stealth class. The only slightly unique thing about the classes is that the Assault gets a jetpack that only serves limited use.All in all if you're looking for a cheap game that you can fart around with your friends in, this is a good game to pick up. Just don't expect anything grand and don't expect to play this game much except for the off night you and your pals are bored out of your skulls.			"

												Let me start by saying this is by FAR the most poorly optimized game I've ever played. For the first hour or so of playing, the game would tab out every 5-10 minutes for windows to tell me that the game was a memory leak (though this did eventually stop for god knows what reason). Upon closing the game, the windows UI was glitched beyond recognition (probably due to all the window switching while in game) and I had to restart my computer to fix it.Regarding the gameplay, Original it is not. The art assets are ripped from Halo (except for the dinosaur models/skins, which are just plain hilariously bad), the sound clips are ripped from Left 4 Dead and the gameplay is a simplified Killing Floor. There are 3 classes to choose from, but it becomes immediately apparent that Assault is the only viable one because without a jetpack you WILL die. The enemy AI is godawful, so the game compensates by throwing EVERY DINOSAUR IN EXISTENCE at you. Orion: Dino Horde is just a mess of things thrown together. To its credit though, it does have its moments of enjoyability, and I'm sure this game would be EXTREMELY fun to play while under the influence. Though I'm not sure what I was expecting when even the trailer for the game is trying to tell me ""please don't listen to the metacritic reviews"".			"

												This is a very misleading game its makes you think these Awesome epic encounters and Amazing Gameplay in the trailer it says things like ""Paid $3.99 for this game and is better than some of $60 games"" and things like that so then I try the 5 day Trial and what do I get A game that crashes contsantly and has tons of bugs and glitches and SO MUCH LAG and you may be saying you may just need a better computer and no I payed $800+ dollars for this computer and it is one of the fastes computers out there so no i had to lower my resolution disable most everything that i could and still tons of lag and its the same raptor over and over and when you try to actually play the game its way to  hard even on the lowest difficulty and no I dont suck at the fps genre its the game the Allasaurus  that spits acid its way to hard to kill so the only possitive think i can say about this game is that it has a massive potential and can be very very addictive with the proper updates and fixes to the bugs than I would highly recommend this but sadly no I have to hate this game and i try to not hate games heck I actually Enjoy the game Sonic the Hedgehog 2006 so I am an open Minded person.

												ORION: Prelude is a game that had such a low price that I had no idea if it was actually going to be a quality product. Fortunate for me, this is a unique and fun shooter game, and all the problems I had did not subtract the overall fun I had with the game.ORION: Prelude is a game in which you shoot dinosaurs (or robo-santa in the Christmas map), but it is not a normal game with team deathmatch or anything. The player (and any friends or internet people, as this game has the multiplayer option) faces 10 waves of dinosaurs while buying weapons and upgrades. However, there are many different gameplay modes, many which I still need to experience.The game has good controls, if with a bit of a delay and a bit sluggish, but the sluggish controls can usually be fixed by editing the mouse sensitivity. The graphics are okay, and the dinosaurs looks rather stupid and not very well animated, to be honest (the bigger bosses in particular). However, they get the job of being a hitbox done pretty well.The sound and music is decent enough. Nothing spectacular, but worth listening to if you want to. However, where this game pulls through is the actual gameplay itself. It is incredibly satisfying to shoot dinosaurs and buy weapons, with loads of different weapons to try. The player can have different lives and be revived or, in a similar way to COD Zombies, take down one dinosaur to be revived with all weapons. Anyway, this game is designed for multiplayer, but the genius fact about the game is that there are bots in both modes. Therefore, when playing single player, bots will help you take down dinosaurs, and they actually are well programed and an actual help, which is a problem in a lot of games with bots on your team. Also, there is loads of content (different gamemodes and quite a few different maps), as well as achievements for those who like to collect those sorts of things. In total, this game entertaining buy and is certainly worth buying and revisisting from time to time. Playing it with friends is a good idea, but not required to enjoy the game, as there is single player and random online lobbies. Anyway, there are some hinderances, such as the sound, the graphics, and glitches (I didn't mention any yet, but I have heard of some glitches from others and have experienced a glitch myself in which the upper half of the screen has a purple tint. The purple tint is easily fixed by using ctr + alt + delete and to go to your desktop and then just entering the game again with no restart or anything). However, these can all be ignored and leave a fun game that can certainly be fun for a good while and kill time. Somewhere around 7 or 8 out of 10.			"

												Worst ♥♥♥♥ing gave i ever played in my life. The trailer looks really amazing and all, i was really hype when i noticed the new content would be F2P this week but once i started playing i was really not happy.INSTAGIB, was my first game, your gun take more then half the screen and it take like 2 sec to charge it to shoot, and you can't hold it and shoot at your will, it shoot after the charge.Second game was in some kind of Power Generator defense map.. no idea what the ♥♥♥♥ was going on... killing dinos for credits and XP, bought a Magnum which aim like potato gun...Again, this ♥♥♥♥ing gamemode.. follow a random dude... walk 3 km, like 10 min walk (THE MAP IS REALLY HUGE) don't see anyone or any dinos on the way... get seperate from that guy, meet 2 enemies... one of them already had a shotgun, we get really close to each others.. i shoot at him at least 50 times (i'm not an idiot i was totally aiming at him) and like 2 bullets it him for 24 dmg which is not even close to 5% health.. he shoot me 3 times at like 50 feets and i'm dead. I respawn and there's 3-4 guys in our base with vehicules murdering everyone.The graphics are a mix of 80's games graphics mixed with CryEngine 2.Sounds is terribad...Map is huge for no reason... more ressources to load in your RAM for absolutely no reasons.Peoples won't explain you the game and tell you♥♥♥♥♥♥like ""I bet you play CoD"", well at least CoD is a decent game, even the hitboxes are better in Black Ops then this game.The fact i wasn't hitting anyone might be due to high ping servers but for me this game doesn't do it.I wouldn't even pay 50 cents for this.Enough words. I don't recommend it.. if you like old school graphics game like Unreal Tournament 2004 but with some randoms ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ts CryEngine2-like and you like killing ♥♥♥♥♥ randomly for no reason to get own by RANDOM enemies. This might be your game.. "

												Oh what a mess. Looking through this game's history is quite the nightmare, and makes me glad I have nothing to do with Spiral's PR team (if one even exists). I think the most important thing for anyone looking at this game to note is that it is not at all what it used to be. Over the past couple of years this game has been nurtured and cared for with an obvious love and dedication that I don't often see these days from developers. While the original ORION: Dino Beatdown was a buggy mess, Dino Horde has grown out of that messy goo into something I think plenty of people will enjoy for hours on end.I recently acquired this game while it was on sale for ~$1.00 thinking I would have a good time playing it with my friends, not expecting a whole lot based on steam reviews and such. My goodness was I pleasantly surprised. The first thing that grabbed my attention when I loaded up the game was the depth of the options menu. The sheer amount of UI customization and graphical tweaking available is phenomenal. And they scored major points for allowing me to turn off bloom and motion blur. However I will note that I have not yet found a way to change the controller look sensitivity, which is quite the downside if you prefer to play this with a controller, and stands in stark contrast to the quality of the rest of the options menu.After tweaking controls and graphics options to my heart’s content, my friend and I jumped into a game of survival. Honestly, this is where I think the game suffers the most. We had absolutely no idea what we were doing, and there is very little help to be found online in the forms of wikis or guides. What we did know, was to follow the on screen prompts to turn on our generator. After we managed that, enough help popped up to lead us back to our base to buy weapons and augments (purchasable buffs that last until you die). With the starting money we grabbed a few SMGs and headed outside to kill us some dinos. Once they finally spawned we started frantically murderizing every giant reptile in sight, and they in turn began chewing on our faces. Seems dinosaurs don't appreciate bullets being hurled at them. We quickly discovered that setting the difficulty to medium for your first go might not be the best idea, and we were promptly turned into dino-chow. So we went back to the lobby, turned the difficulty down to easy and tried again. This time we were able to hold our own against the horde of angry reptiles bent on human consumption. Well, at least until wave 7. After we finished playing a few games of survival I found that I craved more, and dino horde was happy to oblige, allowing for an ""open world"" mode they dubbed conquest. In this game mode you can choose from one of two huge maps to play on. One in the arctic and one in the recently added plains. When you load this mode up you are presented with a vehicle or two for traversing the world, and a couple generators you can head towards. When you go to one of the generators and turn it on, you begin a very similar wave driven experience as survival mode, however, if you manage to last the ten waves and secure that outpost, you are rewarded with a load of cash, and the opportunity to go work on securing another outpost. I will admit that I do not know what happens if you secure more than one outpost (I saw three, but didn't have the time to play 30+ rounds). The biggest thing that stands out to me about this game is the fact that the more I play it, the more I discover about it and enjoy it. I have only played two of the twelve (yes, twelve) game modes and already I feel that this game is worth the money they are asking for it. Admittedly it has its share of issues such as no FoV slider, a lack of pertinent help documentation (took us forever to find out how to get more ammo) and a slightly overwhelming number of game modes that have no description. However, even with these things in mind, nothing beats the thrill of fighting a horde of raptors, a t-rex, a stegosaurus, two triceratops, and a deinosuchus all at once in the middle of a rainy night while trying to capture an outpost. I felt like a kid again, and there are so few games these days that give me that thrill and excitement. Definitely give this game a try.			"

												Great Game actually. I see a lot of reviews sayin how the publisher is a piece of crap and all that stuff, I have to say that the game itself is pretty nice. The idea of the game is simple but hey, if you are a casual gamer like me who just need to wind down a bit after work, this game is perfect. It is an easy goin' dino shootin' fps with nice graphics and a very friendly game community. There is no fancy campaign or complicated mechanics in the game, no scheming no grand strategy, just some good old fashioned brainless action packed shooting. And that is good enough for me. Of course, if you are a hardcore gamer looking for a challege, this game is not for you. But if all you want is sometime away from it all, this game is the perfect choice. 9/10			"

												Every bit worth what I paid for it...I should have prefaced this review with some facts:- I purchased this game at the last major Steam sale (or my wife did for me, rather)- You get to kill Dinosaurs- Clear plotline, but you get to kill dinosaurs- For the most part mechanically sound- The developers seem fairly responsive to the (reasonable) desires of customers- I think it's a great thing when a group of people like this comes together and designs something so very colorful, creative and minimally buggy, without the resources of a entertainment titan like EA, Activision, etc... If you want to argue the semantics of Unrealy Engine, whatever- Just try it if you've got the spare change and could use a good laugh.- It's fun, it's silly, and if you can look at it through that lens it's a great once in a while to do by yourself or with friends!- on a scale of 1-10, I'd give it a solid 7. If you want to be ULTR@ SERIOUZZZ, go play Call of Duty; you will be (un)welcomed to play by scores of misogynists, racists, proto-rapists, fratboys, and <insert next offensive term here> in a super serious FPS! Sounds great, right?!Recommend this game! "

Squeezed from fresh virgins harvested at Spiral Games Studios very own Hell Engine, ARYANS: Dino Harp finally delivers what all satanists have been craving for the past 2 decades: For someone to take good ol' fashioned class based FPS gameplay, dumb it straight the ♥♥♥♥ down, shoehorn in  pointless costumes and hats, and throw in all the assets from Natural Selection but instead of aliens have ZANY♥♥♥♥♥SPACE DINOSAURS so that it can all be blended up, mixed into a fine non-alcoholic beverage, and poured all over the ♥♥♥♥ing ground because holy hell this game is complete dogshit why in God's name would anyone wanna drink it. But don't soften up yet, cause this game's still got enough hilariously stupid shenenigans to keep your♥♥♥♥♥♥rock solid; It's got all the core essentials to being cool, including but not limited to 1) Dramatic Slo-Mo Kill Cams so you can soak in you/your friends every death, 2) Mother♥♥♥♥in jetbikes, 3) Mother♥♥♥♥in JETPACKS, 4) Poorly Optimized Motion Blur (a strong sign of being truly next-gen), and 5) Rag Doll Physics out the♥♥♥♥♥ If you aren't soaked through to the seat by now than you gotta have a crotch colder than the Artic Circle, in which case this is the kind of game that might just actually kill you. TL;DR it's ugly and stupid and cheap but if you're looking for a silly co-op shootbanger than you came to the right place			"

												The MetaScore for this game does not do it justice. - If you only read the first line of reviews, then this one speaks volumes.Essentially a wave-based first person shooter (in the same mold as Tripwire's Killing Floor and Valve's Left 4 Dead), this game has a man vs dinosaurs theme set in mulitple locations.Graphics are smooth and surprisingly good. The developers have thrown a lot of work into making this game not only playable, but challenging and enjoyable as well - and it shows. Not the most immersive game out there, but that fades into insignificance when the bullets start flying.A worthy addition to any game library - especially when on sale.			"

												Don't trust the minimum system specs listed. My system meets all of them and even with all settings dropped to lowest, I only get around 3 FPS, making the game completely unplayable. This comes despite marginal polygon counts and no exceptionally heavy eye candy that I could see. There is little to no optimization of code, making what should be an easy to run game utterly unusable for anything but fast computers, and the threading priorities within the client are so poorly done that I even encountered audio stuttering in the menus before the game. Audio stuttering on SFX is one thing, but this was BGM stuttering, completely ruining immersion. Needs heavy work before I'd call it a success of any sort.			"

												This has got to be one of the most boring and most disjointed games I have never had the pleasure to play.This game has recently had a name change, for the second time, because for some reason these developers change the ♥♥♥♥ing name of their game whenever they release a ""big update"". This game was and still is a buggy pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥since launch and despite these ""big updates"" the bugs remain. First time they changed the name, they didn't fix anything... They just added a microtransaction store. Because they changed the name it caused a lot of bugs with Steam and it brought the game back on the front page of the Steam store and it did NOT deserve it. And now they did the same♥♥♥♥♥♥but it didn't seem to break the Steam Store like last time; No, all this update added was some hats, controller support (which by the way made it so that it only shows the Xbox controller buttons in the main menu, well done guys), and some game modes. I didn't even bother to play any of the other game modes after seeing how godawful their MAIN gamemode is.So what actually is Orion Dino Beatdown/Horde/Prelude you ask? Well, it's a horde mode game involving dinosaurs. A fairly simple concept: there are waves, there are enemies, you kill enemies, progress through the waves and so it goes on. But the presentation and gameplay are so horrible that it doesn't work right (which is probably why they added the other game modes to make up for the garbage that they have created).Presentation: This game looks hideous, even for an Unreal Engine 3 game, and it runs terribly dispite how bad it looks. I had to lower all the settings down to get a decent framerate and the game definitely does not look good enough to justify it. And it appears that they added a disgusting cell shaded look that just seems completely out of place recently, weird black outlines on some places. Besides graphics, the animations are atrocious and the modeling on the guns look pathetic, the sound design is just bad, many of the guns feel weak as a result of having poor animations and sound quality. ♥♥♥♥ing magnums should not sound like BB guns. The dinosaurs look alright, decent enough modeling and sound design... Until they attack you with their adorable little nibbling animations, making them look completely unthreatening. Yeah, this game doesn't look good at all.But ok, graphics aren't important, gameplay is what matters in a game, right? Of course, only one problem, THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE! The gameplay is so bland and generic, it has nothing original about it, it only takes game mechanics from other games, and the mechanics that it takes it doesn't do as well as where they were originally taken from. I mentioned before how the guns feel weak, and they really do. Nothing has any of the OOMPH you would otherwise see in  a competent FPS. This game's gunplay is almost as bad as Borderlands', and the guns themselves are completely uninteresting. There's very little variety in the enemies and it gets boring to fight the same dinosaurs REALLY FAST. So the gameplay is also a failure here.So it looks bad, sounds bad and plays bad. Is there any point in getting this game? Absolutely not. It's not even so bad that it's funny, it's just awful, it isn't even worth the $1. If you want to play a good horde mode game, I highly suggest Killing Floor, it does everything right where Orion does wrong. I decided to write this review now because it seems like the developers are trying to squeeze out every little bit that they can from this game and it's just depressing to see. It feels like they really tried their best here but this just doesn't work. Guys, this game is not good, you have to move on, from here you have two choices: You either realise that game development isn't your thing, or you improve upon what you did here and take note of your mistakes. Either way, let go of this game and focus on stuff you really want to do, rather than just change the game's name multiple times and milk the ever living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it.			"

												♥♥♥♥ Metacritic and their BS score they gave to the game, it has dinosaurs and thus is awesome as ♥♥♥♥. The game sure has its flaws but for an indie game such is expected, nevertheles a few cons don't rule out the awesomeness like badass close combat action you get to have with super sexy mother♥♥♥♥ing reptiles. 6/5, would bang (the dinosaurs I mean).Okay so Prelude is out and the game is even more awesome than before. They fixed almost all of the FPS drops which is really cool and the only problem I now have (randomly exploding sounds) is because of my sound card so nothing to complain about anymore. Totally worth the money, you definitely should support the makers so we would have more games like this. If you like dinosaurs, you will love the game. It sure can be kinda confusing at the beginning but once you get a hang of it, it is the most fun you have had in a long time, especially when playing with friends.Tl;dr: You haven't even lived if you don't own the game already.

												I had this phase where i would buy most anything if it was on sale under 5$ on steam, that Phase ended with Orion dino horde, a very poor game that has mediocre visuals, gunplay, and creativity, its no more than a buggy mess that only pumps out enough entertainment to distract you for a few minutes while waitng for your favorite TV show to come on, and once it does, there's no hesitation to turning it off and getting on with your life. The cummulative money system for weapons is a probably the best idea in the game, and it wasn't ever their's, Counter strike had them beat by at least 10 years, and if you like that system, you should go get Counter strike: GO which is a much better game and i highly recommend it. It doesnt hurt to give them this rating what so ever, 3/10			"

												First time I played: ran around punching t-rexes and raptors. Was grabbed by a pterodactyl and as he flew into the air. I punched him and was dropped on a rock. Did I die? Hell no. I bought a lightsaber and went around chopping up dinos. Then  a dino smaller than my foot attacks me and I die. Moral of the story, punch t-rexes but stay the f*ck away from small dinos. 10/10 would do again.			"

												I had this phase where i would buy most anything if it was on sale under 5$ on steam, that Phase ended with Orion dino horde, a very poor game that has mediocre visuals, gunplay, and creativity, its no more than a buggy mess that only pumps out enough entertainment to distract you for a few minutes while waitng for your favorite TV show to come on, and once it does, there's no hesitation to turning it off and getting on with your life. The cummulative money system for weapons is a probably the best idea in the game, and it wasn't ever their's, Counter strike had them beat by at least 10 years, and if you like that system, you should go get Counter strike: GO which is a much better game and i highly recommend it. It doesnt hurt to give them this rating what so ever, 3/10			"

												For the money, you simply can't beat this game. It does come with different game modes, which in my opinion are all awful except for survival, which is a round based game mode where you buy (not with real money) weapons, perks, and go on missions to acquire vehicles that not only increase travel speed, but also come equipped with guns, rockets, and turrets.Like I said earlier, this is not BF4, or COD Ghosts, but for the money especially  when this is on sale, you can't beat it.*Update*    System Specs have increased due to the new arctic update, you can no longer play this with dedicated graphics, you need some sort of GPU. This degrades my opinion of the game slightly, just because the range of viable players has decreased (i.e. I can no longer play this on my laptop, I have to play it on my desktop with my fx 6300 and r9 270x). This does not affect my overall impresssion of the game, this comment is simply in the ""Other Thoughts"" section of the review if you are familiar with newegg.			"

												ORION: Dino Horde is a game that brings forth many interesting gameplay mechanics but so far seems to falls short in its execution. The developers definitely have many ambitious goals set for Dino Horde but seem to lack the skill and/or funding to implement them properly. The animation quality is fairly poor and the game is still extremely buggy with texture detail fading in and out constantly, frame rates dropping (even on high end graphics cards) for no apparent reason, in-game audio buging out on occasions and with hitboxes that are just seemingly broken. I would be able to forgive a good many of these short comings if the game was an Early Access title however, seeing as this is a full release and updates have yet to fix these major issues, that’s sadly not the case. Overall the gameplay just feels clunky and underdeveloped with a lack of attention to detail as well as level design leaving much to be desired. I wanted to like this game but unfortunately, in short, I just can’t see myself recommending it in its current state. Rawwr!! 4/10Prelude update - About two days after I posted this review Orion Dino Horde was updated and changed names. I have yet to try Orion since it's update and second name change to Prelude (mainly cause I have no dersire) so I can't say much about the ""improvements"", however one thing I do approve of is the new $0.99 price tag. Still... Last time I played Orion it needed a lot of improvment for me to have given it my recommendation so I'd still be warry if you're considering purchasing this title.			"

												Dinosaurs. What's not to love, right? Right?... In the case of ORION: Dino Horde, there is a lot not to love. I was excited at the concept of the game, as I love horde-type games (MVM in TF2, Escalation in Transformers, etc.) where you are forced to work as a team to defeat unbeatable odds. In my first time booting up Orion, I had a bit of trouble finding a server as there were not many to choose from. There are a few dedicated servers, however most are player-run on their own machines. Because of this, the lag was almost unbearable to play a decent match. There was no teamwork to be had, and usually I would blame this on the team I played with, but there wasn't any incentive to work together. I trudged on, hoping it would get better after a couple of waves. I was wrong. Server after server the dinosaurs would warp around the map, and give Michael J Fox a complex because they were so jittery. The game feels like a Halo copy, with dinosaurs thrown in. After jumping in a jeep and manning the turret, it felt oddly familiar. This only confirmed my suspicion when I saw the tank go by. Yep, same tank, different color. It isn't absolutely terrible, but when it was on sale for $0.99 I still didn't buy it. You may have better luck.			"

												Single Player: PVE review.  For PVP look for another review.in this, hopefully final, incarnation the game moves into the world of microtransactions.   the game is still unplayable in single player (its just multiplayer mode w/o other players, no bots).  best if experienced w/ friends for a laugh, the game has no fun factor asside from dying with style.  i bought the 4 pack for 4.99 and i feel ripped off.  if your going to support your product w/ microtransactions you need to make it free.  i know it was done to avoid login but do the microtransactions come right out of steam wallet?  (honest question.  i did not have the endurance to explore the store after discovering it)basically this is the same terrible game it has always been.  good for a laugh if in the dollar bin.i am The Evil Dr. F and i DO NOT recommend this game. (unless you and your hordemates can get it for about a buck)URGENT UPDATE 7JUN14: Game still has no realistic Single Player even though it boasts of it on catalog page.  Game still requires friends and a sense of humor to play.  To some extent a willingness to die with style instead of winning is recommended.  It STILL has a store.  Updates have made the game more easy to look at (when crippled, or abducted by a pteranodon).  Still cannot run and jump at same time (so no bunny hopping).			"

												I can't play this game! I had to put myself into it to play just 1 match, frequent crashes, losing connection from hosts, the servers list doesn't load... there are just too many bugs in this game.When I finally got to play... god...The gameplay is messed up! When you shoot a dinosaur they don't feel anything, they don't stop running. They will only when you kill them. The audio of the guns is a mess. If you shoot with an automatic rifle 40% of the shots will be silent because they are too fast...If you enjoy this game is ok! It's just 0.99 cents right now, but don't buy it if you haven't tried it yet. I had enough after 2 games, there are too many bugs and glitches.			"

Weapons seem like they don't have any weight and I think bullets travel foward until they hit something.The dinosaur theme itself, not that interesting but I decided to give it a try anyways and wasn't really disapointed cuz i was expecting anything good from the start.Wouldn't even pay 0,01 for it.(anyone who wants to ♥♥♥♥♥ about this will be talking to the hand cuz i have better thing to do than listen to lil fan boy kids.)

												A game I bought because it was at such a low price, (Like a pound or something) I knew I couldn't of been getting anything great, but I excpected to get some enjoyment out of it.Where to start?First off, the entire game is a horde mode, so the game is essentially a side feature of most games trying to be a full game.The controls are okay, I can figure out how to move and use weapons.The graphics quality is alright, it's nothing at all special.The dinosaur models/textures are kind of out-of-place looking, they look a bit cartoony.Whenever you headshot a raptor, it's head explodes, and it looks awful.The game's lighting is overall very bland and reminds me of when my ENB for Fallout: New Vegas broke.I went down, it told me ""Fight to survive"", there were no dinosaurs around me, so I died.Gunplay is fairly weak.The weapons don't feel real, they still sound like a gentleman coughing on an operahouse.Voice acting is okay I guess.A wide variety of three classes, wow, so many classes to choose from, so hard to decide.Overall this doesn't live up to the reviews shown in the trailer at all, but then again, did you really excpect that?So what are terms for buying it on?If you're really really into dinosaur games, this might be for you, if you're not, well then why are you even here?Overall, boring game, nothing to keep me in it.

												As someone who loves dinosaurs and violence this game is the saddest creation on Steam.  Not worth the .99 nor the time to install a free trial.The game has horrible matchmaking connectivity, match sizes are too small, and invites from friends don't work reliably.  The lobby menus are bloated with an obvious cash grab shop and ""look at me"" achievements.  After finally getting into the game the environments are so empty.  Sad textures on bland geometry.  The objectives are agonizingly simple, go here, push button, await dinosaurs.  The AI has simple charge maneuvers with little variance.  Other game modes offer different playstyles, but those are just as droll.  Playing as a dinosaur should be an exciting encounter with you as a 'boss' monster, instead you get mown down in seconds by standard weaponry and vehicles.  The bigger dinosaurs available are sluggish and their hit detection leaves you wondering if you're playing on the same map.  How did the developers attempt to balance smaller dinosaurs against their totally-not-spartan soldiers?  They've strapped 'dino-mite' (oh god this is probably what they called it) onto the back of Compy and Pterodactyls.  Orion: Dino Horde is supposed to be a dinosaur game, or at least about dinosaurs, but there are only two decent selections in the multiplayer.  It is more rewarding to be a faceless marine than the game's namesake.  I would call that a failure.Speaking of ""original"" protagonists.  Models, animations, and even the physics feel so similar to Halo titles it is like the budget was spent paying Bungie's royalties, as if they could afford them.  The guns are such obvious plagiarisms they appear to have been stripped from Halo 2 and altered in the simplest ways.  Round a barrel here, recolor there, different gun!  The worst example is the tank.  It is the Scorpion from Halo shamelessly reused.Orion: Dino Horde is a decent concept, horribly executed.  The developer must be trying some last ditch effort to squeeze money out of the dying player-base.  I've found out there is another game in the works, an open world dino warfare game.  I can only hope that they've learned from their mistakes and attempt to make something different from Dino Horde. Despite all that I've said I did play this game, I did laugh at it with friends, but I still feel shorted. I spent .99 on this game and I wish I could have it back.  It is that bad.TL:DR = One of the worst things you could play.			"

												Oh man, this game.Let us begin with the very beginning of this game.It was♥♥♥♥♥♥ just utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ a friend of mine couldn't even play the game back then because when one of us hosted the other couldn't join, we were frustrated by this and thought the game was horrible. We regretted ever buying this game and shelved it for all eternity. However, I remained faithul and watched the development going on from the shadows and I must say, good job Spiral Game Studios! You have shown people they you are one of the few developers that actually give a rats♥♥♥♥♥about your game and want to make it bigger and better! Gone with the DLC crap, you buy the game you get the updates and DLC for free! Period!I salute you, with the new updates I have gained faith in you again and the news about the Orion Project gave me new hope, I just installed the game again and will try it out, a full review will follow afterwards and I wish this will be my most favorite game, because the new additions are so many for me it should give me a lot of time to try them out, not a fan of PvP but that is my opinnion. Full review coming after real gameplay.Also, for all who see the rating of Metacritic, that was when the game first came out under a different name and was utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ give it a try, show your support to these awesome ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, show them that Indie developers need more support then right corporations that care only for the money and not its fans!Extended Cut;So, I played some more and got into a solo match of Open World, man is that snow coming from the skies? Is that a fricking T-Rex walking around not noticing me? What is going on!I quickly found out that Open World is Open World, a place covered in and by snow, it was snowing when I spawned but after a few minutes it vanished, so I took my jeep, went to the generator and saw it was a generic survival mode, activate the generator and hold out, pff, easy I thought and so it was, I was bored and got the Cryo Blade (Lightsaber) and oh my gosh this thing is powerful, two hits against a mobs head with the 2x damage boost and you are set to go solo mode. Now, why would I continue playing after I defended the generator and have to go to the outpost? Easy, five huge beasts to slay with my trusty VTOL, now the VTOL is great and all, but if you DON'T kill the flying dinosaurs you are pretty much screwed, they chew away your VTOL's armor and the fact that T-Rex throw rocks at you, start flying boy. So, after I got downed I tried to fight the T-Rex who got his little T-Rex friend AND army with him to fight me, eventually I died and thought; ""Screw this, it was fun."" And to my surprise I could revive by killing an enemy, which was awesome, also could my shields regen after I got hit a few times, which worked only once because I got overwhelmed again. So, after a minute of fighting the T-Rex got me and digested me, woops.Also, the fact that there are chests and cabinets with money and/or weapons in them is a neat idea, first loot and then see if you can buy a better and bigger gun, a great idea for people who just hop in and need a bit of extra cash to win the battle!All in all I give it a 9/10, it is a great and awesome game and they did a great job, the snow effect made for some intense fighting because my vision got blurry and frozen as soon as I stepped outside, which made it harder and more challenging, I won't give the 10/10 until I actually play some multiplayer matches with random people and friends and see how it works then, overall a great game if you want to test you luck and survival skill against two T-Rex's and their little buddies, next time I bring my own army of four with me and see how long they can survive against us.

												When I first saw this game back when it was originally released, I thought it looked pretty cool. Then I played it and HOOOOO boy, did it SUCK. It was buggy, lagged badly, and yet...when it worked, it was like a fun game that was in alpha. Recently coming back to it, it has changed quite a bit. It seems to play a LOT better than before, and I was able to actually enjoy it. It definitely is shaping into the fun game I had hoped it would be.			"

												When I first played this game it was nothing special. The gameplay was average, but fairly fun with friends. Today the game was updated which added a various number of things. The added rain and day and night cycle allows for more depth and realism to the point where i feel like i am actually in the arctic fighting dinosaurs in real life.  This game now makes games such as Battlefield 4 and Crysis 3 look like arcade shooters. 9/11 would bang and buy again.			"

												I know what you're probably thinking. Someone who has barely any time put into this title wouldn't know anything. But, after shortly playing this game and watching gameplay, I can fully recommend this game. Though the graphics may not be technically 'there', the concept is. If you love to just kick back, relax, and kill, then this is your kind of game. Just ignore the Metacritic rating. In my opinion, it should be at least an 80. There is an amazing weapon selection to choose from along with great objectives and sudden horde bosses. It kind of has a MW3 Survival feel to it which is great. I personally enjoy this type of game and it's just action packed and will keep you on the edge of your chair.			"

Not only does it have literally every game mode I could ever want it's only $15.Do you like Dinosaurs?  GET IT.Do you like PLAYING as Dinosaurs?  It has 4 (soon to be 10).Do you like tons of guns?  Game has 50+.Do you like cooperative gaming with friends?  4 coop modes.Do you like competitive multiplayer?  It has like 10 modes!200+ achievements, 30+ maps, I don't know how, even in it's worst state, this game was so knocked.  Seriously check it out at the next f2p event or sale.			"

												I tried the game serveral hours since it was free to play this week.I really wanted this game to be good since i'm always on the lookout for good coop games, but this game isn't it.Don't get me wrong i definitely had some fun moments when everything was working, some nice games but after a short while i had the feeling that i have seen everything there is to see.Enough fun for 99 cents, but still buggy, especially the server browser.I couldn't sort the servers by ping because it didn't how any ping for the first 2 hours i tested it. So it was gambling if i would find a server with acceptable ping.I couldn't join any game if i tried joining a password protected game until i completely restarted the game.There were some crashes, sending me directly back to the desktop, really annoing if we had a survival nearly finished and no idea how to find the server that i was playing on.In game it felt a little odd sometimes, the weapon handling seemed a little off and the physique of the dinos made for some hilarious sights from time to time. Also the penalty for dieing in the survival mode seems a little harsh. If you die you not only loos all your items, they can be picked up where you died, you loose all your perks and improvements. This penalises dieing in medium or higher difficulties so hard that you might not be able to win the later waves after getting eaten in one round.The only way you can influence the fight after a late death is driving vehicles.I know avoiding death is possible and the meaning of this game mode but somtimes there will be a T-Rex just eating you anyway.I can imagine this game being fun for a short while, if you have friends to play it with even if it crashes from time to time.But playing with randoms in the matchmaking system and then loosing the connection/game crashing mid game can be really dissapointing.Well if i hadn't had those crashes and a really hard time with the server browser i would have recommended this game.Even if it feels a little off from time to time you can still have some nice coop fun with it.Well they advertised in the trailer that they improved everything and made this a great game, after watching Totalbiscuits review of the first relaunch i can see that they actually improved the interface and animations a lot but the new advertising seems to promise too much.

												This game is just... really bad. Not polished, poor shooting mechanics, poor survival wave mechanics (we never really knew why things were spawning in between waves), and a mess of other problems. In dino survival, when a player spawns they have to run for about twenty seconds to a point where they can buy a gun. Why is it designed this way? The player spawns next to the ability upgrade teriminals, why aren't the gun terminals next to that?The animations are so janky. The most common example is when a player is ""downed"". The player gets on their hands and knees and sort of hip fires their pistol at dinosaurs, but stands up on both knees to reload, dropping back down to their toddler crawl to fire some more. Aerial enemies move in little ""increments"" when on flight paths in this sort of jerky manner.Why does my health not regen when I'm in a vehicle? Why does the AI sometimes get hung up on players on rocks, and other times, they just vault right up? Why isn't there a prompt for raising an ally from the ground?It all just seems really basic and unpolished. I'm not really enamored with dinosaurs so I have to go by gameplay merits alone, and there just aren't any. A lot of other games do similar ideas better in a more cohesive manner. The scary part is I've never played this game when it was ""Dino Beatdown"" or whatever, and it's apparently improved a ton since then.Skip this one. Play one of the other various games in this genre instead.			"

												I had a nice day today. I had a above average day at school today, and I came home to see that there was a free game on steam. Me and my buddy were very excited to see that the game was about dinosaurs, as there are very few of those today. So my friend and I said, ""why not?"", and dove in.After an hour of downloading, our hearts were racing. Thoughts of running wild as a gigantic dinosaur, eating anything in our path, running the jungle so to speak. We click ""play"", and off we are into the world of ORION: Dino Horde.Never in my life have I wanted to kill myself. I am one of the most postive people I know, and this game made me the most depressed, dark, and angry person on the planet. My blood was boiling at the sight of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dinosaur animations, and terrible gameplay. I am writing this with my neck in a noose, and plan on hanging myself after I post this review. God speed.			"

												Wow this is bad. I didn't plan on even testing this out until I read some reviews and decided to try it for the weekend trial. Wow what a mistake. I played a whole 30 minutes of this and knew this was garbage. This game has numerous basic gameplay issues. Just to start off, you can't properly remap your keys and the keys displayed in the control settings don't correctly state what key something is currently bound to... Shooting a gun has some sort of a lag from when you actually click and the gun shoots to when you see your weapons recoil/flash... Everything is scaled horribly, it's like they had no regard for what things should look like. You'll have dinosaurs ranging from mouse size to giant size, vehicles, buildings and consoles all look like they took a whole 5 minutes slapping something together... I honestly knew what I was getting into when I looked at this game and other reviewers made me think otherwise. I am honestly more dissapointed at the Steam community for all the ""recommendeds"" for this pile of dinosaur crap. Don't waste your time on this, even for a $1 there are much more polished games out there. Metacritic got this one right. Heed my warning, stay away.			"

The servers don't work, the solo game is impossible to play, and the game does little to nothing to tell you how to play.

And I just love how all those 'Quotes' in the trailer give credit to no one. Who are they from? The developers. The funniset thing is I played this for free! Not only did they sell it at 93% off but I still have 4 days left to try out this utter garbage! This game is awful and I cannot recommend it.			"

												Ignore the metascore. I believe it has something to do with a previous iteration of the game. This game is great fun with friends. There are plenty of different game modes and most of the bugs seem to be ironed out. The development team are also constantly adding new features and game modes.If you're looking for some entertaining co-op or versus action with friends then I highly recommend it.			"

												I can play horde-based gamemodes for hours upon hours without even getting slightly bored. I've played tons of Black Ops Zombies and Gears of War's Horde Modes back on Xbox 360, and the concept generally kept me entertained and immersed in the game longer than I would have without those Horde Modes. However, when a Horde Mode isn't all that good in a tripple-A title, there's usually plenty of other content that will keep you busy, like the multiplayer and the co-op campaign and what not; the Horde Mode is simply an addition. Lately developers tend to create more stand-alone Horde games with little to no other content meaning that the value determines how good or how bad the game is. Take Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army for example. It's a great horde experience with lots of fun to be had in the co-op. This is stand-alone horde gone good.ORION: Dino Horde is stand-alone horde gone haywire-bad.The Good:· Reasonably large maps with objectives and hordes of dinosaurs.· Dinosaurs. Ross approves.The Bad:(Oh God, where do I start...)· Terrible hit reactions from the dinosaurs. You just have to spray and pray that you see some blood squirting from their fugly bodies. Oh, and there are no bullet holes where you hit them, so good luck figuring out IF you've even hit them and which ones you hit and which you didn't.· Unorganised and messy, from map layout and design to gameplay. Dinosaurs look like they're moonwalking on an escalator, the maps are unnecessarily large, ""upgrade stations"" to buy vehicles, upgrades and weapons are scattered unlogically far from each other and so on.· The menu looks okay, but everything else is just so damn aweful: the HUD and chat-window are just large bulky windows that take in unnecessarily huge chunks of your screen.· A few ""game modes"" that make little to no sense what so ever.The Ugly:· The visuals look just acceptable on screenshot, but ingame it's simply terrible. It feels like a rushed and forgotten product the entire time and it's broken at its very core.Final Verdict:Save your money (even the 99c for which its being sold lately) and do not waste your time on this mess of a horde-game. Boring, ugly, broken and generally dumb, ORION: Dino Horde underdelivers in every sense of the word. You may get a laugh at the terrible overall design of the game when it's on a free weekend and you're drunk as sh*t and high as f*ck munching away a pizza on a overly hot summer evening with some equally bored friends. 1.5/10, and that point and a half is simply for the dinosaurs. Rawr.			"

Witness a game experience like no other! The development crew spent Days! Hours! Minutes! Seconds making this game!

The problem is that the plot is just ridiculous and it’s badly executed too. I have to confess that when I played the game it was riddled with bugs, so it may have improved by the time you read this, but I am afraid I just can't recommend it at all.			"

A MUST BUYThis game is totally worth the $0.99 asking price. Orion: Dino Horde Has a familiar feel for style of play that you could come to expect from any FPS on the market now-a-days but with one major difference, dinosaurs! Zombies are great but the market is already saturated to the MAX!Orion offers great co-op play and remains challenging at any level. The loadout system combined with the bonus/leveling system keep the player interested while getting chomped down by T-Rex. Play types include: survival, conquest, slaughter, rampage, duel, team elimination, free for all, king of the hill, and gun game. Most are self explanatory. Best part outside of standard PvP and Co-Op is Rampage, which allows 10 humans vs 2 playable dinos! I would recommend this game to any player, be it a first-timer or a veteran of FPSs.			"

												An amazing game to play with friends, Dino Horde is sure to bring about some good laughs and fun times.- Easy to set up a multiplayer game- A wide array of game modes (PvP, PvE, Co-Op)- Feels like an old school shoot'em up- Stress-less team play, no need to stick to roles and such- Passionate developers- In-game store is mostly for cosmetic items, no pay to win- Just plain funOverall Score: 8/10.The game still has some minor issues, but nothing game breaking, and when it comes to having a good time gaming with a couple of friends, Dino Horde is at the top of my list.

												Given the massive sale that is going on right now it warrants a look at only $1.  The score given by Metacritic is wrong.  The game is a polished FPS that is continually getting updated.  Fast paced survival action is what gets it for me.  Nothing seems to over powered or useless, and there are many different styles to choose from, and routs to take.  I am looking forward to see where they take this game in the future and I am gad I can be along for the ride.			"

												I was rather worried about all the bad reviews, and the awful metascore this game had recieved, but given my interest in games like Killing Floor and Halo, I figured I'd give it a shot. I mean, how bad can dinosaur killing be, right?I downloaded the free trial, and WOW was I in for a surprise. It was just good, clean fun. It didn't feel as tight as Killing Floor, or as ""Next-Gen"" as Halo usually does, but the combination of those two, and lack of real seriousness about the game make a fantastically fun time sink, and an extremely enjoyable game.Within 15 minutes, I decided it was worth the $0.99 to pick this game up, as I had already had more fun playing it than I have had in a game like this since Killing Floor, and I do not regret it one bit, especially at this price.While there are a few bugs here and there, such as dinos occasionally flying up to unbelievable heights, and arrows hovering after they have fired and hit a target. But there doesn't seem to be much of anything that gets in the way of the actual gameplay.While to this point, I have not strayed much from the Players vs. Dinosaurs Survival mode (which is truly fantastic when you get a good group of people playing with you), there are many other different gameplay modes that provide good variety. Also, there is a pretty good selection of weapons in this game, catering to many different tastes, and nothing seems to be TOO over powered, with weapons seeming to be rather well balanced. The different ""Augmentations"" are also a nice addition to the game, allowing you to play to your own strengths instead of always having a vanilla character.TL;DR:Overall, this is a really good game, and has changed a lot for the better from the game that recieved a 35 metascore. Definitely worth the $1 it is right now, and probably even the $10 or $15 it is at full price.			"

It is a fun game, it does need server work and i think there should be a TDM type mode as to where 2 teams battle it out, but also have to watch for dino's.the graphic system does need an upgrade, it is a great looking game but it can be better,  the menu needs an overhaul as well, the store items and character loadout is really pixeled and not clear.The game has potential, and i see that there is another update coming this year, for a change of it to be orion: prelude with new maps, characters, menu, game modes ect. i hope graphics and dedicated servers are in it as well. Maybe more players in each game as well. But while this game is on sale id reccomend it, you cannot go wrong for $0.99			"

												I have given this game 2 reviews already but i kept coming back after the updates, the last update did this game justice, Spiral Games finally stepped up and listened to their fans and players. At first i did like the game, nice concept but then after they redid it, the optimization and performance was awful, and when i mean awful. The animations were just sad, i mean the way the raptors *chomped* on you was too odd and sad. It looked like someone eating cereal while having a stroke. But after the recent update this is what i must say.1. The performance has been hugely improved, i can now play at 60 FPS without my pc tanking it.2. The visuals have improved greatly, Dynamic Lights have been given a meaning however being annoying sometimes.3. The animations have improved slightly, they still look clunky, specially the spino's, when theirs too many raptors it starts to breakdance lol, it looks funny but it could be improved.Overall the game is actually enjoyable now, just becareful on joining a server where the host is from another country, you WILL lagg. This has to be fixed ASAP.Fun gameplay, great weapons (specially the bow, my god that bow is fun) and thank you for listening Spiral Games. 7/10 Fun, Great concept, Killing dinos with a bow while using a jetpack trying to avoid being eating while not dropping to a pool of raptors is enjoyable now.

I reminds me of halo 1 charcter, vehicle and world design but on a much bigger bigger scale and more polish. it has a solid perk and weapon purchase sytem in game and a meta loadout your unlocking those same perks for you to use in matchmaking. and too top it all of ive hardly experienced any framerate drops, but ive been playing on med graphics when alone and low when online.All in all, on of the best multiplayer games if your lookin to have fun with a group of friends.

												This is an awesome game lol, not everyday you can play an FPS game and shoot dinos! As for graphics, they are decent, reminds me of halo based layout. I bought the 4-pack on sale at 96% off for $3 lol it was worth it for sure to have 4 people play for just $3. If you got friends who play and want to join in its worth the non sale price but if your alone might want to try and get some others to get it with you, much better with friends.			"

												This game can't be compared to Dino Beatdown. Yes! It's created by the same developer, but once you play ORION: Dino Horde you'll get to see that Spiral Game Studios really took the negative reviews directly to the chin and practiced what the community demanded from Dino Beatdown - Put that into consideration. Also people that purchased Dino Beatdown received this game for free.More and more free content has been added to this game, so it's pretty clear that Spiral Game Studios is working on it.So how's this game? Well first off you need some people you can rely on playing with, I mean proper teammates. They should be able to revive you when you're incapacitated.  Since there are big dinosaurs  you'll trying to avoid them with your jetpack and you'll freak out for a moment since you don't know whether the Spinosaurus or Tyrannosaurus Rex can reach you or not when you're in the air!If Spiral Game Studio is reading this - Please consider supporting Steam Workshop!Peace.

												Dino Horde. I really think this game is great. Fast paced, balanced achivement/ credit earning (changes based on difficulty setting)   Really helps to play as a team, and feel free to guide new players in to helping the team's overall progress. I can't wait to see what the future holds for this game. Very replayable in the current release. I would value this game around 15 - 20 USD all day long. I am having trouble browsing/finding game matches/ servers. Usually about 10-15 come up, but I have trouble connecting to most of them. Often time I find myself in a Lobby, and It appears the host is AFK.  Would also love to see projectile/paths added.Other than that is very fun. Give it a try!!			"

												Don't let the metascore fool you. It may not be a very well-known game but I absolutely love this game for its bare qualities. A shooter that mixes marines, futuristic guns with dinosaurs? Jetpacks, medi-guns, stealthing, and ♥♥♥♥♥in' weapons? Not to mention some pretty fun vehicles. I got this game for a dollar on the Steam sale. I would happily had paid the full 15 dollars since I have over 30 hours so far on this game.Great to play solo, with strangers, and DEFINITELY with friends! Create your own lobby easily and play with friends. If only I had friends.Each game you earn credits for kills and you spend said credits on weapons and perks for the current game. You also earn experience as you play with the classes and you earn passive perks (and can even unlock weapons to start out with instead of just a boring pistol) or unlock perks that you normally would buy. Saves you some credits.More people need to buy this game and give Orion a GOOD name. I know Orion: Dino Beatdown had a sullied name for what the developers did and the bad metascore, but since its release it has been updated lots and is now a very fun game! And in NO WAY are any of the additional fees required. If you WANT new armors or a new blade color, go ahead and spend 5 or 10 extra dollars. I spent an extra 10 and bought a new blade color, TWO new armor colors (applies to your weapon too) AND a taunt pack for only 5 dollars.			"

												Fettuccine Alfredo began as regular fettuccine al burro until the Roman restaurateur Alfredo di Lelio enriched it with a double and a triple dose of butter for his pregnant wife, who could not keep anything down. The dish was so delicious he kept it on the menu of his restaurant, Alfredo all Scrofa, in Rome. Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks had it during their 1920 honeymoon trip to Rome, loved it, brought the recipe back, and served it to their friends when they returned to Hollywood. And so another Italian came to America. Fettuccine Alfredo has most certainly been eaten more in the States than in Italy since then. The dish is used as the base for many different versions, topped with shrimp, broccoli, asparagus, and more. Since butter separated readily when heated, cream is added to make the sauce creamier. In this version, I also add a few leaves of sage, since sage and butter are a marriage made in heaven.   Ingredients 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for pasta pot1 pound dried fettuccine2 cups heavy cream, or half-and-half4 tablespoons unsalted butter10 fresh sage leaves½ cup grated Grana Padano, (or Parmigiano-Reggiano)Directions Bring a large pot of salted water to boil for pasta. When you are ready to begin the sauce, slip the fettuccine into the water. Combine the cream, 1 cup pasta cooking water, the butter, sage, and half of the grated cheese in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir to melt the butter and bring just a simmer. Let simmer lightly for a minute or two, so the cream infuses the sage leaves. When the fettuccine is al dente, transfer it directly to the skillet with the simmering sauce. Season with the salt and return to a simmer. Simmer, tossing with the tongs, just until the sauce begins to coat the pasts, another minute or two. Remove from heat, sprinkle with the remaining grated cheese, and toss. Serve immediately.			"

												Can kill T-Rex with mech.10/10 Game of the YearOn a more serious note:This game is incredibly underrated. I've played several hours of the survival mode alone, and it has been some of the most fun I've ever had in video games. The gun's models are well done, but are few in number. The game runs like butter and has crashed only once after a couple hours of gameplay. The dinosaurs models and animations aren't cringe-worthy. The combat is fluid, but some of the mechanics are questionable (Specifically the fight-to-survive mechanic). The graphics aren't anything revolutionary, but don't take away from the experience. The rounds in survival do, however, need a ready-up function to bypass the minute wait time in between waves.I payed $0.99 for this game and had a better experience with it than I have with most AAA shooters selling for 60 dollars.8/10, highly recommend.

												I am fully encouraged to recommend this game!...... to anyone looking for a horrific gaming experience & the sexual assault of your wallet (If the game is not on sale for a price that can be considered ""expendable"").Gifted to me by a friend during the 99p sale, we were treated to a game with horrible animations, unusual keybindings, not one single form of tutorial, and horrific sound issues where footsteps reign louder than gunshots & death of a player treats all player to a painfully loud slo-mo sequence. And after all of the updates this game has received since it's crtically panned release, it's INEXCUSEABLE that the developer has left these issues completely neglected. I'd speak about how starved of strategy the gameplay is, but I've not been capable to play this trainwreck enough to provide proper judgement. Unbelievably, me & my friends had a lot of fun suffering at the hand of this game's poor design, but it was short lived.In general, this is a game that is poorly designed across the board, and whose issues most core to the game have been completely ignored in favour of expanding the game experience.You will laugh, you will anger, you will cry. Whatever the case, fully recommended to those seeking to see a video game at it's worst (when ON SALE). Otherwise, SAVE YOUR MONEY & STAY AWAY!!			"

												Edit: Auguest 29 2014 This is the second time this game has changed names after giving itself an update. Kinda fradulent since when does having an update give you the ability to change the name of your game from the original version, to Orion: Dino Horde, and now to Orion: Preulde? Short story sweet, the game is fun for the first day but then gets really boring. Not worth $1 imo. If you want to know more, you can read the rest of my review below or look up TotalBiscuit on youtube for gameplay and developement of this game.Date: March 12 2013Lots of reviews of this game says ""This game isn't as bad as the metacritic score says it is"" or ""This game has improved a lot since the original."" Sorry to say, but if this game improved a lot, it wasn't much of a game to begin with. There's no tutorial at all so you're forced to jump into one of th five or so game modes all of which pales in comparison to survival. There's versus and capture the flag, but it's no Left 4 Dead--that is, the balance is totally off. All the dinosaurs suck except for the T-rex who can toss instadowning rocks (OP) and who can instakill any person close enough to them by swallowing them whole (Super OP). There's other dinosaurs who all boil down to Dinosaurs who all suck and the T-rex. There's tiny dinos who die in like 3 seconds of getting shot or the big ones who can survive getting shot, but who have problems getting kited all day. The marines don't have much variation in viable choices either. There's the assault, the support, the scout, and the assassin--all of whom gets their asses ran over by the hordes of dinosaurs except for the assault who has a jetpack that lets him sits in the mountains on the edge of the map and allows him to pick off the dinosaurs one-by-one while being untouchable to them.Sure this game (or any game) is a steal at $1 but after about 2 hours of playing I had enough as I got bored of sitting up in a mountain peak and shooting down at the dinosaurs, running around to random checkpoints for unexplained goals throughout  the map for up to at least 5 minutes, and playing games where people were only OP T-rexes or OP Assaults. The most fun I had in this game was driving around in a car and running over dinos while I was spamming #Orion:Driving Hit & Run Simulator but that and the game gets old very fast as you soon realize every map is just an excuse to get to random waypoints for no reason which just slow down gameplay just to shoot more dinosaurs.

												Un très bon jeu basé sur de la survie qui mérite bien son prix de 15€ même s'il est sous évalué. Personellement, je l'ai acheté car il était a 1€, j'ai joué 2h de pur plaisir a tuer des dinosaures ^^. Il mérite largement un 18/20 !			"

												This game used to not be good at all. However the developers are amazing, listened to their fans, and turned this into one of the most fun games you can buy on steam right now. I've played this game for hours on end (on a different account if you're confused about my play time) and will continue to do so for a long time. Buy this game if for nothing else than to support developers who care about their player base			"

												I've been holding off on writing a review for this game for quite a long time. I played it a few months ago, and, admittedly, it was less than stellar. If you were to ask me about the game at that point in time, I would have said it was garbage.However, I don't know what happened, but this game is suddenly incredibly fun. Sure, the dinosaurs are kind of janky, and it's definitely too challenging to play on your own (bring some friends!), but there's something charming about it. It's just a loveable game. Quite fun, too!I definitely recommend that anybody considering getting this game should get it. (At the time that I'm writing this, it's on sale for $0.99 for like the 5th time, so I doubt this will happen again, but it may.)			"

												A good survival game featuring defending a base against a wave of dinosaurs, capturing outposts, using vehicles to explore, buy different guns and much more. There are many different game modes to play and many different maps, my favorites are the conquest ones.The graphics are good and the game runs smooth. The Level system looks pretty cool where you edit your loadouts but I'm not sure on how it works yet so I can't really review that.All you need to know is you can shoot dinosaurs in the face...7/10			"

												Summary: This game is WELL worth the $0.99 it is selling for now. Gameplay is enjoyable, and the the overall graphics top it off.8/10 Would knife a t-rex mid air again.I bought this game for $0.99 when it went on sale as a game sold regularly at $12.99. This game by far was not worth $12.99. I didn't even consider it worth $4.99. The gameplay is nice, but very repetitive. Playing with friends is by far the most enjoyable way to play, but to fully play a match through, you have to play for a few hours non-stop. Point shoot point shoot point shoot. The graphics make up for how little thinking is involved at times, and I'm not saying that you don't have to think strategy sometimes, just not most times. Out numbered yes, using your cloak to get past groups or larger dinosaurs is very enjoyable, but sitting at base sitting and spawn killing dinosaurs with a minigun, it gets boring.Another problem with the game is how the pvp matches seem out of place. Not only do some of the maps have cartoon-like graphics, but the pvp system is so screwed up that it isn't enjoyable to play on those servers. All you see in those servers is people spam clicking with their sword until the other person dies or they die.Overall the game I could have seen going for $2.99 and being well worth the money. Now that it is set at $1.00, I see it maybe getting more of a playerbase.			"

												It is a really fun game with dinosaurs. Halo with dinosaurs is the easiest way to describe it. The game is really, REALLY cheap and for that reason alone you should get this game. The optimization isn't amazing, especially since this game looks like a launch Xbox 360 title. The framerate sometimes gets pretty bad, at around 50fps, and it is bad because this game looks pretty bad. Surely, it is not too bad - definitely acceptable, but nothing too special. Anyway, you should totally get this game. It is fun, if not a little easy for some people, but worth playing for at least 4 hours.			"

												DEFEND THE HARVESTER!5/5 Would repair Harvester more._______Nice game, might be little bit repetive since all the gearing and stuff. You get higher gear for higher difficultie ofc.Gameplay is simple, you can play top down or in third person mode. Some say this is pretty much Destiny clone so expect that kind of game. I dont know myself about it since I havent play Destiny.There is bunch of diffrent Gamemodes, Survival and defend the objective (Harvester)Bunch of diffrent Guardians to choose from, personaly I like pyro(shotgun primary and shotgun is the best :D)Diffrent guardians have diffrent special abilities.Little bit optimization after that game is great!I really enjoyed it, and I suggest you to pick up this if you like shooting dinos, topdown- or third person shooters,co-op games or just grinding and gearing.

												First person shooter game sets in Dinosaur survival cooperative, big maps setting, survival mode waves with few objectives task to finish it. Killing dinosaurs to earn credits, you can buy upgrades, weapons or items. There a three class in this game, Assault, Support and Recon. The Assault has the ability to use his jetpack to easily escape from the dinosaurs as well going through unpassable obstacles. The Support has the ability to heal his teammates and also can heal himself and perhaps can act as a tank in the group, the last and finally. The Recon is my favorite class since the ability itself can cloak invinsibility to save herself in the trouble or revive her teammates, i also forgot to mention. There are alot of maps, game modes, etc. I bought this game and i really enjoyed alot, even though there are minor bugs. They will always fixed the bugs and go for the updates, i highly appreciated of what the developers did because they listen to the community players. Take note that this is an Indie Game and its actually a small company who made this game. Some old low reviews came from Orion: Dino beatdown predecessor so there are lots of changes in the gameplay.Rated: 8.7/10			"

												I think it's a fun game. Most of the problems with this were upon release and not long after but now it seems there is not much wrong with it. I've played 12hrs so far and recommend this for people who's ears tingle at the idea of using jet-packs whilst killing dinosaurs or stomping 'round nomming on humans as a dinosaur.The early reviews of this are now oudated as this has gone through a few years of updates and adding content. I feel that people should re-consider their bad reviews at it's release. I see this as a cheaper alternative of primal carnage (and could be cheaper). It's generally a fun game but people just seem to over-anylize and focus on the bad which is a terrible shame. I hope to see more games like this (without the controversy would be nice).			"

												I've never been much of a fan of Shooters, but this game keeps bringing me back for more.Have you ever played a game where you can shoot dinos with a powerful array of weapons, or been able to kill a T-Rex by punching it in the face?Well, despite Sally more likely to end up eating you whole, this game has that, and so much more.It may lack the story that Guardians of Orion has, but nothing's as good at relieving tension than running through Prehistoric mode solo, as you can set enemy damage, health, large and small dinosaur ratios, starting credits, and credit drop rate to become a dinosaur killing machine, easily going on a 6 hour spree without even realizing how much time has passed.For just a dollar you can get so much fun out of this gem of a game, so I recommend it to anyone willing to give it a chance.

												Using the Unreal Engine, this game is a combination of Halo and Killing Floor, only more entertaining. With three classes to choose from and a extensive leveling up system, this game is one awesome indie title for the ages. Orion has difficult but pleasant battles with all kinds of dinosaurs, including T-Rexs. It is very satisfying to fight and kill these very large and prehistoric beasts. The fast-paced shooting works greatly and I most definitely recommend this title for everyone.			"

												I really love this game, The graphics are awesome. 1000000 dinosaurs, Aircrafts, Vehicles, And awesome weapons and upgrades! Don't believe the metascore, The game has been updated so much and got so great. The only downside seems to be a bit low on game servers. However achievements are fun too! (I did notice a ingame-store that was a bit of a turnoff, But doesn't seem to make it pay-to-win)			"

												Awesome Game!Believe it or not this is a great game to invest in if you enjoy first person shooter, or shooter games. I know the price of the game is a bit misleading on its value, but I assure you its more then worth it. There are many difficulties in this game, and you can earn your achievements pretty easy on all difficulties. I generally only play Survival as I am more of a co-op type person then PVP. In survival mode you basically have to defend you the generator from the on coming Dinosaurs mobs. As you get kills or team mates get kills you earn credits & experience. The credits can be used to buy better weapons, upgrades, mods, etc at the end of each level. Out of the three classes I enjoy playing assault the most, and I like the special skill of assault which is a jetpack that allows you to get on top of rocks & other places to get away from harms way.What do you have to loose? Its only $0.99 & if you like it awesome, if not get a refund?			"

You could get it at a discount for 50 cents i got it for 73 cents i think.I reccomend it but don't buy it at the moment it dosn't have alot of players i want this game to be Popular again.			"

												First things first, that metacritic score is BS. That score was given way back when before the game was reworked and re released. I bought it for a $1 during the re-release and honestly i would of paid $30 for it. The survival mode is my favorite mode, infact i havent really played many of the other modes at all, but survival is endless fun. Favorite thing about the game is the avatar esque ships you can fly in survivor or the mech warrior war suit, or maybe even the tank. I play assault so i have a jetpack because if i didnt the massive trex would rip me out of the map and chomp me in half. He still chomps me sometimes while i try to jetpack away and he chomps rocks to throw at you if you try to land on a cliff and shoot from safety. Gameplay 9/10 audio 8/10  overall experience with the game is an astounding 10/10.     As we all know games get old after enough play but seriously this game is more than worth it and its epicness is unmatched by many other games with much higher price tags. Also its in no way pay to play you cant spend any money to get better, you can only just play which makes this game better than all those silly microtransaction games.       One thing i want metacritic to do is to review this game again and give it the 90 or 95/100 it deserves. BUY IT NOW!!!!			"

												Great game. There are many game modes such as survival. You simply choose from three different classes, assult, recon, or support and shoot some dinosaurs. There are multiplayer battles where you can fight other players, or possibly become a dino yourself. But the community is pretty small so it's hard to find matches sometimes. You can create your own server though and people will randomly join from time to time. The game does lag a lot for me though but I still do enjoy blasting dinosaurs in the face. Even on lowest graphic settings, I still lag. Don't get it unless you have friends who play it too. I bought the game on sale for $0.99 so I didn't waste much money. And don't trust the metascore. It's not 36 in my opinion but maybe something like 70 or 80. Overall, it's a fun game to play with a few friends.			"

												When I bought the game like 1 year ago it was really just a piece of buggy junk. I got it for 50 cents in discount so I was't really angry. Yesterday I was looking at my steam library and I found ORION: Prelude. I was kinda confused (the game was originaly named ORION: Dino Horde) so I downloaded it again and Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥..They tweaked the game A LOT. It's still the same, same old weapons and vehicles, but it's polished. It really looks like the devs made a lot of improvement to the game. Some previously useless perks are now vital and guns are more responsive. Also, they added flying damage indicators, so you don't have to guess if you hit that one annoying pterodactyle or not. And the best thing is, IT'S FREAKING 79 CENTS!!! It will give you at least few hours of enjoyment and even if not, it's just 79 cents. 8/10			"

												Don't trust the metacritic score, this game went through several mayor changes, and the score is based on a much older version. This game is amazingly fun to play with a bunch of friends, and extremely diverse too. You can cloak yourself to escape from a T-rex, get enough distance in a suped-up helicopter and unleash hell on this dino by means of overpowered laser rifle! Leveling up earns you cool rewards, and so does unlocking achievements. For this current price, buy the 4-pack and blast some dinos to bits. There are enough game-modes to keep you entertained for days and enough maps and difficulty settings to challenge your strengths. You can even open up a vast world and conquer it completely, provided you don't die in the process. Seriously, this game is top, recommended out the wazoo!			"

Fun! Lots of fun and innovation right ahead!+ Awesome concept+ Various types of dinosaurs+ Alive community as hell+ Usually has some good prizes+ Lots of game types+ Well made vehicles+ Awesome potential- Few and unbalanced classes- Relatively a few weapons- Not very known game- Sometimes you get p!ssed- Suggestions to make a perfect gamePROS1. Awesome conceptWhen I first bought the game I thought like dafuq am I buying? A game with a goal that is to kill dinosaurs? But wait, it's only R$1.50? I'll give it a try. And I liked it! A lot! The concept is fun, the teams have to be organized to survive the hordes of dinosaurs, that come from air or land. Although the graphics are not thaaaat good (they're only 'good', not 'very god', but that's not bad). Even though the dino-shooter game category is incresing, Orion is awesome and even if it's cheap it deserves a nice place in that place in that category.2. Tons of different dinosaursThe game itself has a lot of different dinosaurs, from different species and with different statuses: some are tank-ish, others are fast, others fly, others are so small that shooting them is way too difficult and etc. That's awesome! Bringing lots of types of dinos is truly a heavy thumbs up to the game, while other games lack in this topic, Orion is an absolutely win here.3 Alive communityThe community is alive, differently from other games and the devs are constantly open to discussion or sometimes they start contests or invite people to play with them, isn't that cool? I've seen lots and lots of games (some good games, acutally) that are with more than one year without free patches and are only 1,5 or two years in the market. This game's about 2.5 years until today being sold and is being constantly changed.4. Usually has some good prizesThis topic is strongly related to topic 11, unfortunatedly. But everything has its good and bad sides! The good thing is that I've seen Orion with awesome prizes (85%, 90% off) a lot of times before actually buying it. I bought it with a heavy discount, 90% off if I'm right, and profited very well. It was actually better than a lot of games that I actually paid more and had less fun.5. Game typesThis topic is not as important as it should be since most of the shooter games -related to dinos or not- have this in common but since it's present in Orion it should be pointed, shouldn't it? Like many other games there are lots of game modes PvP, PvE, EvP, etc. It is a positive point so it has to be put here but nothing special.6. Vehicles!The vehicle types are cool! There are tanks, jet-motos, mechs, futuristic helicopters, jeeps, mechs and other types! The good things are not the vehicles themselves but the way you can use it. Even if the graphic's not that excellent there's always an animation of getting in and getting out, signal that at least the developers tried to make the game the most complete as they could. Other thing is that depending the place you are and enter the car, you can't drive or you can't shoot, that's a complete and wide thinking of placing the player in the most realistic ambient to the game. You can also get up on some vehicles while they're moving and they ""carry"" you as long as you're on them. Of course that there are some necessary vehicles missing, like a two people mech and a 2-4 people helicopter but the game they way it is is not that bad :)7. Awesome potentialWell, what can I say, this topic means it all. Yea, Orion has a huge potential, believe me or not, and it only depends on the developers. The ambient is nice, the dinos are annoying (well, they're only doing their job, hah), the vehicles are challenging, there are bosses (with, let me say, are hard AS HELL to kill) and a lot of other things that are differential to other games. This game's technically prepared to have any colossal upgrade that can greatly increase it's gaming experience, remember this.CONS8. Unbalanced classesThe game can have up to three classes only (assault, spy and medic -you probably know what they all do). But it lacks a LOT of classes, for example at least engineers, tanks, snipers, hunters, scouts, and ninjas/melee-handed (anyway, call them the way you want) are missing. Another bad thing is that every weapon is absolutely the same if used by any class, with means that, for example, if an assault player uses a machine gun they'll get the same damage output as a medic (which is NOT right, since the assault-dude is focused on hitting while the medic is focused on supporting). That's not right. The game could have at least an upgrade-tree, too, particular to each class. You can see some suggestions at topic 12.9. Few weaponsThe game has too few weapons in my opinion and they're all pretty much the same. They're all ballistic and the game's context is futuristical. Not that the game would need to have futuristical antimatter-weapons or black hole generators or portals, no. But at least some energy short range weapons, maybe some lasers, gauss rifles or 'dino-ECMs'? Maybe...?10.

												While the metascore may seem off-putting, it is COMPLETELY misleading. Great for a night with your buddies; fast gameplay interspersed with 60-second breathers, craploads of weapons, and multiple game modes to keep it fresh. The only problem is a slight lack of polish, but the game's wonderful mechanics shine through every time. In short: Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game is fun!			"

Fun! Lots of fun and innovation right ahead!+ Awesome concept+ Various types of dinosaurs+ Alive community as hell+ Usually has some good prizes+ Lots of game types+ Well made vehicles+ Awesome potential- Few and unbalanced classes- Relatively a few weapons- Not very known game- Sometimes you get p!ssed- Suggestions to make a perfect gamePROS1. Awesome conceptWhen I first bought the game I thought like dafuq am I buying? A game with a goal that is to kill dinosaurs? But wait, it's only R$1.50? I'll give it a try. And I liked it! A lot! The concept is fun, the teams have to be organized to survive the hordes of dinosaurs, that come from air or land. Although the graphics are not thaaaat good (they're only 'good', not 'very god', but that's not bad). Even though the dino-shooter game category is incresing, Orion is awesome and even if it's cheap it deserves a nice place in that place in that category.2. Tons of different dinosaursThe game itself has a lot of different dinosaurs, from different species and with different statuses: some are tank-ish, others are fast, others fly, others are so small that shooting them is way too difficult and etc. That's awesome! Bringing lots of types of dinos is truly a heavy thumbs up to the game, while other games lack in this topic, Orion is an absolutely win here.3 Alive communityThe community is alive, differently from other games and the devs are constantly open to discussion or sometimes they start contests or invite people to play with them, isn't that cool? I've seen lots and lots of games (some good games, acutally) that are with more than one year without free patches and are only 1,5 or two years in the market. This game's about 2.5 years until today being sold and is being constantly changed.4. Usually has some good prizesThis topic is strongly related to topic 11, unfortunatedly. But everything has its good and bad sides! The good thing is that I've seen Orion with awesome prizes (85%, 90% off) a lot of times before actually buying it. I bought it with a heavy discount, 90% off if I'm right, and profited very well. It was actually better than a lot of games that I actually paid more and had less fun.5. Game typesThis topic is not as important as it should be since most of the shooter games -related to dinos or not- have this in common but since it's present in Orion it should be pointed, shouldn't it? Like many other games there are lots of game modes PvP, PvE, EvP, etc. It is a positive point so it has to be put here but nothing special.6. Vehicles!The vehicle types are cool! There are tanks, jet-motos, mechs, futuristic helicopters, jeeps, mechs and other types! The good things are not the vehicles themselves but the way you can use it. Even if the graphic's not that excellent there's always an animation of getting in and getting out, signal that at least the developers tried to make the game the most complete as they could. Other thing is that depending the place you are and enter the car, you can't drive or you can't shoot, that's a complete and wide thinking of placing the player in the most realistic ambient to the game. You can also get up on some vehicles while they're moving and they ""carry"" you as long as you're on them. Of course that there are some necessary vehicles missing, like a two people mech and a 2-4 people helicopter but the game they way it is is not that bad :)7. Awesome potentialWell, what can I say, this topic means it all. Yea, Orion has a huge potential, believe me or not, and it only depends on the developers. The ambient is nice, the dinos are annoying (well, they're only doing their job, hah), the vehicles are challenging, there are bosses (with, let me say, are hard AS HELL to kill) and a lot of other things that are differential to other games. This game's technically prepared to have any colossal upgrade that can greatly increase it's gaming experience, remember this.CONS8. Unbalanced classesThe game can have up to three classes only (assault, spy and medic -you probably know what they all do). But it lacks a LOT of classes, for example at least engineers, tanks, snipers, hunters, scouts, and ninjas/melee-handed (anyway, call them the way you want) are missing. Another bad thing is that every weapon is absolutely the same if used by any class, with means that, for example, if an assault player uses a machine gun they'll get the same damage output as a medic (which is NOT right, since the assault-dude is focused on hitting while the medic is focused on supporting). That's not right. The game could have at least an upgrade-tree, too, particular to each class. You can see some suggestions at topic 12.9. Few weaponsThe game has too few weapons in my opinion and they're all pretty much the same. They're all ballistic and the game's context is futuristical. Not that the game would need to have futuristical antimatter-weapons or black hole generators or portals, no. But at least some energy short range weapons, maybe some lasers, gauss rifles or 'dino-ECMs'? Maybe...?10. What is Orion?The game's not very known, maybe because the gaming industry is way too competitive, maybe because it was re-released twice I think, or even maybe because the game has poor grades[www.metacritic.com] in a lot of sites and was poorly reviewed by a lot of critics (just see their grades). That's odd, I might say. If you see the Steam Store valuations the game score is 74/100.

SLG's First 10-hrs. Review---The Short 10-hrs. Review---PROS+ Amazing visuals created by a modified Source engine+ Large, open-world maps make fighting dinos and players enjoyable+ Controls are solid and using a controller is just as easy as a keyboard/mouse combo+ Decent amount of weapons for every classCONS- Connection problems make joining a game difficult which leads to low playerbase- Buggy ranking system 'freezes' exp gains in some matches- Lack of any real customization apart from Loadout and color of outfit- Maps can become tedious with the same dinosaurs spawningOVERALL+ Score: 7/10 ---The Long 10-hrs. Review--- PremiseORION: Prelude is a game based around working solo or in co-op mode to survive a horde of dinosaurs. Dinosaurs range from small raptors to large T-rex's, Stegasauri, and other large dinosaurs as well as other players (in Deathmatch modes). That's basically the game in a nutshell. VisualsORION: Prelude is built around a modified Source Engine and although it doesn't have realistic visuals, it has enormous potential for modification by the community. With that said, the environments are still very large and offer a unique weather system that rains, snows, and fogs as the days pass in a match. At times, the visuals stutter against certain tall environments like rocks or mountains and seem broken or choppy, but this doesn't take away from enjoying the game.GameplayThe game's controls are quite solid and offers a solid controller support for those wishing to play from a distance or on a larger screen. Action is fast-paced when a wave starts and there's very little time to stand around unless you want to be killed by a dinosaur. The maps offer a variety of vehicles to use in a match hoowever, at times it feels like they are useless since dinosaurs rarely chase any players around the map.OverallORION: Prelude offers some decent visuals and solid gameplay to last a while however, I'd recommend playing with a friend or two because solo is not all that fun. If you're interested in a PVP/PVE dino-hunting game, then ORION: Prelude may be worth your $1 and if you've got friends, get the 4-pack for just $3.			"

												at $0.99 I have already enjoyed this game tremendously for what I spent.  Only have 2hrs in at the moment, but those were a couple of really fun hours for me and my buddies.  This game has some terrible reviews, but I think it has come a long way since those reviews. Bottom line, this is a good game for its price, and a GREAT game for its current sale price.			"

												I admit i HAD to give this game a try as soon as i noticed how the devs. mocked their own game, and hey it only costed me like 7 bucks to find a very enjoyable game, yes a poorly designed but fun game and i can only cheer the devs for the improvement they've made so far. With some more work this game could be a coop-dino-classic.At first glance this game will simply remind you of Halo. The armors, vehicles and even the weapons must be inspired by Halo i must say.This is a focused co-op wave-survival game which offers several difficulties and competitive modes such as Conquest, Deathmatch and a 5v5 where both teams need to protect a power generator while destroying the enemy's. Very fun.Graphically the game does not offer anything new, i can be honest and tell you that this aint no eye-candy, at all.They seem old and poorly designed.Right away you will notice clunky animations aswell. Robotic movements and weapons being held by thin air, dinosaurs that may disappear for a second while they chase your sorry♥♥♥♥♥making it difficult to kill, specially the small ones.Dont take me wrong, i really enjoyed this game for a couple of days nowadays i play it when i dont know what else to do and i still find it fun. Remember, like 7 bucks for a fun ride !! If you are considering if this game is a go or a no-go, please do.			"

The AI isn't top notch but watching a triceratops throw vehicles into the air around your campfire base in a lighting storm in the middle of the night while raptors go crazy down on the ground is just a feeling you can't duplicate. AND THIS GAME ISN'T EVEN ALL ABOUT DINOS! There's a ton of PvP maps and modes as well!Just buy it and contribute to the dedicated developers who made the ""worst game ever made"" into one of the greatest and probably least appreciated games of all time.

												The most fun you will have with friends.This game provides exactly what I would want in a single package. The ability to fly around with a jetpack and rocket launcher and blow off a T-Rex's face.The 3 class system gives the game depth and variaty, and the level progression, although slow, is very rewarding. Normal survival modes are good for 15-30min stints into the realm of Dino hord, but its the survival mode tundra maps that take the cake. 1-2 hour journys to defend outposts from incoming attacks, this is the mode where you will be pulling out the big guns. Loads of time to earn the big moneys, loads of time to fly around exploding face.9/10 for pure fun.Recommended			"

												This is a fun little team based shooter which involves you, the player, gunning down... well, dinosaurs. Hundreds of 'em, in droves. If you ever get tired of shooting at dinosaurs, then there's a whole host of different modes to choose from, including several styles of PvP. You can even turn the tables and play as a dinosaur yourself.The developers are very prompt about keeping this game up to date and adding new content, and have already released a huge update in the short time I've been playing it. Good work guys!Pros:- Caters to a range of different playstyles. You can play in first and third person, solo or in a group.- Customisable characters provide a huge range of options.- A range of vehicles to choose from. Ever felt like blasting hordes of raptors with a tank?- Constantly updated with new maps, game modes and big fixes.Cons:- Currently a little buggy, though mostly minor stuff like sounds not playing properly and dinosaurs getting stuck.- The music can be repetitive- While the game can be played alone, it's noticeably built with multiplayer in mind. Most game modes are considerably more fun with friends.TL;DR: This game is a lot of fun with a group of friends. Why not give it a try?			"

At first glance the game may look stupid, but even though a second look reveals the same opinion, this is still worth playing. I wish there to be more friendly and helpful players, so the community can grow lively and strong.Edit: Do I like this game? Yes, I do. I do really enjoy playing it. Is this game bad? Yes, it ♥♥♥♥ing is. I laugh at the poorly opmized game with clunky gameplay. But I do wish it was good and well made, with more time dedicated to it. But the developer left it to rot and went on another project that is an even worst cluster♥♥♥♥. I wanted this game to be something I could give to my friends and enjoy with them. But it is buggy and most of the fun comes from laughing at the game and not with it.I still recomend it though. Even more now that it is free to play. Hope one day it will be open source and the players will be able to directly contribute to good development of this great concept and visionary idea for a game.			"

												For $.99 it's actually really fun. I played for almost an hour last night after purchasing and I kept thinking ""If I were at an arcade, i'd spend $1 for 1 round"" So I like to think I spent $1 for an infinite ammount of rounds and in that respect it's definitely worth the price.Aside from the great price, there were a few hiccups. I noticed a bit of lag, even though my connection was good. Hit detection seems slightly off, maybe this was because of the lag, but at times I had to aim a the ground in order to hit the little dinos that bite at the feet.But still, nothing feels better than mowing down a stegosaurus and a t-rex from raining down rockets with an aircraft up above.Get it, it's worth it, you'll probably like it.

												Thumbs way-up.The most fun I have had playing a FPS in a while.  It reminds me of early Quake LAN parties, constant gibs, and non-stop action.  There are several different ways you can play (survival, FFA, conquest, etc),  lots of weapons, vehicles, various difficulty levels, etc.  So far, I have only played one class - 3 to choose from.  Don't forget, you can play dino classes!  Favorite vehicle so far:  two passenger assault vehicle with rear mounted machine gun.  You can ram/crush hearding dinos, but bosses toss vehicle and crew into the air.This game is not thought provoking, deep, and will not solve any of the worlds problems.  It is entertainment.  There are games for solving puzzles, this is not one of them.  Low metascore, but hey, it's easy to be a critic.  You can stare at the idiot box, or you can roast some Raptors!  When was the last time you had this much fun for $0.99?  Keyboard finger cramps included at no extra charge!  Buy it.  If you play for more than 5 minutes (and you will) it is worth it.			"

												This game is the best!  It mixes a epic co-op experience with hard core gameplay and strategy!  Your either fighting dinosaurs with epic looking futuristic weapons or battling each other! I give this game 10/10 stars!Even when i first got the game and played i knew it was gonna be one of my most favorite games!Here's any example of my daily happy fun times in this game....Step 1-Walk around the map and enjoy the peaceStep 2-Turn on the generatorStep 3-Get your butt to the weapons depot and get a machine gun you idiot!Step 4-Take your freaken gun and kill some Dinos!!!!Step 5-Get to any round i feel like because i love this game!Step 6-Kill myself then end the gameStep 7-REPEAT!!

												It's kinda like Halo2 and the oiginal Turok decided to go out for drinks, ended up getting smashed and got hoard mode confused with ♥♥♥♥♥...ooops we got a baby!It's not a hardcore fps, take it serious kinda game. For just messing about, having some fun shooting dinosaurs and flying away to safe ground with the jet pack (and who dosen't like shooting dinosaurs or jetpacks) its perfect. The gameplay is great (once you figure out what the hell you are ment to be doing....there is no tutorial), maps are pretty big, dinos are plentiful, graphics are ok too, guns are fun. For 59p you can't really go wrong! Although i now know what the guy in the toilet felt like with a T-Rex about to eat him in Jurassic Park!8/10 Would get♥♥♥♥♥♥out by a T-rex Again! "

												I am fully encouraged to recommend this game!...... to anyone looking for a horrific gaming experience & the sexual assault of your wallet (If the game is not on sale for a price that can be considered ""expendable"").Gifted to me by a friend during the 99p sale, we were treated to a game with horrible animations, unusual keybindings, not one single form of tutorial, and horrific sound issues where footsteps reign louder than gunshots & death of a player treats all player to a painfully loud slo-mo sequence. And after all of the updates this game has received since it's crtically panned release, it's INEXCUSEABLE that the developer has left these issues completely neglected. I'd speak about how starved of strategy the gameplay is, but I've not been capable to play this trainwreck enough to provide proper judgement. Unbelievably, me & my friends had a lot of fun suffering at the hand of this game's poor design, but it was short lived.In general, this is a game that is poorly designed across the board, and whose issues most core to the game have been completely ignored in favour of expanding the game experience.You will laugh, you will anger, you will cry. Whatever the case, fully recommended to those seeking to see a video game at it's worst (when ON SALE). Otherwise, SAVE YOUR MONEY & STAY AWAY!!			"

												ORION:Dino Horde.this game has a great potential in the future and right now is still a good game. The dinosaurs are not to overpowerd nor are the guns. The vheicals all have thier weaknesses and strengths. and also the classes have been well thought out and put together well so that when all three work together it is a good team. But one of the main things this game has to offer is the community it contains. The community is one of the nicest you can find, they help each other and most of them are playing to survive as well. So make sure you get this game, come join in and have alot of fun "

												I was rather worried about all the bad reviews, and the awful metascore this game had recieved, but given my interest in games like Killing Floor and Halo, I figured I'd give it a shot. I mean, how bad can dinosaur killing be, right?I downloaded the free trial, and WOW was I in for a surprise. It was just good, clean fun. It didn't feel as tight as Killing Floor, or as ""Next-Gen"" as Halo usually does, but the combination of those two, and lack of real seriousness about the game make a fantastically fun time sink, and an extremely enjoyable game.Within 15 minutes, I decided it was worth the $0.99 to pick this game up, as I had already had more fun playing it than I have had in a game like this since Killing Floor, and I do not regret it one bit, especially at this price.While there are a few bugs here and there, such as dinos occasionally flying up to unbelievable heights, and arrows hovering after they have fired and hit a target. But there doesn't seem to be much of anything that gets in the way of the actual gameplay.While to this point, I have not strayed much from the Players vs. Dinosaurs Survival mode (which is truly fantastic when you get a good group of people playing with you), there are many other different gameplay modes that provide good variety. Also, there is a pretty good selection of weapons in this game, catering to many different tastes, and nothing seems to be TOO over powered, with weapons seeming to be rather well balanced. The different ""Augmentations"" are also a nice addition to the game, allowing you to play to your own strengths instead of always having a vanilla character.TL;DR:Overall, this is a really good game, and has changed a lot for the better from the game that recieved a 35 metascore. Definitely worth the $1 it is right now, and probably even the $10 or $15 it is at full price.			"

Jump right into the game and hope to meet the nice side of the game's community that will actually teach you things, because there isn't a tutorial.

												Though this game may not have cutting edge graphics, the best voiceovers and some dodgy controls here and there. It is a beautiful piece of work that has adapted greatly from it's release. This game is proof that if you work hard at a game, it will come out great. The Dev team could of left it how it was. A heaping mess. But they looked at their mistakes and improved on them. Making one of the greatest PvD game i've seen. You can play solo, solo with bots, or with friends and either one it is great fun. All for a super cheap price of $1/79p. It's worth way more then that. Best part is that there is not a single pay to win feature on this game. No ""$10 for 10000cr"" I highly recommend this game to anybody that loves shooters and/or dinosaurs.			"

												you know what people get on my nerves? the people saying ""the graphics are not good"" honestly in the ""rebirth trailer"" i call it(commuinty appreciation"" i dont think they metiond graphics just the gameplay dont judge the game on how the graphics are base it on the gameplay the mechanics and all the things it offers but if the game itself says good graphic sure hold that to them and other things they promised i see allot of promise verdict is8.5/10			"

												I have had a lot of fun playing this game. I sometimes get the COD zombies feel when facing off against countless waves with numerous hordes of dinos but it takes me back to the closest thing i'd ever like to see to a combination between jurassic park and cod zombies. Heaps of guns, augments, perks and achievements to mess around with, game is worth its weight in gameplay despite lacking much singleplayer function			"

												I don't really know how bad this was at launch, but right now? It's quite fun. It's essentially Killing Floor with a touch of Halo. Worth giving it a shot considering how deeply discounted it tends to be. Ignore the Metacritic score if you can, and ignore all the people who tease you for playing ""such a bad game"" because ♥♥♥♥ them, you're a grown up who can make judgment calls for yourself and are capable of enjoying life without worrying what other people think.

												This is a very fun game to play with friends. You can play a variety of different game mode on different maps. These game modes range from PvP to Co-Op. One fun game mode is Conquest where you have to defend a generator against dinosaurs in a CoD Zombie style.( more dinosaurs and more difficult dinosaurs appear as time goes on) overall very fun			"

												I have played this for a few hours and I am willing to say that I want to play more.For this picetag, it was way more fun then I expected.Don't get me wrong, there is still a lot of work to be done on this game, but you can not beat the 1 euro price tag.PROS:-Tons of people online.-It's a game about shooting dinosaurs.-Vehicles are very cool.-Controls are intuitive and easy to understand. This is one of those games that doesn't need a tutorial.-1 euro. Cheap enough to try out without feeling ripped off if you don't like it.CONS:-Menus feel unfinished / buggy.-Vehicles are incredibly overpowered. Especially the flying ones, as dinosaurs have little to no anti-air.-Not enough feedback to see if you hit or not, you notice this especially when you play as the dinosaurs.-Weapons could need more 'umph'.I would not recommend you buy this at full price, but with a discount you can't go wrong with Dino Horde.

												I bought this game when it cost £1.99 during a steam sale. Since that moment I can honestly i have never regreted my choice. This now under £1 game should not cost that much and i await the moment they put the price up and award themselves for the hard work they have obviously put into this. Would happily play £10 for this game as it is worth it. To any others that are looking at the game BUY IT NOW before they do what they should and make it cost more. Easily better than games such as Call of Duty and battlefield, It just needs more players and a wider community which it deserves			"

												Extremly repetitive, but strangely addicting. Small range of weps, OP upgrades, 3 classes with different skills to use... It kind of reminds me MVM on TF2. Jump right into the game and hope to meet the nice side of the game's community that will actually teach you things, because there isn't a tutorial. (Or study at the control part of options.)Overall, 7.5 out of 10. (And for 0.99, well, it's alright.)			"

												This is a fun little team based shooter which involves you, the player, gunning down... well, dinosaurs. Hundreds of 'em, in droves. If you ever get tired of shooting at dinosaurs, then there's a whole host of different modes to choose from, including several styles of PvP. You can even turn the tables and play as a dinosaur yourself.The developers are very prompt about keeping this game up to date and adding new content, and have already released a huge update in the short time I've been playing it. Good work guys!Pros:- Caters to a range of different playstyles. You can play in first and third person, solo or in a group.- Customisable characters provide a huge range of options.- A range of vehicles to choose from. Ever felt like blasting hordes of raptors with a tank?- Constantly updated with new maps, game modes and big fixes.Cons:- Currently a little buggy, though mostly minor stuff like sounds not playing properly and dinosaurs getting stuck.- The music can be repetitive- While the game can be played alone, it's noticeably built with multiplayer in mind. Most game modes are considerably more fun with friends.TL;DR: This game is a lot of fun with a group of friends. Why not give it a try?			"

I havent met any of these so said ""real bugs"" in the game. I can connect the game lobbys when i want, the game has crashed only 2 times for me, the dinosaurs are not phasing trough the walls, VTOLS and other vehicles work like they should. The complaining about the sounds aint true, atleast i dont have them, weapons sound just like they should( except the Revolver, but it might have intergrated silencer like WW2 STEN had). Buy this game for real, you can enjoy it, or hate it doesnt make my life different. "

												First things first, before I go into detail about my experience with the game there are a few things that you need to know: This is a niche FPS/TPS game While it has PvP options, the focus is PvE There are enough glitches and bugs in the game that it feels more like an Early Access titleWith that here is a bit of information about this game. Pros: Strong PvE Elements: The game has a reasonable number of enemy types ranging from the ankle biting Compsognathus (Compy) to the Spinosaurus. Each one provides unique challenges based on when they appear and what order they spawn in.Most maps also provide the players with vertical options; if things are getting to intense on the ground then there is usually a rock spire or canyon wall that you can get on top of. Class Division: There are three distinct classes that players can choose from. The primary differences between the three classes, besides the character models, are their  special ability  and how much armor you start with.  Class Name  Ability  Armor Points  Assault  Jet Pack  150  Support  Medic Gun  200  Recon  Cloaking Device  100 Each class has its own strengths and weaknesses and plays an important role in game modes such as  Survival  and  Conquest  . Ingame Customization: There are two kinds of ingame customization: Cosmetic Weapons and SkillsCosmetic Customization is what it sounds like, you can either earn (to a small extent) or buy skins, armor effects, capes, TF2 style hats, etc.Weapon and skill customization a bit more complex. In the games modes  Survival, Conquest,  and  Vital  you earn EXP and CR. CR is temporary currency used to buy new weapons and  Augments  (a.k.a. Skill Bonuses). EXP is cumulative and is applied towards the Class you are currently playing. As your total EXP in a class reaches milestones you unlock boosts like permanent EXP modifiers, extra CR per kill, Ammo Regeneration, increased Jump Height, and new Starting Weapons. Difficulty: There are 6 preset difficulty levels: Noob, Easy, Medium, Hard, Insane, and Redikulous [sic]. Noob has a low EXP rate but weak dinosaurs, and is good for learning the ropes. Easy is slightly harder but still manageable for new players. Medium is the Default setting; 100% EXP, Dinosaur health, and Dinosaur Damage. Hard is best for  Advanced  Players and is linked to several achievements. Insane is suited for  Veteran  Players, and Redikulous [sic] is punishing for players of all levels and skills.Beyond the settings above, there is one last customizable difficulty,  Prehistoric . Prehistoric lets the host tailor the game to their wishes, Enemy difficulty, CR per kill, Spawn rate, vehicles, and whether or not there will be  Silly Waves . Each adjustment also changes the rate at which players earn EXP, the maximum is around 1300%. Cons:  Game Modes: The fact of the matter is that there are a lot of game modes, the problem is that most of them aren't terribly good. Survival and Conquest are Co-Op, PvE, round based modes. For a general reference point, think Killing Floor - or less accurately  Nazi Zombies . For PvP there is your average Deathmatch, Elimination, and other such modes. There are also  Duel, Rampage  and  Instagib  game modes. In the Duel modes all players spawn as Recon with a Machinepistol and an  Ion Blade  (it's a Lightsaber, but not - Copyrights and such). Rampage is a modified version of CTF and pits two teams against each other, except that one team is Humans and the other is Dinosaurs. In Instagib, everyone spawns as an Assault class and is armed with the  Laser Rifle  and the rest is self-explanitory. The last game mode is  Vital  and it is a PvEvP mode. Basically, defend your bases generator from Dinosaurs, earn CR, and find a way to destroy the other team's generator. Their are two methods of doing this, either directly by attacking their base, which is ~2.4 Km from yours, and destroying it and preventing them from fixing it for 60 seconds (If you want something done right...); or, you can spend the CR you earn and  Mercenary  Dinosaurs into doing the above for your.You may be asking yourself, ""Why is all of this in the 'Cons:' sections? None of this sounds too bad."" Long story short, in any mode other than PvE, your rank, unlocks, and skills mean Absolutely [Explicative Expunged] Nothing. In PvP and PvEvP you spawn with the basic kit assigned to your class, this includes unlocked skills/augments. Again, ""Well, that means that everyone is on even footing. What's wrong with that?"" Simply put, equal doesn't always mean fair. Example, a player spends hours ranking their favorite class in Survival and Conquest and then all their work is stripped away from them. Fair? Perhaps. Infuriating? Definately. Map Design/Usage The maps are extremely varied. There are Forests, Deserts, Tundras, Box Canyons, Building Interiors, and even Cartoon Maps. None of this is particularly bad, but on the larger maps used for PvE there is no real insentive or reason to go beyond line of sight of the generators. True, you do get sent to capture  Outposts  every few rounds, but that's just going from Point A to Point B and back. Leveling Up: I have played enough games to understand the 'Progressive Leveling' is a fundmental element of the experience. For every level you earn it takes more EXP and/or Time to reach the next one. However, when the average EXP earned in a game is in the low hundreds to few thousand and ranks get to be greater than 1.6 Million points a part, I find it excessive. Recommendation: Overall I found this game to be fairly fun. Beginning to end, games of Conquest can run several hours, but they don't have to. As I mentioned at the top of the post, this game is not without bugs. On one of the Rampage maps the objectives never spawn so there is no way for the human team to win. Audio, Video, and Physics glitches are not uncommon; and on occassion this adversely affects game play. In one instance, I was playing a Vital match and the enemy generator suddenly became invulnerable to harm, from both Players and Dinsaurs alike. So yes, I would recommend this game, and I have to a few friends. Just don't expect a flawless experience.Sorry for the long post, and for those of you who understand, no potato either.			"

												First things first, before I go into detail about my experience with the game there are a few things that you need to know: This is a niche FPS/TPS game While it has PvP options, the focus is PvE There are enough glitches and bugs in the game that it feels more like an Early Access titleWith that here is a bit of information about this game. Pros: Strong PvE Elements: The game has a reasonable number of enemy types ranging from the ankle biting Compsognathus (Compy) to the Spinosaurus. Each one provides unique challenges based on when they appear and what order they spawn in.Most maps also provide the players with vertical options; if things are getting to intense on the ground then there is usually a rock spire or canyon wall that you can get on top of. Class Division: There are three distinct classes that players can choose from. The primary differences between the three classes, besides the character models, are their  special ability  and how much armor you start with.  Class Name  Ability  Armor Points  Assault  Jet Pack  150  Support  Medic Gun  200  Recon  Cloaking Device  100 Each class has its own strengths and weaknesses and plays an important role in game modes such as  Survival  and  Conquest  . Ingame Customization: There are two kinds of ingame customization: Cosmetic Weapons and SkillsCosmetic Customization is what it sounds like, you can either earn (to a small extent) or buy skins, armor effects, capes, TF2 style hats, etc.Weapon and skill customization a bit more complex. In the games modes  Survival, Conquest,  and  Vital  you earn EXP and CR. CR is temporary currency used to buy new weapons and  Augments  (a.k.a. Skill Bonuses). EXP is cumulative and is applied towards the Class you are currently playing. As your total EXP in a class reaches milestones you unlock boosts like permanent EXP modifiers, extra CR per kill, Ammo Regeneration, increased Jump Height, and new Starting Weapons.

												Review: When I first saw this game, I saw many bad reviews. I thought about buying it, but left it alone when I saw a review video of the game a while back. I got really bored today, and was like, ""Are there any discounted games that are good?"", and thought of this game again. This time, I just looked at the reviews, all positives, and it looked much better. I yolo'd it and got this game. I messed around with the options, than hopped onto an ""Easy"" game. I was having trouble, not very much fun. Than I went on to a Prehistoric server, kinda hard at first. Than I started getting better after 10 minutes. I started having a lot of fun. This is a GREAT game, considering is only 99c. 11/10, would T-Rex again.			"

												Short Review:Improved since Orion Horde, but largely remains to be seen. There's still plenty of room for improvement.Full Review:- GameplayThe game concept is simple. For campaign, you have to survive a group of invading dinosaurs that will only invade you after you start your first generator and after which, you have to drive/walk/fly a long distance to activate your inappropriately-marked second base. The ""Capturing Base"" message only appeared after I was some distance away from move the marker and the base itself.For survival, it's self-explanatory. For PvP, it's self-explanatory. For sudden death, it's self-explanatory (if you've played other games that have this). Every other mode other than campaign revolves around these 3 modes, only difference lies in whether it's a team or one man army or which weapons you get to use.- Changes in GameplayThe last time I played this game was close to a year ago. I played only Singleplayer and gameplay was at best average. You go around capturing bases, shooting dinosaurs, and perhaps exploiting the map to your advantage. Everything else was left to yourself. There are 3 markers indicating where to get weapons, skills and vehicles. That was about it. Even after the transition from Orion Horde to Prelude, I found it rather boring. Along with a non-existent support team, I decided to abandon the game.Many months later, I saw their latest video advertisement showcasing ""how much their game has improved"". Reluctantly, I decided to give it a try. (To my surprise,) they had actually improved on Singleplayer mode. You no longer fight alone and have four (relatively dumb) teammates which will help you when you go down, without desperately trying to get a last wind. Campaign-wise, I haven't managed to get pass the first few bases because the AI wouldn't follow and I ended up getting plummeted by two triceratops. That wasn't fun (to die and lose), but nonetheless interesting.- Graphics/Visual AppealDespite the ""massive overhaul"" from Orion Horde to Prelude, there was not much change in the menu layout and character design. Pretty much every customisation requires you to buy for real money (or earned by unlocking numerous achievements), and the graphics are rather dated (pixelated with its bad geometrical shapes). The only thing that impressed me was the main menu background and that's about it.In the game itself the developers have noticeably added the weather effect. Your screen will occasionally blur due to the snow and there is a consistent (but annoying) white border around your screen because of snow blowing on your face (at least that's what I interpreted it as). The added weather effects are appreciated and helps you to ""focus"" on the game. However, other than that first glance, every other models such as the vehicles, weapons, et cetera are pretty much mediocre. The text do not scale well with the resolution and exceeds the screen (so the skill name and description is cut off for me) and the border between the background and the text is not consistent. Skill icons are also exactly the same as when the game costed USD15.00 before the overhaul to Prelude, which would have been fine if the icon were not extremely visually unappealing. Think of the icons as having secondary school or fresh college students (not graduates) drawing them. It's not simple enough to be ""simple"" or complex enough to be ""complex"". It's just... Well, the trailers don't show you the skill icons, do they?- Bugs (?)There are some noticeable features that I can't really describe it as bug or glitch or whatsoever, because I have no idea if they were meant to be a feature or a bug. For example, you are able to buy the same skill as many times as you want, so long you have the credits from killing dinosaurs. I have no idea whether buying the same skill again have any upgrades (because the skill description remains exactly the same and there is no indication of current level) or it's just bugged and wasting my credits (because even the skill icon colour, everything else remains the same). Sometimes I am also spawned way, way, too far away from the base when I just started the campaign and have to activate the generator to start the game. Again, I have no idea whether being spawned 400 metres away from your main and first base is a feature or a bug.- VerdictBy now, you'd probably wonder why the hell am I recommending this game after such negative experience and I have only 3 hours on record. I'd say the game is actually worth that $1.00 if you have friends to play with. It's fun for a while, and you could probably find some easter eggs here and there and explore the terrain. The terrain is rather big, but there's no sandbox option for me to explore so I can't rate the maps very accurately and I'll leave it out from the gameplay part. After all, with dumb AI, you can't do much (albeit more than without AI). However, if you got no friends who will play this with you (or can't seem to find one) and/or the game reverts to its original Orion Horde price of USD15.00, I'd say skip it. It's seriously not fun playing alone. I would have given this a mixed review if possible, or else a bad review. But for its price, it's hard to argue.			"

												Vastly improved since release, originally titled ORION: Dino Beatdown. Don't let the Metacritic score fool you, this game is now a shadow of it's former terrible self. The constant updates and bugfixes have transformed this game from being a very bland and broken basic shooter, to a very fun co-op survival game. The amount of equipment, customization, and vehicles; combined with many months of simplifing the games UI, game mechanics, and constant bug fixes make the entire package a very fun way to play.The sheer scale of battles, and the fast-paced combat make it fun. If you get a bunch of friends in on it, you'll be coordinating air strikes, tank movement, and infantry battles all in one wave. It's really something just to see two VTOL's fly above you and reign down missle fire, as two tanks flank from both sides... with troops pouring from either side, engaging a T-Rex which is more then enough to take out everything around it.The AI has been vastly improved, as well. When the game first came out, you would have raptors blindly rush you in a straight line... and pterodactyls swooping in predictiable patterns. Now, the enemies juke and run around, the pterodactyls are hard to shoot and become the bane of any VTOL pilot. Granted, don't expect any amazing AI here, it's still a horde game and horde AI still crowns... but the game is challanging, even if you have the credits and augments to last. Underestimate a triceritops, and it'll destroy your tank in two hits with its charge attack.In fact, the best way to describe the feeling while playing this game is like living the movie 'Avatar', but instead of Navi... you have face-ripping dinosaurs.The game has vastly improved on bug fixes, graphics, and optimization since it came out, as well. No longer do you have memory leaks crashing your game, or textures failing to load. No longer does the game lag on high-end systems, and the graphics looking akin to a grainy mess on your screen, hidden by lens flare. The style, while still basic, has been vastly improved; comparable to the style of Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon. Lots of high bloom space colors, lasers, and heavy weaponary... with vechicles that look as much retro as they do futuristic; this game feels right at home... combining a 'Rad' vibe, high-tech space, and a cheesy 'B' movie feeling. The environments are lush, and the maps are large and immersive. A day-time/night-time cycle affects your visibilty and shifts your gameplay. For example, while playing on a tundra map the cold air at night will cause your visor to freeze if you stay outside in the dark for too long, requiring you to find someplace warm. Rainstorms and snowstorms can also hamper your vision, giving the dinos a leg up to ambushes.The games three classes (assault, support, and infiltrator) have gotten a major upgrade since launch. No longer is the medic gun useless on the support toon... and no longer does the assault dominate maps. The classes seem very balanced, having their own weapons and play styles. An augment system is also in place, which allows you to purchase in-game upgrades with in-game credits you earn per round... allowing you to gain class specific upgrades like double jetpack energy for the assault, or that the support's medic gun can heal structures and vechicles. Later augments will even allow you to purchase and use other class specific weapons, like being a ""boost-sniper"" assault... or being a cloaked minigun assassin; as well as having the ability to canabalize raptors for health, earn more credits, or even cause the enemy who kills you to die as well. However, augments arn't permanent... and during rounds you have a finite amount of lives. Not only does dying during a wave cost you a life, but you loose all your augments that you've purchased; giving a larger penalty to death then most games do.This game has the standard assortament of game modes like deathmatch, team deathmatch, king of the hill; along with having duel modes for both 1v1 and team. The standard horde mode exists as well, called 'survival'... but the meat and potatoes of this game is in it's conquest system, which will allow you to experience those large battles that you see on the screenshots. Players have to fight through waves of enemies, generating credits and protecting their power generator, then use those credits for upgrade, equipment, and vehicles. There's also a 'Rampage' mode that allows humans versus human dinosaurs... so you can live your dream of being a T-Rex and eating people.The game also features an in-game store with microtransactions, using Spiral Coins:1,000 Coins - $1.006,000 Coins - $5.0013,000 Coins - $10.0075,000 Coins - $50.00Thankfully, this store is PURELY cosmetic with most items costing $1 dollar. No xp boosts, or in-game upgrades... the most you can purchase are hats and skins for your marine or dino. At most, I can see just spending a max of 6,000 coins to get a character the way you want him to look, unless you want to go deeper with customization.The game also has persistant stat tracking and a levelling system, however the system is very static... only unlocking set upgrades per each level.The few things I can say bad about this game is that the maps and waves in conquest mode still seem too large. Gathering your entire army to move from base A to base B after you've spent 10 waves defending base A really doesn't make you feel like that base is 'yours'. Also, some weapons are more overpowered than others; and some items aren't that useful to invest your time into (IMHO, the flame turret). On top of that, dinos tend to 'pop in' if they're too far away... making a hunt for a large dino that you can idenifty close by a bit harder to locate. Also, the populations for game modes seem to be a bit low in my taste, with conquest allowing up to 5 people per server. Other modes have different population caps, but overall it feels small. The menu UI structure also is a bit hard to get used to... with the whole menu UI coming off a bit cheap. Granted, the old menu system from two years ago was DREADFUL, and this is an improvement... it's still not up to par with most games.However, these are nitpicks for a game that really has been risen from the ashes of it's former self. The developers are very active in the games future, and this game does have the love and dedication of a passion project come to life. There's constant free updates to this game, and new features being added all the time; as well as having the team be very approchable with ideas and suggestions. With the changes I've seen with the past two years... and (at the time of writing) a new version of the game in development which will expand on this game, allowing for new features... including a persistant open-world game mode, ala Planetside 2... I can safely say that this game has a bright future.If you had met me two years ago and asked about this game, I would have told you to never play it... to stear clear, and forget about it... If you had bought it, to try and ask for a refund.Nowadays, I'd be asking if you wanna buddy up and kill some dino's in a APC. It's improved that much, and I'd be MORE than willing to give it a recommendation. It's cheap, it's fun, it's OOZING with Sci-Fi goodness, and there arn't many games out there like it.			"

												I admit that I didn't even know why Orion: Prelude was in my steam library and couldn't even remember how I aquired the game. Assuming it was a compulsion perchase, I angerly installed it so as to get at least a little time out of one of the many regretful purchases in my library. Twenty minutes later the only thing that was real was the jungle, pitch black in the midst of a typhoon. The only light to see by were the bolts of lightning in the sky and the fire that spread accross the countryside. I'm standing on a hill fending off a living tide of velociraptors. My LMG running dry as a T-Rex charges, up my right flank. As I'm about to be eaten, my team mate broadsides the T-Rex with the APC, killing it. two of my teammates jump out of the back and start engaging the next wave, led by a prehistoric giant crocodile. I equip my shotgun and lept back into the fray.Orion: Prelude is super fun and has some solid mechanics. It is fortunate that the action packed dinostorm never stops because there are some issues. One of the most glaring issues is that the high paced action can immediatly screech to a halt if you die. Depending on the scenario you may be able to only spawn at the begining of the round. There is no telling how long a round can be as there could be as few as 30 dinosaurs to as many as 300, and the earlier you die the longer you will wait. This applies to joining games as well and you can only drop in at the begining of rounds. The objective kept switching every round also, which was confusing. There is only one level with varying weather conditions, the graphics are♥♥♥♥♥♥ the sound is♥♥♥♥♥♥ nothing is clearly labled or explained, the default button mapping for the controller is unintuitive but the game is always on multiplayer so pausing to fix it is suboptimal but exiting the game to deal with it is even worse because you'll have to wait five minutes to get back into the game. on and on I could go with issues.But in spite of a lot of glaring issues the game rocks. For doing a lot of things wrong it does a lot right. Again the shooter mechanics are solid but need to be polished. the game prevents being overwhelming by having shooting dinosaurs be the central focus and you'll be doing that from the word ""go."" upgrading yourself is easy once you try it the first time and it doesn't take long to get a loadout that works for you. Once you actually do change the controller mapping the gameplay will feel like putting on a glove. As it tuned out I had been given the game as a gift by one of my friends that bought a 4-pack and never picked it up. At the end of the day, the game needs work but is still wildly entertaining especially for its price.			"

												To be honest, the game is far from being perfect. The animations are bad, the bots are dumb and for the first hour in game, you don't really know what's happening.BUT the overall concept is really, really cool. It's just like some guys were sitting together over some beer and then someone said: ""I'd really like to play a game right now, where I can punch some T-Rex on his nose!"" And then the second guy said: ""Yeah, and where I can fly a jetpack while shooting rockets!"" And the third guy just shouted ""LIGHTSABRES!"". Then they finished their beer and started working. For all of us. Because we all secretly wanted this game.   Even though the result doesn't look as great as they probably hoped, the game works. And goddammit it's so much fun. Buy it. And buy it for your friends too, so you can punch T-Rexes and run over raptors in beach buggies together. It costs less than a beer.			"

												ORION: Prelude is a FPS that, at first sight, reminds one of Halo. It is class-based, with each class leveling up separately. Classes only dictate the special ability your character has, and you can switch them at any time between games. Assault has a jetpack, Recon can jump higher and has cloaking abilities, Support can heal and revive easier. You can further customize your experience by buying weapons in the match (there are some two-three dozen weapons) with credits earned from killing dinosaurs, and leveling up a certain class allows you to set some of those as starting weapons, removing the need to buy them. The weapons are pretty diverse; pistols, SMGs, different kinds of assault rifles, snipers, shotguns, there's even a lightsaber and a plasma bow. You can also use up your credits to buy Perks, improving your ability to fly (increase duration, speed, cut fuel recovery time in half etc.), walk faster, even give you lifesteal. There is also an abundance of game modes, around 7 if I recall correctly, and a variety of maps.Pros:+statisfying graphics with a range of weather effects+a lot of drastically different, big maps+vehicles and mechs+sound+a vast number of weapons+nicely done perks+a good number of achievements+a lightsaber-only free-for-all+the dev team actually listens to its fans+really worth it for 0.99€Cons:-the classes kinda lack balance (in Survival, Assault is the only class worth using)-in need of a good tutorial-prone to exploits (set the Prehistoric difficulty to the max, so you get the most XP, pick Assault and fly on a rock, it's enough that you kill 4-5 dinosaurs and die to get insta level 15)All in all, the game isn't perfect, but it's a lot of fun. If you intend on buying it, get a 4-pack and gift it to your friends and then play together. For 0.99€, I'd recommend this game to anyone.			"

												Don't let the metascore fool you. It may not be a very well-known game but I absolutely love this game for its bare qualities. A shooter that mixes marines, futuristic guns with dinosaurs? Jetpacks, medi-guns, stealthing, and ♥♥♥♥♥in' weapons? Not to mention some pretty fun vehicles. I got this game for a dollar on the Steam sale. I would happily had paid the full 15 dollars since I have over 30 hours so far on this game.Great to play solo, with strangers, and DEFINITELY with friends! Create your own lobby easily and play with friends. If only I had friends.Each game you earn credits for kills and you spend said credits on weapons and perks for the current game. You also earn experience as you play with the classes and you earn passive perks (and can even unlock weapons to start out with instead of just a boring pistol) or unlock perks that you normally would buy. Saves you some credits.More people need to buy this game and give Orion a GOOD name. I know Orion: Dino Beatdown had a sullied name for what the developers did and the bad metascore, but since its release it has been updated lots and is now a very fun game! And in NO WAY are any of the additional fees required. If you WANT new armors or a new blade color, go ahead and spend 5 or 10 extra dollars. I spent an extra 10 and bought a new blade color, TWO new armor colors (applies to your weapon too) AND a taunt pack for only 5 dollars.			"

												First of all I have to say.... I love this game! Not just for the dinosaurs(which honestly was the main thing that pulled me toward it), but for.... well, all of it! Apart from a few glitches and bugs here and there, it's not that bad. There's lovely areas for you to explore as you fight off the hordes of dinos, with nice music to help with immersion. Also, I really like the credit system that allows you to buy character upgrades, weapons, items and more. It's also fairly easy to pick up and play as it didn't take me long before I was doing well(and I usually take quite a while to pick up stuff in games X3).So if you can ignore the small amount of glitches and such, and you love dinos and/or FPSs, then I reccommend this to be added to your library.

												This game can't be compared to Dino Beatdown. Yes! It's created by the same developer, but once you play ORION: Dino Horde you'll get to see that Spiral Game Studios really took the negative reviews directly to the chin and practiced what the community demanded from Dino Beatdown - Put that into consideration. Also people that purchased Dino Beatdown received this game for free.More and more free content has been added to this game, so it's pretty clear that Spiral Game Studios is working on it.So how's this game? Well first off you need some people you can rely on playing with, I mean proper teammates. They should be able to revive you when you're incapacitated.  Since there are big dinosaurs  you'll trying to avoid them with your jetpack and you'll freak out for a moment since you don't know whether the Spinosaurus or Tyrannosaurus Rex can reach you or not when you're in the air!If Spiral Game Studio is reading this - Please consider supporting Steam Workshop!Peace.

												I got this game out of the blue thanks to the steam sale. And if it wasn't for that I wouldn't of found it. This game is awesome period, its player movements are nice and smooth and the dinosaurs give the game a different feel. The weapons are great and nicely balanced so far. If this game goes on sale again I recommend buying it. Its a rather fun game to play.			"

												This is a very silly game, for very silly people.All of this is in my opinion, keep in mind.Graphics: LovelyFun to be had: LotsPunching of the dino faces: Rediculously funI've had one game crash when I joined the server so far, so keep in mind this could be a problem, but you can easily host your own public (Or friends-only) server in-game without third party software or paying, which is a plus in my book.It's £1, buy it, do it now (This only applies to the sale this review was written on, and possibly any future sales), although, for the full price of £12, I would find it a bit hard to recommend, but something to keep your eye on.

												This game is awesome. the .99 cents you pay is worth it, because you get a fast paced gun game with Dinosaurs. If you want to fork out more cash you can buy special custom looks for your character. Great maps and the graphic style is like that of borderlands. This game is a 8 out of 10 for me.			"

												This game is hilariously fun with a group of friends. Playing on survival mode and blasting wave after wave of dinosaurs is pure gold. Ignore any older reviews (2012, 2013), they are for a different (and much crappier) version of this game. This new version is much improved, with a ton of game modes and weapon upgrades. The graphics and UI are still a bit rough around the edges, but the gameplay more than make up for it.			"

												I ""played"" this game for twenty minutes before I had enough.Five minutes were spent in a solo game to test out graphics settings. Noticed the AI was pretty terrible, but I figured it was just easy because It was only the second wave. Anyways I didn't want to make any judgements about it until I tried out the multiplayer.So I navigated through the buggy menu for fifteen minutes. I tried to join multiple different servers. I restarted the game several times trying to get it to work, and I could not join a single game. It's really frustrating to have to give a game a negative review because I legitimately could not access the multiplayer (Which is the only draw to the game in this case) Rather than on the merits of the gameplay itself.I could have probably had a better time smoking cat hair out of the dollar I spent on the game.Still better than Infestation Survivor stories.

												TL;DR: It's fun, frequently updated and generally enjoyable, especially when played with friends. Wait for it to go on sale though, because the gameplay isn't worth the full price.I was a bit scared when I picked up this title because of all the bad reviews it was receiving, stating that ORION: Dino Horde was one of the worst games ever made.After I watched a rather hilarious german gameplay video, and the game was on sale for less than 2€, I finally decided to get this game.First of all, we've got to set the record straight: ORION: Dino Horde IS NOT the same game as ORION: Dino Beatdown. This should be a no-brainer, but unfortunately many people will still post bad reviews mistaking the previous Dino Beatdown for Dino Horde.Dino Horde is a mutiplayer action game in which you have to kill off waves of dinosaurs and defend buildings. Between those waves, you're able to upgrade your loadout and perks by spending money which is earned in a TD-like fashion by killing enemies. The general concept is rather simple as is the gameplay. When fighting on foot, the gameplay consists of rather monotonous gunplay. Because the dinosaurs are generally faster than the player, movement and celever positioning don't really play a role in fighting. The only real variation lies in the different enemy types of which some require different strategies to kill. The game also includes vehicles and vehicle combat, which is a pleasant relief.The graphics are rather good considering this game is a low budget production, but the map design can be monotonous from time to time.The strengths of the game lie within the co-op aspect and the frequently updated content. Since the launch of the title, the developers have included multiple new game modes, some of which deliver a rock-solid co-op experience, as well as other additional content.This game isn't the next big multiplayer co-op shooter, but it definitely has it's moments and is generally enjoyable, especially when played with friends. The price of 13.99€ isn't worth the experience though. If this game goes on sale anytime soon, you might want to pick it up for some hours of multiplayer fun.			"

												First things first, that metacritic score is BS. That score was given way back when before the game was reworked and re released. I bought it for a $1 during the re-release and honestly i would of paid $30 for it. The survival mode is my favorite mode, infact i havent really played many of the other modes at all, but survival is endless fun. Favorite thing about the game is the avatar esque ships you can fly in survivor or the mech warrior war suit, or maybe even the tank. I play assault so i have a jetpack because if i didnt the massive trex would rip me out of the map and chomp me in half. He still chomps me sometimes while i try to jetpack away and he chomps rocks to throw at you if you try to land on a cliff and shoot from safety. Gameplay 9/10 audio 8/10  overall experience with the game is an astounding 10/10.     As we all know games get old after enough play but seriously this game is more than worth it and its epicness is unmatched by many other games with much higher price tags. Also its in no way pay to play you cant spend any money to get better, you can only just play which makes this game better than all those silly microtransaction games.       One thing i want metacritic to do is to review this game again and give it the 90 or 95/100 it deserves. BUY IT NOW!!!!			"

												Do you want fun? This is funny. You can laugh with or at it. The game lack a story? Narrate a creative one while you play at a random server or with your friends. At first glance the game may look stupid, but even though a second look reveals the same opinion, this is still worth playing. I wish there to be more friendly and helpful players, so the community can grow lively and strong.Edit: Do I like this game? Yes, I do. I do really enjoy playing it. Is this game bad? Yes, it ♥♥♥♥ing is. I laugh at the poorly opmized game with clunky gameplay. But I do wish it was good and well made, with more time dedicated to it. But the developer left it to rot and went on another project that is an even worst cluster♥♥♥♥. I wanted this game to be something I could give to my friends and enjoy with them. But it is buggy and most of the fun comes from laughing at the game and not with it.I still recomend it though. Even more now that it is free to play. Hope one day it will be open source and the players will be able to directly contribute to good development of this great concept and visionary idea for a game.			"

This game is simply fun, if you're looking deeper into this gane welp, then you're not even trying to have fun. It's simple, it's fun and enjoyable and a good game overall.

												This game is hilariously fun with a group of friends. Playing on survival mode and blasting wave after wave of dinosaurs is pure gold. Ignore any older reviews (2012, 2013), they are for a different (and much crappier) version of this game. This new version is much improved, with a ton of game modes and weapon upgrades. The graphics and UI are still a bit rough around the edges, but the gameplay more than make up for it.			"

I see it as a mix of casual and action because its not too far on either side of the scale. I love this game and although everyone sais there are a lot of bugs, the only thing i found bugged was i got disconnected to the internet everytime i opened the game. this meant i couldn't play online with friends. although that sucks, i still had a lot of fun playing and for a dollar, i say it's a great game. Heck i like it so much, I would have payed $15 for it. Maybe more. So i definately recommend it. Pick it up as soon as possible!			"

												Summary: This game is WELL worth the $0.99 it is selling for now. Gameplay is enjoyable, and the the overall graphics top it off.8/10 Would knife a t-rex mid air again.I bought this game for $0.99 when it went on sale as a game sold regularly at $12.99. This game by far was not worth $12.99. I didn't even consider it worth $4.99. The gameplay is nice, but very repetitive. Playing with friends is by far the most enjoyable way to play, but to fully play a match through, you have to play for a few hours non-stop. Point shoot point shoot point shoot. The graphics make up for how little thinking is involved at times, and I'm not saying that you don't have to think strategy sometimes, just not most times. Out numbered yes, using your cloak to get past groups or larger dinosaurs is very enjoyable, but sitting at base sitting and spawn killing dinosaurs with a minigun, it gets boring.Another problem with the game is how the pvp matches seem out of place. Not only do some of the maps have cartoon-like graphics, but the pvp system is so screwed up that it isn't enjoyable to play on those servers. All you see in those servers is people spam clicking with their sword until the other person dies or they die.Overall the game I could have seen going for $2.99 and being well worth the money. Now that it is set at $1.00, I see it maybe getting more of a playerbase.			"

												The game is definatly worth the dollar game wise, but when you do play, if you find a good game, prepare to never leave becuase it is seemingly impossible to get a game with actual people in it. I'm either getting disconnected while I'm connecting or i'll loose connection to host, and every other server is full so theres nothing else to do but stare at your screen. Then i thought, hey i'll just start a server! nope. Sat there for a good while waiting for people and nobody joined.TL;DRGood game with bad matchmaking.

												It's  stupid, all the assets look and feel like they were ripped straight from planetside 2, and playing alone is boring as♥♥♥♥♥♥after a few minutes.But I will be damned if this game isn't a party with friends. When it's on sale for $.50 you can round up a group of bored people and have a great night. This game isn't something you play to be good and competitive or to challenge yourself, you play this to have a stupid, wonderful time with other people, and it excels at being just that.			"

												Glitchy, unoptimized, garbage. If you enjoy generic tower-defence games and have a computer strong enough to run the terrable graphics, go ahead. The only reason it's worth it is because it's 99 cents. If it were 5 dollars I'd say it's not worth.			"

												ok its food for the first 4 hours then you start to realize that it is way too damn easy. that makes it bad. the controls for the vehicles are annoying, i mean who does the borderlands controls like they suck... i want to press ""a"" or ""d"" to turn not move my mouse... the game really does suck♥♥♥♥♥though. though it is fun if you like that kind of game.now i will say it is fun, i will say it is intresting, i will say it is worth the buck you pay for it, and i will say that if you have enough cards to sell, sell them and get this game. its bad but not for the price and the enjoyment you can get out of it. will i play it again?yeah at some pointis it worth my money?yeah it is... it's only a buck.is it worth playing?depends how bad are you at Modern Warfare... this game is fun it is easy but hard at the same time, while i can survive multiple rounds (like 15) in Modern Warfare's servival mode, i only survive at most 5 in this game. but the shear size of the waves is rediculous. they get hard fast... but well sitting ontop of a rock and snipting the heck out of a few hundred dino's with a 75% acuracy rate... is rediculous. heck i think i am about 80 or 90 witht the top tier sniper... that isn't that hard to get. i can bearly hit the broad side of a barn in modern warfare when i snipe, yet along headshots are rare. in this game... you can pick up the sniper and head shot alot of dinos verry easilly. there are times you will run out of ammo before you miss a shot. large targets i guess...lets now talk vehicles... they suck. getting them sucks even worse and well when you have to use an emp to access them... that is bad. intresting but bad.i'm getting a little ranty so let me say the bottom line.SHOULD YOU BUY THIS GAME?Yeah. you should. play if for 4 hours then realize it isn't much of a challenge. yes it is fun, and i would recomend this if you have a buck to spare.

★★★✮☆Price, so cheap you can't go wrong , but there is a store for customisation. ★★★★★Game play, not the best game ever but if you want to spend some time with friends killing dinosaurs, is ok ★★★★☆Replayability, there is no campaign but an endless online matches, for now there are many playing for the sales, but I don't know if the game is death ★★★☆☆Graphics, not the best however not to bad ★★★☆☆Art design and game , simple as water, nothing spectacular, but not horrible ★★★☆☆			"

												I was watching the steam page and I waited for this amazing game to come on sale. It was a dollar so i had a choice watch a porn video on Barzzzars for one dollar or get this amazing game, i made the best choice of my sad and uneventful life, i got this game! I was thinking to my self i may have down's but i got a smashing deal! Opening this game to the menu was amaizing the meu was so well made it was almost as good as the ET game from the 1900's hell this menu was so good i unzipped my pants and started to beat my dino to it. after 2 hours of trying to get in a game with my gay lovers we were in, the graphics were amazing they looked like someone ♥♥♥♥ed on a wall and added in color, then i noticed the best part of this game, the dino's looked and moved like they were mentally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and it made me feel accepted in this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ covered world. This game also ran amazing it ran better than bf4 and had much graphics i was getting 2 fps on low! As playing as a dino i realized wtf am i doing, as i write this i pounder killing myself because i spent 1 dollar on this game when i could have been watching cp, this game should get an 11/5 game of the ♥♥♥♥ing century.    Thanks Sprial Games for putting oon alt-jay and ♥♥♥♥ing me till my♥♥♥♥♥is no exitxtant.			"

												Thumbs way-up.The most fun I have had playing a FPS in a while.  It reminds me of early Quake LAN parties, constant gibs, and non-stop action.  There are several different ways you can play (survival, FFA, conquest, etc),  lots of weapons, vehicles, various difficulty levels, etc.  So far, I have only played one class - 3 to choose from.  Don't forget, you can play dino classes!  Favorite vehicle so far:  two passenger assault vehicle with rear mounted machine gun.  You can ram/crush hearding dinos, but bosses toss vehicle and crew into the air.This game is not thought provoking, deep, and will not solve any of the worlds problems.  It is entertainment.  There are games for solving puzzles, this is not one of them.  Low metascore, but hey, it's easy to be a critic.  You can stare at the idiot box, or you can roast some Raptors!  When was the last time you had this much fun for $0.99?  Keyboard finger cramps included at no extra charge!  Buy it.  If you play for more than 5 minutes (and you will) it is worth it.			"

												In all honesty, I am incredibly hard to hook as far as video games are concerned. There are plenty of games that I will play once, but for me to enjoy any kind of longevity with a single title is rare indeed. I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this will be one of the few awesome games I end up spending a whole lot of awesome time with. Crazy awesome dino A.I., powerful weapons, an addictive counter-strikeesque upgrade system, 5 player co-op, vehicles crazier than anything you've seen in Halo. And that's just one game type! This is an awesome game for awesome people. Any one who can remember being a child watching jurassic park and having halo welcome you into adolescence will absolutely adore this game.			"

												The game cost $0.99. Its far from perfect. It needs a lot of optimization from the devs. It should probably have a brief tutorial. This game is not finished. Hopefully everyone buying this game and contemplating buying this game, realizes this. However, this is probably the funnest game I've played in a very long time. Its super easy to pick up and hard to put down. Its crazy and zany. Plenty of weapons to choose from and will cover any kind of gameplay whether you snipe, melee, rockets, energy weapons, machine guns, SMGs, pistols, revolvers, bow and arrow with multiple arrow choices, and yes even a light saber thingy that sound like a lightsaber when swung. Then theres the leveling progression. Leveling is pretty quick. I played for a few hours and got to level 15 and I'm not even that good. You get rewards for leveling up that you dont have to pay for like you would in other games. Costume customizations and weapon skins and perks just for playing. Yes they have a store to buy extras from but its accessories that only affect your look and style, not the gameplay.The dinosaur models are great, the levels look great but still need some fine tuning and every now and then you'll hit an invisible wall or lip in the ground. The vehicles arent especially fluid and feel kinda awkward. There are also more servers with pings in the 280+ range than not, so if you already suffer from a slow internet connection you may want to wait till they can fix this. Theres half finished games on Steam for $10+ that dont even come close to this. Seriously, its a dollar and a 4 pack is only $3. BTW most of us probably have $1 sitting around as change in the couch cusions or the car or on top of the washing machine. Bottom line: This will be the best dollar you spend. So happy I decided to take the gamble. "

												As a jurrasic park survivor, it's really touching to get the oppurtunity to get back at those pesky dinos for almost klling me and my family. For any one like me who had to go through that tragic events of jurrasic park it is a must have.			"

												Dino Horde. I really think this game is great. Fast paced, balanced achivement/ credit earning (changes based on difficulty setting)   Really helps to play as a team, and feel free to guide new players in to helping the team's overall progress. I can't wait to see what the future holds for this game. Very replayable in the current release. I would value this game around 15 - 20 USD all day long. I am having trouble browsing/finding game matches/ servers. Usually about 10-15 come up, but I have trouble connecting to most of them. Often time I find myself in a Lobby, and It appears the host is AFK.  Would also love to see projectile/paths added.Other than that is very fun. Give it a try!!			"

												Running through the cannons shooting up a Raptor when all of a sudden a massive T-rex rears its ugly head from around the corner. I can see it staring deep into my eyes, I watch on as this massive beasts picks up a boulder with its jaws and throws it at me, I had no choice but to take it to the Knee like a real man, I was down. I watch on as the beast walks over to me, fear in my eyes, hate in his. He leans down, smells me then stands on my head. R.I.P10/10 Will play again, <3			"

												It's kinda like Halo2 and the oiginal Turok decided to go out for drinks, ended up getting smashed and got hoard mode confused with ♥♥♥♥♥...ooops we got a baby!It's not a hardcore fps, take it serious kinda game. For just messing about, having some fun shooting dinosaurs and flying away to safe ground with the jet pack (and who dosen't like shooting dinosaurs or jetpacks) its perfect. The gameplay is great (once you figure out what the hell you are ment to be doing....there is no tutorial), maps are pretty big, dinos are plentiful, graphics are ok too, guns are fun. For 59p you can't really go wrong! Although i now know what the guy in the toilet felt like with a T-Rex about to eat him in Jurassic Park!8/10 Would get♥♥♥♥♥♥out by a T-rex Again! "

												This game has come SUCH a long way. In fact, I don't remember the last time a bad game was patched into a good one.First off, this game is not perfect. There are still a few bugs and glitches here and there that occasionally mess with the game, but nothing gamebreaking from what I've seen. Mostly minor things that can easily be patched, and from the consistent support that the developers are providing for the game I suspect they quickly will be.That said, THIS GAME IS SERIOUS FREAKING FUN. Seriously, kudos to everyone who worked and continues to work on this game.It's nice to see a developer take enough pride in their game to maintain it and keep improving.The dinosaurs are vicious, there's a nice spread of weapons to use, and teamwork is actually a legitimate factor in this game (unlike a lot of popular FPS games in the market now). I can't remember the last game that let me jetpack around a hulking T-Rex to headshot it with my bow. Pure awesome.The community is nice and helpful for the most part and there's always a variety of servers online with plenty of people playing.The game is definitely still a bit rough, but, considering the mess that it was during release, I have high hopes that this game is just going to keep getting better as more updates come along.

More dinosaurs.This deserves game of the year, every year, until I die. I am an avid preacher of ORION Prelude. It is my favourite game. And its all offered at such a beautifully low price. There is Co-Op, Competitive, Survival, first person perspective and third person perspective. Everything about it is perfect.			"

												I am fully encouraged to recommend this game!...... to anyone looking for a horrific gaming experience & the sexual assault of your wallet (If the game is not on sale for a price that can be considered ""expendable"").Gifted to me by a friend during the 99p sale, we were treated to a game with horrible animations, unusual keybindings, not one single form of tutorial, and horrific sound issues where footsteps reign louder than gunshots & death of a player treats all player to a painfully loud slo-mo sequence. And after all of the updates this game has received since it's crtically panned release, it's INEXCUSEABLE that the developer has left these issues completely neglected. I'd speak about how starved of strategy the gameplay is, but I've not been capable to play this trainwreck enough to provide proper judgement. Unbelievably, me & my friends had a lot of fun suffering at the hand of this game's poor design, but it was short lived.In general, this is a game that is poorly designed across the board, and whose issues most core to the game have been completely ignored in favour of expanding the game experience.You will laugh, you will anger, you will cry. Whatever the case, fully recommended to those seeking to see a video game at it's worst (when ON SALE). Otherwise, SAVE YOUR MONEY & STAY AWAY!!			"

												I bought this game for pennies, way back when it was a pile of junk. I was amazed when I logged in a few months ago and it looked completely redone. Are there strange physics glitches? Occasionally? Are the dinosaurs a little stupid? Absolutely. However, the game is one where you can play the game because its core is good, and you are happy to see the game actually be good, perform well, and have a decent level of graphic fidelity. 7/10 in my book, a real recovery. Just look at the cost and ask yourself, why not? "

Other than Primal Carnage, I don't know of very many dinosaur games that have both options to play as humans and dinosaurs. Also, the graphics, animations, models, textures, and sound effects are extremely awesome! I also really love the weapons in this game, especially the pump-action shotgun, since that's always been my favorite firearm in general. This game is also like a combination of franchises I love, such as Team Fortress 2, Halo, and Jurassic Park, which I definitely think is one of the most kickass combinations of all time! I completely recommend this game for anyone who loves dinosaurs and first-person shooters!			"

You get higher gear for higher difficultie ofc.Gameplay is simple, you can play top down or in third person mode. Some say this is pretty much Destiny clone so expect that kind of game. I dont know myself about it since I havent play Destiny.There is bunch of diffrent Gamemodes, Survival and defend the objective (Harvester)Bunch of diffrent Guardians to choose from, personaly I like pyro(shotgun primary and shotgun is the best :D)Diffrent guardians have diffrent special abilities.Little bit optimization after that game is great!I really enjoyed it, and I suggest you to pick up this if you like shooting dinos, topdown- or third person shooters,co-op games or just grinding and gearing.

												To be honest, this game is bad aesthetically. Its animations are rudimentary at best and the gun animations are out of sync but what do you expect from a game that costs 0.99 freakin' cents?! The gameplay is repetitive but somehow it keeps me playing for a few hours (I just go straight for the mech during the later waves) but again 0.99 freakin' cents! I recommend this game solely because of the price. The game is fun with some friends and you owe it to yourself to try it out. It isn't the best looking game but it is a hell of alot of fun once you get the hang of it.PS: There is microtransactions in the game but only for cosmetic items so if you are one of those people who love buying virtual items using real life money... go ahead nobody is stopping you (or you could buy the items to support the developers ;-) ).

												Awesome Game!Believe it or not this is a great game to invest in if you enjoy first person shooter, or shooter games. I know the price of the game is a bit misleading on its value, but I assure you its more then worth it. There are many difficulties in this game, and you can earn your achievements pretty easy on all difficulties. I generally only play Survival as I am more of a co-op type person then PVP. In survival mode you basically have to defend you the generator from the on coming Dinosaurs mobs. As you get kills or team mates get kills you earn credits & experience. The credits can be used to buy better weapons, upgrades, mods, etc at the end of each level. Out of the three classes I enjoy playing assault the most, and I like the special skill of assault which is a jetpack that allows you to get on top of rocks & other places to get away from harms way.What do you have to loose? Its only $0.99 & if you like it awesome, if not get a refund?			"

												Though this game may not have cutting edge graphics, the best voiceovers and some dodgy controls here and there. It is a beautiful piece of work that has adapted greatly from it's release. This game is proof that if you work hard at a game, it will come out great. The Dev team could of left it how it was. A heaping mess. But they looked at their mistakes and improved on them. Making one of the greatest PvD game i've seen. You can play solo, solo with bots, or with friends and either one it is great fun. All for a super cheap price of $1/79p. It's worth way more then that. Best part is that there is not a single pay to win feature on this game. No ""$10 for 10000cr"" I highly recommend this game to anybody that loves shooters and/or dinosaurs.			"

												Fettuccine Alfredo began as regular fettuccine al burro until the Roman restaurateur Alfredo di Lelio enriched it with a double and a triple dose of butter for his pregnant wife, who could not keep anything down. The dish was so delicious he kept it on the menu of his restaurant, Alfredo all Scrofa, in Rome. Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks had it during their 1920 honeymoon trip to Rome, loved it, brought the recipe back, and served it to their friends when they returned to Hollywood. And so another Italian came to America. Fettuccine Alfredo has most certainly been eaten more in the States than in Italy since then. The dish is used as the base for many different versions, topped with shrimp, broccoli, asparagus, and more. Since butter separated readily when heated, cream is added to make the sauce creamier. In this version, I also add a few leaves of sage, since sage and butter are a marriage made in heaven.   Ingredients 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for pasta pot1 pound dried fettuccine2 cups heavy cream, or half-and-half4 tablespoons unsalted butter10 fresh sage leaves½ cup grated Grana Padano, (or Parmigiano-Reggiano)Directions Bring a large pot of salted water to boil for pasta. When you are ready to begin the sauce, slip the fettuccine into the water. Combine the cream, 1 cup pasta cooking water, the butter, sage, and half of the grated cheese in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir to melt the butter and bring just a simmer. Let simmer lightly for a minute or two, so the cream infuses the sage leaves. When the fettuccine is al dente, transfer it directly to the skillet with the simmering sauce. Season with the salt and return to a simmer. Simmer, tossing with the tongs, just until the sauce begins to coat the pasts, another minute or two. Remove from heat, sprinkle with the remaining grated cheese, and toss. Serve immediately.			"

Other than Primal Carnage, I don't know of very many dinosaur games that have both options to play as humans and dinosaurs. Also, the graphics, animations, models, textures, and sound effects are extremely awesome! I also really love the weapons in this game, especially the pump-action shotgun, since that's always been my favorite firearm in general. This game is also like a combination of franchises I love, such as Team Fortress 2, Halo, and Jurassic Park, which I definitely think is one of the most kickass combinations of all time!

												Short Review:Improved since Orion Horde, but largely remains to be seen. There's still plenty of room for improvement.Full Review:- GameplayThe game concept is simple. For campaign, you have to survive a group of invading dinosaurs that will only invade you after you start your first generator and after which, you have to drive/walk/fly a long distance to activate your inappropriately-marked second base. The ""Capturing Base"" message only appeared after I was some distance away from move the marker and the base itself.For survival, it's self-explanatory. For PvP, it's self-explanatory. For sudden death, it's self-explanatory (if you've played other games that have this). Every other mode other than campaign revolves around these 3 modes, only difference lies in whether it's a team or one man army or which weapons you get to use.- Changes in GameplayThe last time I played this game was close to a year ago. I played only Singleplayer and gameplay was at best average. You go around capturing bases, shooting dinosaurs, and perhaps exploiting the map to your advantage. Everything else was left to yourself. There are 3 markers indicating where to get weapons, skills and vehicles. That was about it. Even after the transition from Orion Horde to Prelude, I found it rather boring. Along with a non-existent support team, I decided to abandon the game.Many months later, I saw their latest video advertisement showcasing ""how much their game has improved"". Reluctantly, I decided to give it a try. (To my surprise,) they had actually improved on Singleplayer mode. You no longer fight alone and have four (relatively dumb) teammates which will help you when you go down, without desperately trying to get a last wind. Campaign-wise, I haven't managed to get pass the first few bases because the AI wouldn't follow and I ended up getting plummeted by two triceratops. That wasn't fun (to die and lose), but nonetheless interesting.- Graphics/Visual AppealDespite the ""massive overhaul"" from Orion Horde to Prelude, there was not much change in the menu layout and character design. Pretty much every customisation requires you to buy for real money (or earned by unlocking numerous achievements), and the graphics are rather dated (pixelated with its bad geometrical shapes). The only thing that impressed me was the main menu background and that's about it.In the game itself the developers have noticeably added the weather effect. Your screen will occasionally blur due to the snow and there is a consistent (but annoying) white border around your screen because of snow blowing on your face (at least that's what I interpreted it as). The added weather effects are appreciated and helps you to ""focus"" on the game. However, other than that first glance, every other models such as the vehicles, weapons, et cetera are pretty much mediocre. The text do not scale well with the resolution and exceeds the screen (so the skill name and description is cut off for me) and the border between the background and the text is not consistent. Skill icons are also exactly the same as when the game costed USD15.00 before the overhaul to Prelude, which would have been fine if the icon were not extremely visually unappealing. Think of the icons as having secondary school or fresh college students (not graduates) drawing them. It's not simple enough to be ""simple"" or complex enough to be ""complex"". It's just... Well, the trailers don't show you the skill icons, do they?- Bugs (?)There are some noticeable features that I can't really describe it as bug or glitch or whatsoever, because I have no idea if they were meant to be a feature or a bug. For example, you are able to buy the same skill as many times as you want, so long you have the credits from killing dinosaurs. I have no idea whether buying the same skill again have any upgrades (because the skill description remains exactly the same and there is no indication of current level) or it's just bugged and wasting my credits (because even the skill icon colour, everything else remains the same). Sometimes I am also spawned way, way, too far away from the base when I just started the campaign and have to activate the generator to start the game. Again, I have no idea whether being spawned 400 metres away from your main and first base is a feature or a bug.- VerdictBy now, you'd probably wonder why the hell am I recommending this game after such negative experience and I have only 3 hours on record. I'd say the game is actually worth that $1.00 if you have friends to play with. It's fun for a while, and you could probably find some easter eggs here and there and explore the terrain. The terrain is rather big, but there's no sandbox option for me to explore so I can't rate the maps very accurately and I'll leave it out from the gameplay part. After all, with dumb AI, you can't do much (albeit more than without AI). However, if you got no friends who will play this with you (or can't seem to find one) and/or the game reverts to its original Orion Horde price of USD15.00, I'd say skip it. It's seriously not fun playing alone. I would have given this a mixed review if possible, or else a bad review. But for its price, it's hard to argue.			"

												Awesome game. Could use some more feedback/news  from the developer. What was that patch that just downloaded? What did it fix? What's new? What's coming? The 'news' section as it is kinda feels like BonziBuddy.			"

												Got this game on Steam summer sale. After five hours of game play, I can say this is a fantastic game! I love playing the Recon class and use the bow alot. It is very cheap and you can get a lot of hours on this game.			"

												It's so bad that it's good. It's a really fun game with friends, and we always laugh alot. I'd recommend to play but only with a group of friends! :)			"

												at $0.99 I have already enjoyed this game tremendously for what I spent.  Only have 2hrs in at the moment, but those were a couple of really fun hours for me and my buddies.  This game has some terrible reviews, but I think it has come a long way since those reviews. Bottom line, this is a good game for its price, and a GREAT game for its current sale price.			"
