												A fantastic 2.5D jump and run gamePlayed in a black surreal world, somehow the visuals remind me of American McGee's Alice.You will follow a story that the narrator, which is the player, will tell you while playing.There are obstacles but no enemies, except for your faulty jumps and falls.The music, the colors, the narrator, the rain, everything adds to the atmosphere.It's not about achieving a big boss goal by fighting your way to this point through loads of enemies (no spoilers here), but about enjoying the story and the surroundings.You will meet robots, strange creatures, talk to them, come to strange places and you will be seeing stuff that could have been drawn by Dali.The game is far to fast over if you sit in there and are an avid jump and run player, but just to remind you, you will miss a lot if you just rush through.

												If you played through Limbo and thought to yourself, ""Boy, I could really do without the quality level design, evocative story, and intelligent puzzles"", then Spate is the game for you. It's a 2D platformer that seems to try and emulate better games but only does so at a superficial level, leaving it completely devoid of any substance at all. The level design is bland, the platforming is unsatisfying, and the game offers little to no challenge at all. The gameplay itself is almost non-existent at times; one level in particular is pretty much a Flappy Bird clone, while another has you sliding down slippery slopes and jumping over gaps for about 2 minutes straight. There are instances where you're doing nothing but moving to the right while admiring the scenery and listening to the narrator go on about regret and how alcohol has consumed his life. It's just all too repetitive and boring.On the positive side, the game is quite the treat visually and musically. I really enjoyed the art style, in particular the impressive backdrops of each level. The orchestral composition was probably the high-point of the experience. It did a great job of creating atmosphere and was one of the main reasons I continued playing for as long as I did.All in all, Spate is a game that looks better than it plays. It builds up a strong ambiance, but unfortunately everything beneath that feels empty and shallow.			"

												Spate is a fantastic experience and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. The game takes a very original approach to gameplay story telling and it pays off wonderfully. A deep and insightful story told through a man's journey in an unfamiliar environment. You'll laugh, you'll feel alone in the world, you'll cry and you'll do all that as you navigate the most amazing landscapes. The graphics, sound and narration combine to make a surreal and irresistable setting. I found myself unable to stop playing it right through to the end as I wanted to see what was coming next. I won't spoil the game by giving any part of the story away as you really need to play through it to appreciate its originality.I highly recommend this game.			"

												Fun fact: absinthe doesn't actually cause hallucinations. Spate is, despite it's erroneous science, immensely beautiful. The surrealistic backdrops and bright colors are truly wonderful. The constant storms, the overlay of winds that manipulate the lighting does add to the chaos of our assigned absinthe addicts mind. It adds to the madness. It's a 2D game in a 3D plane, which gives way to a plethora of amazing art-decisions. There are houses, cliffs, rubble, just floating around, sometimes in front of our screen - this can be incredibly annoying while doing some of the more precise platforming since it obfuscates our path, but it could be intentional to make an otherwise easy game a bit harder(bad way of doing that though). But the 3D and the more modern graphics - if you compare it to other indiegames - is a nice change in the way of storyfocused 2D platformers. Spate always give you something to look at, you will never be bored, visually. The gameplay is bog standard, but for the most part it's well done, relatively fun and doesn't bring too much frustration to the overall beauteous atmosphere. Parts of the gameplay are not really enjoyable, and doesn't really partake in the physics that the game otherwise upholds. It didn't make sense and it felt contrived. I am mostly referring to the parts where you used a cannon. Especially when you use a cannon to shoot balls into a basket that at the same time moves up and down, it felt out of place and I also fps-dropped in these parts of the game, which made it even worse.These were however short enough to not ruin the experience, but annoying nonetheless. These stops in movement made the game stagnate a bit, it ruined the flow and atmosphere in a way, for me. It felt really gamey, it snapped you out of the game and into a world where you are playing a game, trying to time a frustrating, fps-dropping ball into a bowl which seemingly made nothing happen. It didn't really give you the feedback you needed either to understand that you progressed. Or maybe I was just not paying attention in my boredom. Otherwise the gameplay is okay, but perhaps not the main draw of the game.The story was interesting. But in a way that reminded me of Contrast, it didn't get it across in the best way possible. The end seemed rushed, lackluster in a way, the death of his daughter didn't really seem to have been absolved. That could just be the ending I chose, the mindless optimist that I am. Which some people may enjoy being there, but it seemed out of character and trivialized the daughters death.There was also some weird writing, where the robot calls attention to the protagonists alcohol problem and he answer in anger, just after he himself have admitted to it being a problem. It felt like it was forced to give way for a dialogue later on. A dialogue infected by cliché. The narrator is this deep voiced guy: Jack Bair, sort of sounds like Morgan Freeman and he really makes the narration a joy to listen to. It's a third person telling of what you're doing in the way of Bastion, only it's the protagonist talking from his point of view. And apart from some trite observations, or ""ruining"" - perhaps confirming - the symbolism you yourself get from the background, the narrator does really add to the game. It's simply great.So Spate has its moments. It can be hilarious at times, it can be depressing at others. It does illustrate the delirium of an absinthe drinker. It's worthwhile for everything that it is. And for everything that it tries to be. It's intelligent, quirky, surreal, humorous, pretty, colorful. It has spirit.Hehe "

												Press X to drink.Basically, you are Christopher Walken and you're slowly losing your mind from drinking too much absinthe after the loss of your daughter. A brilliant set up for a story and nothing more needs to be said about that.Spate is a nice little platformer that you should have no trouble finishing in around 2 hours. There aren't really any enemies to speak of in the traditional platforming sense; Spate is more about platforming and then interacting with characters and objects. Does that make it a puzzle platformer? Not really, no.  I wouldn't call anything I came across in this game a puzzle, and to be honest the controls didn't feel particularly tight so it wasn't particularly good as a platformer either, but since nothing too much is expected of you it doesn't really matter that much. In terms of gameplay Spate isn't sounding that good on paper, but it still somehow manages to be a good game.There are a few things that make Spate a bit special. Being able to drink a seemingly unlimited supply of absinthe as you navigate through the world adds an extra element I haven't seen in many games. The effects of the absinthe warp the screen and environment around you. It makes jumping a little floatier and can affect how some environmental objects function too. While drinking isn't really necessary, you'll find yourself doing it often just for the hell of it. Just like in real life ( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°)What really goes a long way towards making Spate a good game is the fact that it has well thought out audio. The moody string instrument soundtrack adds to the atmosphere of the dark and deranged art style. Spate is narrated by a Christopher Walken sounding man - it's actually Jack Bair, but I've not heard of him before now. Just imagine someone that sounds a bit like Christopher Walken. The only thing I wish was done differently in Spate is that they could have voice acted the dialogue as well as the narration. Having a well done narration (although Jack Bair lacks emotion in some parts where he's meant to be quite upset) makes it seem quite jarring when dialogue appears and it is text only.I played the game through using only my Xbox 360 controller and it worked very well. There aren't many buttons required, but controller support was good.I'd recommend Spate based on the art style, the drinking effects, and the narration/music - although it only just scrapes in on the recommendation line for me. Spate is a fairly simple little platformer, but it shows a lot of promise and I look forward to seeing more games from Eric Provan - Ayyo Games.6.5 out of 10 - Would press X to drink again.			"

												A short, mild/slow platformer with good graphics and a basic story. This game is mostly about visuals and atmosphere. I don't think there is enough or difficult enough platforming to recommend it to someone who is mainly looking for a platformer and I don't think there is enough of a story to recommend it to someone looking for something closer to a visual novel, RPG, or adventure game. Also, there are no puzzles or problem solving in Spate.If you are looking for an atmospheric game with good visuals and a very basic story, then I would reccomend it.			"

												I greatly enjoy artsy, story-driven ""walking simulators"", and this seemed right up my alley. It definitely got the artsy walking simulator part down, but the story is really... boring. It's essentially ""gosh, absinthe/alcoholism sure did ruin my life, but now it's the only thing keeping me going. Also I'm sad that I lost my wife and child."" repeated about 30 times with different wordings. The ending bashes you in the face with symbolism that would make an English teacher proud. ""Climbing this tower represents his struggle with alcoholism. The boss at the end sustains his life by feeding off the souls of those around him, just like the main character destroys those around him with his alcoholism."" The platforming bits are alright, but nothing particularly special. And though it might seem petty, I really didn't like the narrator's 1920's New Yorker accent - just didn't seem to fit the character at all. I like these kinds of games for their interesting stories, and this one's just too shallow and unengaging.			"

												As someone who helped kickstart this game I have to say I am pretty disappointed in it.  While the art is beautiful and the story is alright, the gameplay is virtually non-existant.  The movement is too slow and of the 84 minutes it took me to complete the game, probably half it was spent just pressing right and literally nothing else.  Some of that was to allow you to hear the exposition without distraction, but far too much didn't even have that.This really should have been a short film rather than a game.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: Eric Provan (Ayyo Games)Publishers: Ayyo Games Initial release: Mar 2014Genre: Atmospheric, Story Heavy, Casual#Worth/NotWorth: #WaitForSaleExposition, Concurrence and SummationLoveCraftian alcoholic adventure inspired ostensibly by Tim Burton.Spate is a adventure about a man and his personal struggle for purpose and with alcoholism specifically absinthe after the death of his daughter.  I hesitate to call Spate a plat-former, while there are indeed platforms, a very large portion of the game is spent quite frankly is just walking to the right. I couldn't quite put my finger on why this was; was it intentional as in an attempt to make the player choose themselves to drink as doing so makes the world go warbly and often has some visual effect while additionally allowing the character to jump higher. Perhaps identify with the character more or was this just an area for the narration to take place. Don't expect a challenge here, the game doesn't control that well but it never asks you to do anything that demands much attention. There are a few areas that are a bit wonky as far as clipping and sticky walls though. THE GISTThis game exists somewhere between the meta-physical and allegorical. The specifics are kind of left for you to decide, it sort of leans on the absinthe angle while introducing the world with newspaper headlines so it's a little unclear. It's far from being a great game but it's certainly not a bad game. Follow my curation for more "

												Gorgeous visuals. Nothing else.PROS:-Great visuals.NEUTRAL:-Controls are just barely ok. For a few parts that have actual platforming, they are not tight enough and result in some frustration.-Absinthe (and alcohol in general) aren't psychadelics. Not really to the gameplay, but a cheap cop-out to use alcohol to make the game ""socially acceptable.""CONS:-Walking simulator: the level design is pretty much as bad as it can get. Huge stretches of just walking to the right (some have narration, but lots are just in silence).-Nothing happens. I played for about 40 minutes and all he does is mention his dead daughter, his exwife, and the drink. There is no character development or anything resembling a story; he just keeps mentioning them over and over.  "

												Personal Rating: WastedClassic Rating: ★★★★☆Spate is the story of a man who lost his family and became addicted to drinking; it's a surreal trip in search for answers which probably are not going to be found.It's a story about love, though, without any doubt.About the technical aspects of the game, I had some problem related to low framerate but i was still able to play it; moreover i found an issue about preferences not being saved - subtitles were set to off every time i quit the game and my XBOX 360 controller was working half-way.. i could move but couldn't use any buttons until i mapped them: then again i lost those settings after a Windows restart and had to re-map those buttons.Big thanks to Eric (game developer) for your kind support and my best wishes for your next projects.

												Dear god. This game was seriously epic! And I'm not even into platformers!Long Review:When I got this game from a friend, I didn't expect much. I installed it and when I loaded it up, I instantly saw the graphics where fenomenal. I created a save and started playing. It sounded like the narrator was Morgan Freeman, which was pretty rad. The story was very emotional but very creative, too. The world has some issues like certain objects not working like they're used to, so that's a shame. Aswell as some walking/crouching bugs, whereas I went crouching, I was stuck in a constant crouching mode unable to quit it. Luckely you can reset yourself to the last checkpoint to fix this. World bugs are easily fixed by leaving to the menu and going back into your save. What more can I say?Rates:Graphics: 9.5/10Story: 10/10Mechanics: 7.5/10Creativity: 8.5/10tl;dr version:sp8 is gr8 m8 8/8 no need 4 a deb8 i apprici8r8es:gam: 8/8			"

												Very much a flawed gem, this isn't as strictly gameplay focused as some might hope for and because of the story focus with simple, even bland gameplay it's no wonder a lot of people expected more, but for me Spate was a short, visually strange and interesting journey that only suffered from a few minor annoyances and delivered a lightly moving story. Because of that I'd recommend it as a flawed but good, or at least interesting game worth an hour or two of your time.HighlightsThe balance of gameplay with the narrative/story was what stood out most for me in Spate. Thrown into a dark damp and rough visual art style, you feel slightly out of place and isolated when you first begin your journey, and that matches the point at which the story begins, which is a good example of the multiple instances of putting the narrative ahead of the gameplay, for better or worse. Throughout the stages you'll pass through relic and forgotten structures and visuals from the past, just as the character does. In many stages I felt as though the game was far too simple and I was simply being carried along, later realizing this was intentional and even emphasized during a long slow water stage. Everything tries to feed the story in much the same way Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons did, and while this game is in no way as well polished and designed as Brothers, it does have its own charm and some interesting design points.The narrative and art style are also beautiful and solemn, the strange mix of rough low-res textures and gloomy but vivid lighting are different enough to stand out but not enough to take away from the story or feeling of the game.Mistakes and AnnoyancesThere's plenty wrong with Spate and that mostly come down to lack of production value and polish. As a short simple platformer you'd expect the controls to be a priority, but they feel floaty, slow and frustratingly inaccurate. You could argue that this is intentional to help feel out the story, but it still feels cumbersome and when mixed with poor stage design where you might need to repeat a section a few times or repeat the same action 10+ times to proceed and faulty graphical artifacts and clipping, it really sucks away some of the immersion and takes away from the game as a whole.The other concern is the length. At just an hour or two of gameplay Spate really needs to offer something well crafted and refined. I'm glad there're no false gimmicks like jaunty collectibles or multiple characters and I understand that every section of the game attempts to represent a part of the characters journey, but with the fairly simplistic design of the game and the one line story it needs something else in terms of gameplay to keep it going long enough or make it challenging enough to have an impact and they've missed a beat.RecommendationsAt just $4.99/£3.99/4.99€ Spate isn't overpriced, but due to the very short length and lack of technical care in design it's a game I'd actually recommend waiting for a sale on to keep you from feeling robbed out of a more traditional gameplay focused game. If all you want is a short interesting journey, this is very much worth a play, just don't expect a puzzle/platform title like LIMBO and be prepared to forgive some poor design and you'll enjoy what this has to offer.* There are a number of hidden bunny's (Easter Bunny's = Easter Eggs) throughout the world which usually offer a line of dialogue, spoilers available hereUnedited review notes 27/12/2015 for Spate:

-Poor menu system, have to switch between mouse and keyboard multiple times and backtrack etc
-Really lacking in polish, multiple small jagged bugs from artifacts to timing, big problem for such a simple game
+Good narration and fairly good writing that match the art style
+Rough indie art style makes it feel more personal, like a student art movie
+Moves slowly and gameplay always seems to match narration in terms of pace, point in journey etc

												Spate... If I was asked to give a list of examples of how to make a so-so atmospheric platformer, I wouldn't hand over Spate, because that would imply that this game was good enough to even be considered ""only"" mediocre. No, Spate is the epitome of what people who hate the genre believe it is: creepy/trippy backdrops to make up for a dearth of actual gameplay elements. Spate is the story of a detective who ventures to an supposedly uninhabited island that was once the scene of a mass disappearance of its citizens, and is now covered in a layer of fog and precipitation. His goal is to find some missing entrepreneur, but that quickly resolves itself to make way for heavy handed existential talk of him losing his daughter. You really begin to feel for the good detective when transparent photos of his deceased daughter are superimposed in the background. It looks as terrible as it sounds, but sounds nowhere near as terrible as the voice actor who portrays our detective. More often than not, Detective Hevyhans sounds like one of the more hilarious Christopher Walken impersonations littering youtube. It's as if the actor who portrays him truly means to do his best to destroy any remaining potential for solid exposition, at least any that the highschool level monologue that runs ad nauseam fails to deal with.Levels typically consist of overly long straight and narrow pathways, and occasionally these turn into overly long platforming segments where the platforms barely differentiate in height, size, or distance from each other. And don't worry, equally mediocre jumping controls complement these mediocre jumpways. Some areas introduce more puzzling elements, and I don't mean that they in any way promote thought on the part of the player. An early example of puzzling elements include machinery (usually controlling buzzsaws) that may try to throw a wrench in your plan to move rightward. There is no rhyme or reason to their inclusion in the game, and they don't even match with the surrounding scenery. So why are they here? Likely because someone played too much LIMBO whilst developing Spate.Another puzzling addition to the game is the inclusion of a ""drink"" button. This lets you take a swig of absinthe whenever you please, because your daughter's dead, which twists the world a bit, adding oddities like eyes to trees and giant floating fish in the sky. It also allows you to jump really high, because absinthe is apparently a very powerful hallucinogen, now. From what I've played, there's no point to the function, other than to break up the monotony of moving right for minutes while nothing happens. I've never needed the high jump, and the ""hallucinogenic"" effects wear off in a matter of seconds unless you smack the ""drink"" button between every couple of breaths.Spate does do one thing right. It gives me an even higher appreciation of games that absolutely nail the whole atmospheric bit, like LIMBO. I remember first playing LIMBO years ago, thinking how easy it would be to make a similar game. After all, how difficult could such a minimalist experience be to create? If Spate is any indication, I clearly gave the creators of LIMBO far too little credit.			"

Although, this is my personal experience.

												As the video game medium evolves into a more comprehensive experience, mechanically defined genres have blurred, thematic material and atmosphere emerging as the most accurate descriptions of games. Spate is neither a platformer nor a two-degrees-of-freedom walking simulator; it is a psychological thriller, ripe with counterplay between its prominent mechanic and its aesthetic intentions.The Negs --Spate is a game that relies heavily on illusion and atmosphere. You are held in harrowing hallucinations as much as the protagonist, but this captivation spirals down the drain faster than a slick steamer in a Taco Bell toilet whenever you speak with the main NPC, a comedic relief robot that passes for funny only in abrupt contrast with the otherwise somber environment. The game's exposition switches between text box (for conversations with NPCs) and voiced narration for the protagonist's thoughts. The text boxes aren't the best writing and they have several grammatical errors (as does the store page description if you care to look for them), but the real issue is in the execution of these internal monologues. The writing for these is slightly less obtuse than store-brand cereal names. In a genre that demands vague motivations and misleading actions to unsettle the player's own thoughts, this title was rather direct in all things. Any misdirection by the narrator is almost immediately recanted and explained. Interpretation is unheard of. Also, these narrative monologues come up in one of the 6 distinct gameplay portions. These are open straightaways (wherein the long narration occurs), NPC interactions, platforming segments, sliding sections, ""Angry Birds"" mini-games, and ""Helicopter Game"" mini-games (you know, the one we all used to play on public school computers with the bright green cavern walls and terrible collision boxes where you click to fly up and release to fall down while constantly moving right). I suspect that the straightaways are designed as such that you can just listen to the narration and take in the environment without much thought as to where to jump or what pitfall to avoid. The problem is that these are too long. If you were to continue to walk right for the duration of the monologues, it would often conclude long before the next segment of gameplay. This is suboptimal design. Besides, the platforming sections are so infrequently strewn into the game with such embarrassingly shallow challenge that there would be no concern for distraction should the player encounter one during important exposition. The sliding sections are slopes that your character slips down without any control. The two mini-game types seem to be attempts at bolstering the gameplay, but they neglect that Spate's most enticing characteristic is not its gameplay. I will say, though, that the most fun parts of the game were the ""helicopter"" segments. My very minor complaints for this title are some collision glitches and an uneventful soundtrack that was just a smattering of sounds you might hear in any token thriller.The Pos --Eric Provan developed this game as a personal project and I am glad he did. Provan has worked for Disney's and Henson's animation studios, and he designed models and textures for such works as Frozen, The Amazing Spiderman, Alice in Wonderland, and Big Hero 6. His experience in 3D modelling provides Spate with its most powerful aspect: a haunting visual trek through a fantastically detailed world. The game is set in a steampunk era, and it plays well with the dark and mechanical environmental elements. The visual experience is unrivaled by most 2.5D side-scrollers; it develops a cerebral existence with themes symbolically integrated into the geography of the protagonist's world. While the story is not especially well-written, it does offer an emotional journey if the player wishes to be so engrossed. This is actually the most satisfying part of the game to me. The game very early informs you that you can take a swig of absinthe at any point during the game. The effect is shocking at first, the world twisting and distorting, backgrounds shifting into monstrosities. Having consumed the spirit, the player can move slightly faster and jump significantly higher. As is the case with absinthe, the player will encounter hallucinations on account of the drink which really embellishes the story in every good way. I will not ruin any plot elements in this review, but I will say that the entire game can be beaten without drinking absinthe, only some of the platforming sections are made stupidly simple if you are under the influence (due to the jump height advantage). I loved this intertwining of mechanic and story, since an alcohol addiction may make coping with pains significantly easier but it is never one's only option. A slighter pleasantry I should mention is the pacing of the game. It took 2 hours to play through, and I did not feel that any distinct section was drudgery, since the narration and visuals did mesmerize me quite well.The Verd --It may very well seem that I loathed this game, but its mistakes had much to do with the gameplay, which was not Spate's draw in the first place. Rather, thrilling atmosphere and striking animation are what this title offers most. I would have to dissuade those looking for a fun platformer from purchasing this game, but anyone who might be interested in a spectacle of mind games in service of a gloomy theme must experience Spate. For missing out on an opportunity to further immerse the player by melding more of the mechanics with the plot and for leaving the gameplay unattended, Spate garners a [7 / 10]. A dark theme terrifically employed into an uncertain world, Spate makes a great game for anyone willing to overlook its design flaws.			"

												I've followed Spate almost from its very inception.  I've seen the creator propose the game in the IGN ""Game Boss"" show and went through its design stages.  Then I backed it on Kickstarter (you can see my username in the credits if you finish it).  So, I had a bit of an investment in this game.  I have to say, despite a few reservations, I am not dissapointed.I think many reviewers don't understand what this game is trying to do.  This game is not trying to be the next platformer.  It's not trying to be an award-winning story.  It tries to be just a bit of a different experience.  This game just wants its own place in this world, and it deserves it.You play as a man who struggles with alcoholism after the loss of his daughter.  There's a story about him being a detective on a case trying to catch a killer with the help of a robot, but it's all just an excuse.  After all, the entire thing is just a metaphor for the internal struggles of this character.  The world he inhabits is strange, imaginative and visually trippy, but the details are vague.  Is he really a detective working on a case and all the details are exaggerated as his mind hallucinates or is the entire thing happening on his head as he tries to find a reason to pick up his life?  Is the robot actually a friend of his or merely a metaphor for his conscience?The gameplay is where things get both more and less interesting.  This is a platformer, in the strictest sense of the word.  There are no enemies to fight here, there's only running and jumping.  Your other only action available is drinking.  Press a button (or key) and you take a sip from your (apparently bottomless) flask.  This produces the effect of warping the world a bit, as if you were dizzy, but also makes you faster at running and better at jumping.  The metaphorical effect being that alcohol makes you troubles go away.  It makes it all easier.  Do you leave the bottle in your pocket and face the challenge ahead the hard way... or take a sip and make things easy now... but harder later?And this is where I think the game falters.  The platforming is just too easy, so there's no real trade-off.  Things are easy enough that you don't need to sip your drink (except maybe in sections where your character starts to walk slower after a dialogue which, for all I know, might be a bug), and if you do it it's just for the hell of it.  There's also no real consequence for abusing your drinking, as the ending depends merely on a choice you purposely make at the end.  This is another missed opportunity to make the ending only as hard as you tried to make things easy before.But, again, this game still succeeds at what it was trying to do and I fully recommend it.  It's a short but sweet experience.  Nothing wrong with that, particularly for the price.			"

												In this video I try to avoid any story elements that would spoil anything as the game is not that long, but worth your time for sure.Spate is a platformer with a strong focus on story and atmosphere, where it will draw you in, make you feel warm and safe then kill you. I am surprised at how good this short little game truly is.

												Spate is an Adventure 2.5D platformer game set up in dystopian Pearl Isles.You are Bluth, a private detective that was hired to find the whereabouts of a missing business man, he was last seen around the X Zone, a forbidden place where a lot of people vanished years ago, why would a business man be there? You have no clue and frankly, you don't care, you've lost it all, your daughter, your wife, your sanity... The only thing you have left, is the drink.Why then are you doing this job? What happened to the island back then? What can you do now? And finally, What is real and what not?★★★★☆ | Liked it "

												I truly, truly wanted to love this game.  In sincerity, I don't really buy very often on Steam.  From the glowing reviews, I wanted to give this game a shot, especially considering the breathtaking design that the screenshots promised.The noir/steampunk design lended itself nicely to the plot, which is ripe with cliche dialogue that would make Max Payne's grimace transform into a prideful smile.  Although, I have to admit that the main voice actor in the game sounded very similar to Morgan Freeman.  Not that it's a bad thing.  Truly, the sin of the story is that it doesn't seem to go anywhere.  You can plop down the most surrealistic architecture, but if you have a plot that stands still, why am I even listening to the protagonist?If you're used to platformers, the gameplay is par for the course.  Jump on things that spin, dodge pits, dodge spikes, throw in a cannon or two.  Don't get me wrong, it's obvious that the developers put a ton of work into the game, but I still can't recommend the title, even at 50% off.To be honest with you, I haven't finished the game.  There was a respawn glitch that sends me to through the floor, straight into the kill barrier.  After shutting off to my desktop, returning to my save file, the glitch was still happening.  There's no excuse for this kind of game stopping glitch, which is a shame.There was a lot of potential for a truly special experience.			"

												Too long for♥♥♥♥♥♥ too short for Richard.  It's nearly great, and if you prize art, sound and atmosphere above all else, you'll probably enjoy it.However, for me, while the game does a great job of building atmosphere, it's in the service of a slightly half-arsed story and some slightly half-arsed platforming.  Either the gameplay needed to be better, or the story needed to be deeper. It raises plenty of questions without having the balls to answer them, and it provides some mild gameplay challenges without having the balls to truly challenge the player. As it is, the end product is unfocused, too clever by half, and I can't recommend it.			"

												Are you among the many who thought that Dear Esther could have been just a tiny bit more, erm, ""challenging"", gameplay-wise?  But did you, on the other hand, find Limbo just a little TOO demanding for your decidedly♥♥♥♥♥♥poor coordination, reflexes and/or puzzle-solving skills?  Well, have we got just the game for you!      Spate is a gorgeously epic and dream-like platformer which teaches kids all about the ups and downs of alcohol abuse, and suggests that while absinthe will usually just lead to child neglect and marital disintegration, it also has its benefits, such as giving one the boundless energy required to perform super-human feats of death-defying derring-do which even the most suicidal of ""extreme sportsmen"" would balk at attempting; all whilst our anti-hero muses casually to himself about the wrong he has done in his life, thanks to his dual addictions to detective work and the dreaded demon drink.  It's a mostly day-dreamy, though occasionally perilous, journey through landscapes both bleak and beautiful, as seen through the eyes of a po-faced protagonist wearing a gas mask and sporting an unfeasibly oversized arm.  In short...it's ABSOLUTELY BLOODY FANTASTIC.  Unhesitatingly recommended for the head-in-the-(storm-)clouds, miserabalist romantic residing in all of us.  Well, in me, Morrissey and the twisted folk who made this game, anyway... Verdict: 9/10.  (PS The ending very nearly made me CRY.  The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!)			"

												Spate reminds me of so many things, from Limbo, to The Wicker Man, of all things. In Spate you play as a detective sent to an abandoned island to investigate the disappearance of a business man. Detective Bluth has a troubled past, as most detectives seem to have, involving his daughter disappearing, his wife leaving him, and having a drinking problem, which makes its way into the game as a surprising game mechanic.The first thing I noticed right away just by the game's screenshots is the game's style is gorgeous. They even say in the discription that they took influence from several artists such as Jim Henson and Dr. Seus. They way I could describe the overall style of the game is, Tim Burton remaking ""The Wicker Man"" with elements of Dr. Seus.The other cool mechanic of the game is the use of the main character's addiction. The game itself is a puzzle-platformer, like Limbo. And the reason the game looks so surreal is you don't know how much of the strangeness is real and how much of it is hallucinations from his addiction. And by drinking the alchohol during a puzzle it will make completing the puzzle easier. My only complaint about this that only a few puzzles actually needed to use the mechanic on. I like that it didn't force the mechanic on you, but the puzzles just seemed a little too easy, at least to me. I feel it could been a little bit harder to really make you sort of fight yourself not to use the alcohol. For the most part I just said ""Okay I'll try not to use it!"" and I didn't really have to try.The story also keeps you interested. The main character slowly feeds you what happened to him in his life and why he's become like this, and what's really going on, on this myserious island.The only other thing I have to complain about is the ending, or should I say endings. The game has two different endings. And while I liked them both, I feel like the way you get them could have been handled a lot better. I feel like what they should have done was one ending you get if you solved more puzzles without the need for the addictive substance, and the other ending you get if you rely on it too much.It's also surprisingly short, it only took me 99 minutes to complete on my first try. But to the game's credit I'm not sure how they really could have made it any longer without it feeling like they were dragging it out.Overall I liked Spate, it's a little flawed, but it's got a beautiful and interesting style, and a good story about overcoming loss and addiction. If you like games like Limbo, Braid, or Bastion, check this out.			"

												While I strongly believe the elements of a good story were set in place here, Spate lacks gameplay mechanics. There's cannons, jumping, and drinking your absinthe. It lacks interesting elements to keep a steady flow of attentiveness and enjoyment. There were some very interesting parts, such as entering through the first odd creature. As it went along I thought 'wow, i'm a little intimidated to go through this part/go inside this area. What'll happen if I do?' well, what happened was that I literally just walked through it, without any action or consequence. This game isn't terrible, don't get me wrong...But another problem with it, is that the controls are clunky. It feels like your character's slightly off in certain situations. There were a few times when I had a checkpoint and died. Not so hard, right? You get sent back to the checkpoint when you die-well, when you've went through a series of 6-8 obstacles and a narrow passageway just to slam right into the same upper wall the billionth time JUST because you didn't hold the space bar in just the right timing makes respawning very agonizing. There were very few other parts where I just sat there and said to myself 'I wonder if i'm going to get through this anytime soon.' because it was just so clunky and absurd. I go on a jump panel, and somehow I die....I jump towards a paltform, miss my jump, glitch in the segment holding up the platform and instantaneously die. The difficulty in this game is just aggravating. For the most part, it's easy sailing, you just work your way through, and to an extent it gets boring. Then, when you come to a more difficult part, that's not even that difficult in concept....You keep dying, or falling back to start, over and over and over again. It's not the fact that you die that makes it difficult; in fact, dying wasn't a concern...It's falling back right to where you started. It happens very solemn in this game, but when it does.....It's pretty aggravating. The narration is excellent, the story is very well done. If it's on sale and you just...Want to find a way to kill time, or if it looks interesting to you, go ahead and get it...But if I was recommending this to people who're looking for a triple A game, i'd tell them to pass on this.

												I'm not sure whether to term this a 2D platformer with narrative walking simulator elements or a narrative walking simulator with 2D platformer elements. What I can tell you is this game is absolutely gorgeous. As a great lover (perhaps even connosuier) of surrealism in non-static media such as films and video games (and static media too, mind, but those already get all the attention), I think I know a thing or too about seeing surrealist video games well done, and Spate is defintately a surrealist game well done.Spate is the story of an unflappable, self-loathing, absinth-addicted detective whose prone to blackouts and vivid hallucionations investigating a rich businessman who suddenly ran off without explanation into the surrealist, rain soaked, sunless wasteland of the Pearl Islands, known as the X-Zone (likely short for ""Exclusion Zone"") ever since everyone on them suddenly disappeared and the Islands turned into a surrealist, rain soaked, sunless wasteland. The style is a bit hard to put into words, so I recommend just checking the game out for yourself. You won't regret it.			"

												Pros:-This game is beautiful; graphically, and philosophically. -The game is fairly easy to beat, but also fairly fun to play.-The music is some of the best I've heard from a game in a while. -Pretty decent voice acting. -Well written dialogue. -Very atmospheric.-Satisfying ending.Cons:-There were a few bugs; for example, there was one part where I was randomly launched into the air, and another time where I kept going through the platforms and had to reload the save file just to get through that section. Not exactly game-breaking, but not welcomed.Overall, this game is great, despite the occasional bug/glitch. If you like platformers, games with good stories, or just have a couple of hours to spare, it's worth playing through. Overall score: 8.7/10.			"

												Really want to recommend this game but it's quite boring to be honest.You play as a private eye, Bluth, with a drinking problem looking for a businessman lost in an island where some unexplained catastrophe happened years ago and many people just vanished. Now it's a livid land with constant rain and crazy sights; floating rocks, impossible caves, somehow still functioning ever helpful machinery to help you get to the next stage. You never know if these anomalies are the result of this catastrophe or his drunk dreaming.You keep walking to the right of the screen and occasionally encounter platforming bits; a few jumps and you are good. Platforming is not challenging nor fun. You learn about the story of Bluth by his talking about it on long stretches of stages where nothing happens and you just walk right; you keep walking right most of the game.Bluth can take a swig of absinthe whenever you feel like it however it's not tied to any gameplay mechanic, just a visual effect; I feel it's wasted potential. Game is quite short; an hour should be enough to finish.Some good visuals here and there but not enough to save the game. Get it with a heavy discount.			"

												It's a 2.5D platformer in the same vein as Deadlight and LIMBO - less LIMBO, more Deadlight. The story follows a man on a quest that takes him deeper into madness. Without giving anything away, I'd say it's worth a playthrough. It's a short game (under 2 hours), and has virtually no replay value, BUT if you can get it cheap, in a bundle, or just like a good story and atmosphere, it's a good experience. Though I do recommend it, the $10 pricetag feels pretty steep, all things considered.			"

												Oh Spate what a suprise this one was.I saw this game some time ago on that half bad youtube show IGNs next game boss where this game won my thoughts where that it had a good artstyle but not much more. Now when i played the full game i do not think the art is good its amazing and so is the game. Im not going to talk much about the story but it is told in the way that something like Bastion is with a narriator telling a story as you play. The gameplay reminds me of Limbo its a simple slow paced platformer without the puzzels witch i do not mind as im awfull at them. I do not have much to say about the game as i feel the less you know the better it will be but i do recomend anyone that like a good story that is told well and do not mind a short game that you play in one sitting becuse it is short i finished it in 2 hours but i felt it was a perfect time for a game like this as nothing got boring and i was hooked all the way.One of the best games of 2014 a real hidden gem i can recoment this to anyone!

												A simple, intriguing platformer. The visuals and overall setting of the game have a pretty great variety. The platforming is quite simple, however a mechanic of boosting your jumps by drinking Absinthe (a prevalent theme in the narrative and visuals, etc..) provides for some variety. It's a very chill game, much more about ambiance and atmospheric settings / visual style than the story or limited gameplay. The story is done well through the protagonist's narration, reflecting on his life, as well as his text interactions (no V/O there unfortunately) with various others etc... For the price and personnel it's a great 2.5D platformer, slower paced... If you're at all interested I recommend giving it a whirl.			"

												Spate is a 60-75 minute adventure with some very light platforming and 'puzzle' elements. Apparently this game is all about the story. I heard people were comparing this to games like (I think) Limbo and Bastion but I'm sorry to say that it doesn't even come close.The story it tries to tell is interesting but the world feels weird and I couldn't really connect with it. That, and the conversations and monologues working toward the ending sometimes seem random and/or uninteresting. The ending, however, is pretty good and maybe it needs a second playthrough in order to fully understand things. Then again, maybe not.Spate is a nice attempt at trying to be something deep but let's just face it: you're better off playing games that are actually deep. Or, at least, deeper than this.[Rating: 63/100]			"

												Gorgeous platformer with a very sad story and a beautiful soundtrack to accompany that story. One interesting thing about it is that you can drink portions of absinthe, which enhances your jumping ability and changes the visuals of the game, making it feel like a bit of a psychedelic trip. It also has two different endings, which I don't see very often in this type of game.			"

												Pretty much what the tittle says. I thought this was a really great/deep/one of a kind experience that I wasn't really expecting. I was following this game for quite awhile and then had forgotton about it till it showed up on a steam sale recently. The game is short, but I'm okay with that, the story is as unique as it is weird and the narration I thought was very good actually. Perhaps was expecting more for the ending, but it was still very rewarding none the less as the game does a really good job and making you keep guessing exactly what the hell is going on.Graphically was beautiful and the orchstral soundtrack really did the game justice, fantastic music. Loved how you can just drink endlessly and the weird funny effects that it does on the game can really trip you for a loop! Beautiful game with quite a deep story even though it is short, and read the credits, some meaningfull stuff in there I wasn't expecting either, so take the time to read some of em....Game ran flawlessly for me with great mechanics. Ending was unique and just enough to walk away with a satisfied feel you finished the game. I hope there will be another game someday with perhaps more to it, doesn't matter if its a sequal or a whole new story/adventure. There isn't many games that are so simple, but yet, move me a little and this did that.... If you're thinking about buying this game, just don't think about it what this game is when you play it, just let the game take you on its journey is really the best way to describe how to play this game....I highly reccomend this game, especially when it was only $3.99 from sale.1 side note though:Game isn't optimized very well, It ran good for me, but then I am sitting with a GTX 980 so it would but I would go from 220FPS down to 40 something without much going on with my GPU/CPU or much going on the screen.

												Played this game from start to finish in one run. it's far from being perfect due to it's short gameplay time, mediocre voice acting and some control issues but as an adventure game it's beautiful both visually and audibly.			"

												Review Spate - well, that's a challenge as whether you count it as a platformer jump'n'run indie game or as an experience but I see it as both.When I made my first jumps I thought crap - the jumping doesn't feel 'right' - it's clumsy somehow and not that precise but after some minutes I got used to it, somehow it fits the game. I don't want to say much about the story but there is a personal tragedy evolving around the character you play throughout your journey through the world. You can drink Absinthe whenever you want and it changes the play world in terms of colors, surroundings and so on but most importantly it changes gameplay as you can jump much higher even though it gets really hard to control those jumps but overall it makes the jumping challenges easier. First I thought it would be useful to have a limitation on the Absinthe consumption but well, it's a crucial part of both game and experience. At anytime you can get hallizunations - if you want but you don't have to.The narrator of the story - the character you play - does a great job in telling your story and it's pretty immersive if you are open to it. Even though gameplay is not perfect and there are some minor glitches, the 2D side scrolling is perfectly built into the 3D surroundings. It has become quite common and usual but the game developers did a great job on that!So, if you are thinking about getting this game - look at some screenshots (I loved to do some myself).I recommend this game if you liked e.g. Limbo even though it's not that concentrated on survival. It's more about the experience and you can take your time and are not in a hurry. The jumping challenges are a bit repetitive though and the sometimes you jump from platform to platform which somehow is in conflict with the atmosphere of the game world as the platforms look mechanic and quite unfitting but it's aside from that there is nothing to add.So have a look at Spate and maybe you pick it up while it's on sale (Y)Edit: I forgot to mention that the voice-acting itself is outstanding and all sounds add beautifully to the experience.

												TL:DR - Go and play Papo & Yo instead.I really wanted to like Spate. The description of the story is enough to pull you in: Spate is a dark, brooding, and beautifully crafted emotional journey that is seen through the eyes of a struggling addict.Indie game gold right? Sadly no.I found Spate to be a story-based puzzle platformer with no puzzles and a narrator whom I felt no empathy for. The way he casually flings his alcoholism and self-deprecation about is more akin to a troubled teenager than a father in mourning.The 'game' mostly consists of holding down right and jumping. I thought that the 'X to drink' was an excuse to put a funky filter over the whole thing and promote it as an art piece but it wasn't until the last scene that I found I could jump higher once I'd activated it. I'm not sure if that was contextual or a mechanic I had somehow missed throughout the whole game, it just goes to show how little I actually needed it.The imagery is often spectacular but is interspersed with glimpses of the main character's daughter who looks like something out of Frozen. On the whole, I got the feeling that three indie titles had been merged into one to help fill 90 minutes of gameplay. Even then I found myself skating down a waterfall for about 5 minutes. I almost jumped off it at one point to see if it was a test. Don't worry, that's an optional ending.			"

												As an addict, I was rather dissapointed in the story/dialoge, It was obviously not written by or guided by someone who has struggled with addiction. Im not done playing it but i was really excited for a sad story involving addiction, instead (probably unintentional i know) it felt sort of like a slap in the face to the people who actually deal with this♥♥♥♥♥♥ Oh and you dont hallucinate from absintheThat being said, at least as of right now (I will edit this as I play further if any opinion changes) It feels nice alot of the time... until it doesnt. I love the asthetic! It has very interesting concepts and mechanics not all of them work correctly or together well. I really want to like this game but I dont.			"

												If you like walking simulators then try it out. IMO it doesn't offer anything, loads of questions with no answers.Only one man walking with nothing to figure out, no different paths to take and almost no skill needed to complete the game.After everything you go through in the end you may end by killing yourself and the main character is an addicted alcoholic. While game isn't like horrible, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.4/10			"

												Being a backer for a game comes with some sort of risk because, despite the fact that you can choose to play it before it is released and get an idea of the quality, you never really know if the product is going to be a success or fall flat. You simply put faith in the fact that it will do well.Mr. Provan has made a game much more than a success and what I had in mind. And I have chosen the two greatest admirations of this experience.Graphics:The Unity engine still shows itself, once again, to somehow bring my computer almost to its knees with its somewhat out-of-the-box lack in optimization. However, I was present when Eric was doing well to optimize it himself so that performance and quality was equally present. That said, the graphics in this game are done well and beautifully. In most games, I try to admire the level design but most of the time, I'm just breezing right through it. In Spate, the game was at an appropriate slow pace that I was able to stop and enjoy the level designs. I would say that my favorite was the level with the small village and houses.Sound/MusicThe entire time I was playing this game, Mike Raznick's surreal and haunting scoring pulled me more into the experience. The violins led the way and drove the music toward feelings of melancholy and ethereal. This is a great example of how the music not only fits the story but drives it forward. The voice acting of Jack Bair as the main protagonist was perfect; I personally received the feeling of a 1920s detective with how his words were spoken.So there are two cents on a wonderful experience that I need to play again so I can see what happens in the other ending.

												Spate is sort of a platforming/puzzle game that never really challenges you in the areas of platforming or puzzles. Rather, the game mainly focus around heading to the right and avoiding the obstacles whilst you admire the interesting visuals and listen to the story unfold.The visuals are the main reason why anybody would enjoy this game. They are definitely interesting, as you can see in the screenshot gallery on the store page. At any point, you can also take a swig of absinthe and have the visuals go all wobbly to spice it up a bit. But it saddens me to say that I found this to be its genuinely single redeeming factor.Never before has a psychological thriller — I guess you could call this one of those — left me so bored. The main character and narrator has not an unpleasant voice, which is a good thing as he spends a lot of the game talking to himself about his life. Nevertheless the narration begins to get really seriously drab as he goes back over the same points over and over and over, and I became completely sick of his talk of “the drink” by the end of my first playthrough.The gameplay involves dodging various obstacles which aren't ever a real challenge to avoid, and you're given slight changes in pace in the form of piloting a small plane or sliding down several slopes in succession (which is my new favourite sentence) in order to break up the sheer monotony that still manages to seep through. The main causes for my deaths was either impatience due to boredom or not paying attention due to boredom, and neither of which is ever a good thing.At the end of the game, your only form of actual interaction with the story comes in the form of making a ‘choice’, which sort of falls dry when there's a clear right and wrong answer:Fix everything that's wrong and get your life back on track vs. Be an alcoholic and continue destroying any emotional ties you have because why the ♥♥♥♥ not.Yeah. Spate is a monotonous game with interesting visuals. The several points in which it fell flat weren't so bad as to make me not wish to finish or revisit it. I got it in a bundle, and it's been in four unique ones thus far, so maybe keep an eye out on those sites if this has piqued your interest; I didn't hate it, but I honestly couldn't recommend it for full price.

												For a game with an amazing soundtrack and visuals, it is disappointing for me to have to say this but having beaten it in a little over 2 hours and with little replayability, it is not really worth MSRP of $10. Purchase this one on sale and save it for a rainy day and it'll be the most amazing 2 hours you will experience. Story was on the cliche side and I felt that a little more could have been done with the voice overs and cut scenes. Only other complaint I have about this game is that the controls were very weak and tends to be the only challenge of the game but I looked past its minor problems just because I was ""wowed"" by the soundtrack and visuals. I am only recommending this one on sale. What I've recieved from this game, for the 2+ hours I've commited was worth the cost of renting a brilliant movie. 7/10*, -1 controls, -1 cut scenes, -1 no challenge, -1 replayability, +1 just because the visuals and sound track was so freaking amazing!

												What a beautiful concept. A very tripy and dark game. Spate looses him self by drinking absinthe and gets lost in his mind. The soundtracks are perfectly suiting all atmospheres and kinda gives you the effect of being there how it would feel. Well done team and the developer. Hope there will be another gem like this.

												Spate is a short yet enjoyable experience into the life of a wrecked man. This was the intent, and the sensation is, for the most part, entirely felt through gameplay and art alone.Beware, it's not the prettiest indie game out there in terms of polygonal richness, and sometimes the technic and narrative department fall flat (especially at the end). But everything else is more than okay, and for such a price, I can't really complain. If you have 1 hour to spare and you want to feel immersed, you should check this out.P.S.

												This isn't much of a game. It's more of a surreal experience, a slow walk through the mind of a broken man, an alcoholic on Absynthe and mourning his life.  There are a few platform elements and minor puzzles, but it's mainly your figure moving right, watching the bizarre and surreal world as your thoughts are narrated to you in a broken, despondent tone. And yet it's not necessarily a downer of a game. And the visuals are fascinating; the color palette, the background images as things go from sane to insane, it's an experience. Just not much of a game. It took about 90 minutes to walk through.  And I don't regret the trip.			"

												WOW....just...WOW. Had this for a while, and every so often I rekindle the awesomeness of Spate. Vibrant colors, responsive controls, about as good a platformer as they come...and as an added bonus, you take a 'drink' and the visuals get even trippier. The only downside, personally anyway, is that I put this game aside to play other games, and I forget how awesome it is. If you've ever had the kind of romance that goes hot then cold, and every time you date them again you ask yourself why you stopped...well, this is like that, without whatever guilt trip they thro at you...lol. EASILY worth full price, but a must-buy during a sale!			"

												I wish, this game was what it wants and tries to be. I really do. It would've been amazing. But it fails more than it succeds and good visuals, interesting narrative and occasional excitement fades due to the fact, that the majority of the game is boring, tiring and, sometimes, frustrating.It tries to be an atmospheric cinematic platformer (think Another World, Oddworld or, more recently, LIMBO), but with much less action and much more narrative. And it starts quite well. The beginning feels like an interesting build-up for something great - surreal imagery, unique setting, interesting narration and seemingly solid platforming. But this build-up than starts taking much longer, than you'd want it to. You start expecting things picking up soon, adding some more interesting elements to the gameplay, maybe. And they do, a bit later than they should, but they do. And then you start wishing they'd not.A lot of ""challenging"" parts of the game feel just thrown in without much thought. Here's a section, which would inevitably remind you of Flappy bird nowadays, thrown in for no reason and working at the painfuly slow pace, with checkpoints spaced out unevenly. There's a long jumping on the slides section, which has absolutely no tension, is also very slow, also has weird checkpoints placement and doesn't have any interesting visual or narration things going on either. Here's platforming with buzzsaws, for no particular reason, which don't really fit the aesthetics or the speed of the game. All those sections are just *there*, being not fun to play, nor interesting to look at. And the checkpoints seem to sometimes completely disregard just how long some parts of absolutely *nothing* can take, where you can somehow manage to die right at the end and redo all that nothing again.The snail pace during the simpler narration+platforming segments tends to be less frustrating, just because at least there's narration and some interesting visuals happening. But even there, I feel, a lot of things could've been changed and a lot of things could've been much better and more creative.It is a shame, really, since the game has lots of potential. But I don't see many people not giving up on it after about half an hour, just a third of the game in. And the sad thing is that, they will probably be not missing out much, since apart from a few interesting visual things and flawed but good narration, nothing really changes in the game after that. I do hope, though, that people who worked on this game will continue and maybe next time they will create something much better.			"

												Spate is story driven, which means there will be stretches in the game that you will have minimal interaction other than running and occasionally jumping, while the story is being narrated. And the narration is done very well, it reminds me of old black and white detective movies from the 40's.Although I did die several times. the gameplay is not hard, nor did it reach a frustrating level.The visuals were awesome IMOGrab it on sale, set your expectations low, and be pleasantly surprised!

												I was one of the backers for Spate. The gameplay itself is very simple. This game would be better described as a narrative visual book than a platformer. I was unimpressed with the gameplay all together, but for some reason I couldn't stop playing. This is one of the most immersive games I've ever played. The rain, the visuals, the music, the narration, everything is bound together perfectly. Even the ability to take a drink and disorient yourself for an ability of jumping higher, which is mostly useless, brings you further in. The ending is strong and for the sake of not ruining anything, I won't comment further on it.I once said to a friend of mine that, gameplay be damned, a solid story can make a game become amazing. Spate is evidence of that. The game will not take you long to beat; a couple hours at most, but this is a worthwhile game.			"

It is almost another ""2deep4u"" indie non-game like a 2D Dear Esther, however it IS actually a ""game"" (if not a very challenging or lengthy one) and it DOES have a coherent story.Its strengths are the visuals, and atmosphere it creates. The levels are fairly creative and enjoyable to traverse. You can drink absinthe to alter reality a little, which seems like a decent gimmick but most of the time it is completely optional. With virtually no replay value I couldn't justify the base price of 10 dollars. In a sale or bundle, its worth a look if you're in the mood for something weird and relaxing.			"

												Spate is a weird game. Far more on the side of an artistic experience, more atmospheric and narrative driven, rather than a game with solid mechanics that you need to learn in order to overcome various obstacles.This by itself might put a lot of people off, as the game bundles itself with Dear Esther, Gone Home, Limbo, Braid, etc.I would definitely not pair it with Limbo and Braid. Those games had more focus on the mechanics, regardless of having just as big of an artistic approach to it.But, I certainly enjoyed Spate. I wouldn't consider it as good as most other attempts at art-sy games, but it certainly had a few great moments!In Spate, you're an alcoholic father, who has ""lost"" his little girl. You're in a twisted, dream-like land (it reminded me quite a lot of Alice Madness Returns, in a good way) in search for answers.You, and your absynthe. And because of that, you don't know what is real, and what is not. You don't know what's actually true, or what you've hallucinated in this weird world. And that's part of its charm.Visually, the game is beautiful, without a lot of strange creatures, and a world that makes you feel tiny and insignificant right from the beginning. The game is also very heavy on effects, and camera movements, so beware if you get motion sickness easily. All in all, I really like the look of the game, and trying to figure out exactly where the hell I was.A big issue, is that it performs terribly. The developer is actively trying to make it better, but it still runs pretty badly, even in very good rigs. I played at probably 30-45 fps and it didn't really impact the gameplay too much, but a smoother experience would be much better.The music was actually phenomenal! It was one of the high points for me. It has a sad feel to it, and very heavy, actually (Not in a heavy metal way, but created a very heavy atmosphere), and it was beautiful. It was fairly minimalistic, but it worked perfectly.I'm not sure if it was influenced by the players actions, but it always hit the spot for me, with its intensity. I'm very impressed with both graphic and sound design in this game, both beautifully crafted!Now, how was gameplay?Well, pretty weak, for the most part.It seemed more of a vehicle for the narrative, but just ended up feeling a bit too empty in that regard.You jump and run to the right, for the most part, with some soft platforming. A few saws here and there, some somewhat precise platforming, but there was hardly any challenge. As there shouldn't be, taken how the game was designed. It's more of a walk, enjoying the world and its looks, trying to answer the questions it brings.There were also 2 sequences where you were in a flying boat, that played a bit like flappy bird (with good maneuvering space, not unfair or anything) to keep the game fresh, but it felt out of place, and a very artificial way to keep things interesting.Then, there was the main mechanic, directly tied to the narrative. You can take a sip at your absynthe. That'll make the world even more surreal, making you dazy, but will also make you run faster and jump higher (perhaps a bit how you would feel, like it's a weight off your back, ready to face the world).You could easily beat the game without drinking anything. But you could also drink a lot, like the drunk you are!And, while they may not matter in what the game does later on, it serves as your own story. In this case, the path, and not the final goal. There were a couple of great moments where I myself felt inclined to drink (or not to), as my own interpretation of what was happening, and that's also something I didn't expect, but was very cool.The whole game is narrated by you (the character), about how things got where they are. About all that went wrong. About losing your daughter, your wife, and now your life, to the alcohol.It's up to your whether or not you try not to drink, or just drink to forget. While great in concept, it didn't quite feel as significant as it could have been, as it changes nothing, in the end (And I don't think that was the point, although it could certainly be a valid interpretation).The game has 2 endings, I believe, but they're not based on your actions , it's more of a binary choice in the last sequence of the game. And that was very disappointing. I feel that much more could have been done with the theme. I liked the narrative of the game, I've found it fairly enjoyable, and has you questioning reality, life, misery, all within a very surreal looking world. The gameplay, on the other hand, isn't as tied to it as it should. But hey, it's not too bad.The game is pretty short (most people finish it in 90minutes to 2 hours) for one playthrough, and the binary nature of the choice lacks replayability.Despite thinking the game has still a huge room for improvement, I still liked it, for what it is. It's a beautiful walk in the park, structured more as a short film than as a game, but still worth trying out if you're into these kinds of games.Wait for a sale if you think it's too short for 10$, but it's certainly an interesting one.

												I wish I didn't buy every new game that sounds interesting.  The control is bad, it makes you use the analog stick on the Xbox 360 controller and it's way to easy to crouch while trying to walk.  The animation of the character just doesn't look right, it makes me feel like the designer thought he was doing something really artistic and cool and it just turned out wrong.  I had to stop playing about 30 minutes in I just couldn't take it anymore.  The whole thing is just extremely unpolished, you can feel it from the opening menu.			"

												Looks great, has a nice voiceover, and the controls work well - there is nothing worse than a platformer that will take you ten goes to make a narrow landing that would be easy on some.The puzzles you meet progress in difficulty nicely, not painfully easy, but not insanely hard. I have now completed it, and it was well worth doing so. Quite a short game, but extremely enjoyable.			"

												Experience on Linux:- Does not work properly with Intel drivers.The game:Very simple jump n run, but it has an interresting narrative and very pretty visuals. If you like the advanced and exact twiddly finger action of SMB or Sonic, this may not be your game since the game isn't very precise with jumps and collisions. It has an element of timing, but nothing near the precision and complexity of oldschool platformers. You should buy this because you enjoy the story and the artwork. Story is OK, the artwork is fantastic!Score:3/5			"

												I just spent about a half hour playing this. At first I was under the impression that things would pick up, they'd start some interesting music to get my into the story line. But then I died and got sent back a ways and the little music that was going had stopped, the emersion broke, and then I got to spend five minutes getting past rolling pinballs because the platforming response time and just general movement is slow.I would say that about 20 of my 30 minutes playing this game have been spent holding my analog stick to the right.The narrorator was doing a pretty good job of getting me interested in his story, but then it throws you into a dialog that has no voice acting, but instead has a robot that tells you that he can in fact poop with a love of lamps. Maybe that was supposed to make me laugh, but by that point in this game I was so fed up with the slownest of the platforming and lack of music, that humor was just not going to work.The only decent part about this game is the background astetic. The character animations are below N64 standards, and I don't even want to get into the frame skipping and limited graphics options. Do not waste your time or money on this game.			"

												I really wanted to enjoy SPATE, but saying it was a decent game is stretching it. It wasn't bad, but it was far from being good. There are a lot of STRETCHING in this game. Calling it a platformer was a stretch, as a good 50 minutes of the 85 it took to beat I spent holding the 'D' key and taking a nap. There were no puzzles, and very few obstacles to keep the gameplay interesting. So Idecided to focus on the other aspects...and was STILL dissapointed. Calling the game surreal is also a stretch. There was one moment about 45 minutes in where it got weird, and I was hoping that it would keep getting stranger. It didn't. Instead, that segment was over in about 5 minutes and it was back to boredom. The story was also really dissapointing. The narrator had a nice voice, but he sounded bored out of his mind. Th story was almost non existent. Guy loses daughter, drinks, goes to find missing man on deserted island, there is another guy there. done. The end has no significance, the drink mechanic has no significance, the art has no significance. The main issue here was a MASSIVE waste of potential. The game was boring and the story was even more boring. That's really all I have to say.			"

												Alright, to be fair, this game does have some gorgeous level design. If you're looking for a stroll through some pretty levels, I guess this game is a fine choice. That said, there are a number of problems:1.) Lack of PolishThere is a serious lack of polish on this game. In the first 36 minutes of play, I had already died from glitches twice and had to restart the game once because I mysteriously lost the ability to focus on a submenu, and could only control the main menu so the submenu was seemingly impossible to get rid of.The deaths were due to falling through the floor of a see-saw-like platform twice. This same see-saw sometimes seemed to pivot really fast if I stepped on it a certain way. If I stood on it while it descended, the character would hang in the air for a moment then fall repeatedly instead of riding down smoothly, causing him to do a weird sort of dance.At some point I was also shooting cannonballs into a basket to lift up a rock. I didn't realize at first how high I was supposed to lift it so I kept shooting cannonballs into this basket, which lifted the rock comically high above the pully that was supposed to be raising it.There's also barely any sound effects in the game. Buzzsaws swoop silently around you and kill you just as silently. The music volume on the other hand varies wildly, and I kept having to adjust my volume.And while the level design was fanstic, the character you play as seems to stick out awkwardly against hte world. He doesn't seem to quite fit the art style. This game simply doesn't seem to be finished.2.) Gameplay and PhysicsThe physics in this game are pretty awkward, and that really takes any kind of fun out of the dodging/jumping challenges you have to complete. The challenges themselves are pretty uninspired, and just don't really even seem to belong to the rest of the game. There is also a game mechanic where you can drink absinthe for apparently no reason other than making the screen wobbly. There is There's very little to gain from playing this game that you wouldn't gain by watching a playthrough of it.3.) Writing(Spoilers Below)While there are a few good lines, a significant portion of the monologue is reminding us over and over that the character drowns his sorrows with absinthe and that it makes him hallucinate. At the end of the game we also see the professor in the place of the bad guy for a few flahes in an apparent analogy between dependence on a machine and dependence on absinthe. I feel like the ""bad guy is you"" / ""journey of self improvement"" theme was pretty apparent long before we arrived at the end though. If there is anything subtle in this game, it was too sublte for me to catch it.The world and underlying plot are also not very well fleshed out. I understand that that may not be important in every game, but for a game where you play as a detective, the truths you uncover are pretty unsatisfying and feel very ad-hoc. The jokes are also not terribly funny.And I'm still clueless as to why our protagonist has a giant hand.(End Spoilers)It's not an ""awful"" game or anything, but pretty disappointing. I'd like to see the same artistic and musical talent in this game put into a more polished product in the future.			"

												SPATE sports some nice set pieces to surround many interesting concepts...that either don't work together or don't work flat out. The story/atmosphere (which seems to be the big selling point) aspires to be Max Payne, but it's married to SteamWorld Dig going through a bad acid trip. The story as it stands has as much to say about addiction as a potato has to say about geopolitics. That said, any potential dramatic weight is completely deflated anyway by the hilariously bad Christopher Walken impersonator charged with the narration and the bootleg Frozen clip-art used to evoke memories of your daughter.  The unrecorded dialogue is also amateurish and silly.Your character, supposedly an alcoholic detective, looks and controls more like a rough draft of Octodad - and that actually provides most of the challenges given the unimaginative platforming involved. The drinking mechanic is interesting, but only half baked in this context of this game.The result as a whole is a garbled mess. Clearly this game was a labor of love, but unfortunately love alone does not a good game make.			"

												Spate is a story driven platformer where the map around you changes but will you want to play this game ? In Spate you play as Detective Bluth. Bluth is an alchoholic who cant stop drinking after his daugter dies when an island becomes poluted which is now prohibited to every human and now named the X zone. Bluth loses his wife and becomes addicted to drinking alchochol. One day he gets an assigment to track down a weatlhy man who has disspeared in the x zone. So how is Spate ? Its one of the best game i have played in a while. Now the game is quite simple. Its a 2d platformer with a heavy story element. Now for the pros. The game has an outstanding soundtrack and Amazing Graphics. Gameplay is smooth and alot of fun. Story is great and kinda creepy too. But there is some cons to it as well. The game is incredibly short but there is two endings so you can play through it twice. Some minor bugs. Kinda wonky controls but thats about it. Overall Spate is an amazing game you need to own if you like story driven games. Spate is incredibly fun and Atmospheric game. I give Spate a 9/10 "

												Short walking simulator in platformer form, with elements of Angry Birds and Flappy Bird.The usual noir theme (family member dead, alcohol and despair) is pushed towards absinthe addiction. Mechanically you can drink it anytime - it applies some Unity filters and makes you jump higher for a couple of seconds.This drinking mechanic is virtually useless - during long walks with bits of narrative it's used 2 times to jump higher - that's it. And in pointless single button flight sections (2 of these) or no less pointless cannon sequences (3 of those) it provides no benefit whatsoever. So I conclude that it was added to make the game more 'artsy' and to tie it to whatever moralizing story this game is thought to tell.Overall, I couldn't find anything impressive or interesting in this game. Crude 3d models with distortions and particle effects didn't do it for me.			"

												Spate's visuals are gripping, ofttimes Seuss-esque, but dark. Gameplay is next to nonexistent, offering little more than a walking simulator. I encountered a couple game-breaking bugs, which generally required a game restart to remedy, and a few other lesser issues. If the story had been compelling, the problems could have easily been overlooked, but overall it was lackluster and by the end I just felt unsatisfied.			"

												Here you play as Christopher Walken in a steam punk-ish like future. You are a private eye of some sorts. You also have a troubled past. Your daughter dissappeared and you couldn't coop. Infact you grew obsessed. What do you strive for now? The past. What do you look forward to? Nothing. What dulls the pain? Drugs? Alcohol? How about absinthe.Absinthe is historically described as a distilled, highly alcoholic (45–74% ABV / 90–148 U.S. proof) beverage. It is an anise-flavoured spirit derived from botanicals, including the flowers and leaves of Artemisia absinthium (""grand wormwood""), together with green anise, sweet fennel, and other medicinal and culinary herbs. Absinthe traditionally has a natural green colour but may also be colourless. It is commonly referred to in historical literature as ""la fée verte"" (the green fairy). Although it is sometimes mistakenly referred to as a liqueur, absinthe is not traditionally bottled with added sugar; it is therefore classified as a spirit. Absinthe is traditionally bottled at a high level of alcohol by volume, but it is normally diluted with water prior to being consumed.Absinthe originated in the canton of Neuchâtel in Switzerland in the late 18th century. It rose to great popularity as an alcoholic drink in late 19th- and early 20th-century France, particularly among Parisian artists and writers. Owing in part to its association with bohemian culture, the consumption of absinthe was opposed by social conservatives and prohibitionists. Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine, Arthur Rimbaud, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Amedeo Modigliani, Pablo Picasso, Vincent van Gogh, Oscar Wilde, Aleister Crowley, Erik Satie and Alfred Jarry were all known absinthe drinkers.Absinthe has often been portrayed as a dangerously addictive psychoactive drug and hallucinogen. The chemical compound thujone, although present in the spirit in only trace amounts, was blamed for its alleged harmful effects. By 1915, absinthe had been banned in the United States and in much of Europe, including France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Austria-Hungary. Although absinthe was vilified, it has not been demonstrated to be any more dangerous than ordinary spirits. Recent studies have shown that absinthe's psychoactive properties (apart from that of the alcohol) have been exaggerated. A revival of absinthe began in the 1990s, following the adoption of modern European Union food and beverage laws that removed longstanding barriers to its production and sale. By the early 21st century, nearly 200 brands of absinthe were being produced in a dozen countries, most notably in France, Switzerland, Australia, United States, Spain, and the Czech Republic.And your character is guzzling it down as he searches for answers to his daughters dissappearence.With your wife having left you years ago, your mind is warped by the toxic green substance that is often refered to as ""The Green Fairy"". The trip you take is to an island where everything starts to take a turn for the worse the moment you step foot on it. This was the last known where abouts of your daughter, the last bastion of madness and regret. As you witness strange things you will often run into a strange but friendly robot. He speaks weird, he might be hiding something, but your goal is too important to trouble yourself with the history and purpose of this robot. You have to find out what happened to your daughter. The further you go the more absinthe you drink. You should of brought food, water, real supplies. But who needs that when you can find all the comfort, all the numbness, all the peace you will need in this dark green liquid? Surely not you.So embark, my friend, on this strange journey. Know what it is like to have lost everything, go into the middle of a river of blood and force yourself to tread on. What's the point? The end. What is the end? No one will know until it is upon us. What of all your goals and questions? Will you reach them? Will you have answers? My friend these are the wrong things to ask... Drink another long healthy swig and let us go. For what really is behind us? Nothing but despair. It is time. Lets go...  "

												Hard to fully recommend howeverThis game is stunning to look at, a fully immersive world which will grab your attention and hold it to the very end.However the story is incredibly basic, relying on a lot of easy 'go to' tropes and a functional yet basic platform component. This is not a game for someone looking for a dose of gameplay or even a great story but if you want to get lost for 90minutes in a bit of interactive art this game looks and feels like a stunning piece.Graphically amazing but lacking in everything else.

												Having completed the game now (in about 90 mins), I'd say this is a decent atmospheric indie platformer. A lot of colorful backgrounds, eerie symbolisms and a certain amount of intrigue.However, when I got to the end, I frankly expected more than just to complete the game. No boss battle, or some somewhat challenging puzzle to solve? Or more to add to the story?The voice acting wasn't enchanting at all. In fact, I kinda wished there was no voice-acting in the game. It felt way too jarring, the way there would be just the background music then suddenly somebody narrating. And there was no cohesion whatsoever to the story.Imagine if the voice acting was done in the same vein as Thomas Was Alone (or even Bastion). The narrator there has a brilliant voice, and it never felt jarring even once. Story was slowly built, and character bond created, via the narration.The voice acting/narration in Thomas Was Alone single-handedly made the game so memorable. Or else, it would have remained a freeware game on some free flash website.In addition to that, too much time was spent just pointlessly going to the right, dropping down rivers and jumping up stairs. While I agree a game like this should not have too much (and too difficult) precision platforming, there was so much room for better puzzles though.And what was with the cave sections where you fly the ship? Felt completely pointless and out of place.In the end, while I say this game is decent, it is not particularly something that has enchanted me as so many indie atmospheric platformers before this (Thomas Was Alone, The Swapper, and even Brothers, which is admittedly not a platformer). I personally did not connect to the character, and the story was lost on me. Gameplay was too sparse.Really, this is probably the first 2d walking sim I have played.As a singular developer, the dev may have been so consumed by his work that the flaws or rather weak-points may have gone unnoticed to him. Or perhaps, I just missed the point of the game.Regardless, it is a brave try. Artistically, the game looks good, though the dev really needs to work on optimizing the game. Framerate dropped by more than 50% in around 10 scenes in the game, and a further 10 times I got freezes that lasted 5 seconds.It is hard to recommend this game, but then again, it would be harsher still to rate it as not recommended"". As for the price, maybe yeah I kinda regret getting it on release, but when it goes 50 or 75% off, it should be more palatable for what is offered.			"

												Spate... a fascinating idea, a wonderful experience, a mediocre platformer.In this Steampunk 2.5D (as in all the models are 3D but the game happens entirely on a 2D plane) you play the titular ""Spate"" a man sent on a mission to find someone. Through a narrated story we find out the man lost his daughter, his wife left him and he has an absinthe addiction problem. This is where the interesting mechanic comes in - at any point during the game Spate can have a drink of absinthe, affecting his controls, the environment around him and the camera of the game. However interesting of an idea this is, like the rest of the game it just falls short of being great. With every drink the camera turns ""trippy"" and slow-motionesque, Spate can jump higher, and the environments often become creepier. But that's it. At any point of the game, that's all you can expect. There are no consequences to how much you drink or no further feedback other than the small visible changes.While the main story is narrated, the two other characters in the game, plus Spate himself (as in the entirety of the game's dialogue) is left to text without any sort of audial feedback feeling strangly out of place.The platforming itself is nothing special - the controls feel rather floaty and slow/sluggish but never really become frustrating or aggrevating - a checkpoint at literally almost every jump helps this. Despite the generous lives, the gameplay mechanics itself lack depth and mechanics. The total of activities you'll do include: jumping, firing a cannon, flying in a ship. That and the absinthe. It just doesn't feel like enough.So why is this recommended? Well, at the end of the day I had a good time with Spate. It's story is interesting, it's atmosphere is wonderful - tense, creepy, and ""trippy"" all at the same time, and the game deals with a topic rarely touched upon by modern games.While this is a recommendation, and I believe you should most definitely try Spate if you like atmosphere/story heavy games, I simply can't recommend it at full price - there are so many more rewarding, fleshed out, and expansive games available on Steam for $10 with which you can spend hundreds of hours, unlike 60-120 minutes (and that really is max) with Spate.So if it's ever on sale or in a bundle - go ahead and grab it. Despite its shortcoming its easy to tell that the single developer put a lot of heart and effort into the game.			"

												A very interesting an artfully made game, the visuals are fantastic and storyline is good. The absinth mechanic is cool, as it changes the gameplay and distorts your vision. As you can see from my play time, this is a short game, so if that is a dealbreaker, stear clear. If the game is on sale and you are hungry for a unique and beautiful game, give Spate a shot. While the visuals are entrancing, the gameplay is bland, and you'll find yourself guzzling absinth while you run through the game.There are two endings, but you have to play through the game again to see both, or look up the ending you missed.

												I had my eye on this game since it was on Kickstarter, so I got to see some aspects of the game evolve over time. I finally decided that I would set some time aside and play through it, since I was told that it wasn't very long. In short, I wasn't disappointed. I played through the game in about 90 minutes, but it's most definitely worth the $10 full price. In fact, I feel like I cheated the developer by getting the game at half price.The game's story is truly great, and the presentation is amazing. The music and visuals add so much to the atmosphere, and overall this was truly a wonderful piece of art and story. I very highly recommend Spate. Now escuse me while I go buy the soundtrack.			"

												This only barely classifies as a game. At best I could describe this as an artistic story disguised as a platformer. Come to think of it there is not much story to begin with. Narration seems to be the center of the game, walking you through depressing wanderings of a drunk, with absolutely no substance to them at all. Little inklings of a story fed to you here and there are never really expanded on just mentioned before the main character reminds you of his melancholy.Platforming aspect is as boring as I have ever seen. More often than not you are just mindlessly going forward and jumping with no challenge at all. Logic puzzles are virtually non existant. If you are looking at this game for its platforming qualities, I assure you there are none.The only quality here is the artistic background which will briefly break you out of the boredom that this game brings, but not for long. Maybe worth going through it once for that reason, at a grand total of just under an hour to finish the game. Nah, it is not.Fail 2/10			"

												If you're going to make an atmospheric walking simulator you had better damn well make sure that the story and atmosphere are top notch. This game tries and fails to do this, with the narrator either re-stating things that had just happened, or saying ""my wife and kid died and it made me sad because I drank a bunch of absinthe"" for the hundredth time. Also, making a surrealist work that literally has somebody say ""boy that sure was weird"" every-time something out of the ordinary happens is a ♥♥♥♥ing sin. Some really nice visual effects and setpices don't make up for the horrible platforming, floaty controls, and a story that sounds like it was written in a day. Also absinthe doesn't cause hallucinations you chuckle♥♥♥♥s.			"

												If I had to describe what this game was about in 3 words I'd say Alcohol, Family, and Depression.I got this game after seeing it on Steams store page and decided to buy it after being impressed with It's artwork, voice acting, and story in the trailers. This game is DARK! The nature of the game, and the overall story is really surreal, and distorted. Spate is a side scrolling story telling game where you pretty much do nothing except scroll to the side and listen to the history of the character you play.I was really impressed by Spate. The story is outstanding, the voice acting deserves an award, and the visuals altogether are brilliant. Even though this game only lasted 2 hours I can honestly say this was an experience like no other. I was fascinated by this game. It's not usually a game I would buy, but this has made me consider buying more side scrolling story telling games.Spate tells the story of an alcoholic detective who cannot get over the loss of his daughter, and collapse of his marriage. When he gets a contract to look for a missing business man on the same Island his daughter went missing the story begins to unravel...This game leaves you with two endings. It leaves you with a choice. Which one will you decide?    "

												Spate is a sidescrolling platformer spun from the mind of Eric Provan, an artist who had previously worked for the Jim Henson Company, Disney, and Sony Animation. You play as a depressed detective investigating the dissappearance of a rich business man in the ""X Zone"", a dreary, mysterious place that is plagued by endless rain and storms. Spate mixes the literal with the surreal to create a distinctive setting that is at once vivid and dream-like.        The first and also lasting impression comes from the visuals of Spate, which look very much like something from a stop-motion animation. It is as if the player were looking in at a smaller world through a maginfying glass, only to find it filled with all manner of buildings and landscapes, crafted from wood, cloth, rocks and paint. Not only does the game have a striking style of art, but the actual design is also noteworthy, from a mountain made from a head made of hardened clay, to swerving, curving, striped pillars reminiscent of a Dr.Seus illustration. And all the time, the rain falls, the wind blows, rocks glistening and grass swaying beneath a relentless storm. The end result is the sense  of a dark dream, not a nightmare, but a somber, melancholic world colored by the perceptions of the detective the player plays as. The visuals are beautifully complimented by an atmospheric soundtrack that blurs in and out, a soundscape both musical and representational of the sounds of the world.        The story is also an important part of the game, with the detective consistently narrating as the player journeys through the game's environments. The narration also reinforces the mood created by the visuals, of dark brooding and depression. We learn much of the detective, his past, his present and his attitude towards life, and especially of his addiction to drinking absyinthe and the effect this has on his mind. While the narration is effective, it doesn't quite match the stunning beauty of the visuals and audio of the game. I found the detective to sound a bit cliche and repititive. The story and the narration work, but they aren't the highlight of the game, which is unfortunate given that they are strongly focused upon.        In terms of gameplay, Spate is a well-executed if not particularly original or challenging platformer. I would definitely recommend using a USB controller as the game plays much better with a D-pad, just like most other platformers. Spate utilizes many classic tropes of the platformer genre, from springs that let you jump higher to ropes that let you swing across holes. It is a physics-based game, which does set is somewhat apart, but by and large the game plays fairly similarly to something like Donkey Kong Country. For someone experienced with the platformer genre, the game is not particularly difficult, yet is nonetheless well-designed and enjoyable. It is perhaps a particularly good game for those approaching the platformer genre for the first time, as it introduces many typical ideas of the genre without assuming the player has already mastered the basic elements of the genre.        Spate is a wonderous game if only for it`s exemplary visual and audio aesthetics. The story is decent, and the gameplay is fun, but it`s the setting and the presentation of that setting that really take your breath away. Never before have I played a game so willing to embrace surrealistic aesthetics, and with such a captivating art style. The game is rather short (I beat it in a few hours) but this is a case of quality over quantity. If you like an experimental aesthetic approach in videogames, this is definitely a game to try out. If you're looking to get acquainted with the sidescrolling platformer genre, this is also a pretty great pick. If you don't like experiemental aesthetics, or are looking for a long game with lots of challenge, this game isn't for you.			"

												Spate.....where do I start? It's kind of a odd contradiction in itself, theres a bit of good and a bit of bad. The narative is kind of fun to watch as it plays out alabiet it feels a bit flat. It's short but each level seems like it's drawn out longer. There are some interesting platforming sections, but some of the jumps outside of those sections feel like they're there to engage the player. In some sections it feels like there are some moments that are really able to draw you in, but others just kind of remind me that I'm playing a game. The main character feels resonably fleshed out, but it's as if there missing sections that I can't understand. There are creative monsters that give you a conversation, but never apear again. At the end of the day this is a fun game that is worth a look see because of the price. There seems like there could be multiple endings outside of a mere choice but I'll update if thats the case.

												Spate a wonderful game with heavy emphasis on music, narrative and an overall style I can hardly describe. It is surreal, strangely enveloping and brings all the colors and illusions you always wanted to experience for yourself unless you can't get rid of them. Combine with slow-to-come platforming were, apparently, alcohol makes you faster and jump higher, you get truly awe-inducing game. Not to mention the art style and visuals - I often felt as if Machinarium had married The City of Lost Children along with bits from Fantastic Mr. Fox' 2.5D perspective.Thus, I wholeheartedly recommend this game. It's perfect for those times when you feel like there's nothing in life but numbing away from your pain. And then it surprises you with something so otherwordly that you simply have to change your perspective.			"

												I really enjoyed this game. The story in the game was gripping enough to keep you going just to see what happens. I also found myself dying a bunch of times just because I was so into looking at the artwork. In truth my only con in this game is that it was to short. Hopefully they will have some DLC. So if your looking for a good story or something to pass the time (you know between those pesky maint. hours for  your favoriate MMO) I would give it a shot.			"

												Alrighty. This game. This game is like Limbo, except with trippiness and Absinthe. I played through it twice and can clearly say it's a worthwile game. Short, kinda linear (read: very) but the story is nice and it's well made. I recommend snagging it if you have the extra cash lying around :p "

												This game is beautiful but incredibly boring. Most of the time you can nod off and keep pressing right and you'll get to where you're going. The game would be 10 minutes if there weren't long sections of walking intended to show you some nonsensical thing in the background.Other than that the game looks nice enough save for a few parts.The verdict: not worth it.

												This only barely classifies as a game. At best I could describe this as an artistic story disguised as a platformer. Come to think of it there is not much story to begin with. Narration seems to be the center of the game, walking you through depressing wanderings of a drunk, with absolutely no substance to them at all. Little inklings of a story fed to you here and there are never really expanded on just mentioned before the main character reminds you of his melancholy.Platforming aspect is as boring as I have ever seen. More often than not you are just mindlessly going forward and jumping with no challenge at all. Logic puzzles are virtually non existant. If you are looking at this game for its platforming qualities, I assure you there are none.The only quality here is the artistic background which will briefly break you out of the boredom that this game brings, but not for long. Maybe worth going through it once for that reason, at a grand total of just under an hour to finish the game. Nah, it is not.Fail 2/10			"

												If you are trying to find a beautiful audiovisual experience which is more an art than a game then this game is way to go. If you try to find a game where you have lots of challenges in gameplay, this won't be it. As a game this is very easy to play through if you have any kind of experience about platformers before this. Still, sometimes it is very relaxing to play games which is as easy as this is, so I wouldn't say that it is a bad thing that this game was easy to play - especially because the best parts (for me at least) of this game was not the actual gameplay but music, story and graphics. Probably it is easier to think this game as an interactive audiovisual experience and art than a game. I recommend this :)			"

												Spate is a sidescrolling platformer spun from the mind of Eric Provan, an artist who had previously worked for the Jim Henson Company, Disney, and Sony Animation. You play as a depressed detective investigating the dissappearance of a rich business man in the ""X Zone"", a dreary, mysterious place that is plagued by endless rain and storms. Spate mixes the literal with the surreal to create a distinctive setting that is at once vivid and dream-like.        The first and also lasting impression comes from the visuals of Spate, which look very much like something from a stop-motion animation. It is as if the player were looking in at a smaller world through a maginfying glass, only to find it filled with all manner of buildings and landscapes, crafted from wood, cloth, rocks and paint. Not only does the game have a striking style of art, but the actual design is also noteworthy, from a mountain made from a head made of hardened clay, to swerving, curving, striped pillars reminiscent of a Dr.Seus illustration. And all the time, the rain falls, the wind blows, rocks glistening and grass swaying beneath a relentless storm. The end result is the sense  of a dark dream, not a nightmare, but a somber, melancholic world colored by the perceptions of the detective the player plays as. The visuals are beautifully complimented by an atmospheric soundtrack that blurs in and out, a soundscape both musical and representational of the sounds of the world.        The story is also an important part of the game, with the detective consistently narrating as the player journeys through the game's environments. The narration also reinforces the mood created by the visuals, of dark brooding and depression. We learn much of the detective, his past, his present and his attitude towards life, and especially of his addiction to drinking absyinthe and the effect this has on his mind. While the narration is effective, it doesn't quite match the stunning beauty of the visuals and audio of the game. I found the detective to sound a bit cliche and repititive. The story and the narration work, but they aren't the highlight of the game, which is unfortunate given that they are strongly focused upon.        In terms of gameplay, Spate is a well-executed if not particularly original or challenging platformer. I would definitely recommend using a USB controller as the game plays much better with a D-pad, just like most other platformers. Spate utilizes many classic tropes of the platformer genre, from springs that let you jump higher to ropes that let you swing across holes. It is a physics-based game, which does set is somewhat apart, but by and large the game plays fairly similarly to something like Donkey Kong Country. For someone experienced with the platformer genre, the game is not particularly difficult, yet is nonetheless well-designed and enjoyable. It is perhaps a particularly good game for those approaching the platformer genre for the first time, as it introduces many typical ideas of the genre without assuming the player has already mastered the basic elements of the genre.        Spate is a wonderous game if only for it`s exemplary visual and audio aesthetics. The story is decent, and the gameplay is fun, but it`s the setting and the presentation of that setting that really take your breath away. Never before have I played a game so willing to embrace surrealistic aesthetics, and with such a captivating art style. The game is rather short (I beat it in a few hours) but this is a case of quality over quantity. If you like an experimental aesthetic approach in videogames, this is definitely a game to try out. If you're looking to get acquainted with the sidescrolling platformer genre, this is also a pretty great pick. If you don't like experiemental aesthetics, or are looking for a long game with lots of challenge, this game isn't for you.			"

												Best platformer i've played in recent years. Spate delivers a unique experience that sets it apart fom other games of the genre. The tone and the mood make Spate a game that grips you and pulls you into the story. Dispite being a sidescrolling platformer it makes you feel a genuine connection to the protagonist, a trait that not many games can claim. If you are looking for an entertaining, thought provoking game then Spate is a great buy.			"

												This is one of those hidden gems you sometimes stumble upon by accident.The platform mechanics are simple, the puzzles you encounter aren't complicated; and you've got your basic jumping, rope climbing, sliding down slopes, and moving platforms to navigate on. If this was a basic 2d game with static graphics I probably would not like it.However, in Spate it is the combination of the striking visuals, the music, sound effects, the constant rain and shifting colors and the unusual surroundings that you encounter that make it a delight to navigate and progress through the levels.Add in some whimsical characters that you meet on your way and you have a mix of serious content with some funny dialogue in between, without it ever seeming out of place.While you progress the character you play narrates and you get to know more about what is going on, this all happens while you are still moving so the game doesn't slow down on you.The camera slowly auto zooms in or out at scripted times to show you more (or less) of the surroundings, normally I would hate that, but here it manages to enhance the experience quite nicely.The only down side I can think of saying about this game is that it is short, I finished it in 2 hours. Other than that it's a very pleasant experience from start to finish.			"

												I REALLY wanted to be able to post a positive review for this game.  I had high expectations regarding the story and visuals for this game.  The artstyle and the warping of the environment from the ""drinking absinthe"" mechanic lived up to my expectations;  It was truly a beautiful visual experience.  The music was also very fitting.Unfortunately, every other aspect of the game was lacking.  The platforming was not challenging and boring (not to mention half the game was spent just walking), the story was very cliche and redundantly paraphrased throughout the game, and aside from looking beautiful the level design was mediocre.  If as much effort was put into these game elements as was put into the visuals, Spate may have been one of my favourite Indie games of 2014.Spate had so much potential as a game, but the final result makes me feel the game should have just been a short film instead.  The game even has 2 possible endings, but in order to see both you are required the play through the ENTIRE game once again (repeating all the boring game elements).  I suggest others avoid buying this game, and at the very least just watching a Let's Play on youtube.			"

												I had my eye on this game since it was on Kickstarter, so I got to see some aspects of the game evolve over time. I finally decided that I would set some time aside and play through it, since I was told that it wasn't very long. In short, I wasn't disappointed. I played through the game in about 90 minutes, but it's most definitely worth the $10 full price. In fact, I feel like I cheated the developer by getting the game at half price.The game's story is truly great, and the presentation is amazing. The music and visuals add so much to the atmosphere, and overall this was truly a wonderful piece of art and story. I very highly recommend Spate. Now escuse me while I go buy the soundtrack.			"

												This is a game that makes me wish for a 'maybe' button under 'Do you recommend this game?' If it had one, this game would fall firmly under it.The game itself is simple.  It is a platformer that has very simple obstacles, and no enemies.  Gameplay is pretty straight forward, with one of the main abilities (drinking) being almost unnecessary for actual gameplay, considering the benefit of it is to make the game look funny and to jump higher - which never really is called for.The story is intriguing, if slightly confusing.  The dialogue is stilted and forced at times, but overall isn't too terrible.  Time-wise, I finished it in an hour and a half roughly.  Not a terrible amount of time, but perhaps a little shorter then I would have cared for.  As for visuals - this game is stunning, with dark and surreal backdrops and colourful environments.  It shifts and changes at times, and is probably the best part of the entire game.This is one of those games that doesn't have too bad of a price at full retail, but I would wait until the steam sale to acquire unless you really like games that are more like interactive movies rather then actual, full games.

												I'm left kind of neutral in this game. The game is VERY easy, but also can get caught up in some glitches (especially when jumping) that can make the game difficult at times. I was attracted to this game because of some of the artist (both musically, visually, voice acting) that were involved with this project. *The Trailer's music and and footage collection does actually over hype the game. This game is VERY predictable and VERY depressing. Besides the drink element, there was nothing special about this game. I mean really, this is just a platformer that allows you to jump higher, in slow motion, when you drink...And I feel like they were really trying to cash in on the story selling the game, but with it being so predictable (I had a ""feeling"" that actually went down just as I thought it had at 22% of the game)W/O spoiling the ending: the choice that I made (which once you get there, could actually just make sense...) told me ""Game Over"" at the end, and considering how just over the top depressing this game was, I didnt feel the desire to go back and try the other decsion. *This game is DEFINATELY NOT worth $9.99 by any means. The two elements that stood out the most in this game was the animation and the soundtrack. Story wasnt that great honestly...*This is an opion based outlook.			"

												Spate... a fascinating idea, a wonderful experience, a mediocre platformer.In this Steampunk 2.5D (as in all the models are 3D but the game happens entirely on a 2D plane) you play the titular ""Spate"" a man sent on a mission to find someone. Through a narrated story we find out the man lost his daughter, his wife left him and he has an absinthe addiction problem. This is where the interesting mechanic comes in - at any point during the game Spate can have a drink of absinthe, affecting his controls, the environment around him and the camera of the game. However interesting of an idea this is, like the rest of the game it just falls short of being great. With every drink the camera turns ""trippy"" and slow-motionesque, Spate can jump higher, and the environments often become creepier. But that's it. At any point of the game, that's all you can expect. There are no consequences to how much you drink or no further feedback other than the small visible changes.While the main story is narrated, the two other characters in the game, plus Spate himself (as in the entirety of the game's dialogue) is left to text without any sort of audial feedback feeling strangly out of place.The platforming itself is nothing special - the controls feel rather floaty and slow/sluggish but never really become frustrating or aggrevating - a checkpoint at literally almost every jump helps this. Despite the generous lives, the gameplay mechanics itself lack depth and mechanics. The total of activities you'll do include: jumping, firing a cannon, flying in a ship. That and the absinthe. It just doesn't feel like enough.So why is this recommended? Well, at the end of the day I had a good time with Spate. It's story is interesting, it's atmosphere is wonderful - tense, creepy, and ""trippy"" all at the same time, and the game deals with a topic rarely touched upon by modern games.While this is a recommendation, and I believe you should most definitely try Spate if you like atmosphere/story heavy games, I simply can't recommend it at full price - there are so many more rewarding, fleshed out, and expansive games available on Steam for $10 with which you can spend hundreds of hours, unlike 60-120 minutes (and that really is max) with Spate.So if it's ever on sale or in a bundle - go ahead and grab it. Despite its shortcoming its easy to tell that the single developer put a lot of heart and effort into the game.			"

												If I had to describe what this game was about in 3 words I'd say Alcohol, Family, and Depression.I got this game after seeing it on Steams store page and decided to buy it after being impressed with It's artwork, voice acting, and story in the trailers. This game is DARK! The nature of the game, and the overall story is really surreal, and distorted. Spate is a side scrolling story telling game where you pretty much do nothing except scroll to the side and listen to the history of the character you play.I was really impressed by Spate. The story is outstanding, the voice acting deserves an award, and the visuals altogether are brilliant. Even though this game only lasted 2 hours I can honestly say this was an experience like no other. I was fascinated by this game. It's not usually a game I would buy, but this has made me consider buying more side scrolling story telling games.Spate tells the story of an alcoholic detective who cannot get over the loss of his daughter, and collapse of his marriage. When he gets a contract to look for a missing business man on the same Island his daughter went missing the story begins to unravel...This game leaves you with two endings. It leaves you with a choice. Which one will you decide?    "

												Spate is a wonderfully atmospheric voyage through one man's battle with his inner demons. And Absinthe.The game reminded me, somewhat, of Limbo. Though it lacks the puzzle elements of that game.It's short - I clocked in at a little under 2 hours - but an experience I really enjoyed. The sounds are just superb, and the game was one huge ASMR hit for me; it's a very relaxing experience.There are elements of ""walking  sim"", I suppose, but I felt much of that was really setting the scene and tempo, adding to the game, rather than just padding it.I'd recommend giving Spate a go, if you like a good bit of atmosphere in your games.

												This is a great, slow paced, environmental platformer.  I love absinthe.  I love the style of this game.  The narrator is excellent.  This is a perfectly chill platformer.			"

												Spate is not a bad game, but it's a disappointing one. Surreal atmosphere, gorgeous graphics, good orchestral soundtrack and voice acting : that's about it ! There are no puzzle, no challenge. Absinthe doesn't have any gameplay utility and there is nothing original about the story.			"

												Like a hybrid of Limbo and Dear Esther completely gone wrong. This is a sheer abomination with laughable gamplay, trying-too-hard atmosphere and poor dialogue.			"

												An Interesting experience, Spate was, being a walking simulator.It was short and had an unique aesthetic, the story was simple.Not much to say about the gameplay, but it could have used some more puzzlesand have some less moving forward sequences.Spate has music of only violin, and there wasn't much different tones of it hence it feels dull.All things considered6.5 / 10			"

												Best platformer i've played in recent years. Spate delivers a unique experience that sets it apart fom other games of the genre. The tone and the mood make Spate a game that grips you and pulls you into the story. Dispite being a sidescrolling platformer it makes you feel a genuine connection to the protagonist, a trait that not many games can claim. If you are looking for an entertaining, thought provoking game then Spate is a great buy.			"

												The game is fairly short, and the controls can be a bit clunky in places, making the platforming frustrating at times, but overall Spate is wonderfully atmospheric, has a unique look, and good voice acting that all make for an interesting, psychadelic noir experience.			"

												Even if the gameplay isn't that developped, I really feeled like it was pretty well made in the sense that it was the mirror of the background story of the protagonist. I really like it.I also found a funny bug which was amazing %DAnd you can stop time by drinking alcohol. This is freaking awesome.			"

												I truly enjoyed playing through this game.  It had such a great atmosphere and story to it that I ended up completing the game in one sitting.  The controls were tight, art style is amazing, and if you enjoy platformer games, I totally recommend this one.			"

												A platformer with a great story surrounding a subject worth talking about.Pros:+unique artstyle+a nice story+two great endings as well, not spoiling them, but you really have to put some time into making the ending decisionCons:-a tad bit poorly optimized-gets a bit too bizarre-lacks dialogue audio with other characters, I personally would have loved other characters with some weird audio.Overall, if you are bored and got 2 spare hours, check this one out.
