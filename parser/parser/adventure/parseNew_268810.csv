												""The scariest bit was his face""My attention was brought to this game while it was still trying to get through Steam Greenlight and was offering free keys to users willing to vote. Now the game is up, and while me and many other users are still awaiting the promised keys, this game appeared in a bundle, so I've picked it up there so I can play and review the game for all those who are still waiting. StoryAs someone who doesn't watch television, my knowledge of this was minimal until I looked it up for my review. The knowledge that the series was supposed to be reality TV just makes this so much worse. Anyway, this game has the team, along with you, a new guy who doesn't receive a name, go to see someone about some recently strangeness at the site of a Civil War battle. This really was a weak point of the game, and given I know now of the 'reality TV' series, I can only face palm at the thought that it would be so poor as well. PresentationExpressionless faces and emotionless voices. This was so bad. The characters from the TV show have some poor caricatures, most of which don't closely match the original characters. Still, they aren't so bad you couldn't match them to a photo. The fact that the faces are never changing, no matter the current events, well, that is less forgivable. The main character just has a creepy stare that never changes through the game, and the rest aren't much better. I've been informed that the voice acting isn't from the original actors either, which doesn't bother me as I've never watched it, but the poor quality of it certainly does. Little emotion to it, and bad all round. At least once you ignore the characters, the rest is at the expected level of quality for a hidden objects games. Items are clear, but don't stand out, which is what you would want from the genre. Nothing special to mention, but no more complaints from this section. ControlsPurely point and click with the mouse. The only problem here was picking up an item to use on the same screen, as where you would expect the pointer to be isn't always correct, resulting in trying to guess the correct positioning to continue on.  GameplayWith a hidden object game, there isn't a lot to the gameplay. A number of rooms to look through, finding hidden object puzzles, logic puzzles and items for solving the logic puzzles. In two of these, the game is fine. Hidden object puzzles went as expected, even if it doesn't bring anything special to the table. Locating items for the other puzzles is also simple enough. The logic puzzles, here there are some more problems to add to the list of flaws. Some of these are quite alright, while some of them seem to have no logic to them, just attempting everything until it works. One early puzzle was to get the electricity working by replacing fuses. You have several empty slots and several coloured fuses. The slots weren't marked in any way that I could see, you just tried each fuse until a small light lit up, then moved to the next. That isn't any sort of puzzle, just random guessing. If there was a logical solution, it wasn't visible to me. There were several others handled just as poorly. LifespanThis game is quite short, being under 5 hours to beat both the original campaign and the bonus content unlocked after that, though that is an acceptable length for the genre. There are also 20 achievements, but most if not all will be unlocked the first time around. There are some difficulty settings but this only effects what level of hints you will receive during the game, something I never used myself. Chances are you won't bother with this game once you have completed it the first time. ClosingOverall, this game really isn't worth a purchase, at least not at the asking price. There are many better games available capable of testing both your eyes and your mind, without inflicting the problems mentioned. 4 / 10			"

												Well it is not bad, in that I completed it and didn't feel ripped off, there weren't any technical issues.  However there are many other similar and better games on Steam that I wouldn't recommend this one unless you are starting to exhaust Steam's catalogue of hidden object games.It is not scary, there are a couple of jump scares but they don't really affect the scariness of the game.  However I did feel uncomfortable playing this game for the following reasons.The art work in general is very good.  However the character animation during dialogue is really uncanny as it is just large blinking eyes and in the group scene at the beginning strange head tilts.The characters motivation is a bit off, you play as the newest member of the paranormal investigation group, but you are given all of the equipment during the game and sent off to do almost all of the work, so you end up wanting to tell the other members of the team to get up of their backsides and do something. I would understand if you were split from the group or there was some story dynamic to make you do it, but there isn’t. An early example  is that you have to answer the phone in the back of the car on the way there, even though you are in the front passenger seat and there are four people in the back who are nearer the phone, and are more likely to know the person on the other end.  Assembling an electrical item with the technical expert next to you, because he cannot be bothered? It gets worse.Hidden Object Scenes, not too difficult to implement you would think, but these are the most annoying I have ever played. Using synonyms is ok, half hiding objects are ok, but most of the scenes have objects which require multiple actions to find.  Which is fine but there are a lot of them.  I should mention that the hidden objects appear to be the same in subsequent play throughs. Normally I would expect a scene to have 12-15 hidden objects selected out of database of a greater number of possible objects, sometimes they always include a particular object needed to advance the plot, but there is usually some variation, in this game there isn't any. This is made worse because even when you know two objects work together clicking on one with the other is difficult due to the detection of the game engine, if often doesn’t detect the click unless you click a certain part of the object but this seems to vary, and not in a predictable or intelligent way.The first hidden object scene contains 4 objects out of 12 which require multiple actions; the highest appears to be 6 out of 12. Some of the solutions are nonsensical. It is almost as bad as the famous puzzle in one of the Gabriel Knight games that requires you to place tape over a hole in a fence to chase a cat through, such that hair is stuck to the tape, which you then use to make a fake moustache to disguise yourself as a character that doesn’t have a moustache.This followed through into the other puzzles,  melt that substance with a melting point over 1000 degrees C on a campfire ok. Go to great lengths to get a source of light, even though there is an electric work light only feet away etc.Gameplay aside I felt uncomfortable playing the game for three main reasons.1) The game requires you to vandalise and steal items during you investigation at times when there is no urgency. If the game required me to steal a first aid kit to help someone who was dying, I would say fair enough, or break a car window to retrieve a phone to call for the police, well they can just bill me for the window.However the game requires me to steal and cause damage at times in the game when as far as the group is concerned, no one is in immediate danger, or the only reason to break the law is for the benefit of our investigation. Randomly destroy and damage Native American artefacts for no reason because later on you will just happen to need them, take whatever you want even though the owners are not far away, because well who cares.2) Health and safety, running into a burning building to rescue someone, dangerous but necessary. But don't worry; you won’t be doing anything like that.Instead:Instead thrill in the danger of lighting candles so you can see to fill a gas tank, because someone cannot be bothered to go back to the car and get a torch. Damage a building water supply and leave it leaking in a room with the electricity switch on, to clean a mirror to see something in the reflection which you would see by just turning around.3) Native Americans, I don't know much about Native American culture, however it is featured and plays a prominent part of the game. But it all seems very stereotypical, dream catchers - check, Indians wearing fringed buckskin - check, big head dresses - check, totem poles - check. Everything from old cowboy films before laws were brought in to stop white people in makeup playing Native Americans - check. I doubt that all of the Native American symbolism used is genuine, and even with the genuine items, I doubt that any one nation included all of these elements. It would have been less of a problem in a more fantastic setting, but the associated TV show is delivered as a documentary, and the game is set in a real world setting. It made me cringe and I am a white Englishman, so I expect it would really upset actual Native Americans. I just felt that it was all a bit racist, and apart from holding my hand up and saying ""How"", it couldn't have gotten anymore unpleasant.So I would in closing say, the game is not terrible, but almost all of the hidden object games on Steam are better. It is really only for fans of the TV show. Go play something by Artifex Mundi (Developed not just distributed by.) and you will have a better experience for a bit less money.			"

												I'm gonna be completely honest here, I hated this game, and this is coming from someone who enjoys hidden object games quite a bit.  This review will be based on the game's merits regardless of the fact that I received it free, as I think that would be unfair to anyone looking to purchase it.Let me first state that I am not a fan of the premise...at...all.  I've never watched the show, but even so, the whole paranormal investigator thing is so hokey and contrived that it right off the bat turned me off.  Despite the story, I was willing to give the game a chance focusing on the gameplay; it's not as if HOGs have the greatest narratives in gaming anyway, and it's usually the artwork, atmosphere and gameplay that keeps me entertained.In all honesty, the artwork is pretty decent, at least the non-character graphics.  They're pretty much par for the course in the genre and are pleasant enough to look at.  The character models though, boy...again, I haven't watched the show, but I found the characters' emotionless stares far more creepy than anything the ghosts toss at you.  And the somewhat monotone voice acting doesn't help them either.The gameplay in the adventure portions was average, nothing I haven't seen before.  The puzzles were OK, again, nothing I haven't seen before, but mildly stimulating all the same.  The hidden object scenes, though, I grit my teeth even thinking about them.  It's kind of hard to mess these up, but they managed to do it here.  For one, there are way too many multi-action items; 2-3 per scene is usually pretty good, but later in the game nearly half of the items in each scene require 2-3 steps to clear.  Ok, no big deal...but some of the actions are so illogical, I don't know how they expected people to figure them out without either clicking on everything like crazy or taking the easy route and using the help button, which I usually avoid at all costs but used more times than I can count because I just didn't have to patience for this game.  Other items were what I would consider deceptively hidden, which is something I will always criticize as an artificial means of adding difficulty.  The best hidden object scenes utilize clever synonyms and unique word usage to add difficulty as well as help improve vocabulary, but that's rarely the case here.  And I haven't even mentioned the buggy cursor that wouldn't select/pick up certain items without clicking 20+ times trying to find the right pixel to trigger...Bottom line, the gameplay was not enough to make up for the stinker of a premise/story.  Folks, there are a LOT better hidden object games out there to spend your money on.  I would advise avoiding this one unless you're a rabid fan of the TV show and need a fix or end up getting it in a bundle.			"

												Casual level of difficulty for the Hidden Object Puzzles, but also a good story for Veteran Mystery game fans meaning you can be 93.14% sure you will enjoy this game.  Lots of different puzzles to keep things interesting.  This game is based on an A&E show, players are a member of a college club called the Paranormal Research Society, or as the cool kids say PRS.  In Poison Spring all kinds of creepy stuff happen, and the game is even scary as well at parts!  One of the characters Ryan Buell just looks creepy, the characters in cinematics look expressionless which also makes it eerie.  Dont let steelhands get away with his master plan to decieve this group of pesky kids, they are supposed to be in college but they all look way to old and one of them looks 90 so not sure what that is about.  Feels pretty short, after beating the game is a bonus game where you return to the dreaded Poison Spring to solve yet another mystery.  The puzzles are very well put together, the hidden object parts really fit and dont look like a garage sale vomited stuff all over, each part has a sound, or most do making it feel in depth.  Be careful behind some objects are ghosts!  Lots of those weird ghost hunting gadgets from the audio device to the camera and a digital signature thing is in the game making you feel all x filey.Here is a link for history buffs:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Poison_Spring*If game is blinking, right click the exe and set it to disable DPI scaling... Problem solved :DTurn out the lights, use only a candle while playing for maximum chills and thrills!Rating:  10/10  Value:  $7.99			"

												This game is not just a HOG (hidden object game), it also has the elements of a point and click adventure.   This is my first time playing a HOG that is both a HOG and a Point and Click adventure game, and let me tell you, it is a lot of fun.  When I played other HOGs I got bored of doing nothing but hidden object scenes non-stop, and I often would not even finish the game.   This game, I see myself finishing and maybe even coming back to play again a 2nd time.   The game is that much fun and it is never boring.   In between doing hidden objects, you got plenty of mini-games and puzzles to solve.   I highly recommend that nobody who plays this game, use the skip button on any mini-game.   The fun of this game is solving the mini-games and puzzles.  If you skip them, then you are losing out on a lot of the fun.  One of the things that makes this game great is that the hidden object scenes ""fit"".   In other HOG games, the hidden object scenes would not fit.   Like a cemetery scene that was so cluttered that it didn't even look like a real cemetery.   In this game, every hidden object scene feels like it is part of the world.   I would say the scenes fit into the world about 95% of the way in this game, and that is pretty good.   Every HOG game has a lot of hidden objects that don't belong in a certain place, so no scene will fit 100% but fitting about 95% is pretty good.  One of the things that makes this game both unique and great, is that there are interactive objects in the hidden object scenes.   For example, you may have to cut something open.  So you first need to find the right item that is able to cut the thing open, and then you need to do it.   I ran into some interesting interactive objects during my time playing so far, such as the spider web.   I don't want to give away any spoilers so I won't say anymore about the spider web.   But I will say, it makes this a unique game in having these interactive objects.  Having them in the game also makes it more interesting and fun.Another thing that makes this game great, is you feel motivated to continue playing the game until you finish it.   Other HOG games, I got bored with, but not with this game.   This game, I feel motivated to play.   I just started playing the game today, and I played for almost 3 hours in one day.   I will finish the game in the next few days.   What keeps me motivated is that every time you finish a hidden object scene, you get rewarded with an object that you can use in the point and click adventure part of the game.    Also as I said earlier in the review, it is not nothing but hidden object scenes, so you have variety in this game.   The variety keeps me interested and motivated.    I plan to solve every mini-game and puzzle in the game, without using a walkthrough.   Even if that means taking a little longer then other people to finish the game.   I will get more fun out of the game that way.I highly recommend this game for people who enjoy HOGs, especially if you like a HOG with point and click adventure elements in it.			"

												I hear this is based on some TV show on A&E that I've never seen because our waxen-faced hero there won't shut the ♥♥♥♥ up about it for the first 5 minutes of gameplay. He's the leader of some rag-tag Scooby gang that goes around and uses their dad's spare electronics to pretend ghosts exist. Some♥♥♥♥♥♥s going down in a state park built on an old Civil War battleground and you get to help them suss it out.Aside from the fearless leader and the contrived-as-hell plot, this is a very solid game. The graphics are clear and detailed, which you would think would be a regular priority in games where you have to find things. It really does make a huge difference in the item searches, which are a small step backwards from Infected in that you have to find some really obtuse, nonsensical items like shadows and symbols. They're still quite fun and seem easier than in similar games. The puzzles are also great, clearly explained and easy to get the hang of, but still provide a decent challenge. The detail extends to the environments you navigate, with lots of things to examine and learn more about the park from. There are even some hidden objects scattered around the map to find just for fun. I think this one makes a perfect entry-level hidden object game for people new to the genre, and is polished and fun enough for veterans as well. Thumbs up.Seriously though, he makes that kind of face through the entire game.			"

												TBH, I used to watch this TV show for amusement... the 22 minute per episode format was always edited so that each episode fit as many of the ""token things associated with the paranormal"" as it could into that small timeframe. There were spiritboards, cemetaries under the properties,  demonic possessions, EVPs, thermal readings, exorcisms, etc. Everything that one associates with the paranormal from mythology to spirtuality to gadgetry... all crammed into each 22 minute episode.This game is a lot like that... it's somewhat short (much longer than 22 minutes) and you will experience all of the typical stuff you associate with paranormal research and especially with the show Paranormal State.SPOILERS:At the center is Native American lore, wrapped around the story of ghosts of forbidden lovers, in the midst of a demonic possession (see, I told you this title was like the TV show with a bunch of stuff packed in)... and you can just use your imagination to go from there... you will use dowsing rods, spirit boards, EVP recorders, thermal imaging... all of it... to save the day for the Paranormal State crew.It's mildly entertaining, but don't expect much unless you find amusement of whatever sort in the TV show.Complaint: No Chip Coffey in the game.Highlight: Upon game launch, Ryan Buells eyes blinking creepily at you.

												I don't usually like hidden object games, because the gameplay tends to be really shallow, but this effort wasn't too bad. Now whilst I may not be particularly savvy when it comes this particular subset of puzzle genre, it seems to offer slightly more in the gameplay department than others I've played due mainly to puzzles working on a multi-tiered basis; moving items will reveal a previously inaccessible item behind it for instance.This version comes with quite a few extras like wallpapers, artwork, team profiles, achievements and a trailer, though the biggest bonus is in the extra adventure game you may access after having completed the main quest.Not too bad then.

												Great hidden object adventure game.  Some good tough puzzles that had me trying multiple times before I finally was able to solve them.  Though never too tough where you'd be frustrated.  The graphics were perfect, and what you'd expect from this type of game.  The hidden object scenes on the other hand were very tough since many of the scenes required multiple objects to be used to finally get to the item you were looking for.  Personally, I enjoyed the difficulty when compared to other hidden object games that I've played in the past.The story was constantly in your face and didn't take a back seat to the game, however, there was nothing too impressive about the story itself.  Overally, a great game that I would definitely recommend, especially if you're into this type of genre.			"

												Storyline: A paranormal investigative team led by Ryan Buell is called to Poison Springs state park due to ""hauntings"" after an archeologist uncovers some civil war relics.  Fictional Poison Springs was the scene of a civil war battle where the union soldiers were to sent to stop a supply shipment to the conferate army.  During the course of the investigation, the ghosts of a conferate civil war soldier and a Cherokee girl help guide the team to discover the source of the ""hauntings"".  Of course, the team is also there to stop the ""hauntings"" as well, and they have called in the help of Lorraine Warren, a renown spiritual exocist.   First I would like to address various reviews which point out this was made in conjunction with A&E (TV network) about a most likely popular show called ""Paranormal State"".  I have never seen the show or even heard of it before reading the reviews (after I played the game).  So my opinion about this is: fan service, big deal.  Half the anime shows on TV and many games on Steam are fan service.  (Shrug)  The second thing: It seems everyone points out this game is about the paranormal, and they use the word paranormal when stating, in most cases, why they do not like the premise.  Would the word ghosts have been better?  I notice no one complains about ghosts.  My one and only complaint is this arena of real people being depicted in a fan service fictional game is the developers and A&E really should have used the actual real people to do the voices, not voice actors.  It is fan service after all.  Gameplay:  This game is more point and click then Hidden Object.  Being a fan service game, it is very simple and meant for a wider and most likely non-gaming or at least non-Hidden Object/ point and click gaming audience.  There is some backtracking and some relatively pointless back and forth movement as the gamer is the ""newest team member"" gets sent to the other team members to get equipment or information.  Also as the newest member the gamer gets all ""the work"".  This game being designed as a nearly interactive game ends up bordering on annoying for someone like me who is a HO junkie.  On one side of that annoyance is team leader Ryan Buell who almost comes off as a jerk by sending his newest member to do all the tasks while he and his team sits about.  Yet on the other side of that annoyance is the gamer is interactive in the investigation and gets to play with all the ""toys"".  I must say playing with all the ""toys"" is actually what made the game for me, as well as the actual real life way the investigation is presented such as research and talking with people.  (Though the gamer is only given that information since other team members are responsible for that.) The gameplay is set up in about 5 scenerios which depending on your point of view may or may not seem out of place or illogical in progression.  Maintaining the investigative spirit while playing makes the progression logical, as facts and information are uncovered by the team and pointed out by the helpful ghosts.  Puzzles/Hidden Object scenes:  OOOOH .... I really liked the actual puzzles.  Those were definitely brain twisters and some out-of-box thinking.  Most if I remember correctly were old fashioned logic puzzles, and a couple the hair pulling kind.  The Hidden Objects scenes were easy and solvable in a couple of minutes.     Overall: The game was worth the play, and I would rate it family oriented.  Nothing too hard, the premise fair enough and for those who are not into ""paranormal"" just leave ""reality"" at the door and think ghosts instead.  As I said before this is fan service and should be treated as such.			"

Pros :Easy achievements. Perfect for achievement hunter.Trading Cards.Rather long gameplay & bonus game. As a fan of HOG, I like it.Cons :Bad voice acting. Especially Ryan's voice. They are not live up to their role.Some objectives are missing dialog, Makes me confused of what to do.I've experienced a bug in bonus game where the stairs in the bar didn't appeared and somehow appeared after I re-entered the bar multiple times. The hint pointed the ceiling but nothing can be clicked.Neutral :The minigames are too easy. Maybe some of you like easier puzzle, but not in my case. I prefer harder puzzle.10/10 for easy achievement and trading cards :DI recommend this game for achievement hunters out there. "

												First of all: Don't get this game for the full price.The horror tag must have been added by people who are very easily scared. This is not a horror themed game at all. It's mildly spooky at best. The game itself is an adventure game with quite frustrating and random hidden object scenes and some odd puzzles thrown in. The hidden object scenes require a ridiculous amount of interaction to reveal some of the objects. This adds to the adventure character of the game, but it certainly feels like a missed point in a hidden object scene. The game might have benefited from a traditional point and click approach.Also some of the puzzles feel really forced (match barely identifiable symbol to match their 'yummy' partner for instance) and rather take away from the game. The story isn't really good and neither is the animation (almost none anyway) or the voice acting. Granted the voice acting isn't terrible either, but it fails to deliver any suspense. The graphics and sounds otherwise are good.I'd say for half the price this game isn't a bad way to spend 2-3 hours. There's a pretty decent game in there that got messed up by bad design mistakes. Still worth a play for a couple of bucks.			"

Short version: 61%Poison Spring is a mediocre hidden object game with decent art style, no difficulty, a boring story, and a bunch of really bored actors.Long version:Paranormal State: Poison Spring is supposed to be a tie-in game of the American “docudrama” show of the same name, despite the fact that none of the characters look like the cast.The storyline is of a generic hidden object game about a few investigators, ghosts (from the American Civil War), shamanistic magic, and an obligatory dark entity to banish. The plot just moves whenever the writer realised something should happen, and the actors read everything with the same bored tone.As a game it offers one challenge, the terrible hit detection… because the 20-30 objects per scene sure won’t provide any trouble. Same goes for the puzzles– except one, which will be a nightmare fuel for many of those who want to complete the game without the Skip button.If you liked (or, well, remember) the original show, or you just ran out of all other hidden object games, this may be worth on a sale, but otherwise stick to the better titles.

												This game was a little disappointing. But only a little so.The graphics of this HOG game are ok, it is an collectors edition with additional contents and the sound is atmospheric, only at the end the sound can be quite unnerving.The reason for the disappointment was in fact, that the game crashed several times after solving either a HOG-scene or using the thermal-camera in the game. It happened about eight times during the run of the game. But that might also have something to do with a defect Steam-Overlay or some update crashes.I played it through, the story was ok, even if a bit too cheesy. The hidden object scenes were on a quite easy level, even on expert mode. The riddles were also quite simple, but also entertaining. This game is a casual game, so I didn't expect more about that. The game was rewarding during it's course of run. I would say that a younger audience might have a lot of fun with this game ... and it might even surprise older players. It plays like an adventure game often, so you don't have the feeling you are stuck in a ""HOG-Scene after HOG-Scene"" nightmare.The important question is, can I recomend this game? I would say yes, even though there are minor issues, for example the price is a tad too high for a HOG game with about four to six hours of playtime. But if you get a 50 %, 66 % or even a 90 % coupon, or if this game is cheap in a bundle or in a sale, you might think about adding this game to your library. Another issues is the repeated crashing on one of my machines, without any real reason behind this weird behaviour - but since this game has a good step for step save game, you aren't forced to replay too much of the content you already solved (in fact, it seemed that the crashs happened after the checkpoint was saved - so you could in my case just end the task and restart right were you were kicked out of the story). Another thing was the sound at the end of the story, it wore down my normaly quite strong nerves with this pulsing, crunchy sound in the background - just enervating, not horror just plain enervating - like horse flies in the summer after you had a long dive in the pool and lie down on your chair to savour your well earned glass of scotch...

												I really enjoyed this game. It is a hidden object game with creepy theme. Kinda easy but addictive. It takes about 7 hours to beat it fully with the special chapter.Un juego bastante entretenido en el cual debes buscar objetos ocultos, realizar algunos puzzles, etc, para poder avanzar en la historia. No es un super juego pero al menos yo lo disfruté. No me quedé atascado en ningún puzzle por lo cual lo considero facilito, pero a la vez me resultó bastante adictivo. 7 horas tardé en pasármelo, incluyendo el capítulo extra.			"

												The ""acting"" alone is worth a good laugh. So if you can get this game cheap enough, go for it. Its a decent hidden object game, not great, but I've honestly yet to find one that's actually ""great"". They're all fun, regardless of how cheesey the acting or how bad the graphics. But honestly, this one takes the cake for cheesey acting. Like to the point its become a running joke in my friend group after I shared a screen shot of it. Its bordering ""So bad its good"", but its mostly just laughably bad.Still a decent game though, as far as I can remember.			"

												I got this game off a bundle, and if you did, too, you might want to actually play it.The game is mostly a collection of puzzles, many of the ""hidden object"" type (some objects in the scenes require actions to uncover them), some are logical, and some are adventure-style inventory puzzles. You can skip every one if you want, or get a hint on the hidden object ones, and there are 3 levels of hinting that you can set as the game difficulty. Also, in this edition the journal contains a complete ""strategy guide"" which is a step-by-step walkthrough. The collection is held together by a story taking place on a number of pre-drawn screens (with next to no animation) and competent voice-acting. The story and gameplay is mostly linear, and you can check the map to see where you need to be to progress. You'll be traveling back and forth a lot as new puzzles might be unlocked for you later. There is a short bonus chapter tacked on that is interesting not so much for its three puzzles, but rather for another take on the same scenes you saw in the main game.I found it a diverse collection of puzzles married to a casual adventure; granted, it's not exceptional, but for its budget, it is well executed, and if you don't skip too often, should keep you pleasantly occupied for a few hours.

												Not going to lie - this is not exactly the second coming of Baldur's Gate - but for what it is - a cheesy as anything puzzle game distraction for a few hours it didn't outstay it's welcome - the puzzles were never frustrating and the thing didn't crash or bug out at any point.

												What the others said: bad voices, bad characters graphics, terrible 'Hot spot' in some scenes where clicking becomes awful, ridiculous teen story filled with clichés, the other characters that do... nothing.  I'll add bad sfx to the list, way too much backtracking, some bad translations for the objects lists (still acceptable though) and you're often wondering where to go next since walking back & forth is the main gameplay; it leaves you dizzy lol. Didn't like the 'find the wolf' thing as it's badly done: a tiny puppy statue seems really silly, I'm still missing 2 wolves and there's a statue that only gives me a text 'That's a wolf statue!' instead of validating the find... What I liked though are the HOG scenes graphics and the actions to do in it, quite original and IMO all logical, the occasional WTF was solved with the hint button. The problem came from the clicking zones, quite fiddly. The locations graphics are also gorgeous.TLDR Summary: Badly done, it feels unfinished. They should have tested it out more.			"

												A solid hidden object game from someone other than Artifex Mundi for a change. The puzzles here are much better than you usually get, and include a few dexterity minigames too. There are tons of hidden object scenes too, which you don't get so much of in newer titles. If you liked the first Enigmatis, this is a good bet, as the production values, feature set, and puzzle to hidden object ratio are similar.The only negative is that the hotspots are tiny. If you remember to click with the top left pixel of whatever thing you're using -- rather than what visually makes sense -- everything goes smoothly. For example, if you get a set of keys and the keyfob is on the top left corner, put the fob into the lock, not the key. You get used to it quickly.			"

												Solid mix of HiddenObject and adventure game elements. Story is a rather cliche ghost story and nothing special, but the environments are well done and unlike most other HOGs you aren't soloing through the story, but have a gang of other paranormal investigators around, which gives it a bit of a unique feel.Only real problem I had with the game was the ending, which came in the form of a three second cutscene and felt just way to short. Even the epilogue bonus content suffered from the same problem.Never seen or even heard of the TV show it's based on.I did ran into a dead-end/perma-crash issue early in the game, but a restart fixed that and I didn't have any other problems.

												So, as embarrassing as it is to admit to all my very close friends here on Steam, I've watched way too many of these reality TV, ghost-hunting shows (including this one). And every time I watch one I'm always like, ""...look at these goofballs running around town 'helping' even bigger gullible goofballs with what they stupidly think are ghosts, but actually have a totally rational scientific expla...  Oh holy freakin' sh#t! Did you see that?!?! What the hell was that??? Oh man, that some scary sh#t! No way in hell I'd stay in that house...""  Yeah, it's not something I'm proud of.Anyway, I think this game nicely captures the more subtle, unintentionally humorous aspects of the reality TV ghost-hunting genre. If you're a ""fan"" of this sort of thing, you might get a kick out of this game. As some other reviews mention, you play the newest member on the ""team"" and are very excited about your first mission. However, although they never even so much as mention the disproportionate risk, you soon come to find out your hardened, paranormal investigator teammates seem to have no trouble at all sending you into what is obviously harm's way so that they have time to show off their finely honed, particular set of skills (e.g., interviews, setting up the shot, helping the museum curator with emotional issues, and/or waiting to see if you make it back alive). I thought the entire thing was hilarious. The game itself is an okay P&C/HOG. The graphics are crisp, the mini games/puzzles are about average, and there's plenty of game to play. I got it on sale for a couple bucks and have no regrets. Played well for me on Linux Mint 18.PS I almost exclusively play offline. I typically only play online long enough for Steam to allow me to write a review. So Steam only shows that I played 0.1 hrs as of the time of this review, although I've played at least 6 hrs and have completed both games.			"

												I feel like I should state before I give my review of the game that I got Paranormal State: Poison Spring free through a promotion on an Indie site and that it does not reflect my opinion of the game and that the promotion had nothing to do with giving a review for this game.I've been playing quite a few hidden object games lately and had run out so I was quite glad to get this. It's a very solid hidden object game though I'm not quite sure on the price or the TV show background. (Who watches TV anymore?)Pros:- Great art for the scenery, the objects, and the characters (I will get back to the characters part...)- I can't recall any objects being reused In the actual hidden object puzzles throughout the entire game, that's impressive.- Three difficulty to chose from that actually affect the game it self instead of just the hint timer.- Voice acting done well- A nice selection of mini games.- Some replayability (Holy crap a Hidden Object game with some replayability?) This game has something I haven't seen in a hidden object game before, After beating the main story it actually has bonus levels that weren't included in the actual story so they aren't just rehashes. Major points in my book.- Steam Achievement and Steam Trading Cards- Between 4 - 6 hours of gameplay for the main story plus the bonus after story.- Decent story giving you a reason to go from area to area.Cons:- Characters (oh the characters...) While the artwork for the characters was amazingly well drawn I found them boring and unmemorable, the only memorable feature about them was the fact that through the entire game the only animation they have is that they blink every few seconds, Even though they could have gone with mouth moving for the voice acting they went with blinking. (WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?)- No Quick travel, Which goes with my next point (You have a map telling you where you need to go why can't you just click on that scene? Maybe other Hidden Object Games have spoiled me.)- Lots of back tracking. (Seriously, Lots.)Overall Score: 10/10 Even with the things I mentioned in the cons I have to give this game a 10 out of 10 for the things I mentioned in the pros, Especially the replayability due to the actual difficulty differences and the bonus after story. The only real sticking point I can see is the price, Sure I got it for free but 10$ feels like a lot for a Hidden Object game although I understand they have to pay the artists, programmers and voice actors hidden object games get really low in price on steam so it might make the difference to many between buying it or not. If you like Hidden Object games and the price doesn't bother you Buy it, it's great. If that price is a bit much pick it up on sale it's well worth it.			"

												Paranormal State was a documentary show about the real efforts of Ryan Buell and his best friends to become Ghostbusters. He is joined by Eiffel 65 (some hippie woman), Sergei Federov (a tech guy), Hurricane Katrina (the interview woman), his gramma Lorraine, and some other woman with a creepy smile as they struggle to discover the sinister events occurring at Poison Spring. This game is a documentary, and the events were filmed in real time.From a gameplay standpoint, PS:PS is solid. The hidden object scenes are a tad on the easy side, but they never repeat themselves, The other puzzles tend to be enjoyably difficult, with the exception of two Tower of Hanoi (more like Tower of ANNOY) puzzles that show up, and a boring 'jump stones over other stones until only one's left' puzzle. The story itself is pretty unusual, for being based on real events. (After all, something with the name Paranormal State would never lie about ghosts, right?) The Ghostbusters roll into Poison Spring to help Iris (the curator of the park) fend off the Cherokee version of Satan, along with the help of some old fogey Indiana Jones wannabe (seriously, the dude has fedoras all over the place, and a whip, and he has a poster of Indy in his tent). You also meet the ghosts of a black Union soldier and his Cherokee lover, the daughter of the dude who summoned the Cherokee Satan in the first place (so, your typical Romeo and Juliet stuff). I really had no idea the Civil War was almost decided by a demon summoning, so this game is truly edutainment. (That couldn't be wrong, could it? After all, a show with the integrity of Paranormal State would never lie...would it? ...Nahhhh!)Overall, a fine experience for any fan of HOGs, or the show this was adapted from. Plus, an extra 10/10 for demonstrably proving the existence of demons, life after death, and time travel (since I found sushi in a Native American grave that had been sealed since the Civil War).

												Paranormal State Poison Spring is a hidden object game about a paranormal case, mixed with some point-and-clicking. It isn't scary; it's meant to be played as a casual game. And by now we've played hundreds of these games already, right ? So... the big question: does this bring anything new to the table ? I'm sorry to say that the answer is no.If you want to play something scary try a true survival horror game and if you want something casual try one or more of the hundreds and hundreds of titles already available. New ones get added on a weekly basis these days.Still, not bad. But not unique either.[Rating; 72/100]			"

												I really, really wish that Steam offered the equivalent of a ""meh"".  This wasn't awful, but it's wasn't particularly good either.The story is ""meh"". It's not entirely believable (not that HO games are particularly engrossing or believable), but using Native American lore did give it a bit of intrigue for me. Still, it  could have been a lot better. It's just kind of ... there.I had no idea about the show this is based on prior to playing it. But seeing as how the main characters are from the show, the voice acting was well above average for HO games for the most part.  There were definitey some lows to the voice acting, especially at the conclusion where the voice acting was completely wooden.With regards to the gameplay, it's standard HO fare. All of the achievements can be done in one play-through; however, the one achievement to complete an HO game in less than a minute is way more difficult than you might think. *EVERY* HO minigame had multiple items that required multiple steps and some items are very well hidden.The art design is an awkward mix between real life characters and the standard hand-painted, HO fare. Faces don't offer a lot of emotion and some of the expression choices are eye-rolling and totally hokey, like the lead pulling a ""Home Alone Kevin"" with this hands on his face as a show of totally weak surprise.Music? Meh. It was nice to hear some Native flutes in the background once in a while, but it was otherwise unremarkable.I understand why so many people have given this a thumbs down. It's NOT a good game. But I've played many other HO games that are far worse. Comparatively speaking, this one isn't a particularly painful way to spend a few hours, but there are other HO games that are far superior.Definitely save this one for a Steam sale with a STEEP discount.

												Uncanny valley alert! Apparently this game is based on a TV show, so they've probably done a decent job of illustrating the real people from there, but.. woah. The voice acting is mostly decent (except for one specific character who doesn't talk that much, thank-you-very-much)Apart from that, this is a pretty solid HOG. Most scenes are only used once, and the objects aren't too hard to find - though the hitboxes are a bit too specific leading to pixel hunting when combining items. The puzzles are also on a nice difficulty level.That you were a part of a team was a nice touch, even though the other members just prepared the scenes off-screen.(My recorded playtime is a bit bloated, as I left the game running while doing other things. Slightly less than 3 hours for the game + the extra content)			"

												Very easy, short length, casual Hidden Object game.Story is interesting and well spread throughout the game, with a very short bonus chapter. The actors and voice are fairly cheesy, pretty much what you'd expect from 'paranormal investigators'. The graphics and sound fit and but are not ageing well. While it is a little dark and grim in places, it's more light spook than horror.The Hidden Object puzzles are nicely presented scenes, lots to find, only a couple of glitchy moments.Nearly all the logic puzzles have the answer provided in clues found nearby and all but one are very easy.There is a map - but the teleport is from a single location, the areas are close together so backtracking is not too bad. Also an in game guide included if you get stuck.Achievements are super easy to 100% as nearly all are collected as you play normally.This is a very easy game suitable for crayon-eaters.			"

												An Investigation Discovery case: Haunted museum in the forest! Wooha, creepy meepy isn't it? Do not scream, the horror-o-meter is low.I don't know if ghosts do exist or not, but I think this is somewhat similar when two children are talking about games, future kid says that he have 200 games on Steam account and the kid from the past asks can I see em? So future (rather present) kid answers like, sorry, they physically do not exist. So I think most of the things can be answered by science. Either way, there is one thing I am sure, lots of people can make a living from the paranormal and esoteric business. (Not the game devs of course). So, a small team of professional people decided to face the haunting past, their adventure is fairly exceptional. Great puzzles with logic, no nonsense pairings and such riddles, unlike in the similar point and click games. 5-6 hours of gameplay, good graphics, interesting story - good buy I say.			"

												A fairly run of the mill hidden object game with a TV tie in (I have never seen any of them and don't even really recognize the actors although no doubt this will add something for fans of the series) - essentially you get to join the regular gang as a new team member that specializes in falling down holes and generally being a gopher and repairman while the rest of the cast stand around investigating the spooky stuff - at one point the team leader even shows off his amazing skills of opening a door, but most of the time you will be the one doing everything here (fair enough it is a game and just watching them do everything wouldn't be great, but you have the sneaking suspicion the reason the plot has you seperated from the team so much is to avoid the actors having to do more than minimal voice over work for the game).Anyway the plot seems fairly standard spooky TV series material and is fairly decent for HOG game standards, and the graphics are nice and clear and make the hidden object scenes fairly easy (although they have lots of objects, multiple objects and multi-step objects - getting the 1 minute achievement the first time on any scene would be very good going). The puzzles are mostly pretty easy, although I suck at the peg board jumping over one so I had to skip that particular, but fairly varied. There tends to be no explanation of why everyone has weird puzzle locks on their doors and handbags, but that is so common in the genre it hardly even counts as a negative. One note on achievements is that there is a certain part after completing the old house where half the areas previously unlocked are now unavailable (including the old house itself), so ensure you have found all the collectibles before finishing this part or you will need to replay most of the game again (luckily you don't have to get all 20 in one playthrough if you mess up and miss a couple like I did). Otherwise you will mostly be able to get all the achievements in one playthrough (minus the 1 minute HOG timer which probably will require redoing the first one or two scenes knowing where everything is).The point and click sections between are mostly fairly good, although prone to the common hidden object game flaw that half the game could be saved by a protaganist that thinks to bring along a basic set of common tools like screwdrivers, hammers, knives, etc. and didn't throw them away every time they are used. Otherwise they are mostly reasonably logical, or at least not completely silly and immersion breaking anyway. There are also some sections where you use some spook detecting equipment - some equivalent of a ghostbusters style PKE meter which needs you to find symbols randomly scattered around a screen, a heat camera which is a simple tile swapping/matching exercise, and a noise recorder where you have to fiddle with the amplitude and volume of a recording to match the target line. Oh and plus a metal detector you use once. These all are done fairly well and add a bit more variety to things.Overall it is fine, if a bit cheesy, so if you have an evening to waste it is an okay option, especially at the current price. Probably more for fans of the series, but it isn't so bad anyone else that likes this genre won't get on fine with it.			"

A good HOG that puts additional effort into storytellingParanormal State is a reality TV show. Never watched it. This game follows the show's cast of paranormal investigators as they work a case in the Poison Spring Battleground state park in Arkansas.What I enjoyedWell presented. The music, artwork and voice acting are pretty good.A balanced mix of HO scenes, puzzles, and item hunting and combining.The HO scenes require you to access certain objects by interacting with others.In-game journal fleshes out the story and keeps track of your objectives.Mini-games such as a metal-detector-like EVP sensor add some variety.The story is better that in most HOGs in that it has a steady pace and is almost thrilling, helped by the moody music and frequent spooks and scares.Finishing the main game gives you access to a bonus chapter. It's short, and the voice acting is ah, not as refined in it, but it's nice to have.Extra content such as wallpapers, character profiles and such. I didn't peruse them, but for fans of the show this is a nice touch.What I didn't likeAlthough the artwork is pretty great, the characters themselves are firmly wedged in the uncanny valley. Faces look just off. Especially with blinking eyes on those static portraits.Although it's clear that much thought has gone into guiding the player to avoid hesitation, sometimes you do find yourself wondering what to do next. The hint system is pretty helpful, but it got confused a couple times and led me to the wrong spots. Most of the time it's fine, though.Clickable areas on objects may be fiddly, especially when combining items.I missed on a collectibles achievement because the game locks you out of a big chunk of the locations after a certain point. I had 19 out of 20 collectibles found. Bummer.All in all a better than average HOG. Worth the 10$ asking price? Yeah, I'd say so. And definitely so if on discount.			"

												Oh, I so wish there was a ""meh"" button. I don't really recommend or not recommend it... read below why if you wish.Yet another hidden object game... one with seemingly slightly higher production values than some (that's not saying much). Carrying a paranormal documentary series license, it features real people digitized... horribly. The backgrounds are generally well done, the hidden object scenes aren't an eyesore (most of the time). So that's a plus. Some effort was put into the surroundings, some details etc., and it can look really good here & there, but the story that, while it contains an somewhat interesting background, degenerates into nonsense every time in every other dialogue. Voice acting is... well... ok I guess - hit & miss. Scary? Nah, maybe one ""boo"" moment when it shouldn't happen and that's it, with some attempts being laughable.It packs some meat for the genre, what with 5 hours (305 minutes, including menu time & dunno, watching credits) it took me to finish both the main game and the Collector's Edition mission, and it doesn't exactly turn you away with the story, but there will be groans.The puzzles are oversimplified and nothing new to the genre - there's maybe  one that requires you to actually think about what you're doing for a second - and those incapable of getting it (how?!) can just skip it. Go them. In most of them, the only variety you see is graphical. They actually advertise this as ""fast-paced"" - which basically translates to easy to solve.Ah, dunno, it has big pluses for the genre - most aspects of it aren't half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥for example (though not all), and you can see actual care put into it here & there, but it's far, faaar from perfect. If you're a lover of the genre (hm) and can grab it on sale/in a bundle, get it. For 10$ normal price, it's a No.PS. The Collector's Edition episode is extremely short, silly & simplistic.PPS. Shaving the beaver (oh you'll see) made me facedesk. Seriously?			"

												Decent hidden object game.  Story is okay for what it is based on.  Voice acting is nothing to write home about (at least it has voice acting...)  The graphics are done well and there's a couple spook moments that could get you to jump.			"

												Normally, I wouldn't give a hidden object game any attention.  Of course with them popping up more and more in bundles and in this games case with trading cards its a given I'll be trying them out.  Only played a couple I think and like many games they don't get more than a couple minutes of attention before its AFK for the obligitory 2 hours to get the trading cards.  This one however despite the immediate put off of the main NPC and horrible! voice acting, had something going for it.  Occult games are pretty run of the mill in adventure/hidden object games but the story was somewhat intriguing.  Also the game itself is well designed an I didn't hit any bang your head moments, despite after a certain while their being a skip/hint system which i never needed.  The music is far better than I would expect from a game like this and had a STALKER esque vibe to it at times which was strange.  So yeah the game isn't too difficult, somewhat intriguing, and the voice acting so ridiculously bad its somewhat enjoyable.  I recommend playing it if you have it and if you can grab it for a handful of dollars that would be a good deal.  There was even a bonus episode that takes place after you finish the main game which I thought was a nice touch.   Not going to be in the top 10 or probably even top 20 of games I'll play this year but it suprised me in not being terrible, which may seem odd to warrant a review or recommendation...			"

												I want to like this game but its hard. The game has nice points for it. The graphics look good and clean and clear. The sound is nice, the voice overs are ok. The issue I have with the game is the puzzles are a little strange to be honest. The fusebox puzzle for one and they all seem like someone is checking them off from a list. They are mostly unfun.The graphics while clean are strange. You get a full screen shot of someones head and there talking but no lips are moving. You get a lot of static shots of the locations and people. The team of people your with dont seem to care much about the living. In the first scene someone is talking on there cell and she screams and the line goes dead. Do they call the police? Nope they wait around while you search the area for a way to get into the house. There is another scene where your character falls thru a hole in the floor of the house. Do they offer aid and try and get you out? Nope just a well I know you can make your own way out. Wow thanks for the concern there fellows.The thing is there are already games out there that do this exact formula and do it a lot better then this. Examples would be Abyss: The Wraiths of Eden, Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart, The Midnight Mystery games. These games have better puzzles and the stories are a lot more interesting and they tell a good story. Buy these other games first and if you can find this for cheap as I did then pick it up if this kind of game interest you. NOt a terrible game but could be so much better then it is.			"

When there is something strange in the adjacent suburbs?  Who will you txt?  A collection of rather unhelpful teenagers.  Suffer constantly at their inability to do any work while as the 'new kid' end up solving every mystery while at the same shifting through piles of junk to find loose objects and hopefully pocket change because I doubt this is a paid internship.At the core, this hidden object game doesn't push the genre forward in any compelling way and the cast of characters are so ineffectually that they negatively impact the story by being utterly useless.

												While I haven't watched the TV series, I suppose if the game was about a faux paranormal group, it would have been more interesting.As a casual HOG (Hidden Objects Game) that I purchased cheap via the Steam Summer Sale, I enjoyed the game for its challenging puzzles, premise and design.But the story is hoakie, the majority of the characters really offer you any help except two and for those who want realism with the supernatural, you're not going to get that, considering that the dead will be communicating with you quite clearly.You do get an extra chapter after you beat the game.While I need three more achievements, one playthrough for the game is enough for me.  The acting is hoakie, the limited interactions, character involvement and facial expressions hurt the game.  It's only saving grace is wanting to find out who was responsible and why...I recommend this game if you can get it under $3 but anything more than that and it's not recommended.			"

												This game is beyond a joke. It sets the whole gaming industry back 30 years.It's terrible story is only confounded by awful, dated game play that only the severely blind would find remotely challenging. I wrote at length about the evils this non-game has to offer here http://thenerdingtonpost.com/paranormal-statepoison-spring-review/  but for those looking for a shorter review.....The evil representation of Ryan in this game somehow managed to hypnotize me into playing it for over 6 hours.I would have preferred to be Ruffied, at least it'd be an experience I'd vaguely remember at best. Unfortunately for me I remember every thing. I got this game for free but some how I still manage to feel ripped off.There's a niggling feeling at the back of my soul, that I may have still paid a spiritual price for playing this poor excuse for a ""game"". I'm sure when I go to Hell, Satan will greet me with open arms and I'll spend eternity with him playing his favorite game, Paranormal State: Poison Springs.So,don't end up like me.Avoid this game....even if you get it for free.

												Paranormal State: Poison Spring is a paranormal point & click game with lots of hidden object minigames and puzzles. The game takes around 3-4 hours to beat and it has no replayability at all.I'm really on the edge between a positive or a negative experience with this game. The graphics are very good but the animations and soundtracks are meh. The story had it's good moments but... In the end it's not really satisfying.  Some of the puzzles made no sense or were just plain annoying, but I really enjoyed some of them. Also the jump scares were pretty lame.I've only came across one bug while playing the game and i'm not even sure it was a bug... After getting a certain item I couldn't find what to next so I used the Hint button and it just wouldn't work. Other than that, the game had no other bugs.It isn't a bad game... But $10 for a 3-4 hour long game that doesn't leave me really satisfied is not something i will recommend to my friends. I'm pretty sure there's a good number of superior point & click games on Steam that you should buy before this one; Though, if you ever see this game on sale or you are interested in playing it, don't feel bad for buying it, it's still a good game.

												I only recommend this to those that love the genre, I like it every once in a while, its not my favorite. It's a point and click puzzle game. The story is kind of lame and the puzzles are below average. You would think that being based on the paranormal that there would at least be a few scares, but sadly there weren't any. The voice acting is terrible and the native American sounds like she is from the south. I have played better P&Cs and this is not one I would want to play again. 5/10			"

												Picked this game up in a bundle and didn't realize it was a hidden object game til I played it. Honestly, this game was bad even for a hidden object game. They tried really hard to make the characters photorealistic, but then they added touches like blinking. Because there's no character motion but the blink, the effect makes it land squarely in the uncanny valley and really wigged me out. Maybe this game would be fun if you're a fan of the show *and* you really like hidden object games.			"

												This is just your average hidden object game. Funny if you like watching and laughing at the show. Which is why a friend bought it for me. Some of the puzzles make no sense, and one minigame that was hard enough that even the walkthroughs I found skipped it. The dlc was also kinda racist. But hey, I got to tell a friend that I had to shave a beaver to save the world.Tldr if youre in for an hour or so of weird, moderately humorous ghost themed weirdness this is an ok game.			"

Paranormal State: Poison Spring is one of those games where it's difficult to fairly rate it when you're only presented with the options of thumbs up or thumbs down as a final verdict. On the one hand it's a nice enough casual point and click/hidden object game with an OK plot (nothing spectacular but OK) and I enjoyed playing it. On the other hand there is a pretty major issue present though: due to a game breaking bug I was forced to restart my experience with the game from scratch (the game's autosave system prevented me from just reverting to an older save). I enjoyed the game, but can I honestly say I would recommend a game I knew had at least one game breaking bug in it? That's what's so tricky with Steam's system. The bug in question occurred in the Excavation Pit section of the game which involves using a tool called the EMF reader. There are prior times in the game where the same tool is used and I completed these without issue. However on this one upon what should have been completion of the puzzle nothing happened. Neither does the game's skip feature that you can use if a puzzle is giving you trouble actually work in this case, ending any and all further progress in the game. I was very tempted to stop and uninstall there as I'm sure you can understand, but fortunately this is the type of game that can be done much faster once you know what you have to do for each scene, so I was quickly able to redo my lost progress and I was intrigued enough by the plot to what to do how it ended. Fortunately the bug did not happen a second time and I was able to complete the game without any further hitches. It is a good game if you enjoy casual titles but given that I only have two options to score this I can't honestly say I'd recommend someone something I knew had a game breaker in it.			"

												No I don't recommend it. It's just so extremely REGULAR*. P&C adventure games (including here the HOG little cousins) should be mostly about the interesting story and engaging interaction which furthers that story. What we have here is regular effort to make a bog standard HOGame. Regular plot, regular obligatory jump-scares, regular ""twists"", regular puzzles. I mean how many more 100s of times do we have to fill up the electric generator with fuel to turn the lights on to procede a screen further?!I got the game as part of a mystery bundle and since I like the HOG genre and am currently stuck with entry-level laptop, I gave it a try, but otherwise I don't think I'd have patience enough for all it's procedural nonsense. Yet again every door is (in)conveniently locked, every handle is either missing or stuck, every opening mechanism an unconventionally complex and poorly explained puzzle.  Now I'm not american, so I was mildly aware there existed some mildly popular reality thing about ghosts and have became aware that this was an official tie-in game for an actual show solely from other reviews here on Steam. Since I believe everything paranormal is 99.9999999999999 times just a bling-bling entertainment and most of the phaenomena are just NOT-explained, rather than UN-explainable (and that other minuscule rest no one can possibly claim true or false anyways), I can only comment that character portraits in the game are... strangely drawn, are overtly stiff and the little animations look cheap and not very proffessional. Same goes for voice acting, though, again, I don't have a slightest clue if that are real original actors/TV personalities, or just some look... well.. sound-alikes.Simply put, there are far more well made HOG-adventure hybrids. Some even on Steam. You should play those.*I'm not actually shouting, it's just Steam doesn't give us italics option...			"

												Got this in a humblebundle deal for $1. Without a shadow of a doubt one of the worst ""games"" I have ever played. It is not a game. It is basically like a visual novel where all of the people look like they are from some gay♥♥♥♥♥♥like Twilight. The scenes are all still shots and all you do is point and click around the scene until you find all the objects listed. It is like a combo of the two worst game types; point and click and point and find. Point and click games are the worst games because they are just sleep inducing bore-fests, but at least some of them have some animations. This is even worse than a point and click because it is just point and find on predrawn still backgrounds.The only reason I have more than ten minutes logged on this load of sh-t is because I'm alt+tabbed out of it doing something else while I wait on the card drops, then sell them. I'm sure they will probably sell cheap to someone with no social status who is bored and desperate enough to give a crap about this ""game"" because they only go outside once a week or are just too old and dumb to play real actual games or is a little girl. Little girls are seriously the only people that should be enjoying this.0/10, they can 'point' this ""game"" up their ♥♥♥♥ing @sses			"

												I play a lot of HOGs and give this one thumbs up as it's a little different than most. There's a lot to like here, with two negatives that are annoying. Navigation is clunky, too many clicks to get to a reference map and once there you still  have to backtrack through scenes to your destination. Making that worse, your next destination is frequently not obvious so you're clicking the hint button a lot.  However, unlike any other HOG I've played, there is a strategy (cheat) guide built in so you're never really hopelessly lost. Side challenge, skip button, achievements and bonus content are plusses. Fair value at full price, excellent if on sale.			"

												First Of all, this game is much more inventive and creative than the trailer shows. I remeber watching Paranormal State on A&E so when i saw this, it was a must buy. The game itself is kind of campy and cheesy but it also holds a somewhat interesting storyline in which allows the negatives of the game to almost fade into the mist. My Review: 7.2 / 10fun and corny in the best way possible, but also is a very frustrating puzzle game, in which leads a pointless existence.			"

												This is the story of bad luck brian.  Brian tries to join a cult to gain some friends and become part of a community but little does he know he joined a circle jerk of lunatics.  These lunatics chase after paranormal events trying to discover ghosts and demons and Brian falls into the prey of these lunatics while trying to blend in.  Some psycho lady calls these lunatics for help to what they believed to be a breakthrough to discovering demons and they end up at a site of the civil war.  The lunatics send Brian to run all their errands gathering materials needed to aid the discovery while they sit back and do♥♥♥♥♥♥  During Brian's duties, numerous misfortunates happen to Brian (fall into the basement through broken hardwood floor, get locked in trailer and ladder stolen after going in a pit) while his new friends watches him struggle to get out by himself without providing aid.  There are a few scare scenes from popups otherwise this game is as scary as teletubbies.This game is decent as good as stuff from artifax mundi.. and one of the better hidden object games on steam.  However, this game is excessively long with a very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ending on top of constant location passing due to lack of map transport.7.5/10 Well worth if you get it from discount only.			"

												I secretly play HOGs because they are good for lazy gaming when I don't feel like getting into something heavy.  As a result, I pick them up from time to time in bundles and thankfully this one game at an extremely low price.  In my limited experience with the genre, I have to say that this one was just not that great.Uncanny-valley art direction aside (really, these people are creepy looking, even though they are clearly painted photos), the biggest hump tor hurdle are the series of asinine puzzles that await you.  Like any modern HOG, the game is split in between traditional puzzles and HOG scenes.  The traditional puzzles themselves are irritating at best - hardly any brain power is used as you solve variants on old games like matching tiles, hopping peg removal (like the game you can play while you wait at the Cracker Barrel), and other such rot that hasn't been fun for a hundred years.  The HOG scenes themselves are where things really take a downward route and for a game that is essentially about these scenes, that's not a good thing.  In traditional HOGs, you want to be efficient and find things in minimal clicks; in Paranormal State, your typical HOG scene requires that you somehow figure out what random thing they want you to interact with to reveal the object you're looking for.  So instead of cleverly hiding the object in a masterful painting of clutter, you now have to figure out why you can pick up scissors and just what in the hell you're supposed to cut with them.  It's not a difficult task, mind you, but it just feels like you're wasting time in a genre that is supposed to make wasting time fun.  It's not.  Even worse, the hitboxes are really off so you could pick up that fossil piece, for example, and TRY to put it on the plate, but because you have no idea if you're really clicking in the right spot, you have absolutely no idea if it's SUPPOSED to work or not.  So when you inevitably fail, you have to try again and again just to make sure that you're simply not missing the tiny hitbox to register the object to the right place.  Bah.Long story short, there's little that makes this game fun and enjoyable - the story is weak, the puzzles are terrible, and the artwork is unnerving.  If there is actually one thing I enjoyed in this game, it was finding the hidden wolves in the normal exploration scenes - what is supposed to be a fun side activity actually turned out to be the best part of the game.Pass.

												Point and click puzzle where you shave a beaver to thwart an ancient enemy... 6/10Background: Never heard of it, picked up for pennies in a bundle, completed it for some reason.The Good:* Backgrounds are well drawn as are the puzzles* Lots of puzzles, samey pixelhunts but plenty of them* Subtle animation gives life to otherwise flat scenery* 5 Hours of gameplay, more than I expected* Hint system is mostly helpfulThe Bad:* Characters are creepy, I mean those not supposed to be* Scooby Doo has more dramatically competent story telling* Virtually all puzzles are simple* Later pixelhunt scenes make no sense* Voices and expressions don't match the narrative* Spelling mistakes galore* Hints breakdown at map junctionsImpressions: By turns shoddy and enjoyable. The creepy static faces of your friends is really off-putting as are their stilted dialogue with is flatly read adding nothing to the drama of the plot. The puzzles are basic but enjoyable if you like pixelhunts. The odd nature of the inventory system is weird too. Everything conspires to break your immersion in the game. Any tool you pick up has a single use and disappears once used (no matter how mindblowingly handy it might appear to be). But despite it all there's an enjoyable series of basic clicking puzzles that are fun to do while you wade through the connecting drivel.Recommended for: Teenage Point and Click fans and those who like unchallanging searches.Conclusion: 6/10. Okay for nominal cost but poor value at anything more.			"

												An interesting historically based storyline. This game probably won't appeal to those who don't like casual point and click games but to those that do this is a decent entry into the genre. It's a little short, but it makes up by adding another chapter once the game is finished. The only downside, as there is for a lot of games like this, is the overly dramatic American main characters. A few of the main characters in this game did get on my nerves, but not so much that I didn't want to finish.			"

I thought it was a bit cheesy that each character had...like each character said really dorky things about whatever their specialty was, in an over-the-top way. You'll see what I'm trying to say if you play the game. But Poison Springs is a real place, that's cool. It wasn't boring, I actually enjoyed playing it even when I couldn't figure out what to do. I play a lot of HOG, and this is a good one. It can be enjoyed by more than the Paranormal State fans.			"

												A short game that is ok to play. Nothing that is outstanding. Easy simple and straight forward story. Some music and most of the art is nice. The mini games and hidden items are also not very challenging (well I choose the mode [easy and standard], duh).I just hope to see more emotions in the NPC's faces as they practically had the same face (emotionless) from begining to the end... Overall, an ok game to play since it was with a 85% discount when I bought it.			"

												Okay, so I'll admit something right off the bat: I have NO idea what Paranormal State is. A television show is the vibe I'm getting from the game, but I haven't seen it around. Regardless, this is not about the show, it's about this game that was based from the show. And it is good solid fun.I've been playing HOA games since ""Return to Ravenhearst"", the one that started it all, and I can safely say this one meets my standards. Good atmosphere, intriguing story, and of course lots of places and puzzles to explore and solve. The puzzles range from mildly to brain-bendingly challenging, but they all require some sort of thinking process and that's part of what I enjoy about them. The Hidden Object scenes are much the same way. Trying to get a scene done without a misclick on my part was near impossible at times.Along with the puzzles and story, the game also has some interesting and rather fun ghost-hunting-type tools that you can use in various parts of the game to find and solve things. An EVP device as well as a heat-sensing device are among the tools you'll use. It's fun and it adds a little bit of a twist to the game that requires an additional thinking process. You'll need to use them at certain times in the game to progress too, so it's all about wondering what tool will best fit what situation, but with something different which is fun and refreshing.As for the cons, well...don't go playing this game if you're looking for zany expressions; the characters are not very expressive in terms of faces but there IS voice-acting  and that kinda in my opinion makes up for anything the characters are lacking visually. The game can be frustratingly hard at times, and the climax of the story is a little...well...odd. However, the great gameplay, challenging puzzles, and beautiful environments make up for this as well as the ghost-hunting device play and the premise of the story itself.Overall, it is highly recommended by me to other HOA fans out there who enjoy a good challenge and a rich environment and story. Give it a try!			"

												Bring your patience! The story is decent and the gameplay is generally simple. However, I did dislike the fact that in order to construct some objects, the cursor must be at exactly one point, and it will take several tries to find the correct place to click. Also, several scenes were rather unclear and at times I found myself using the hint button repeatedly. Overall, the game goes smoothly except for a few frustrating places.			"

												Underneath the uncanny-valley art and animation, horrendously inaccurate depictions of Native Americans, ridiculously small cursor hotspots, and pretty bad recording quality (did no one send the voice acttress for Iris a decent mic?), there's a pretty decent HOG. This game is fun and funny in its badness, but the mechanics are there enough to make getting through the game pretty simple and painless. Got it for less than a candy bar, so I can't complain.			"

												Nice game, worth the 1.49€ i got it for. Kept me busy for an afternoon. I'd buy it again for that price, the standard 10€ is a bit too much though, in my opinon, as you finish the game in a few hours and it doesn't have what i'd call replay value.Some of the minigames should have been left out (Peg solitaire? Towers of Hanoi? Please!), but all in all, it is a nice mix of hidden object and minigames, none too hard. "

Almost perfect hint system (except when it points you to the camp map: grrrrr annoying). There's a short but nice extra chapter too. Worth the buy.			"

												THE GOOD polished; in this vast ocean that is the Hidden Object genre, many titles simply feel very rough around the edges, but this one had obvious effort put into it solid gameplay consisting of a varied mix of item combination puzzles, hidden object screens and minigames decent, though not particularly exciting story and mostly well done graphics while its map doesn't allow for ""fast travel"", it does highlight areas with things to do, which is extremely useful, especially later on when you've unlocked a fair number of locations it comes with extras such as elaborate character biographies and desktop wallpapersTHE NOT SO GOOD the faces of the characters are all exceptionally goofy; they often linger in grotesque expressions during moments of intense action or drama, which is a bit of a problem considering how serious this game is taking itself there were rare moments that felt a bit directionless because the game wasn't very good at communicating what it wanted me to do next one of the recurring minigames has overly sensitive (and counter-intuitive) controls, which makes it a bit of a chore THE UGLY nothing; I played through the entire game without encountering any grave technical issues or bugsOVERALLParanormal State: Poison Spring is the kind of game you'd recommend to someone who's looking for an adequately representative first impression of the Hidden Object genre. It's a very streamlined, very conventional game, which is both good and bad. It is, of course, unequivocally commendable that they put up the effort to provide such a polished experience, but at the same time I wish the game wasn't quite so formulaic and generic. Everything about it feels a bit bland and ultimately forgettable. Still, though, this blandness does not make it a bad game in any sense, especially not for people who want to see what the genre is all about. It's just not a particularly memorable experience. Well, except for those goofy faces. Those will stick with me for a while.			"

												At first I kept playing the game because it seemed so bad with the expressionless faces and bad voice acting that I just wanted to see how bad it might get. In the end, though, the mix of hidden object and puzzle solving (along with a very useful hint system) actually managed to keep me engaged and entertained. And you gotta admit, the location artwork is fantastic. But I would only pick this up if I were a big fan of HO games.			"

												It's a standard point and click/hidden object game with casual level of difficulty. You are a new member of a paranormal investigation team solving a mystery at a Poison Spring museum/park of Civil War. I am giving the game positive rating because I did enjoy the game for what it was. I bought it at 80% off the original price during sale. I don't think I'd be happy had I paid the full price though.Negatives:- The character design: the character artwork is just strange, ugly and eerie at times.- The First Nations/Native American cliches. I don't mind a little bit of fantasy and ""fusion"" if the game calls for it but when the game setting is modeled after some historical events these type of things do bother me. The nation featured in the game are the Cherokee who are not known for the use of dream catchers nor building totem poles. The Cherokee have also historically not worn feathered war bonnets. A shaman is a term used for Siberian/North Asian religions. Most Native American indigenous religions have their own terms but the general term used is Medicine Wo/Men. I don't know if it's lack of research and laziness on the part of the developers or intentional ignorance; either way I didn't like this aspect of the game at all. Positives:- The character design. It's so bad that it's hilarious at times.- I enjoyed the story overall. Ignoring the historical inaccuracies I am a sucker for paranormal investigations and history so I usually like these type of storylines.- I like the artwork of the game a lot. It's very pretty despite the ugly character design.- I like that the map in your journal showed you the setting which had something new to discover. I get frustrated at times in HOG games going from setting to setting trying to figure out where to find the next object or clue.- It's just a fun little game to play on a lazy evening. So to sum it up. I would recommend the game to those who like hidden-object adventures with paranormal settings but only if you get the game on discount.			"
