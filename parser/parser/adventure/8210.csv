												Warning: This is NOT a game with QTEs, where you walk around to solve easy ""puzzles"" and make important decisions like the recent Telltale games. This is a classic, 90's-stlye point-and-click game with medium to hard puzzles and dialogues are only important to solve the puzzles,  (the story is quite linear).Tip: you need the Telltale Custom Resolution Tool to play the game in the reoslution you want (you cannot select modern monitor resolutions in the game): http://www.wsgf.org/book/export/html/5159I played the original (2D) Sam & Max game a long time ago, and it was a lot of fun. This 3D return is not the same thing, but if you enjoy Point and Click games and don't mind, when stuck, to check a walkthrough, you'll have a lot of fun. The plot is ridiculous but fun, and the dialogues are quite entertaining, as alll characters are well designed.In this second episode from Season 1, you see another person being hypnotized. I had a lot more fun in this episode than in the first one, and most puzzles were a lot easier to understand. Thumbs up from me!			"

												First off, if you have windows 10 then you will have problems running the game.This game is worse than the first. Reason all of the bad stuff from before and then some. Once again the game felt like it was meant for a little kid as the story is extremely stupid. The game was even shorter than the first, so if you liked that one you get half a game. One new area for the entire game, the rest just the same old stuff with a new storyline (which was terrible by the way). Again, I regret buying this game and other telltale products, as Tales of Monkey Island was the only one with a decent story and humor.Pros:...Cons:Even Shorter Game (really a pro for me, but this game has yet to prove that there are any pro's)Continued Terrible StorylineLimited Area of Travel, with not really any new areasNot FunnySoda Poppers continue to exist somehow!I've decided to play through the whole series (once) out of protest to having bought all three games before playing this garbage and writing a review for each. Here is to hoping that Season 2 and 3 are better.			"

												The expected funny dialogue and amusing situations are here aplenty in TTG's Sam & Max episode 102. Personally I found this to be a little easier than 101, in a good way.			"

												Situation: Comedy is where the Sam & Max series starts to really pick up steam - partly because it reveals the first hints at an overarching plot for the ""season's"" remaining four episodes.			"

												Sam and Max, Freelance Police! ... are back in their own new adventure.(You can never have enough Sam and Max!!) - and yes, they go as far as they go in the comic (and further). If you love the Sam and Max type of humor, you will love this series.If I'm going to mark points off for anything, its that the voices of Sam and Max have changed from the original LucasArts version, but after awhile they really start to own it and become the definitive Sam and Max voices.Hilariously imaginative, well-written, and adorable. Recommended! 9.5/10			"
