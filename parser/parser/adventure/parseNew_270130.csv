												I *love* what this game is so far! So I really, really don't want to give it a negative review, but I have to be honest.My co-worker owns a Vive, and I didn't recommend he buy this because it's just so short for such a high price. So if I'm telling somebody I know not to buy this, despite how good it is, I really don't feel like I should rate it any differently on Steam.The only problem is just that it's just so very, very short for such a high price. If that doesn't bother you, or if you want to support the developers and feel more like ""donating"" than ""buying"", then I encourage you to pay the price so that the developers can create more of this game. Just keep in mind that there is roughly 90 minutes of actual gameplay.			"

												Edit: As I've seen this question repeatedly, you need a VR headset. Specifically the Vive until Oculus Touch arrives assuming dev support for the Touch controllers.At a $30 price point for the time I spent in the game I would be hesitant to recommend this right out, but I think that the quality of the game and the polish I felt while playing it I would definitely suggest giving this a shot. Don't go into this thinking it will be like the old school point and click adventures as the puzzles are generally nonexistant and you rarely interact directly with any characters. Go into this for the feeling of adventure.Pros:-Looks and sounds beautiful-Great acting-Movement system pretty intuitive and with no motion sickness-Interacting with everything feels great-Feels like I'm in a movieCons:-Short, very short. Short enough that I am concerned about the price point.-Shooting flares was somehow the hardest thing I had to do in the game-Very subjective, but I wanted significantly more puzzles than I got.			"

												+ Phenomenal story / artstyle / voice acting / music+ Dark, gritty atmosphere+ Perfect balance of puzzles / no leaps of logic nonsense+ System Shock 2 style audio logs+ Silent protagnist+ God Damn Flare Guns+ Teleport / Chaperon kept the walls at bay+ Fully baked product that's worth every penny+ / - Walking on inclines will move camera up / down- Turning in teleport mode is flakey- Physics based actions (e.g. putting stuff on tables) are flakeyCall of the Starseed is a bold first step into a new way of telling stories. This isn't just a game. It's not just an interactive movie. This is something new, that cannot be experience outside of VR. This envoked in me emotions of awe / wonder / curiosty to an extent I can't compare to anything else. The massive scale during some sequences left my jaw wide open. The tracked controllers played a pivital role in bringing me into the experience.This should, without question, be on the top of your VR list.			"

												Very mixed feelings! On one hand I want to give this a positive review because it's a great gaming experience with some neat writing, fun ideas, amazing atmosphere and immersion, etc. It hits on nearly every single element a VR title should.Some gripes though....Why does the first video on the store page for Gallery spoil the entire ending? Like, I think they show every single segment that happens to close the chapter in that one minute video to preview their game. Seems really....Strange.30$ for a single episode of a multi episode series? Will this be five episodes? To finish the story we'll be paying around 175$ after tax for this product. Jesus. I mean....That's like a full fledged triple A product with the largest DLC bundle that'll be dishing out content for 12+ months to come....Maybe they'll be cheaper? Hope so.Secondly the content is short, I mean, really short. Don't let my two hours fool you, I started and restarted and started and restarted and spent like an hour in the main section of the game. I'd say this game could probably be beat in one sitting spending around 30 mins if you know what you're doing. Probably less.So for 30$ we only get the first episode (as bizarre and economically shady as that sounds) and hopefully enough excitement to sustain interest long enough to purchase Episode 2....Whenever it comes out and however much they charge for it (the fact I don't know these things is also disconcerting).I guess....Please just make it longer. You've kind of trapped me between my expensive new device and curiosity because I've already dropped money into your project. So, please make it longer and even offer different avenues and solutions to puzzles so the game can have a tiny bit of replayability.For now? Negative I guess, wish I didn't have to. I just don't have a positive feeling despite really enjoying the product, I think how they have handled that episodic system is really amateur and it leaves all of these early adopters who just spent thousands on gear standing yet again outside waiting to be let in with the hope and promise it'll be nice and warm when that time comes.

												I took a chance and purchased Call of the Starseed, even though it seemed a bit pricey for the reported length. I played it for longer than a couple of hours and spent a lot of time searching for things and completing some of the achievements. The inventory system is easily the best I've seen so far in VR, the camera repositioning/blink system is incredibly good (if slightly confusing at first and a little wiggy on inclines), and the graphics are very good at highest settings for a first-generation title.Having that said, I am a 30-year-old gamer and have been an ardent comic book, fantasy, and sci-fi geek my entire life. And what I experienced tonight in Call of the Starseed reduced me to tears when I finished the game. When the credits finished and the game closed out, I took off the headset and sat in the dark, openly weeping with happiness.I won't spoil it for any of you, but the experience was equivalent to being a child and seeing Stargate for the first time, at the moment when Jackson first sees the Stargate activate and walks through it. Or the first time you saw The Goonies and they found the bottom of the Wishing Well. Or like the first time you played Myst and were swept away by the fantasy of discovering the secrets of the ages. The elation and fear of the unknown, and the sense of impending adventure... it came crashing down on me so suddenly and overwhelmingly that I completely lost my sense of self.For people the need a TL;DR:PROS:- *Excellent* presentation- Detailed environments- Interesting puzzles- Voice acting, audio, and music are splendid- Inventory and blink movement systems are easily among the best in VR to-date- Achievements!- The beginnings of what promises to be an excellent and engaging story- No motion sickness during moving bits (Elevators, etc.)CONS: - Hand tracking will (very rarely) spaz out for a half-second- Blink movement will sometimes wig out on inclines or too close to walls, which can be disorienting- Short length, if you're rushing through it. (I recommend taking your time)- Pricey for the length, but it's VERY polished for a first generation title- Physics for loose, thrown, or falling items can sometimes be a little wonky.- Graphically intensive. Ran perfectly on 980ti at highest settings, might need to go lower with other GPUs- Accidentally forgot my in-game hands weren't real and punched myself in the face with the Vive controller while reaching for my backpackTL;DR: The first title I've played for the Vive that truly made me forget about reality and engaged me on such a deep level that it stirred profound emotions and reminded me why I love gaming. Absolutely worth your time and money, full price.			"

												The game is pretty, and it really showcases how VR can be used to tell good stories with new and interesting mechanics.

												This is the first VR game to offer a polished, coherent glimpse of the kinds of narrative experiences we can expect from this medium. I'm hooked and I can't wait for the next episode.Where most VR games focus on a single mechanic or two, Starseed focuses on telling a story, and in doing so it manages to blend elements from walking simulators, puzzle games and classic adventure games without feeling scattered. There are a handful of clunky systems (interacting with objects could be unpredictable) most of their experiments pay off (I loved the backpack inventory in particular).It was worth every penny of the $25 I spent on it, and I say that as someone with a tight games budget. I'm a little stunned at the negative reviews. Someday when the kinds of experiences it offers are more common that price may feel steep, but for now this is a rare treat and I strongly recommend it.			"

												The Gallery is an episodic VR game which gives you the vibe of games from the past like MYST - only now you're ""really"" there! The atmosphere is great and ominous, making you move through greatly detailed area's. As a VR game you can interact with a great deal of items and props which only adds to the immersion (yay fireworks!).However, the game has so many shortcomings that it's impossible for me to upvote it at this current time.- Performance issues are all over. On the beach I had regular moments in which the screen started to flicker and the framerate would drop to 5, instant nausea for some I bet. In the sewers the game would also go blackscreen on me (luckily your progress is saved per chapter and a couple reloads helped get past the part that'd bug).- The loading screens are long and prone to crash the game if you interact with things like SteamVR.- The game does NOT listen to one of the basic rules of Roomscale - keep the virtual ground on the same level as the room's ground. I was unable to pick up multiple items during the game because they were 10cm below my floor.- For the puzzle adventure genre I found it lacked puzzles - there were only 2-3.- If this was a game played with a controller / keyboard you'd be finished in an hour, tops. Thats how short it is. VR is there to make you gaze at stuff and be amazed and immersed, I know. But its mostly the movement controls that add to the time played. I tried using the ""walkAbout"" technique but the cursor would sometimes not flip the room, and I'd find myself traversing back in the level on accident. In the end I just started teleporting instead of walking.- With a price of 28,- all of these shortcomings are a bit too much for me. Don't forget its only one episode, too, and if you are invested in the story you will have to throw even more money at the screen. If its gonna be anywhere above 15-20,- it will definitely need to feature more gameplay and a longer timespan.No, I did not hate The Gallery. I loved it. I wanted to be there, shoot fireworks and drink empty bottles of booze. But for 28,- I expect the bottles to be filled. Wait for the price to drop, people. Steam Summer Sale coming up real soon.			"

												Summary:+ Very polished, beautiful graphics+ Nice and fluent user interface+ Quite atmospheric- Way too short- Negligable content- Generic story""When I finished this game and put off my headset, it was the first time I left VR with an undeniable feeling of disappointment.""I'll start my review with the most obvious and outstanding positive aspect this game has to offer: It's visuals and atmosphere. You won't encounter the best graphics a PC game has ever offered, but perhaps the best so far incorporated into a VR experience. To stroll around in this environment is a nice pastime in itself, and I really recommend to do so if you want to squeeze some play time out of this game.This positive impression is even intensified by the relatively large number of interactive objects placed all over the area. Admittedly, most of these items do not allow much more than to grab and view them before you have to put them back or throw them away, others even can just be pushed around. However, in my opinion non-interactive decoration is especially disappointing in VR, so I really approve of this level of detail.The second big plus of this game is its fluent user interface. The backpack inventory works well and just looks great. Picking up, using and combining items mostly worked like a charm.If you want a decent example of what is currently possible in the visual department of VR, don't expect more and just have the money, don't read any further and just open your pocket. I suppose in this case your rig also contains at least a GTX 980, which I would more than recommend for this game.If it is the label ""VR puzzle adventure"" that caught your attention - like it was for me - then you better prepare for a disappointment that reaches from slight to huge, depending on your expectations. Either Cloudhead Games put a disproportionate strong focus on visuals right from the start, or they just ran out of time, budget or both, and didn't manage to add a decent amount of puzzles and story elements. Taking into account the large number of absolutely useless (in the sense of unused) clues littered all over the walls, I'd vote for the latter.To put this into numbers: The whole game contains not more than four puzzles that are halfways worthy to be named as such. This is even less than the number of stages or levels, and consequently there are stages without any puzzle at all. Well, if you need a map to navigate from your living room to your kitchen and perceive this endeavor as challenging, your counter might go as high as half a dozen puzzles. To put this lack of content into other words: If you watched the video and screenshots on top of this page, you didn't see a teaser but literally every single relevant scene of the game.When it comes to the story, there is not much to say, as there is not much story. It is not particularly bad or good, it is just generic. You'll encounter stereotypic video game story elements as the crazy scientist, the alien artefact, the guys that litter the environment with short audio snippets (for whatever reasons, probably because they are just carrying too many audio tapes with them), the sewers (big plus, I love sewers), and some nondescript bad guy. As the story starts to unfold, the game unfortunately ends.Conclusion: Cloudhead Games put a lot of effort and budget into the visual appearance of this game - with success. Unfortunately they forgot to divert some resources into the creation of a sufficient amount of puzzles so the game could be called a puzzler. Most browser escape games offer more and more challenging puzzles. If you decide to give this game a try, do it slowly. Take your time, enjoy the environment and then even slow down more. If you start to rush, you'll ecounter the credits in less than an hour.			"

												This game offers a glimpse into the future of VR. Although it's short, it's the first title with a level of polish similar to that of a triple A production. The first half hour will be spent like you are on drugs with you staring at your virtual hands, repeatedly opening then closing them while giggling uncontrollably. The inventory and menu system alone is worth the price of admission. Everything in this world you can touch, pick up and interact with. The eye for detail is simply astonishing. There's exploration, mystery, adventure, humor, puzzling and some tense moments. Call of the Starseed has got it all. The finale, the last half hour of the game, will without doubt provide enormous goosebumps. I've finished CotS in one sitting, took me about 3 hours and I'd say it was well worth the 30 EUR I paid for it. When I finally removed my HMD I just sat there wide eyed for a couple of minutes, dreaming of the astounding possibilities this perfect marriage of creativity and technology will enable going forwards. Episode 2 can't get here fast enough!			"

												Stunning. On paper it's a straightforward adventure game but, if The Gallery is any indication, VR will be transformative for the genre. The hand tracking makes such a difference. For example, early on you're navigating some dark tunnels. You've got a map and you've got a torch. To look at the map you reach over your back to grab your backpack, get the map out, hold it up to your face and shine the torch on it with your other hand. While these interactions are necessarily a little abstracted (without any kind of finger tracking you're only really able to grab and release), they're enough to really draw you in to the experience. And it is absolutely worth being drawn in to.Regarding price, I don't have a problem with it at all. Maybe in the future when there are thousands of incredible 10+ hour VR games to choose from at the same price point I would think twice. Right now though this is an experience you can't get anywhere else. Compared to the IMAX, a football match or a theme park I think it’s totally reasonable. If anything it might be too cheap considering the limited user base and the high production values. I hope the developers make enough from it to finish the story. In conclusion, the game is great; please buy it so I can play the next one. "

												One of the best VR games to date, it is a VR adventure game done right, with fabulous visuals, room scale movement smoothly mixed with blink control for larger steps, and a great atmosphere. It is only the first part of a larger story, which leads to the first negative: it is a fairly short game. You'll likely spend more time just exploring the surroundings, but for a play-and-finish type, it isn't as long as it should be. The second negative, is that there aren't really that many puzzles. It's more about exploration and some minor manipulation, with only a handful of spots where you might have to think your way through to a solution (and there are generally clues scattered about to make it even easier).Make no mistake, though: this is still a great VR experience, way ahead of most of the competition, released at the same time the headsets went commercial (more-or-less). Also, as part 1 of 4 (or 5?), it is hopefully setting up even better games to come...			"

												Summary:Pros- Looks good- Immersive- Inventory system is fantasticCons- Cumbersome teleport mechanic compared to the teleport mechanic in other VR games- Overpriced- Short (1-2 hours)- Puzzles and exploration are the main focus of the game, but the puzzles fall shortIn Depth:This game is very visual, it tries to look good, and succeeds most of the time. There are only a few moments in the game where I noticed poor-quality textures or mesh clipping. The textures could be due to the fact my GPU is the minimum recommended, so it's not a big deal for me. The game ran fine, no graphical lag, no crashes.At the time of writing Call of the Starseed is probably one of the most graphically appealing vive reality games out, if you want to experience a nice looking game, this is your best bet, but don't expect the earth.The main pro here, is that the game is quite immersive due to the way it looks and plays. Another main plus point is the inventory system, I think it sets the benchmark for every other future VR game. Hands down. It doesn’t break the immersion, it’s easy to use, I just wish I could put anything in there not just key items. However, there are quite a few cons. The teleport navigation is bad, when so many games have done it so well, it makes me a little baffled to think what they must have done to make it so counter-intuitive. It’s like trying to drag a cat around. How you move your controller and where the teleportation target moves does not seem to be linked by any logic.Picking stuff up is questionable. Quite often I found essential or interesting items impossible to pick up. In numerous circumstances the floor was lower than my own, meaning pressing my controller against the floor would leave the item an inch from reach. This is not a calibration issue, there are different heights in some of the in game floors. There also seems to be a bug when in which you are unable to pick anything up if holding the magnet gun. No matter what you try to pick up, a vacuum tube will teleport to your hand from the gun. In general that portion of the game was very frustrating. Tubes got stuck inside objects and are needed to complete the puzzle, placing your hands inside one tube and trying to pick it up would pull up another tube to the right of it. You could argue this could be a tracking issue. The game is overpriced. It just is to me. I understand that a developer, or multiple developers worked hard on this and need to make a living, but for 95 minutes of gameplay, I paid £22.99. Which means I would be paying £15 per hour for something I didn’t even get 2 hours into. That 95 minutes includes credits and restarting areas several times due to item bugs. If the experience changed my life that would be no problem, but the game is 90% wandering and interacting and 10% puzzles. I only noticed 2 puzzles in the game, (ones that require you to think and work out the solution); both of which only took 5 minutes to complete. Which leaves this game drastically lacking in the gameplay department. Leaving the game a mostly interactive story experience, but for this beggining of an episodic story, there really isn’t much story to be had, and any tidbits you get are from listening to tapes. The final nail in the coffin for the overpriced status, is this game is Episode 1, that’s right, the game is episodic. I understand developers sometimes need to break up a game in order to fund the development process, but if people are not impressed they’re not going to buy the second part. By the time I finished the game, it felt like I had just paid for a lengthy demo. The end was visually spectacular, but that’s it. To finish. I had fun, I played it to the end, would I recommend it? Yep. If you don’t mind the cost. Which may seem counter-intuitive to what I have been saying. The fact is the faults of the game could be forgiven if the price was reasonable, and a reasonable price is subject to personal opinion. I will not be asking for a refund, for the following reason. I want the developers to take my money and spend it on the next one, use people’s suggestions to improve the game. I want to see a much longer episode, with more puzzles and more character interactions, but if it falls short again, I will get the episode refunded and wait until the game is a reasonable price. Also, the people in the game seem really really small. "

												Yes, it is short. Yes, it is somewhat expensive given the length. But what an experience! The atmosphere is fantastic, great production values, and the ending sequence just blew me away. This gives us a glimpse of what VR gaming can be in the future. I am happy to support this game and can't wait for the next episode.			"

												i think 30$ is a bit much for the amount of time you spend in this game, maybe 15 - 20$ is what i'd call it (i got the game free with my vive). otherwise super ♥♥♥♥in cool, i'll buy episode 2 if they make it a little cheaper.edit: the price has been lowered to 20$. this is Good.

												Probably the best VR experience I've had to date.  In some ways it's a shame that it came out so soon into the VR cycle, because it's going to take better resolution and lenses to see this game for what it is.  Most of the objects in the distance right now the Vive 1 just can't show clearly.Still an awesome experience, though, especially the last 10 minutes.  Can't fault the developers for a technology limitation.  I'll be going back and playing this one on Vive 2, though, for an entirely new experience.Looking forward to episode 2.			"

												Pros:- Visually stunning- Interesting story- Bar-setting game mechanices (particularly the inventory system and the flashlight behaviour)Cons:- Short (about 2 hours, 3 if you enjoy exploring & marvelling at the scenery)- I ran into a fairly major bug, but it was solved by reloading the gameWith a library of nearly 50 VR games currently in my Steam account, I can safely say that, hands-down, this is the closest you'll currently get to a AAA title on the Vive. The visuals are top-notch and incredibly immersive. Is it expensive? Yes, considering the relatively short playtime; however, I am simply in awe of what the developers have achieved with Call of the Starseed and personally think the price is worth it. If you're a fan of adventure games, this is a must-buy!			"

Wow what a ride. While The Gallery - Episode 1: Call of the Starseed sure does have a high asking price compared to the measly two hour experience given, it is quite the unforgettable trip.This is essentially a quite-interactable walking simulator that has a few good puzzles along the way. It really showcases some pretty cool stuff the VR tech can do, too. The whole thing is very polished from excellent graphics to cool mechanics (i.e. the backpack and flashlight), to the AAA voice acting.Pros:+Excellent edge-of-your-seat experience the whole way through.+Dripping with atmosphere.+Excellent use of VR (in fact, I'm not sure it would be worth it at all without it - if thats possible).+More episodes to come - which I am personally hooked!Cons:-The price is a huge 'con' here. Very expensive, and the experience only lasts like two hours unless you are doing some of the tedious achievements. On the up-side, you are likely to have friends play through to show the experience.Awesome experience! If you have VR and this looks like your kind of thing, don't hesitate!			"

												The Gallery - Episode 1 is a phenomental demonstration of what we have to look forward to in future VR gaming. It's a 1.5-2 hour adventure (mostly looking at things, with a few puzzles) with lovely graphics, excellent voice-acting, a great soundtrack. The visuals (particularly at the end) can be breathtaking. Mechanically, it speaks the ""language"" of VR very well. Movement and interaction with the world is natural, and the inventory system using a backpack which you ""pull"" from your back when you want to access the inventory is neat. It's not perfect (nothing is). Graphics demands are high, with some juddering on my 6600k/Radeon 480 system, which mostly cleared up when I turned the settings down to low. There are some nausea issues with parts of the terrain where your elevation can change while you're walking in room scale, which can cause discomfort. The puzzles are a little simplistic, and the episode itself is not very long. That said, it's a wonderful first effort from this studio. It's a high quality, immersive, adventure, that's worth experiencing if you've taken the plunge into VR. I'm looking forward to the next episode.  "

												Bought the game on the Steam Summer Sale.  Can't remember what I paid.  Fourteen, Fifteen, maybe Nineteen dollars.   I proceeded to download, install, load and jump into the game.   Fifteen minutes of exploration go by, then the game decides to crash.  I gave up on it, until tonight.   I had a nagging feeling to load it up again, so I did.  I was most impressed.  What can I say that hasn't already been said.  You feel completely immersed in this world.   There are many tapes that you will pick up/play to learn more about the setting.   Every mechanic fits together perfectly.  The visuals are breathtaking.    There were a few moments when I thought to myself ""WTF are they thinking, this scene is going to make me motion sick!""  Well, not once did I feel sick, and that's quite impressive considering the amount of time you spend on elevators and other devices in this game. I've gotta say, this is a wonderful experience.   MY only gripe is that it is $29  when not on sale!!   Thats a lot of money for a game that you can rush through in an hour.  On the other hand, you can explore the worlds completely, leaving you with roughtly a three hour playthough.   I'm actually excited for the upcoming sequels.  I would recommend this game to anyone with a vive.  I would wait until you see it on sale, and snatch it right up.   This right here is how you do VR.  It is quite the teaser for what's to come.   "

												This game is a near linear experience with puzzle elements to progress forward like Myst. There are a handful of great moments where the VR experience is very compelling and I thoroughly enjoyed. The backpack the character carries, as simple as that sounds,  is beautiful and highlights some of the unique interactions the VR enables.  The background story is a bit like the TV show LOST as sci-fi elements build.I definitely recommend it, but bear in mind the content took me about 2.5 hours total (that is an immersive very fun 2.5 hours). The price is steep but I suspect it will come down with some time.			"

												Best VR experience currently available to early adopters.If you're looking for an ""actual game"", and not some trumped up tech demos, this is it. If you can afford to buy it, you absolutely should, that said... 30 bucks...? Ehhh... 15 or even 20 may have been easier to swallow, considering I've completed it, and steam shows me at exactly 103 minutes. There's no replayablity, unless you just want to ""do it again"", or maybe showcase it to a friend.THAT SAID, it's awesome for that 100 minutes or so. The puzzles are trivial, and you're mostly just plowing through it to do it. Right when it gets interesting, it ends, but it's episodic. I expected that.All told, 30 bucks isn't a big deal to me, and I think it was worth it. I'm not saving allowances or anything anymore though... so you may be in a different boat.			"

												Welp, i finally popped my review cherry with this game from Cloudhead games. All i can tell you is that if you own the Vive, you need to buy The Gallery: Call of the starseed. I was trying to think of a way of describing how i felt about this VR game and it hit me like a ton of bricks. The Gallery reminds me of PRE-DOTA Valve!!! I am not trying to do Cloudhead games a disservice by comparing them to Valve but their games attention to detail in the environments, the physics of the world and the story completely remind me why i once loved Valve and i think i found my favorite new developer in Cloudhead games. I just started playing The Gallery earlier today and i played for 2 hours straight because they brought their world in this game to life in an amazing way and it sucked me in without any hesitation. I keep reading about people complaining about the price of the game but 30 dollars is a fair price for the best VR game out there right now on the Vive or any other headset bar none. BUY THIS GAME, ENJOY IT, LOVE IT!! BTW, the voice acting is top notch, brilliant even. Just updating my review of The Gallery to say that i nominated this game for a Steam award for WOOAHHHH DUDE, COOL!!!! It deserves it for the last 20 minutes of the game which blew my mind!!!			"

												Just... Wow!  This goes way beyond just a VR experience.  It whisks you a million miles from your living room and drops you knees deep in muck, with a flashlight, a map and a creepy feeling that you should've gotten a tentanus shot before coming up in here.  There's familiar game mechanics like papers lying about, junk on shelves, notes tacked to the walls.  They all feel VERY different when you get to root thru a life sized cabinet in order to inspect it all.  This will really ruin a lot of my fav games for me - but at the same time I have that old feeling from being a kid when games like Quake and Doom first came out and we all thought ""Man - gaming is about to change forever, and right here soon"".  Revolution is coming.  Can't wait to play the next episode.BTW, more than the puzzles or the story or the environments ... the one thing I appreciate the most is the inventory system.  Extremely well done!  If you grip your hand near your shoulder and pull, you will slip off your backpack which can then be parked mid-air anywhere you like (think Deadspace).  A touch of a finger will summon whatever you want from in there - a tape recorder, a flip lighter, some scrap parts or a map.  Grab a strap on the bag and throw it back over your shoulder to put your stuff away.  A+ for immersion whomever designed that part.			"

I think this is a must have title at the moment because it shows absolut stunning the possibilities of VR. I didn´t saw something like this until now. And it´s imo also a must have game because there are more episodes coming. When they make them also so impressive and beautiful you will have to buy episode 1 for knowing the beginning of the story. ;-) The price for next episodes depends mainly on the number of purchases if I understood it right in the disscusions. That´s absolutly ok and understandable to me. The market is very young and it´s not a huge company, so it´s fine to handle it likes this. Better no promises as maybe later wrong promises.

												IMO This game is to VR what Half Life was to PC Gaming. Polished, Innovative, story driven and ahead of its time. The game is exactly what I have been looking for in a VR experience. The controls just work and the inventory system is very innovative. There is a level of polish seen here that is truly breathtaking for a first gen VR game. The real con here is the lack of content on offer. This game doesn’t feel like a $30 piece of content. It took me only 2 hours to finish and that was after having the final puzzle break on me the first time after completing it; albeit The only bug I encountered in my play through. Seeing as the game does not offer much on the replayability front, it is a hard sell at the current price. I strongly recommend this game to anyone once it goes on sale for $25 or less. I am excited to see what the next episode has in store.			"

												Echoing what a few people have already said, this is an adventure game but the fact that it's in VR, you are standing and you can use your hands makes it truly compelling on a level I've never experienced. I thoroughly enjoyed myself and constantly lost track of where I was in real life because presence kept kicking in. A couple of downsides though. One, the way the camera adjusted up and down in height depending on what you are standing on is extremely uncomfortable with me and the only time I've experienced motion sickness with my Vive. Granted this is the only game that that has different Heights in room scale that I've played but if it's for immersion reasons I'm two floating hands that cast shadows, having my view locked to a height to avoid screwy motion sicknesses on each blink would be OK. Two, the price. If it's going to be 30 dollars per episode (!!!) then this will become the classic ""wait till it's on sale"" game for VR because that's a hilariously high price for what is good, but very short amount of enjoyment.

												Unwieldy title aside, The Gallery Ep1 is a great introduction to adventure game conventions in VR.  The blink movement mechanic (with directional selection) took some practice, but once used to it I found little issue exploring.  The puzzles weren't overblown and felt attached to the narrative, each leaving me with a smile on my face.  The story told is a launching off point to a bigger tale and delivers a satifying first episode; leaving me excited for the next one by the time the credits rolled.My only criticism is that sometimes I didn't notice the colour outline on objects and had to trial and error to see if it was something I could store in my backpack.  Perhaps more distinct/customized colour choices could help in future episodes.Also note that this game is definitely on the higher-end graphical scale, so you'll want to tweak your graphical settings to ensure you're not dropping frames.  (View this as a plus, nothing about it feels ""tech demo/filler"", it's a properly designed world.)			"

Good music, color scheme and advanced teleporting system compared to Valve's ""The Lab,"" in the way that you can select post-teleport facing direction, which is very helpful.Nice to have chapter select after game completion and I dig the retro tape recorder motions to listen to audilogs.

												Well, I'm torn. On the one hand, I'm extremely looking forward to future episodes so it was clearly a good teaser. On the other hand, $30 is a fairly steep price for such a mere teaser that took me only 90 minutes to complete with as much looking around and playing around as I cared to do. I even wasted maybe 10 minutes trying to shoot seagulls. I really hope future episodes offset the cost of the first by either being cheaper or far more involved. I will recommend with high hopes, however, as it left me longing to see where this goes.			"

												I'll keep it short.I kickstarted this one way back in the days of Oculus DK1.  It's nothing like the game that was originally promised I don't think, a lot of the stuff is missing, no full torso shadow etc etcBut - it's a good play.It's very short, took me 2 hours, and I was spending a lot of time looking around and being silly.The Blink system is clunky, the hands could do with some arms, the puzzles are way too easy.But - it tells a story, at least the start of one, and creates an atmosphere well.There's massive, massive room for improvement, but it's a decent start.At full price I have to say it's overpriced, but it's fun and if it appears in a sale - buy it.Because - The end sequence is fantastic.  Gives you a real ""Wow, THIS is what VR can do that no other medium can do"" feeling.  You feel part of something magical, and leaves you gagging for the next part.The further you get through this first part, the more it feels as though the developers have found their feet, so you have to hope that the next episode is gonna be REALLY special.

												Very happy to hear that this game is now included with the Vive because I believe that anyone who plays this will immediatly realize that Call of Starseed Ep. 1 and the HTC Vive is the future of gaming. Starseed feels like the Virtual Reality fantasy I have been dreaming about since I was a little kid hearing about virutal reality and obsessing about the day when I could be inside new worlds and gaming experiences.I can't wait for more episodes and hope that this team continues to break new ground in making gaming and reality blend. It has been a long time since I finished a game where I was not only left breathless but also so excited about the future of gaming. Play Starseed ...you will love being a part of this new world.

												Never been this immersed in VR. I'm running it on my old, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GPU but it's still absolutely gorgeous. It's filled with mystery and i just love everything about it. It is however veeery short for it's price, but it's important to understand that the VR market is a subset of a subset of a subset (PC gamers, PC gamers with top hardware, PC gamers with a Vive) so prices reflect that. I also had a bunch of bugs, but none were game breaking. Like sometimes the loading screens are 3x as long as they usually are on that same leve. And graphics options sometimes don't save, and the blink mode never saves. So that's kind of annoying. But seriously, this is THE VR game to have because it just gives you such an incredible experience			"

												The Gallery is one of the Vive's big launch titles, and it shows. The game has a very noticeable level of polish and production values, and the visual quality is probably the best I've seen in the Vive so far. There's a lot of things in the environment that can be interacted with, and even if something isn't related to a puzzle it can be a lot of fun just messing with things, like throwing beer cans at rocks and watching them fizz around or cooking popcorn on a campfire. As a first episode of a larger series, a typical playthrough will last maybe 1 or 2 hours, but it can easily go more depending on how much you like to interact with the environment. My only complaint is that the checkpoint system is somewhat lacking, and if you encounter a bug or something that makes you quit the game you can sometimes find yourself replaying a lot of gameplay, particularly in the longer early areas. But the game is so good that you probably won't want to quit anyways, so barring the rare glitch it isn't much of a problem.			"

												This game is the unofficial sequel to Gravity Falls. Based on this game alone, I feel that point and click adventures have reached a new dawn with vr. This is one of the most accomplished, well paced, atmospheric games I have ever played. The puzzles were physical and real, but made perfect sense. The story was mysterious and full of character. It's not just one of the best VR games around right now. it's one of the best games in general, and I cannot wait for episode 2.That said, two issues. I could blink through a door at the end of the first section, to areas I clearly wasn't supposed to go. Also at the end of the first elevator, the frame rate tanked down to about 8fps. It was tearing my brain apart. I blinked like 3 times along the path and it sorted itself out, but still, needs fixing.But yeah, 10 out of flipping 10.			"

												One of the most fully realized games I've played on the Vive so far. The way in which inventory and movement is handled is great, and the story is pretty cool... at least so far as it goes.And that's the one negative to this $30 purchase - it's incredibly short. There's only 4-5 areas to complete, and they're over in the blink of an eye. There's nothing particularly challenging as you make your way through the beautiful environments.I loved the experience, but in some part that's due to the fact that I'm willing to support pretty much everything that's happening with the Vive right now, and this is something different. A year or two from now, I think I'd be appalled at paying $30 for such a tiny game. But having this product out at launch time? It gives a taste of what's to come, and (IMO) that's well-worth supporting.			"

Posted: April 14, 2016
												I enjoyed my time with the first episode of the Gallery. There has been a resurgence of adventure games recently with Telltale's series and Life Is Strange. This game harkens back more to those adventure games of the 90s that LucasArts used to make, and the popular Myst series. There is still a strong narrative but it doesn't take as much focus as the more recent adventure offerings which are often small bits of gameplay peppered around long cutscenes and NPC dialogue. Here the emphasis is more on environmental storytelling, with additional exposition being delivered via cassette tapes you'll (perhaps inexplicably) find around the game, and traditional NPC dialogue. The game has some of the best interaction with objects I've seen in a game. Most objects you can find in the game are able to picked up, and the way your virtual hands interact with them feel very natural. This game also has the best virtual inventory system I've seen in a game; you pull a backpack out from behind your back and reach to grab the items you want from it. If you want to stow something into your backpack, whilst holding the item you reach behind your back. The occasional puzzles you encounter in the game use this excellent interaction model to great effect. This is one of the best launch titles for VR, highly polished with about two hours of content. So the question is is it worth it? Currently it is one of the highest priced games on Steam for VR. Personally I felt the price was worth it, but that opinion is coloured by virtue of this being a VR game. If this was not a VR game, I feel like this game would be better priced at about $20 for the episode. I don't think you can disregard the VR because right now the audience for VR is very small and the developers likely need to charge a higher price to compensate for smaller sales. If you're looking for a VR adventure game in the vein of Myst or The Dig, then I recommend this. If you're on the fence, it might be worth waiting to see how future episodes are reviewed or for price drops.			"

												It's a bit pricey but I recommended nonetheless. It is a story, a good one, before you play this: turn off your phone, turn off steam notification, decouple your door bell. Proceed to play the game in one go. It will take 2-3 hours.I don't want to say to much about the game itself, it would be spoiling it like a good book or film. But it start on a beach and ends somewhere you have never been before. On the way you will discover audiologs, do puzzles and play around with objects and the environment.VR technical:- The world is gorgeous!- When you get to close to walls, your vision starts to blur. At some spots it maybe starts to blur a bit too quick. - The ingame movement is a blinking system, you can even rotate your play area.- There is some automatic height adjustments which is quite uncomfortable. So avoid walking on and off ledges, but just blink. There was one point where I went to close to a ledge to look down and I sort of fell to area below. I had to take a breather to get back on my feet. (Devs try to look at these high adjustment mechanics because they could probably improve)- There is tutorial area which teaches you how to blink and interact with object, which is quite good but doesn't take to long if you already know all this stuff.- Moving object around can be a bit flaky and could use some work. Somehow it was quite common to bump the controllers together. Mainly because I wanted to try and manipulate items with two hands, which is not possible.			"

I left a negative review. I just bought it again now that the price has been lowered. I am blown away.This is AAA. It starts of rather slow, and seems very cute but nothing to fancy. But by the time this game gets going, there are some trully stunning areas to explore and all running super smooth on my system, enabling some real presence. The issue is, by the time my jaw was hitting the floor, it was over!I can understand the reason this got some negative reviews however. Even though the last puzzle made me think and I found it very fun, it was basically one of only two puzzles in the entire game. It is also very short... but the quality more than makes up for it in my eyes... this is AAA quality in a bite size package.Anyway, easily the best game on Vive yet, and it was one of the first. I can't wait to see this slowly become a full game via the future chapters, and will be gladly investing in Cloudheads future work.			"

												I really enjoyed my time with Call of the Starseed. It is far too short, there aren't enough puzzles and it is too expensive in relation to its length. With all that said it was amazing look at how impressive and immersive a story telling medium VR can be. I thought the game looked fantastic and did a great job with its controls. I was especially impressed with the inventory system which has you reach over your shoulder to grab your virtual back pack.You can then position it somewhere convenient to acces your various items. Once your finished simply grab the bag and put it back over your shoulder. Very simple mechanic but i thought it was a cool way to manage inventory without clunky menus. I look forward to more form this team and this story arc but im sure a more realistic pricing structure will have to be reached. If you have the money and want a really cool experience i fully reccomend this. I was a big fan of 90's adventure games and this is a perfect example of just how cool things could be.			"

												While this game is an excellent showcase of the potential of VR, there isn't enough content to merit the price.  There's only one real puzzle to speak of near the end of the game (but it's a fantastic one).  The final scenes, however, had my jaw dropping to the floor - they were truly incredible.  But it's not foreshadowed very well, and it's a sudden and radical left turn from the tone of the earlier parts of the game.  And of course, it's a cliffhanger.If you've got $30 extra just lying around, I'd say go for it; but as it stands now (with only episode 1 out), I am not sure it's worth the list price until there's more content.

Additionally, this game on the HTC Vive is one of the first to make me forget that I was in fact standing in my little bedroom with wonky googles on.I don't have many complaints. Normally I dislike teleport mechanics in VR games, but it serves this game well, honestly. I encountered one bug total (an elevator left without me), but it self-repaired.If you have a VR device, or a friend who owns one - you HAVE to play this game. It's worth twice its cost.			"

												A Fantastic start of a journey, with a story that will engross you. It is fully voice acted, sound design, an engrossing story and is an experience harkening to the days of Point and Click Adventures; Except that you are fully within the world. You use your own hands to interact with the world through the motion controls. It doesnt come with its down faults however, it is marred by some judder issues even with a decent system, and is fairly short for its price, (being double of a movie ticket, and milage which varies): But these should be ironed out as time goes on, and the pricing issues should ease away as we go to future episodes and VR gets adopted further. This is the quality of content we should be rooting for,  thus for now, to support development, it is fully worth the price of admission.			"

												If you are a long-time adventure gamer who just got his Vive, this is probably what you're looking for. It isn't a demo, or a quick experiment. It's not something somebody threw together for a college project. It's a short (< 2 hours) adventure game with easy puzzles, but the art assets and voice acting are what you expect from a full retail game. The world isn't huge; there are 4 locations in the game, but they are all properly atmospheric and look great. This is a glimse at what a full-blown AAA VR game would be like, even if this is only part of one.The controls all just work. Tracking of the two Vive controllers is fine, the haptic feedback works when it needs to, but wasn't anything special. The ""blink"" method of locomotion is passable. I wish the rotation of the destination weren't so finicky. Holding the flashlight and map at the same time, using the flashlight to illuminate the world and the map is great. Item management works well, though it's strange that many objects just can't be taken (only special items can be stored).If these puzzles appeared in a regular 2D adventure game, they would be insufficient. The thing about VR, though, is that if you trade that off with immersion, it's ok. I feel that the stuff that's here, while basic, works well enough because you're *inside the damn game*. But don't come in expecting Grim Fandango.The game is about 110 minutes +/- some time depending on how many bugs you hit. And it's 30 bucks, and it seems like the other chapters will be also. All in will be over $100. If that bugs you, fair enough. But I have two people in the house who will both play it, so to me it's worth the money. My wife and I spend that much on a regular restaurant meal, and you just blew $800 on a Vive. To me, I'd rather do this than play 10 half-baked games.About the bugs: yes, the developer has work to do. Some items will persist in the game world (for me it was a miniaturized set of ammunition for the flare gun), floating there for no reason as you move through the game. They can get stuck onto your hand, and only a reset got rid of them. I also had several instances where the game was bogged down on my GTX 970/i7@3400 GHz machine, though minimizing the game window on my monitor helped. The game also froze after solving the ""main"" puzzle near the end, which made me have to redo it after restarting. More checkpoints would be nice.The Gallery is at times spooky, but I'd never say it's scary. There are no jump scares or anything like that, nobody gets in your face. There are a few sections of automatic locomotion that may make some people motion-sick, so beware of those. It's just a few elevators, but it's a substantial amount of game time near the end. Also, if you run into the frame rate issues I had, you might puke; I don't recommend this if you don't meet the Vive's minimum spec.			"

												This is the best game on vive I've played.  It combines puzzlers (ala Myst) with a touch of sci fi, in a beautiful emersive world. As many have bemoaned, many games on the vive have an ""arcade"" feel to them.  This breaks the mold nicely.  And there were a few, ""HOLY CRAP"" moments that were just amazing.			"

												By far one of the best experiences I've had on the Vive. I love old school adventure games like Lucasarts & Sierra and this really scratched that itch for a VR game in that style. The only con is the length. It is a fairly short experience, especially for the full $30 price. Despite that I still feel that it was worth the investment in a studio that made a beautiful fun VR game.			"

												Possibly the best VR game yet, can't wait for episode 2 so I can get lost in this world once again. Only thing it's missing in my opinion is proper redirected movement locomotion as moving by rotating the play space and walking everywhere was my favorite way to move around this world, as it's rich and beautiful while not too huge to discourage exploration through physical walking.

												Just finished this, and I've been blown away. It's slow, but deliberately so, and action isn't what makes this special (there are plenty of other VR games for that). The atmosphere... the music... the characters and the beautiful mystery into which they're drawn. This is dark fantasy at its best. By the end of this short episode, I am all in; I'm ready to take the next step (literally) with the characters, eager to discover where this tale is headed, driven by a genuine concern for my sister. Towards the end, as I descended into the depths of the earth, I was rendered breathless. An amazing and disturbing journey at once. I've dreamed of this kind of experience since I was a kid. This is what we were promised in the 90's, and it's finally arrived. Kudos to this team for making something truly special, something that many of us have longed after for many years. A few technical glitches aside, this is worth every, single penny.			"

I thought I had a pretty good idea of what VR was capable of but The Gallery just completely changed my perspective on the tech and the future. I don't just mean the future of video games. This goes beyond video games. This is a conciousness game.If you have a Vive get this. It is everything you want, and didn't know you wanted from a VR experience.

												This game is a great example of where vr games should be heading in the future. it is not the ""stand still and shoot stuff coming at you"" kind of game you often find today.pros:- looks good- well done inventory- step of an edge and you actually fall down (yes of course i tried it)- controls are intuitive- wtf ending makes you want more- decent story ...cons:- ... that you have to look for (think bioshock 1 audiologs)- the rest of the sound isnt dimmed when listening to a tape- short (about 90 minutes)- sometimes the collision detection (for the floor) gets confused and you bounce up and down- price (although its fair to say, that the vr market is very small today and almost all games are still a lot more expensive compared to non vr games)if you are looking for a game thats more than just point and shoot or a reflex test this game is well worth a look.i finished it once and i will definetly play it again.

I take my time.What i saw so far is nicely done and the quality is a lot higher than pretty much all other early roomscale games. Graphics are great too. It's definatly worth the money for me allready. I will update this review onc i finished the game.Update: played some more today. As you can see I am taking it slow.I have very little playtime and when I play nowadays I amin no rush. From what i saw today the game really took off. I fear it is over soon since it is known to be short but it is worth the money. Episode 2 is a must buy for me allready.Update: Finished it just now. I wont spoiler anything but the end is bloody amazing. This is the best experience in gaming i had in a very long time!			"

												Someone once told me VR is just a fake world and it will disappear once I turn off the computer, I replied: ""But the emotions I felt was real.""Despite its short gameplay, Call of the Starseed truly brings out the raw emotions out of me. Awe, anxiety, fear, and the urge to push forward despite all odds due to the burning curiosity within.For a first generation VR game, Call of the Starseed is visually stunning. While it does not have the sharpness of modern AAA games due to the limitations of current generation headsets, everything looks surprisingly real, including your own hands. Well animated NPCs and excellent voice acting also helped made this world organic and alive.The only complain I have is that the price is slightly on the high side for such a short experience, which can be completed around 2 hours if you are not like me and get stuck in almost every puzzle.However, if you love games that tinges your emotional cord, and doesn't mind paying for future chapters, Call of the Starseed is for you.tl;drPros: Emotion roller coaster Visually stunning Excellent NPCsCons: Pricey Short experience "

												Short story - BUY IT - top notch experience and immersion.This is by far the most immersive VR experience I have played through yet - especially with the Vive and tracked controllers. The graphics and immersion are amazing, and play time is better than most early VR games as well. Love how the hands are rendered and work in VR (and hope they take advantage of gloves and elbow tracking that will be coming out at some point). This is a throwback to adventure games I loved so much back when they were popular, and this medium makes them so much better. There are achievements in this game as well, so planning to jack back in and finish the achievements! Can't WAIT for the next chapter!There are some known flickering issues in some spots, but appears to possibly be an nVidia driver issue or STeamVR issue. Shows up in this game because it is much more advanced than many of the launch VR titles. I still had no problems getting through the chapter though.			"

												Hands down the most immersive VR experience currently available. This game is just pure magic. If you own a Vive, you are doing yourself a great disservice is you pass this one by.My only complaint is that it's shorter than I would like. You can play this game in one sitting (standing?). It's hard to gauge time when you're in VR, but I'd say 2 hours at the most.			"

												Wow....Was holding off playing this game after I bought the Vive, I guess I wanted to experience all the cool shooters/games that seemed to have a large wow factor with VR. The game I should have checked out earlier is this one. Really unique experience that capitalizes on what VR does well and doesnt just rest on its laurels as being another game with one cool feature. Production values are top notch and so is story telling. Even the basic mechanics and use of world interaction are above most of the other games.Worth the price of admission...do yourself a favor, you spent a ton on this whole vive vr thing. Go one step further and get this game. *drops mic*			"

												Good game, good graphics and mostly good puzzles. Downside is it doesn't take long too complete.My one crticism is no consideration for coloured blind people in one of the puzzle. If you have to involve colours why cant they be bright blue, orange, white and black.  But apart from the colour thing and being too short, overall a good game. "

I also love the always-present image showing you the center of your play area, as well as the fact that you can rotate the area around yourself when you teleport.  It allows for you to choose where you move and how much space around yourself you want, which is quite nice when playing.Definitely a must-buy.  Can't wait for future episodes!			"

												This game is very short as it is an introduction to a multipart series. Even admiring the beautiful environments didn't get me more than about an hour and a half of game time with no replayability beyond admiring the quality of the production. While I admit that may turn away many thrifty purchasers, I want to give a few more thoughts on the overall value of the experience.This game was absolutely worth the time spent and was by far the most immersive and visually stunning experience I've had thus far in virtual reality. It was worth the price as a vanguard vr project to help fund well-optimized games with engaging storytelling. If you're an early adopter of the Vive, this story introduction will be well worth your time and money.			"

												In a word, Amazing. Like many people, I am new to VR, or at least long durations of being in VR. This game will take you somewhere else, and it is gorgeous in its rustic, delapadated environs. At times I was so immeresed I forgot I was in a vertual world. Simply exploring and looking around was as much fun as trying to complete the puzzles, which could be a bit harder, but they aren't so hard that you become frustrated.Some people complain about the value. But even if you only get a ew hours of gameplay out of the story, it's a better deal than you and a date going to the movies, and certainly going to be a better experience. After getting their feet wet with Tilt Brush, I will have my friends play The Gallery as it is currently the best example of the potential of VR.			"

Fantastic sense of atmosphere and the ending, holy crap it completely blew me away.  I've had my Vive for about a week now and I've tried everything available for it multiple times, had to wait on this game because I only had 12GB RAM and found on the highest settings the game would crash after chapter 1 with memory issues.  Upgraded my RAM and finally got to finish this game.  The single most astonishing VR experience for me so far was the final sequence, I can't blabber on about it enough.  Looking forward to the next episode.			"

												Well dang. I know there are a couple ""real"" VR games hitting Steam among the deluge of throwaway tech demos, but this one is a cut above the rest. It feels like the future of VR. Like after we get done standing and spinning around to shoot things and we get past all of that dumb Wii level BS, when we start getting full experiences, they will be like this. Besides the occasional jank, it's a very smooth and polished experience. The elevators will give you vertigo, the fireworks will delight you, the volleyball and basketball hoop will wake up your neighbors above if you are 6'3"" and have short ceilings. I want more of this, and not knowing when the next episode comes out makes me sad. It's absolutely worth the money for one episode. Especially considering you just paid $900 (Shipping and handling!) for that headset of yours.			"

Picking up a candle with the other hand, and lighting the RC realizing hey, it is!  And firing them around is so cool.Having to reach behind you to pull out your backpack, go through it for the item you need, and pulling it out feels so smooth and real.They did amazing work for such a small team!  This is a must have!11/10(Just like the VR tester goes to!)			"

												Wooooww! What a brilliant game! Immersive! The mood set by each ""scene"" is incredible, where I was properly on edge in certain parts. I had tingles in a lot of it, and it is the only/first game for the Vive that made me jump... Stupid glowstick falling into water behind me...The story is very well put together, the characters are really well acted/fleshed out considering the minimal contact you have with them. I can't really explain how effective it is.Considering the graphics, the performance of the game is great. I've had so many problems with other Unity games, but this one ran nicely on a R9 290, i5 6600k. Maybe 5 dropped frames the entire time. I did run the game on low, mind, but it still looked great :)My only critical review point would be about the backpack. I found myself struggling to juggle 2 items then get the backpack out etc. I don't know how I would improve it though, it was just too real :PI haven't finished the game yet, but I'm already happy with the purchase. The amount of quality content is 10x to 100x that of a lot of £15 games for the Vive, and I feel bad that the devs are getting negative reviews about the price. My argument goes: at least 5 games in the top 20 Vive games are a single scene, with low quality content but good replayability. Now those are great games and they absolutely have a place, but charging £10-£15 for them just seems wrong when put up against disproportionately  high quality content like this.Anyway, I hope the next episodes are quick for the devs to produce as they have the format, interactions, optimisations all down now. I'll be buying the next episode and cannot wait.			"

Ok it's a bit short, but if you have a headset you owe it to yourself to play this game.Characters are interesting and funny, the puzzles are (while a little easy) satisfying and the inventory and menu systems are excellent.Don't be put of by the seemingly high price, this is one fantastic experience.

												This is probably the most polished narrative game you can find, with great VR mechanics. Great story and visual imagery, but plays a little short. I was left longing for more, and hope the devs will continue and make followup episodes.My wife was skeptical of the game, seeing how much I paid for it given the amount of content, but after having played it herself, she was impressed, and felt it was one of the most polished experiences she's had.tl;dr: Buy this if you want to see what a polished VR game would look like and support the developers who make them, and you have a little bit of money to burn. You won't regret it, but you won't necessarily love the price.			"

Fantastic sense of atmosphere and the ending, holy crap it completely blew me away.  I've had my Vive for about a week now and I've tried everything available for it multiple times, had to wait on this game because I only had 12GB RAM and found on the highest settings the game would crash after chapter 1 with memory issues.  Upgraded my RAM and finally got to finish this game.  The single most astonishing VR experience for me so far was the final sequence, I can't blabber on about it enough.

												Well dang. I know there are a couple ""real"" VR games hitting Steam among the deluge of throwaway tech demos, but this one is a cut above the rest. It feels like the future of VR. Like after we get done standing and spinning around to shoot things and we get past all of that dumb Wii level BS, when we start getting full experiences, they will be like this. Besides the occasional jank, it's a very smooth and polished experience. The elevators will give you vertigo, the fireworks will delight you, the volleyball and basketball hoop will wake up your neighbors above if you are 6'3"" and have short ceilings. I want more of this, and not knowing when the next episode comes out makes me sad. It's absolutely worth the money for one episode. Especially considering you just paid $900 (Shipping and handling!) for that headset of yours.			"

												By Far this game will be my number 1 pick for what I want to play long term.  It was a bit strange at first was stuck because i was not playing the tapes and taking the hints but once i did and got to the last stage of the game i was almost 10 years old again.  I admit that I went back and keep going back to play around with the Graphic card settings for the last sceen because it is by far super exciting to watch.  I only wish the game was not so short!  The last puzzle was my only issue, it took way to long to complete longer then it takes to get to that point in the game but it was worth completing as the sceen after that up to the end of the Episode was amazing.  Please release new updates, but not so expensive, the price of this Episode was not worth the gameplay TBH, paying 30 for a game i would expect a decent 8n hours of game.  But with that said for anyone not sure about this game play it, its worth the money now but if they are going to charge us every episode it is not worth it after the first one.			"

If you own a Vive then this game is a no brainer, A truly magical experience, If you ever fancied starring in an adventure movie and thought you could do a better job than Indiana Jones then this is the game for you, Yes everyone is saying it's short for the price, But nothing I have seen comes close so far on the Vive in terms of an actual game, And because of the nature of VR I think it's well playable a few times just like you would go on that roller coaster again and again, Breakout of your dull life and go to another place, you won't regret it.

												So, I'm going to give this a positive rating, however, I strongly recomend thinking about how much money you're willing to spend per hour of gameplay, even if it is VR. I beat the game in almost exactly an hour. The puzzles weren't difficult at all, and there was not 'exploration' due to being very linear. Graphics were fine, not quite at 'The Lab' level but better than some other VR experiences. For me it wasn't worth the ~$25 I paid for it, but it is a great start to something that will hopefully end up being interesting (the game stops on a cliff-hanger, just as it is getting good). That being said, this will be the first (and hopefully last) game I've ever refunded on Steam (I seriously cannont justify $25 for 1 hour of gameplay, since my wife isn't going to be interested in doing a playthrough of this game). If they add episode 2 to this as a paid, or cheap, DLC I'll gladly re-purchase it (perminately) to continue on with the story, but for now it goes back on my wishlist for me to watch as things *hopefully* improve.

Felt like I was inside a Pirates of the Caribean movie almost (no pirates though sorry). I did pick during the Steam sale otherwise I might have not dropped the $30 Ill admit. But after having played Id say its worth it. The next best experiance I had was with Vanishing Realms which is $20. If you liked that, Id say pick this one up! Very similar. Minus the combat, but more impressive visually. Will be buying episode 2 when it arrives for sure.			"

												Unfortunately my gtx970 had to go to its limit to run the game, and (maybe due to overclocking) the game crashed quite a few times in the beginning. Plus I ran into some bugs, for example entering the sewer system through the gate (after the beach) caused the vision to go black and I was unable to go/turn back, it just stayed like that , so I had to restart the game.That aside, the game did finally run pretty smooth on the lowest settings with a low-ish resolution (changeable in setting), and sweet jesus the experience is awesome. Well designed and differenciated levels, lots of cool game mechanics.  The game is indeed short (4 chapters that you can each basically rush through in a few minutes), but you can spend much more time exploring the world.Also, the ending tight as ♥♥♥♥ and definitely justifies buying the game.

												This first episode of The Gallery shows a lot of promise. The story and characters are interesting and the world is very immersive. I'm not going into details, but I do recommend this game... but maybe you shouldn't buy it yet.You're basically going to pay 30 €/$ for about 1-2 hours of content. The big question is: How much does it cost you to play the other episodes after buying the first one? Hopefully not a lot, as the cost of this first episode is already pretty high. Waiting is propably the best option, unless you really want to experience it now. I don't regret buying the game at this point. Just be aware of the possibility of sky high pricing. It propably won't be like that, but who knows.One of the best VR experiences so far.8/10 Applauses [media.giphy.com] "

												Fantastic immersion and sense of adventure throughout this beautiful piece of art. I got this bundled with my Vive, so my only comment on the price is that it may be a little high for the length of the game.+ Beautiful atmosphere+ Sound design is excellent+ Perfect 1:1 tracking+ Polished VR that truly feels like an actual game+ lots of little extras that you'll no doubt miss on your first play through+ Really liked the backpack and the way it worked+ Puzzles aren't too hard and a good sense of progression- On stairs the camera can go up and down and cause a nauseous feeling.- Pretty short with only a few puzzles- Putting items down can be quite fiddly.- Music / audio doesn't automatically drop when listening to audio logs, but the intuitive ability to hold the tape recorder closer to your ear does make it louder and clearer.-/+ If you want to get all the achievements, there is one that'll take you 7 hours of leaving your Vive on (hence my playtime) -/+ Audio logs, you'll either love them or hate them. I personally really like them, nice Bioshock feel.Overall, really enjoyable game and really look forward to Episode 2. The experience far outweighs the length of this game. Highly recommend.			"

While it seems overpriced for the length of play time offered, this is the nature of games right now while VR is so young. I spent $800+ on my vive plus a new new GTX980. A slightly higher priced game is not going to deter me especially when quality experiences are so hard to come by at this time. I will be buying episode 2 the moment it is released.

												I got this game for free when I bought the Vive and I am so glad I tried it because these mysterie-puzzle games are usually not the type of games I play. Although I can agree that the 20€ pricetag is way too high, I can also agree that it's a brilliant experience.My playtime was, from start to finish, 1.2 hours and I am not that great at solving puzzles.The story itself starts off pretty unremarkable (find your lost sister) but evolves into a very entertaining and exciting adventure. (I'll only say, as the title might suggest, that sci-fi fans will most probably love it)The graphics are really good and I didn't get a headache because of washed out/blurred textures. The whole world actually is just great to look at and explore. It happened more than once that I just had to stand somewhere admiring the scenery until I forgot what I was actually supposed to do.The controls, using standart teleportation, are very accurrate and the game didn't loose tracking accurracy regardless of how stupidly i tried to reach something.All in all, it is well worth playing and I am looking forward to the second part but I really hope that the new part is either a lot cheaper or a lot longer in terms of story/playing time.

The Gallery: Call of the Starseed is the first episode of a science-fiction adventure game for the Vive.The player takes the role of Alex, a (presumably) young man following in the footsteps of his vanished twin sister, trying to discover what has become of her.In terms of gameplay and content, this is exactly the experience the Vive was made for. The player interacts with everything , even her inventory, in a very natural way, from picking up and manipulating objects to opening and closing containers to loading cassettes into a Walkman Talkman to throwing and catching items to shaking glowsticks to manually loading a flaregun. Curiosity is encouraged and rewarded, and the player will make use of the full range of her play space, vertical as well as horizontal.The story is engaging, and the graphical and auditory effects are beautiful and immersive.The only thing that makes me hesitate to recommend this title is the conjunction of its length and price. At the time of this writing, it is priced at 28€, and it takes 60-90 minutes to play from beginning to end - potentially a bit longer if you take more time to complete the puzzles and dexterity challenges, or if you explore and examine everything exhaustively. If it were either significantly longer or substantially less expensive (both of which I understand that subsequent episodes will be), I would be harping on and on about it to all my friends, relatives, and casual acquaintances, and relentlessly nagging them to buy and play it.As it is, The Gallery: Call of the Starseed is a fantastic experience, and I heartily recommend it to those who feel it's an adequate value.

												When I first got my Vive, this was already on my list to try because of the comments I had seen on Reddit. I really wasn't disappointed.If this were a normal, 2D FPS-type exploration adventure, you'd whizz through it in about 45 mins. Because you're immersed, however, you take so much more time to observe and enjoy your surroundings. The world is lovingly made and there are lots of details you'd skip without the abillity to pick things up and look at them from all angles.At one point, I had the entirely open choice of using my flashlight, a lantern or a candle. I decided to pick up the candle because I enjoyed moving it around and seeing how it realistically affected shadows. This feature isn't groundbreaking in terms of what game engines can do - but when you're *in*it, it's delightful. Shortly afterward, in my other hand, I picked up a note. As I tried to read it, the ambient light was a little muted, so I moved my candle closer. I had just started to read it when the page blackened and set on fire. The few puzzles you solve are satisfying, and the final big puzzle experience is mesmerising, and done so well. Nothing particularly mentally taxing, but because you're moving things around with your hands it just *feels* more awesome.Other, random highlights: - Moving things that emit sound closer to your ear to hear them better (hint: try the seashells) - Trying to juggle with beer bottles in the tutorial - The beach. - Being able to rotate your playspace to fit each little nook and cranny you want to explore. It meant I could figure the best fit and not have to teleport to enjoy all the details a particular room/spot was hiding.If this were a 2D game, you'd be upset to pay over £20 for it. Because it's VR, it's totally worth it. I felt like I was the silent protagonist of a feature length episode of a new JJ Abrams/Damon Lindelof collaboration. I'm really looking forward to Episode 2, and am *really* pleased this will now be bundled with the Vive as I think it's a fantastic intro to what storytelling in a VR experience can be.			"

												The Gallery - Episode 1: Call of the Starseed is a room-scale VR first person adventure game where you interact with items with your own two hands (well, with the vive controller sticks). The game itself is not particularly long and would probably get a negative review if it weren’t for the virtual reality element. The game takes place on a beach and sewer system and feels very immersive the entire time you are playing. A couple times I found myself reaching up for items only to be reminded that my ceiling fan occupies that area in real-space. Thankfully, the game allows you to adjust your VR blink area by moving your thumb across your left controller so that you can conveniently position the playing field away from things, such as a ceiling fan. I’ve played a lot of adventure games and as a result I found the puzzles in TG:E1 to be a bit on the easy side, not to mention a bit sparse. There are really only two puzzles more complicated than “put the thing in the other thing” but those two were actually pretty fun to figure out. The game places more emphasis on exploring your surroundings and finding things such as cassette tapes left as a kind of audio diary for you to follow. I hope that the sequels will have a bit more interactivity as the parts where I was messing with circuit boards and resistors or searching for the meaning of “3B” were the most fun.I got this game for free as part of my initial purchase of a Vive so I can’t really speak for its price but I would probably consider getting the sequel if it were released for about the same price as it is now ($19.99). Just keep in mind that if you blow through this game without stopping to smell the roses it’s probably not going to last you more than 90 minutes.			"

												This felt like a VR myst to me. Some puzzles easier than others, but nothing too hard. Glad they brought the price down to $20. Is it worth that, maybe. It's a little short, but that being said, it has a great story and pretty polished. I can't comment on the graphics as I'm running on the minimum  graphics card (gtx 970) for VR, but it looked great with what I have. Looking forward to the next installment when it arrives!			"

												I just finished ​The Gallery - Episode 1: Call of the Starseed. Soo cool. Probably my favorite VR experience so far. It's an adventure puzzle game, inspired by ""dark 80's fantasy films."" The puzzles aren't ground breaking, but they are very well suited for VR and they were fun to solve. The environment and detail and space the game gives you is really what made it for me. At times I was scared and at other times I was dancing. It's obvious they were inspired by so many things, from Goonies to 2001, and they found a way to synthesize it all. On top of that it features top notch voice acting, comfortable teleport movement, and a great inventory system. It makes me excited to make my own VR places and stories. I can't wait to see what happens in the next The Gallery episode.			"

I feel as if this is the next evolution for that genre and the beautifully crafted ambient scenery does not fail to impress.Overall I feel as if the developers have used all the new capabilities of VR and the Vive and managed to use them in some clever ways.And if you bought a Vive to play then you have this anyway, therefore it should be the first thing you play.

												Absolutely awesome. A few glitches but nothing worse than a non-VR game. Intuitive controls. Interesting tasks and puzzles (although nothing particularly difficult). Captivating story. Good controls.The game reminded me of a Myst-lite type experience but in VR. The only issues are not game specific and are problems with everything in VR (motion/teleporting problems, room-scale problems, graphical fidelity, etc.) and those they handled better than most games.My only hope for the next installments is that they present progressively more difficult tasks. Since there isn't a death mechanism the difficulty of tasks is going to be key for replayability.			"

												This was a great time. It looked good (better than certain screenshots suggest), played well, and the blink system where you can rotate the play area is something I wish every game had. The sense of adventure was great, and each section felt well paced and enjoyable. I do have a hangup, though. The puzzles span a variety of styles- basic observation/aim, navigation, depth perception- all of these puzzles fit VR, each one is enhanced by VR. But one of the puzzles was a misfire, in my opinion.  It was the fuse puzzle. I just feel like that one gained nothing by being in vr- it felt a little awkward to navigate and some rules of the puzzle made no sense.That puzzle aside, this game was great. Really immersive, good voice acting, GREAT ending. I do recommend and also, cannot wait for episode 2.			"

												Okay first and foremost I am so damn glad I didn't watch the Steam trailer before playing this game because I had no idea what to expect. The ""Machine"" section took me completely by surprise and reminded me so much of the Fifth Element (for some reason). I was completely taken aback!The voice acting and character animations aren't amazing, nor are the quality of textures or geometry but that is where my negativity ends; this is the kind fo foot in the door that VR needs, the backpack functionality was a breath of fresh air and I thoroughly enjoyed the attention to detail like setting off fireworks and holding a sea shell to your ear (that really made me smile). The sense of wonder I had playing this is unlike anything I have come across in a game so far. I bought it solely on good reviews and I was definitely not disappointed! It is however a little on the short side, I admittedly expected double the length for the price it was, but not complaining though as it was still worth every penny!I would highly recommend this to anyone who owns a Vive and I'm hugely looking foward to playing the second one, the end of this episode completely and utterly piqued my interest!

												This is BY FAR the best you can get out of the Vive at this time.I've played a lot of games for the first week that I own this device, but this just blew my mind.It's the first time for me that puzzles and story and great staging comes together to form an experience that makes me believe that VR can actually be here to stay.Seriously, if you have a Vive, get this! Can't wait for the next episodes.One thing to note is that the pricing is of course very heavy if you think of the playtime and the fact that this is just the first episode. But the fact that the target audience for VR is still so small probably gives the developers no other choice. However i'm pretty sure that they don't expect us to pay 150$ for the full game. Not gonna happen.			"

												I ended up getting this game like 2 weeks after I first received my Vive and had played plenty of other stuff and it just completely blew me away. The ending is magnificent and I have replayed that portion multiple times. I have had my family all complete the game as well just so they could see it and they all were very impressed and enjoyed playing. It is a puzzle adventure game and does a very nice job of setting the atmosphere throughout the different areas. I honestly believe this is worth the price even if the price stays the same for the future episodes. Although they have mentioned that it will likely be cheaper in future episodes (I think). If you enjoy stories and really getting absorbed into the game I highly recommend purchasing this even at its current price.			"

												All the negative reviews forced me to write this quick review.*sigh* Yes, it is short, but IF YOU DO NOT SUPPORT this specific genre again, it will be like it was on the PC, neglected with a few gems... Despite this being VERY expensive, I still think it's worth it because you can get some friends or family members to experience this epic tale once it's over.Overall I thought this game was VERY VERY fun and it did have a few glitches but nothing game breaking. I so can't wait for Episode 2 and YES, I will spend another $30 (if it is 30) for episode 2 when it comes out.Soo support this genre!			"

												Everything I would have expected and more. This was the first adventure/puzzle game I downloaded for my Vive setup. Once you get used to the controls, they feel extremely natural. The only thing that left me a bit disoriented were areas with major slope changes in the ground. This results in the camera vertical position jumping to the correct height to prevent you from clipping into surfaces; as disorienting as it was, it doesn't happen frequently at all, and I personally don't know of a better solution to that game design challenge. My favorite innovation was the inventory system. Once you get used to using the backpack, it feels very natural and fun!			"

												If you're a go-go-go type then this game will probably take you about 2 hours to complete. If you're a take-it-slower type like me, then this game will probably take you about 2.5-3.5 hours. In both cases, just buy it.*PROS*-Phenomenal story.-Excellent graphics.-Complete immersion (this is the only VR game where I've actually bumped into my wall a couple times reaching for things. it's also the first VR game where I kept stepping prematurely, expecting to be able to walk down a path before remembering it didn't actually exist).-Intuitive, natural controls.-Getting a glimpse at the future of VR.-Spooky and emotive locales, but thankfully no horror.*CONS*-It starts with a ""look"" form of the blink teleport mechanic. Hit the menu button and you can change it to the standard ""point"" blink teleport found in most vr games.*Other Stuff*The primary game themes are: exploration, investigation, discovery, and mystery.The primary game mechanics involve walking about, collecting and using items, investigating, and some puzzle solving (but thankfully not too much) as you slowly unravel the plot.The price is not a pro or con. You get what you pay for. This is a better experience than people who wait for an hour in line at Disney World get to see (and those experiences only last 5-10 minutes!). The devs are planning 4 episodes and they can't get finished soon enough as far as I'm concerned. This is probably the best VR experience on Steam at this time. If you've got the cash, it's a no-brainer.			"

												Sadly I can't recommend this game for it's current length and price. The game is beautiful and flows nicely, and has some interesting puzzles, but for $20 for a game I finished in under 90 minutes without rushing just doesn’t scream worth to me. In addition it’s episodic so I assume that the rest of the games are going to be like this as well. A lot of the reviews are saying the story is great, but considering the game is 90 mins and you barely do much I don’t see much story at all. The few characters you meet aren’t that exciting, and at best it leaves off way too open ended. Maybe if all the episodes come out at once in a decent bundle price it’d be worth considering, but for now I can’t recommend it.  "

												Wow, this is exactly the kind of game, wich i would like to see more often in VR. It's more or less a classic adventure but you really are in the middle of it, exploring and trying things out. It's not too complicated, just perfect for VR. The game starts slow, but gets better and better and leaves you with a big cliffhanger. Fans of ""Stranger Things"" or any 80s SciFi- ans mystery-stuff might like the setting. I just hope the second part will have more playtime, since i completed this one in just 2 hours. But besides this, there is really nothing to complain here for me. One of the best VR-experiences on any plattform. Part 2 will be an instant buy for me.			"

												Absolutely fantastic, up there with Vanishing Realms as one of the best VR Experiences I have tried yet.It's kind of like a VR Myst in a way. Something else that was a particular standout was the physics audio. I have noticed a lot of VR games are missing many sound fx, and it may just be very noticeable in VR, but here there are a lot of fantastic subtle details that are very hard to get right. Like the physics sounds of dropping metal items, or the sound of the rain when you are inside.It may have some performance problems though: I have a beast of a machine (gtx 1080, 6700k) and I had some stuttering during some sequences, running with medium details settings, but it wasn't enough to negatively affect anything. There are plenty of graphics options in there which could help too.Episode 2 is an instant buy for me.			"

												Too short to be worth the price point, especially when so much of the time I'd spent waiting for someone to finish talking or riding on elevators/platforms. The ""story"" of the game barely gives you any clue as to what's going on and is mostly told through difficult-to-hear audiotapes. The puzzles are mundane. They're mostly a set of ""pick up these thinges and put them here"" tasks or a ""find the numbers"" games.I'm just glad this came bundled with my Vive. I doubt I will be playing any future episodes if they don't drop the price or significantly change the game.			"

												TL;DR: The game is overall pretty good, but is way too short to be worth 20 € in my opinion (and I'll be unsure about 10 € too). I call this a demo. I played longer demos in the past.I got this for free with my vive, but i was left kind of disappointed. There are some really great mechanics (like the inventory management), but, while playing, I often felt like the experience was ""stretched"". VR is a new media and I was unsure if that was the case, but as the game ended quickly, I'm now pretty sure it was intentional.As an example, the tutorial felt way longer than needed. Ok, I did play other experiences before, but then again there's no need for me to smash every single botte. The Lab just tells you how to teleport and grab stuff and you are done. Felt like they really wanted me to be ready before jumping into action, so I did take my time to ensure I was ready. Except, there is no action at all in the whole game so you have plenty of time to practice later in a non-time-critical environment. There are many more examples but I will just stop here to avoid spoilers.I really cannot suggest this to anyone at this price. A few really easy puzzles, lots of teleporting, a huge deal of standing still and listening (good voice acting, though). I really took my time looking around, checked pretty much everything out, played a lot with useless objects (example I spent a good 15 minutes playing with an hammer inside the magnetic field), and still did a full run in under 2 hours.I may be interested in the next episode, but I'll wait for other people's reviews, and no way I'd spend 20 € for an experience like this. Pretty well done, but there is already way better and longer stuff to do in VR for this price.			"

												This game is just a glorified walking simulator, with very little interaction and one tiny... kinda... puzzle... It's not worth the $30, and it's extremely short. The entire gameplay lasted about 10 minutes (and that's adding up every interactable thing that wasn't just moving). The other hour or so was listening to an old guy talk.... waiting, on a lift... waiting... on another lift.... and well, 1 entire level, was just you on a lift...... doing nothing, no one talking... nothing but a lift. If it happens to go on sale for $2 then I would say get it, otherwise, don't waste your money on this over priced walking sim.			"

												While there is a lot of visual detail and artwrok (which is hard to find in early VR games) and it has a nice atmosphere, I think the Gallery fails as an adventure game. It's more of an experience.There is very little to do beside walking (=teleporting), and the puzzles are really uneven. The first one is actually pretty hard to figure out as you have no idea what to look for.I enjoyed the final one with the capacitors but that was about it.The final sequence (that everyone is raving about) does have a nice 'Encounters of the Third Kind' feeling about it, but the dialog is pretty meaningless and doesn't fit the preceding events. It's plain inexplicable. Also, the sequence itself is more of a visual effort than a story or event. It doesn't make much sense.The game mechanics are generally okay, although there are some glitches (I had to solve the final puzzle with e flare shell stuck to my left hand). Voice acting is great (especially the sister on the tapes) and sounds are also spot on.If you're considering buying it, do so for the ambience and visuals, not a great adventure game. It's more of a taste/showcase of what adventure games will be like in VR. "

												After recieving this game for free with purchase of my vive (as I believe most people will be these days), I was quite surprised. I have played about 15 VR titles before making my way back to this game which is one of the original highlighted games for VR, and this one has some of the most polish to it. This has excellent graphics based in reality (except for the people) compared to the cartoony feel of most games currently available, and it was a great evening spent on a 1.5 hour puzzler adventure.I'm looking forward to EP2, though insofar as VR games go, $20 is a bit steep. I will definitely be buying the next episodes, though almost certainly waiting for a discounted rate (what's a few more months onto the year gap anyway?) Recommended on sale (or free!) as a great demonstration of VRs potential and well-polished sci-fi adventure.			"

												Best ""real"" game for Vive so far. Good storytelling, great voiceactors. Myst-style in world puzzles combined with VR-interractions. About 2 hours long to finish if you don't rush it.			"

												My decision not to recommend has a lot to do with price. It feels like a polished tech demo that was stretched long enough to call it a game, and just barely reaching outside of the two hour window Steam gives you to return a game.Pros:* Runs decently on the Vive* Looks and sounds great, and has decent immersion* The bag interface is novel, and the tapes for saving are a good innovation* The voice work is very professionalCons:* For the price of USD$19.99 it is too short at ~2 hours.* The writing is really nothing special. It actually kinda bugged me. It would have been utterly tedious if the voice work wasn't so good* I can remember about 4 actual puzzles. The rest were find-thing, use-thing-with-thingIf the price went down to USD$9.99 I could give it a recommendation. Short polished games are in no way a bad thing, if priced right. I'm still meh on the writing and puzzles, which are the most important parts of an adventure game, but technically it looks and feels great.			"

												This is the start of a great game and it introduces an interesting story. Unfortunately this game is only the first 10% of a story. I took a ton of extra time examining details and wandering around leisurely but still finished it in less than 2 hours. Thinking back, there are only about 6 points of interest with some very linear paths between them.I did experience a bug where one of the puzzle pieces disappeared (I think maybe under the floor), forcing me to reload the game.Overall its one of the best story based games I've seen for VR right now, although I expected it to be 2-3x as long for the $30 pricetag			"

												An excellent, but short game.  The story and gameplay are excellent though while it includes a couple of puzzles, they are a bit on the simplistic side and the game offers no real challenge. Overall, if this was a demo, I'd give it 5/5 stars and wait for anticipation for the rest of the game.  As it is, it feels like I overpaid for the first chapter of a large game.  Hopefully the developers will reward early adopters of the game by providing subsequent chapters at a more reasonable add-on price, but that may be wishful thinking.			"

												I would buy the game even for just the ending alone, which left me absolutely floored. The immersion is ridiculous in this short little adventure game, lovely atmosphere, impressive physics, good puzzles etc. As I said though, the ending is so stunning and it really took me by surprise. The fact that we can create experiences like this on a first gen VR headset is remarkable. If you own a Vive, this game is a must!			"

												I loved playing it but finished it from start to end in about 1,5 hours. So i dont think it is worth 20 euro and will not but sequels if they cost the same amount of money. Its just to expensive to pay 10+ euro for each hour. So lets see what the next episodes will cost :-) Altrough pricy it really looks nice (not graphically amazing but really intense!So no i do not recommend paying 20 euro for a game you finish in max 2 hours. Yes i do recommend this game if it was less expensive or had a longer story.			"

												The Gallery Call of the Starseed (Episode One) Ended up on my VR Playlist when I was looking for narrative story games in VR. This is what I found so I added it. So when you drop the $20 dollars to play the VR game on steam your expecting quality, as $20 is quite expensive for a VR game. And Gladly when you boot the game up that is what you get. The graphics are very good for a VR game and the graphics settings are adjustable in game. The game is loaded with cool depth of feild effects, bloom, and other various visual gags. and it also runs very smoothly.                   The game starts off with a tutorial, and it lasts for about 5 to 10 min and teaches you the basics of how to move around the enviroment and pick up objects. I Liked the tutorial and it had a good voice over. then it moves on to the area selection which is done by playing tapes in a tape player (The models of which have stunning detail I might add) I like the idea of playing tapes more then hitting a button. Its an unessesary detail for the game devs to include, but they did it anyways. It was creative.                   The game then goes on to take a semi long but pretty average loading screen. After its done loading it drops you on a drop dead gorgeous rocky beach with lots of little things to pick up and play with. Now when your wlaking on the beach there will actually be an area where there are two paths to explore one to a sewer and one farther into the beach, now the game doesnt tell you the correct path to it just allows you to explore for yourself. It does not hold your hand. eventually you go down the beach farther and it actually has a mini tutorial kind of thing to show you how to use your back pack and tools then you go up a stair case to find a workshop in the rocks with many interesting areas to explore and things to look at and throw around. However the main quest items to actually start telling the story are on the table now like I mentioned before there are actually more tapes and you have a tape player so the story is told through the tapes. You hear the character's voises but you do not actually get to see the characters until later and you only get to see two of them at that. I really enjoyed this hyping up of the characters it invests me more in the story for some reason.                   Anyways, you read a paper get a flare gun then it is on to the first large puzzle. the puzzle is opening the gate to the sewer, and to do the puzzle you have to shoot three bells with the flare gun. Now I didn't listen to any of the extra tapes the professor recorded so the solution to the puzzle may have been in those. But if it wasnt for youtube playthroughs, I would have had no idea to shoot the bells.  but eventually you get it then move on to the sewer.                  Now I'm going to cut the review short here, because I don't want to spoil the rest of the game and I will be here all day if I go over the whole thing. But in the end I got around 3 hours with the first episode. Now I was hoping for more but I guess we will have to wait for the next episode right? I just hope I don't have to buy it because The game is already pretty expensive for a 3 hour game. Anyways in short the VR implementation was excellent, the puzzles were well thought out and difficult but not too difficult, and the story has me hooked and kind of ends on a cliff hanger. Can't wait to play more! and I give it a 9.2/10 (Played on HTC Vive)			"

												A short but really sweet initial entry into the series.. I have to add that the difference between a GTX 970 and 1080 is out of the ballpark on this game - it really shines on high end hardware , not to say its bad on the minimum either!Imagine an old school style point and click adventure, adapted for room scale in a walk able 360 degree world where you interact directly with the objects instead of ""combine, examine"" etc.Some great little puzzles, I have to admit to resorting to the web when stuck on the beach with the 3 B's to the B - and suggest that you don't! I regret not getting the achievement of working it out.The game builds really nicely and has a brilliant final level that has me begging for more .... Come on! Bring on Episode 2 already!			"

												I've tried a lot of VR games and this one sticks out as the most amazing experience yet. Being in VR, I played thru this adventure in a completely different way than with traditional games. In traditional games, I tend to rush and try to do everything as fast as possible. It is not so here: I just took all the time in the world.  Is it because VR puts me 'in' the game, so I tend to act more realistically? I can't say.  But one thing is for sure, I enjoyed every second of the experience.The environment is super polished, the visual effects are great and the story writing is great. I really felt like I was there.  Keep up the good work, can't wait for the next episode!			"

												This is definitely in my top two or three games for the Vive. It is visually stunning, has a story, and has brought a lot to the table on the UI and inventory system. It is probably about 90 minutes of play for the first episode.The ending alone is worth the cost of entry, in my opinion. I've also found the ending to fit right into my demo reel - at least when I know the person won't have an opportunity to play it in full. For my friends who have more time, I will have them play through it and give them hints to hurry it up. Usually about an hour to play through doing that.tl;dr: Game looks great, immersive, really cool environment, and an ending that will knock your socks off.			"

												$20 is a steep price to pay for what little time you spend in this game. $15 would be a fair amount seeing as this is episode 1 and the developer will be charging for the new episodes to come.At first the game was very glitchy and stuttered constantly, but those issues seem to be resolved now and it is a solid Intorductory Chapter to what will be a fantastic story. The graphics are very nice and the immersion is definitely there. I esspecially liked the fuse puzzle whch is saying something since I don't go for puzzle games normally.I am still sceptical, however, since the original price was (I believe) around $30. I will not be paying $30 per episode to complete this journey. For those that argue that it is a small developer and they need the money, just remember that this game comes with the Vive now. Which means they recieved some sort of lump sum on top of all the purchases from the early adopters.I really look forward to episode 2, but if it carries the same price tag there should be much more content.

												TL;DR : If it comes free with your Vive, or if you have access to it via family sharing, or can get it for 7 - 10 bucks, go for it. Otherwise, skip it.The Gallery: Call of the Starseed isn't really a bad ""experience"", but it's very short and somewhat rudimentary. The main problem is that, just as things are starting to ramp up, the experience is over. The first setting of the game, the beach, has more mini-distractions than the rest of the game put together, which is almost a beeline if you don't count a small maze as a distraction.The default method of movement is holding down the left track pad and aiming with your vision. Do yourself a favor and switch this to where your pointing with your hand. It's less of a pain in the neck, more accurate, and faster overall. Like many Vive games, Starseed uses a teleportation mechanic, which is fine, but they have an extra ""orientation"" feature which never really felt intuitive to anyone I showed it to.The ""grab"" of the hands is somewhat cumbersome and you'll pick up things you don't mean to if they are near something else, including picking the section of gameplay you want to start from the title menu/desk thing. It seems like it needs to be tightend up a bit.There aren't many characters in the game, but neither are animated in a compelling way. What's most compelling is the scale in VR- the characters are a little flat in facial expressions to be honest. One character talks almost nonstop and, for some reason, doesn't have any sort of animation for speaking. It kind of kicks immersion in the teeth.Otherwise, I like the locals, and the fidelity of the locations is very nice. The sounds aren't bad, but not really a whole lot going on. The puzzles are sort of short and simple, nothing that will keep an intelligent person with some coordination busy for too long.This game's price recently dropped down to $19.99, but honestly this game could be completed in one sitting at a friend's house. I'm interested in upcoming episodes, but they'd need either a lot more content, a lot more ""gameplay"", or a reduced pricepoint, as $19.99 for this isn't cutting it for me. I could see $9.99, tops, but it's just so short and simple, and the only replay value is completing achievements (most of which are very easy and are done on the first level).While I would say it's a very worth Vive experience to showcase what it can do, from a buyer's standpoint: consider something with more depth or more replayability unless this game is discounted.

												This game is incredible. It's very Outrun, mixed with TRON mixed with GOONIES mixed with mid 80's outrun goodness. I get the feeling that the following episodes will be DLC for far less then the original product: but let me tell you. What they have is downright incredible, but very short. It's the most polished experence I've ever had in the vive, and I can't wait to see what's next, but hot damn is it awesome. If this was 20 hours long, it would be worth every single penny three times over, I hope the next chapter isn't too expensive.			"

												Hands down my favorite Vive game so far. Immense, deep, clever, really just a perfect example of what VR can do. I couldn't contain my joy when I picked up a roman candle and lit it, or my legitimate worry near the end. Right when the end came up and the credits rolled, I said the same thing everybody else is saying. ""... NO! Come on! There has to be more!""Fantastic experience, and I highly look forward to the next chapter. I got it as part of the Vive bundle when I purchased, but I will happily pay for the next chapter.			"

												The game is great, but imagine Half-Life ending when you finally activate the reactor and the alien dimension spills over. Yeah, it's a tease. It's short and it's a tease.Very promising, but Episode 2 should be free to everyone who purchased this. They have the mechanics flushed out, now give us the $30 worth of content we payed for. I get VR is a new medium, but it doesn't require twice as much money to make stuff. Look at contemporary equivalents like Firewatch.			"

												The price might never come down, but surely a bundle will come out eventually. If there ends up being 10 episodes (each lasting about an hour), that would be €300 with no price reduction, and I just can't see them charging that much for a bundle.So I was going to wait to buy it, but people kept saying: ""OMG, the last 10-15 minutes are amazing! This is exactly what is finally made possible by VR!"" and I was like: ""Ah, that sounds like there's a big twist! I better experience the first big VR twist and have my mind blown, before someone spoils it!"" I had all kinds of ideas for twists that could only be done in VR where you suddenly realize everything is different than what you thought.Well, there's no twist. This is fine, since it's only the very first part of a story, so it doesn't need a twist. But that means it can't be spoiled, so you don't have to buy this now. You're not taking any risk. There's no chance of you having your experienced ruined, because of something you hear or read somewhere.As many other people have pointed out, everything is high quality, but the game contains one actual puzzle that will take you more than 30 seconds to solve and you will likely finish the entire game in an hour. (I spent longer than that due to technical problems. If you have a GTX 780 make sure you downgrade to driver version 364.51 before playing. This will fix the chaperone frame drop problems.)So, I would definitely recommend you wait for a sale or for a bundle with multiple episodes to come out before you buy this. It's impossible to spoil, so you're not taking any risks by waiting.			"

												I have heard alot of great things about this game, and I decided to trust what I read and spend the $30. I was reluctant, seeing that $30 doesn't purchase a full game, but only one episode.  Long story short, it was a pretty good VR experience, but i regret spending $30 on a VR experience that ended up feeling bland and lackluster.My first gripe with this game is the unsteady performance. Of all the VR games in my library, the Gallery had the least steady performance, leading to lots of frame skipping and nausea. I spent more time trying to optimize the graphical setting to something less nauseating than actually playing the game, and i already completed episode 1.My specs:Intel i7 4770k2x 980 GTX 32GB RAM "

												An episodic puzzle adventure game where you pay per episode. Really bad stutter issues at times that cause really bad VR-sickness and no real fix has been added yet other than ""downgrade your drivers"". Its a beautiful game, but not worth $120+ for all episodes. Dont fall for the hype.			"

												I was going to write a positive review for this game, the visuals were great, the puzzles were pretty good. And during the decent I was like, WOAH! THIS IS ONE OF THE COOLEST THINGS EVER! But then it ended with a ""Well you don't get more story until you pay for our second game that should've been in this game too but we want more money!."" (It didn't acually say that, but that's how I felt.) This game was really short and I'm glad I recieved it for free with my vive, yes it was cool but I would've been so angry if I paid $20 (18.97 Euro from what I got off of Google, not sure how correct that is) and I was just shown a few cool things for a short time and then it ended with a ""Haha now give us more money""Sorry, my rant is over now.

												Despite not recommending this game I do think it's technically a great game and storywise a good enough game, and one of few VR games that really shows what we'll come to expect of the bigger games for the platform in the future.It's short, depending on how much you'll explore in the game you could probably get 2+ hours out of the game. The puzzles, especially the one with the fuses, are (borderline) tedious but easy enough to not occupy you for too long.The reasong I'm not recommending it is how it's being sold. Even at a sale I'd say it's a no go. €15-19 (tops!) at full price would be fine. At the moment this isn't even a season pass-type deal but just episode one, if you'd get all future episodes included in the price it would be acceptable, but as it stands now I can assume future episodes will be priced the same as episode one. I really hope though that future episodes will be heavily discounted for owners of episode one.If you got money to spare and want a glimpse of what the future holds, do consider this, but know that in doing so you're approving the way the developers are selling this game/series.Or you could just breeze through it, enjoy it and get a refund and in doing so have your cookie and eat it too..!

												It came bundled with the Vive, so I paid for it.And this one is a hard one to judge, as its not really a bad game.Pros:+ on a technical side the game is fantastic, great physics and overall VR mechanics+ not only can you teleport, but reorientate your playspace, by rotating it while blinking, very intuitive+ graphics look nice+ one of the best inventory systems in a VR game today, you get out your backpack from your back and place it, to then put stuff in or take something out, very cool+ after the game was finished I kinda wanted moreCons:- its very very short, you will get through it in 1,5 hours- at the end of the game there is a puzzle that is insanely difficult and really needs a guide to be solved- the whole game is basically a demo for the Vive and VR mechanics, this is the stuff that should be free or at least very cheap- the price tagg is insane compared to the numerous better games that are out there and ultimatley made me decide to thumb it down. Its hard to believe that this 1,5 hour game not only costs a lot more than other very replayable games, but they are also going for an episodic system, which is downright greedy.- no replayablility whatsoeverI did like the games story and overall storytelling, but the greedy marketing is enough for me to thumb this one down.

												Honestly I looked at the reviews before buying it and I was really hesitant about getting this game. After buying it I regret not doing it sooner. It's the exact kind of experience I had wanted when I bought into virtual reality in the first place. Only a few complaints so I'll touch on those first-the game froze for a brief moment a few times, kind of disorientating experience in VR-the price, as many have complained, is a bit high for it's length but I would gladly pay the same amount for the next part of the seriesThe good things I really liked about the game-The backpack was a really innovative and amazing use of VR. Felt very cool, hope a lot of games pick up on this idea-Atmosphere is really next level. Great visuals, random other sounds, music, top notch voice acting, movement system is even better than the lab, flashlight actually being needed and working great. I actually flipped my controller upside when using it to read some papers in the sewers like I would a real flashlight. A ton of other little things-Despite the game I actually cared about the charactersOverall just really blown away by the experience. I really hope the next one comes quickly. Kudos to the creators of this game, your game was really special. Best thing I've experieced on VR yet  "

												One of the most epic experiences in VR, if you play all the way through.  Great mood.  Reminds me of MYST, in gameplay and vibe.  (spookier, though)The end is mind blowing.I did feel nausea a few times, the auto-movement when you walk up and down in terrain made me sick.  Also the last 30 minutes contains elevator-esque activity which always seems to do it to me.  You can avoid most of the nausea by just standing still and teleporting where you want to go, but when there are steps it still gets ya.  Sounds like the developers are making fixes for ep2, which after the way ep1 ended, I'm excited to try out.Thanks for an awesome game!			"

												Just finished the game. Wow, that was good but short. It does make use of the Vive very well and there's been significant effort put into the locations.But it's short. The story is good and interesting and it's the core of the game which in turn kills replayability. This all wouldn't necessarily be a problem, but they ask for 30 CHF (probably the same in euro/dolar) and that feels like too much for what you get. If you can get it for 5 - 10 euro/dollar it might be worth it. "

												I'm very torn on this review. Call of the Starseed was fun, the visual fidelity was high, the voice acting is good. The story is mysterious and makes we want to play the next episode. Playing leisurely, I finished the whole episode in 80 minutes. This seems short to me, even for an episodic game. This is also the second most expensive of the 15 VR games I've bought. On the other hand, this is the closest I've seen to a AAA game for the Vive (or at least the introductory chapter of one). As a story-based game, there isn't much (any) replayability, although VR in general is starving for more story and less arcade. Unfortunately, the VR market is still small which is likely the cause for the price if the devs hope to recoup the costs of their top-quality content. If the next episode comes at the same price, I hope they manage to significantly increase content quantity to match their already impressive quality.Performance is impressive, especially looking as good as it does. I have a GTX970 an an i54690K@4Ghz, and didn't have any performance issues after the beach, and the minor framerate dips on the beach weren't bad enough to cause the nausea that major stuttering does.

There were not that many puzzles and I was done the game in an hour.  Wasnt trying to go fast either.For a console game price I expect 6-8 hours of playtime or immense replayability.  Genuinely looking forward to a price drop and fleshed out sequels or new games from this studio.At 40 dollars - stay away.  Glad the vive bundle gives for free for now.  People need to see this and not get wallet hosemptied out to have a good all-around experience with this one.			"

												MUST HAVE!!This game is really impressive and creative with the game mechanics that were created for it. The inventory system is genious and the teleportation is great since it lets you rotate your play space. Graphics are also pretty good. It has a few puzzles along the way to solve, but pretty simple. ConsThe game seemed to have some issues between level loading, one time when the level loaded everything was blurry and couldnt do anything, so I had to restart. Another, the level went to loading and remained black screen forever, had to restart. There was some black flickering that happened randomly, I wasnt able to pinpont what was causing it, but others have reported similar. While it was happening, it made it unplayable because the frames were distorted and I simply waited 2-5 seconds for it to pass to continue playing.It was a little precey for the length IMO, but do not regret purchasing and had a very good VR experience with it, so I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to experience innovative VR gameplay.

												Easily one of my most favorite games for VR. It’s not a fast paced shooter like Raw Data or an epic RPG adventure like Vanishing Realms, but it’s just a really fun adventure that reminds me of my times in Myst. The story is really cool, the characters are cool and got me invested and immersed, and the puzzles are simple and grounded which felt very real. The icing on first episode of The Gallery is the ending. I don’t want to spoil it, but the potential of what Episode 2 could have for us is shown at the end of Episode 1 and it has made Ep. 2 one of my most anticipated VR games, even though it hasn’t seen a teaser trailer.5/5			"

Some good puzzle elements although I found the first hurdle the hardest and nearly gave up. Only reason I would not recommend this is that the price seems a lot for a bit less than 3 hours game play, of course it's free with the VIVE currently and is a great intro to what is possible.			"

Disabling camera, Minimizing desktop window. Resetting with Nvidia control panel and Lower in-game settings.

This vertical motion on top of jittering issue makes me sick. (Note: I am fine playing Hover Junkers) They could easily fix this by locking height when not teleporting. "

												This game is way too short versus the price imho. The puzzles were too easy, and the ending could have been more. Of course the dialogue was intreaging, but how could there not be another puzzle involved? I'd recommend waiting till this goes on sale before checking it out, I didn't feel it was worth $30. This episode does set up what looks to be an interesting episode 2, I just hope that there's more to it.....			"

												This game is cool, but a little pricey for the content. If this episode was a cheaper ($15 seems fair) or the price included additional episodes I could recomend it. However, $30 for 2 hours of content is pretty steep. The story line is great and I definitely want to find out what happens next, I just can't see myself paying another $30 per episode for so little content.With that being said, if money is not an issue this game is immersive, the voice acting and sound is great, and the puzzles are fun - I just wish you got more for $30...

												A beautiful game with very nice visuals for the Vive. Still it is a very short game and I´m not sure it´s worth almost $30 when there are many other games out there with more content. They do note that it is episode 1 but maybe the devs should discount the game until there is more content.			"

												I was hesitant to pickup this game, based on some reviews, but decided to go for it, and give it a play through.  I want to support the devs, so I don't return it or something, like some others have done.  But with that said, I do agree with others in that, it's very-very short, for the price, and still has some issues.  The story itself was interesting, the audio was nice, and some of the interactions were cool.   But, I also ran into some bugs that broke immersion and also made me kinda motion sick.  The Good:- Intersting story- Nice Audio in general - The backpack storage is cool/better than traditional menus/ect.  - Some nice iteraions with objects/environment.  The Not So Good/Bugs:- Blink Navigation (Default Settings) felt a bit clunky to me.    Trying to rotate the teleport space was a little akward with the touch pad, but that's maybe a hardware/firmware issue.   Also aiming with your head is awkward/kinda uncomfortable.  I really like how Valve had it setup, where you aim with the controller, and press the touch pad to instantly teleport.  You have a delay in this game, as you ""walk"" to the teleport area or something.  - Some of the env. art felt a bit in-consistent.   The last env. felt pretty rough.  Geo wasn't too bad, but the textures looked almost placeholder/temp.  Lower res/too large of UV scale/noitceable seams/ect.   - In multiple cases, when I leaned my body left/right, the whole world seemed to move up and down or something. Which started to get me a little motion sick/unstable.  It wouldn't always move, and in some cases only 1-2"".  But the worst was when it moved 6"" to 1ft, and I really started to feel un-easy.  Not sure if a bug or what.  - When I loaded into an area once, maybe since I teleported into a doorway before the load, the loading icon/menu was broken, and I saw 3 large grey planes infront of me.  - In multiple cases, the Flare Gun ammo got stuck floating in the air attached to my gun.  Or I couldn't drop the ammo/interact anymore.  So I had to load it into the gun to get rid of it, or shoot my flare gun till empty, then reload.- The backpack, while cool, wouldn't get put away many times, when I thought it did.  So I started to walk away, and it was floating there yet.   Or I could try to drop items into it over my shoulder, and it would miss and fall to the ground.  Unless I wasn't doing something right.  - The game is very short.  Depending how fast you solve the puzzles.  But, even still maybe only 2-3 hours long.  - The env was very linear/not really much to explore or checkout.   I probably wouldn't play through a second time. Unless to show friends/ect.   "

												This game suffers from the same problem the mass majority of the other VR content, the devs are not sure how many copies they will sell and are afriad to put too much time into a game right now, so they are realing ""episodes"" at damn near full retail for a game.I cannot reccomend this game for the price, the teleport system in this game is one of the least intiative i have used, the graphics are muddy, the game performs very poorly, the character models seem off and small, the puzzles are easy, and there are very few of them.If this was $40 and all other epidoes are included as they come out id say buy it...if this was $10 and at least 1 other episode was out they id say buy it...if they had SLIVR supported and the game didnt lagg so bad i had to turn the graphics to low on my tri-sli 980 with a 4.4ghz cpu i might say buy it...if the game didnt raise the camera when you look over a higher spot on the ground and make you dizzy when it happens id say buy it...I did LOVE the inventory system and the flashlight was a wow moment in the sewers, and the last 5 minutes of the game looks bad♥♥♥♥♥ if they release the next episode i might buy that one to use the ""power"" you get...

												I've owned my Vive for about a month now so the facination you get of simply being in VR is gone.  This game is not meant for someone who has owned their vive for this long.  Since looking around and playing with objects on the ground doesn't give me the satisfaction of a $30 title.  I can honestly say I didnt attempt to rush through this game before the refund period, there just isn't enough gameplay to keep me within the incredibly small world that has been presented.While the story is engaging, abiet extremely ambigous, it did give me goose bumps, but there was little interactivity when I did get to those points.  Simply pointing and pulling the trigger does not keep me entertained for the last 15 minutes of gameplay. I sadly can't recommend this title at a $30 price tag.However, if you enjoy having other people experience the vive for the first time, then this title ranks up there with The Lab in terms of quality with more of a focus on visuals and story experience.  This is quite simply a high quality demo of what can be accomplished on the vive when it comes to telling an interactive story.			"

												This one made me nauseous pretty quick. The problem is that the world raises/lowers based on the position of the headset. Since most of the ground is sloped, shifting your weight or leaning/etc causes the world to raise/lower. Also with the winding map, you're constantly having to turn around and reorient yourself after teleporting. There are a lot of objects close to your player, which isn't comfortable on a Vive. The 'sweet spot' for view distance on a Vive/Rift is at least a few feet from your character. I got this weird sensation after taking it off when physical objects that were close to me felt too close, since the Vive renders near objects as a few feet away. I also found myself impaled by objects several times while teleporting from room to room. That's a little awkward when you're already starting to feel sick.Overall, a high quality game but they need to apply some VR learnings to their level design. I'll try to work through the rest of this game in small chunks. Hopefully episode two has a little more flat ground..			"

												I'm not usually a fan of adventure games, but I thought maybe VR would add some extra sparkle. If adventure games are your thing, you might enjoy this. Unfortunately I didn't.The game crashed SteamVR twice and then was very slow and choppy. I didn't enjoy Blinking as a movement mechanic. Frequently when walking up/down stairs, I'd start floating up or down. I had to stop playing and shortly afterwards, had my first bout of VR sickness.The way you used your backpack, though, was very impressive.			"

												This game is really buggy considering how highly recommended it is! I'm about as big a VR evangelist as they come but issues with basic mechanics like grabbing stuff and graphical settings not saving (sometimes not working at all as far as I can tell?)- inexcusable for one of the most expensive games on Vive. I personally don't even mind that it's apparently short (have not finished) but for those that do, it's even worse- short game, expensive, buggy. There are just better options, even so early in the Vive's lifetime. Hope to see it improve!			"

												Yeah I will agree with a lot of the other reviews on this game.  It really has some amazing wow moments, and a few really cool mechanics.  While watching the trailer you do see most of what happens in the game, just not in VR which is a world of difference.  The biggest gripe is not being sure what the future episodes are going to cost.  If the are $5 or so each, I will certainly feel they are worth it.  If they are $30, they are not getting any more of my money unless they take 10+ hours to complete.  I have a total of 2.3 hours on this game.  Like most players, it wasn't really due to the content taking that long.  I did a demo of the game, as well as got lost in the sewers by going the wrong way, which took up some time.  Really, if you do know how to complete it, there is only 30-40 minutes of game play.  The puzzles really are pretty basic.In a lot of ways, this shows the potential of VR.  For that you are paying a premium.  If there was a solid 5 hours of game play, this would of been an enthusiastic thumbs up, but not for 1.5 hours.			"

												Man I really want to love this, but it's plagued by too many technical issues.  My computer easily meets the system requirements but I have to play on the lowest settings possible to avoid the screen flicker people have mentioned.  Even then I still get it on occasion.  Other things like having elevators were a problem for me.  Maybe because I was already a little sick from the screen flickering but they made me incredibly nauseas.  In-game body/camera movement is a serious no-go for me.  Again, maybe it wouldn't have been such a problem if I wasn't already dizzy from before, but who knows.If they fix the performance issues I'll probably revise my review.

												Expensive for under 3 hours of play! But one of the coolest experiences I think I have had with the Vive to date. If future episodes offer the same content:$$$ ratio I will probably pass but I'm trying to be a bit more forgiving for the first round of titles I suppose. Hopefully the devs will take to using this as the base required Episode and pricing the next ones cheaper like the DLC/Expansion Pack model.One huge downside that I wish I knew before I started the game - If your chaperone bounds tend to show up when you stretch both arms you will be constantly shown the stupid chaperone grid due to how you move around in this game. Having enough room to at least get 1.5 your arm span would be most ideal. My temporary setup was a rectangle and the narrow side was very annoying for this title. Not the game's fault really.Worth $30 USD? Hard to say, I really do wish it was at least $10-15 cheaper personally. Got a few bucks to spare for a few hours of a very immersive game? Go for it..On a budget? Consider getting 2 cheaper games with replay value instead..			"

												The game lasts 40 minutes tops, if you're accustomed to VR and have decent problem-solving skills. The game crashes fairly frequently at one area (happened to me four times) and the game does not save checkpoints so I had to replay the same boring part of the beginning of that ""chapter"" for 8 minutes a piece which added to my game length. If I'm being honest the game put me to sleep at first, 75% of the content of this game is not very interesting and the 25% that is has already been spoiled for you in the video on their page. The last 10 minutes of the game are pretty amazing, but it's a non-interactive experience, you're on rails watching the cool things happen, then the credits roll for like 30 minutes as the devs pat themselves on the back for releasing a fifth of a game and charging $30 for it.

I was very disappointed because the game has been in developement for very long and it was one of the first to use ""blink"" teleportation. Incredibly, after you teleport, the floor of the virtual play area moves vertically, up and down, causing severe nausea. To be clear, I can play for 6 hours in a row in the HTC Vive and feel perfectly fine with games that are well done (Quar battle gate 18, Jeeboman, Cloudlands minigolf, Final Approach  all have got blink too and I feel very fine inside them).

												Cons- Very short (90 minutes for me)- Story is generic... probably because there is only about 20m of story, and the other 70m is exploration/puzzle solving.- Only 2 real puzzles, and neither is original or that interesting- Weird developer choice to have the viewport stay consistent with the ground height: This causes the world to move up & down in a weird way (mainly on the Beach) that made me think my Vive was broken. How this didn't cause red flags in QA, I don't know. It feels horrible... so much that you have to limit any moving around and teleport everywhere, which broke my immersion.Pros- Good art direction, sound and music- Really inventive inventory system- Some really cool visual moments in the last thirdI would probably normally return this game because I am under the refund time limit, but I would like to support VR developers in this new market.

You teleport around and the gameplay only consists of about 3 puzzles.  2 are extremely simple and the third is mostly trial and error.  The graphics are really well done but I still never felt presence in this game.  The ending was actually a let down for me because I was expecting a lot more from the reviews.

												A very cool game that gives us a glimpse of the potential of modern VR for storytelling. It truthfully isn't much of a game, however. While there's a couple of puzzles and a little maze, it's mostly just exploring the environment, interacting with objects (which can be fun in itself) and discovering the story. The fact that, in VR, you are actually there, really makes this an experience rather than just a nice little story. Though limited, I also thought the voice acting was well done.That being said, I wish you could give a neutral rating on Steam, because at 2 hours, including a fair amount of time fooling around with breaking bottles and setting off fireworks, I think the price tag, currently at $30, is steep. I hope future episodes are either cheaper or include more content, otherwise I may not continue this adventure. And I do want to continue it. I don't know where you go at the end, but it's bound to be a cool trip. As a side note, I did occasionally have issues with skipping and occasionally a frozen camera for a second or two, but I'm also running an old CPU that caps out when I try to run Job Simulator and Budget Cuts, leaving those games off limits for me. Just as a note for others with older CPUs, it might be on the edge of what you can handle, but any hiccups I had were minor. I neither got nauseous nor fell on my face.  :-)			"

												Had some technical issues with this game, with the screen glitching uncontrollably at points. I noticed that it has a lot to do with optimization oddities with the Unity engine. But also... while well acted and I can see a lot of hard work going into it, I find myself desperately wanting. I would love to have been helping with a playtest in QA because I could have narrowed it down. Perhaps it's that actions didn't have much to offer in a fully physical game? Only certain objects are scripted... and buggily so. Why doesn't the log burn? Why doesn't the soda can burst? Why does the popcorn keep popping? It's nit-picky, I know, but it made me realize I was just supposed to bumble around and move on.And, while I am usually in love with explore-y puzzlers, I found myself annoyed that the first thing I encountered was ""anti-physics"" even if it dangled by a chain. Then I was supposed to see another, and I'd even say similiar looking, box and knock it down to advance the puzzle. All my continuity feels broke and I just ... stopped and, mainly because of the buggy refresh and tracking, I returned it. Sorry.			"

I do like that it includes the ability to rotate your heading during the teleport, but the controls for that are confusing/poory explained.

Instead, it's rwlative to your current facing so it's not really possible to move and rotate to the desired facing without some mental gymnastics.)			"

												This game has one of the greatest interaction systems in VR currently.The teleportation system is very cumbersome, though.But there's nothing that can justify the $30+ price tag for me, for 1 to 2 hours of gameplay. Especially considering this is just for episode one, meaning the full experience will be $100+ for about 8 hours.The experience is cool and all, but had I paid for this, I would suffer from buyer's remorse, no doubt.If money is not an issue for you, by all means, buy this game. But if you don't throw $30 left and right, you may end up wishing you had waited for a discount.Maybe I enjoyed the experience knowing I hadn't forked out $30 for it.			"

												A nicely polished game with a little VR-playground built in, nice graphics and soundtrack... but it's way to short! Paying 30€ for literally four riddles is too much - and no fancy or even awe-inspiring level- or gamedesign can change that, IMHO.  About 8-10€ would be a fair price. Note: My 2.8 hrs playtime resulted from two people playing the whole game AND some idle time. CONCLUSION: Fun and polished game but way too expensive. Buy it anyway and you'll have about one hour fun for your bucks.			"

												Not worth the money for the amount of content provided. I enjoyed the game when I played it but I had also just received my Vive so the ""wow"" factor was still in full effect. Environments were nice but the game could use more puzzles and exploration. I also kept running into a bug with the backpack where it would stay stuck to my hand and I could not put it away unless I restarted the game.Immersive game but the lack of content makes the $38 CAD hard to justify.

												I've never even played any of these games that a lot of people refer to as ""walking simulators"", but I thought that VR would make it more interesting.  Unfortunately, it probably makes it worse considering it is now a ""teleportation simulator"".			"

												I beat this several days ago, and I've been struggling to come up with a conclusion to what I played. On the one hand, it was lovingly crafted, with lots of little details and a great interface and UI. The time I spent with it was enjoyable, and it felt more like a tripple A game than most launch VR titles do... but on the other, it's so pathetically, laughably short for an adventure game it is insulting to those who pay good money for it. There isn't a whole lot here that isn't what you'd expect from an adventure game, but there's so LITTLE of it is what makes it a problem. The story barely, BARELY gets started. If this was a book it would have ended halfway through the prologue, it's that short! I don't know what else I can compare it to, but the length is just plain a joke. Is the story good? Who knows? There isn't even a ghost of enough of it here to be able to tell. Should we be excited for the next chapter? Who knows? This one is so short we barely got past the title before it was over.A serious player can beat this in well under an hour. The only reason I have as much playtime as I do on record is because I spent an unusually long time playing around with the environment... and despite the shortness, I managed to find a bug that wasted my time for over an hour by denying me a clue that was floating around that I needed to progress.I hate to harp on how short it is but I just can't get past it. To put it another way, fire up an episodic game from Telltale. Watch the intro. Now play for fifteen minutes. Stop, and that's about how much is here. Now look at what they are charging for this. Can this content possibly justify the price? Another way to put it, there are so few areas for screenshots, the store page actually has one from the tutorial room that has nothing whatsoever to do with the game, other than forced padding! That's some seriously bad form.Is this a cynical cash grab from a company that is exploiting the launch of VR by overcharging for a glorified demo because they know people will buy it due to the lack of titles at launch? I hope not, because I'd heard from the developer and thought they were more passionate about the project than that. More likely, it wasn't anywhere near completed, but the April 5th launch of the Vive was coming close, and they had to lock down what little they had completed and publish.I love the quality on display. I love the interface and gameplay, and I'd love to play a full-length adventure game using the systems developed here. It hurts me to have to bash something so polished, and I really, really want to give it a good review... But I cannot, and will not overlook the insane price being charged for a piece of game that is so short it is outpaced by demos on the old PC Gamer disks from the 90s.			"

												People said it was short for the price, so I waited till the sale to buy it at £18 (£4 pounds discount). But it soooooooooo short. At best I can describe it as three puzzles wrapped up in the beginings of a very nice story. But two of those puzzles aren't really puzzle (follow the arrows and find a 'secret' entrance).This will be one of the best Vive adventure games (in two years time there will be a ton to choose from) but judging by the length of episode one there will be about five of them to make it even close to AAA length game. THAT MAKES IT A £90 GAME!!!!!!!!!!! and I didn't even pay full price!			"

												While the game is great, it is not worth the $20 price tag.I beat the game in just under an hour and a half, but there's no replay value to justify the price. I understand that this is only episode 1, I don't know if episode 2 comes for free if you purchased ep.1 (if that's the case then get the game).Now the price aside, the game is fun. Graphics are beautiful and life like. The UI is simple and actually pretty neat, probably the best inventory managment I've seen in a VR game. The story is interesting and gets REALLY crazy/cool/interesting at the end, so much that I eagerly look forward to episode 2. So you can be the judge, it's price vs. content for me. I'm giving it a thumbs up because it's an excellent example of what we can expect for first person narrative VR titles, but if you don't have a pile of cash you can blow away I highly suggest waiting for the game to go on sell and instead invest your $30 on a title that has a higher replay value.Pros:+ Great graphics for a VR title+ Easy UI+ Interesting story+ Awesome setting and enviromentCons:- Way too short- No replay value			"

Be fully immersed with floating hands and objects with no idea what to do with them. Then teleport around trying to figure out how the developer designed the game so you can get on with the vague and silly story.			"

												I had received this game for free with my Vive when I bought it 6 months ago, but was frustrated by some of the initial puzzles on the beach and put it away and hadn't played it since.I went back to it today, and boy am I glad I did.   The lighting and ambience are fantastic.    Being programmed in Unreal Engine, it's quite hard on the system - on 'high' settings with my GTX 1070 I had to turn off all supersampling to get rid of reprojection, but it ran great after that.   1.4x supersampling was playable with async reprojection on, so long as you don't mind a few jittery spots.

												I received this game for free as part of an special offer when purchasing my Vive. I also played a little bit with a friend of mine prior to purchasing my Vive and obtaining the game myself (like, I beat the first puzzle, that's it. x3)This is a good game, I'll definitely say that. The story is immersive and there are a few neat little puzzles you have to pursue. The controls feel natural and I didn't have any problems with the locomotion. However, the issue with it is that it's not a long game, by any stretch of the imagination. I finished this game in one session, from the moment I opened up to the game and the tutorial loaded, to the end of the credits sequence at the end, in less than an hour and a half. It'd probably take me just a little bit longer (say, 10 minutes) if I had never opened it up before. And I wasn't trying to rush through it or anything, either.It's definitely worth it if you're getting it as a sort of special offer (such as I did.) If, however, you don't have the option of receiving this game for free or anything of the sort, you're going to need to decide if an hour and a half's worth of immersive content is worth $20. It could definitely be considered worth the cost, and if you think it is, then by all means, snatch it up. Otherwise, I'd say wait until it goes on sale or something.When Episode 2 comes out, I'm gonna have to think long and hard to decide if it'd be worth paying for. I mean, I wouldn't imagine it'd be much longer than Episode 1, and I'm sure it's probably gonna be around the same price, but man, the end left me with a lot more questions than I had started with.

I love the movement and look of the hands, and the backpack system is awesome.The beach chapter is a fairly good experience to bring out for friends and newbies when you are showing them the VR for the first time. There's a fair amount of high quality content here for someone looking to complete the game though, especially if you take your time and look for all the hidden cassette tapes and listen to them. A few of the puzzles might be a bit difficult but just look at the steam forums to get some hints if you need them.If ever you wanted to be inside a Myst game, this does a fairly good approximation of one.

I also think the cost is very fair considering the polish and how niche our genre is right now.The only memorable con is that character animations are pretty basic right now, and I feel like that pulls you out of the experience a little. Still, I definitely recommend The Gallery and can't wait for Ep. 2.			"

												What a great experience! Finally able to live an adventure like we've seen in so many great movies and TV shows. The game is very immersive and is enjoyable from start to finish. It is a short game, and for that a $30 price tag seems steep, however it is worth the money due it its high level of entertainment. A must have for all VR users. Looking forward to future installments.			"

												This fell well below my expectations and I walked away disapointed. Despite having quite a few visual wows and a well realised inventory system I couldn't recommend it as I just didn't find it fulfilling.The first puzzle in particular is an unintuitive mess.  I spent about half an hour trying to work out a morse code puzzle that didn't exist . The sewer puzzle isn't really a puzzle  You can only go the wrong way by going to the well which lead me to think i would have to put items in the well to get stuff out of the sewer .Finally in the third and fourth sections the puzzles got more interesting. But after that it was time to sit back and enjoy the ride. In general the whole thing felt like the episode once had a lot more content which was cut but the hints of more interesting things were left in. There was never once a point where I got to use knowledge i had learned earlier. There was never a sense of mastery. So what was left was a game that felt like a theme park ride where you get shuffled from one scene to another.Unfortunately the story doesn't quite make up for the lackluster gameplay. [spoilter] The monolog near the end is painfully long whilst you literally do nothing for 10 minutes with very little happening on screen for most of it[/spoiler].In general its the gameplay that really needs a step up here. VR adds a 3D spectacle but this game could have been made without it and without it the game would be utterly forgettable.The controls are well realised and the rotating teleportation works well.  My hope for the developers going forward is now that they have the basics down they really need to double down the gameplay and puzzles for the next episodes.			"

												Definately one of my gaming highlights for the year so far.  A great experience which truly shows off the potential of the VR.  Simply amazing last chapter which left me gobsmacked. Cannot wait to contiunue the adventure in Chapter 2, although may delve back into chapter 1 to kill the craving for a while.  Not the longest game although an essential one.			"

												I seriously enjoyed this game so much. I have pretty much all of the VR games that are available right now and this one was probably the most immersive. It really makes you want to just stop and interact with everything you see. That being said, 30 bucks is just way too much to ask. Especially if this is going to be episodic. I mean, I'm thoroughly invested in the story but even with that I'm not likely to buy the second episode for anything more than 15 and I will still probably wait for a good sale. 30 dollars for an hour and a half of entertainment is just obscene. All that said, I will recommend the game, but be aware that you are going to feel like you blew a lot of money at the end. Especially since the ending basically hits you like a commercial break in the middle of a good movie.			"

												Kickstarter backer here. When the Kickstarter ran, I had no idea what to expect, but VR sounded cool and interaction with the Razor Hydra was a great idea.Well, now it's 2016, the Vive has been developed, announced, produced and shipped. The game was the perfect fit for the Vive's setup, even though it started development before all of that, and it shows. It's the perfect showpiece of what roomscale VR can do, it's the most immersive experience I've seen to date.As an old adventure games fan, this pushes all my buttons. It's (rather simple) puzzles, story, amazing scenes and exploration of dark caves. I felt like a child again, that discovered an old underground cave system and goes on exploration with a flashlight and a lot of imagination. Only this time, the fantastic stuff is real, and you are actually inside of it.			"

												The only way to begin a review is to say that initially I was skeptical. I\'ve been enjoying the \""arcade\"" style of most VR games as of late, and so I wasn\'t sure what to expect out of a narrative driven experience. Although it wasn\'t the most polished game, Call of the Starseed set the precedent for narrative driven VR games from here on out. Although deeply flawed in its \'blink\' locomotion mechanic, low graphical fidelity, and short length, the 15 straight minutes of shivers sent down my spine during the latter end of the game made every penny worth it. The only shame is that because it is more in-depth, I can\'t demo this efficiently to new VR players... Damn. I\'ll be replaying this very soon...			"

												I get some framedrops here and there with a AMD R9 390 on default settings (medium graphics), but apart from that, the game is absolutely incredible so far. And the story has that mysterious, supernatural, ""something is out there"" vibe known from games such as the old Myst or Atlantis. I'd absolutely play this if it was just a regular game, but the very well done VR implementation (backpack is genius!) makes this so much more intense. I have always been more interested in exploring new worlds rather than getting stuck on puzzles all the time, and so The Gallery EP1's pacing is just right.Recommended with full of love ♥			"

												One of the best room scale story/exploration games I've played in VR. The world is lush and immersive. The blinking movement gets a little clunky navigating around in tight spaces. And... there will probably be at least one time when you are stuck in the games progress and unable to tell if you are experiencing a game bug or a hardware bug. The fuse box puzzle part of the story is a little frustrating, but once you get through it the pay off is worth it.			"

I love the movement and look of the hands, and the backpack system is awesome.The beach chapter is a fairly good experience to bring out for friends and newbies when you are showing them the VR for the first time. There's a fair amount of high quality content here for someone looking to complete the game though, especially if you take your time and look for all the hidden cassette tapes and listen to them. A few of the puzzles might be a bit difficult but just look at the steam forums to get some hints if you need them.If ever you wanted to be inside a Myst game, this does a fairly good approximation of one. Looking forward to the next chapter!			"

												I received this game for free as part of an special offer when purchasing my Vive. I also played a little bit with a friend of mine prior to purchasing my Vive and obtaining the game myself (like, I beat the first puzzle, that's it. x3)This is a good game, I'll definitely say that. The story is immersive and there are a few neat little puzzles you have to pursue. The controls feel natural and I didn't have any problems with the locomotion. However, the issue with it is that it's not a long game, by any stretch of the imagination. I finished this game in one session, from the moment I opened up to the game and the tutorial loaded, to the end of the credits sequence at the end, in less than an hour and a half. It'd probably take me just a little bit longer (say, 10 minutes) if I had never opened it up before. And I wasn't trying to rush through it or anything, either.It's definitely worth it if you're getting it as a sort of special offer (such as I did.) If, however, you don't have the option of receiving this game for free or anything of the sort, you're going to need to decide if an hour and a half's worth of immersive content is worth $20. It could definitely be considered worth the cost, and if you think it is, then by all means, snatch it up. Otherwise, I'd say wait until it goes on sale or something.When Episode 2 comes out, I'm gonna have to think long and hard to decide if it'd be worth paying for. I mean, I wouldn't imagine it'd be much longer than Episode 1, and I'm sure it's probably gonna be around the same price, but man, the end left me with a lot more questions than I had started with.

												Fantastic game.The puzzles aren't terribly difficult, but cool nonetheless. I hope the following chapters do have some varying degree of difficulty though. The environment is a pretty compelling experience in VR, and very stable. I was able to play the last 90 minutes straight through with no issues at all. (Although there was one point in the first zone where you are standing on stairs, and if you move it's very disorienting).The game is about 4-5 hours long, but I very consciously took my time to take in all of the scenery. If you're turned off by the price, don't be. If you early adopted VR, shoot for quality not quantity. This was easily the most fantastic time I've had in VR to date, and cannot wait for the following chapters.			"

												In short, this is what an adventure game in VR should be.Great use of scale and lighting. The environments are pretty rich and interactive (including objects that don't serve real gameplay purpose), but this does mean that when you actually find an object you want to move and can't, it's disappointing. The story is just getting started so I don't know whether it'll be a selling point, but it's a good hook so far imo.The inventory and locomotion systems take just a short while to get used to and then are pretty good. Stowing items over your shoulder and retrieving them from the backpack handles the large inventory cleanly and is more immersive than a menu.I hope episode 2 is a bit longer and has trickier puzzles but this is a great introduction.

												this was a fun and immersive exploration game. i enjoyed the puzzles and all the clues scatterd around for me to find. the atmosphere was great. one of the puzzles had me working on it for a little while, maybe ten minutes with my head tilted down, this caused some cramping in my neck but it was still a fun puzzle and that may not be a problem for you if you just solve it faster than i did. I enjoyed this game allot and im looking forward to ep.2.			"

												Got this free with the VIVE. Its a fun game, with a few interesting but simple puzzles to work through. Looks promising, and then thats it, done, finished.With this looking like its going to be released in 'episodes' There could be a long wait inbetween, and then having to buy the next one, and the next one, and the next one. With it being free I would reccomend it, just be aware that you are not getting a full game, more of an expensive 90 minute demo for what could be.			"

												$30 is a lot to spend on any game that will last on average about 2 hours. Still, I can't recommend this title enough.I've been a VR enthusiast for about two years; ever since I landed an early number DK2. In those two years I tried just about everything on the old Oculus Share and I've bought pretty much any title on Steam VR and Oculus home with a reasonable rating. In all that time, nothing has made my jaw hit the floor like The Gallery.If you have a Vive do yourself a favor and pick this title up ASAP. And please, don't give up if you get stuck on the beach puzzles. The parts of the game that really shine are the ones that come after you trudge through the sewer.Pros: Most breathtaking VR experience I've had. Period. Lots of effort put into making most objects interactive Very novel backpack inventory management systemCons: Very short (around 2 - 2.5 hours) A bit pricey for the duration As others have pointed out, the solutions to some puzzles are not exactly clear. There are hints scattered around, but the world is very detailed so they're easy to miss. It is extremely rare for me to me use any hint or guides but I did need to in order to complete the episode.Overall, I highly recommend this title for any Vive owner.			"

												This is like Myst or Riven for the VIVE.  It's a very well made game, immersive, great graphics, good voice acting, and the controls are well polished.  The puzzles were not always easy, but I was able to solve them all without cheating, so I'd say not too hard for an intelligent adult.  This is definitely one of my favorite games for the Vive!  I will definitely buy the next episode.  Although it's a bit expensive for ~3-4 hours gameplay, its a fair price considering how much better it is than other vive games.			"

												This fell well below my expectations and I walked away disapointed. Despite having quite a few visual wows and a well realised inventory system I couldn't recommend it as I just didn't find it fulfilling.The first puzzle in particular is an unintuitive mess.  I spent about half an hour trying to work out a morse code puzzle that didn't exist . The sewer puzzle isn't really a puzzle  You can only go the wrong way by going to the well which lead me to think i would have to put items in the well to get stuff out of the sewer .Finally in the third and fourth sections the puzzles got more interesting. But after that it was time to sit back and enjoy the ride. In general the whole thing felt like the episode once had a lot more content which was cut but the hints of more interesting things were left in. There was never once a point where I got to use knowledge i had learned earlier. There was never a sense of mastery. So what was left was a game that felt like a theme park ride where you get shuffled from one scene to another.Unfortunately the story doesn't quite make up for the lackluster gameplay. [spoilter] The monolog near the end is painfully long whilst you literally do nothing for 10 minutes with very little happening on screen for most of it[/spoiler].In general its the gameplay that really needs a step up here. VR adds a 3D spectacle but this game could have been made without it and without it the game would be utterly forgettable.The controls are well realised and the rotating teleportation works well.  My hope for the developers going forward is now that they have the basics down they really need to double down the gameplay and puzzles for the next episodes.			"

												Fantastic game.The puzzles aren't terribly difficult, but cool nonetheless. I hope the following chapters do have some varying degree of difficulty though. The environment is a pretty compelling experience in VR, and very stable. I was able to play the last 90 minutes straight through with no issues at all. (Although there was one point in the first zone where you are standing on stairs, and if you move it's very disorienting).The game is about 4-5 hours long, but I very consciously took my time to take in all of the scenery. If you're turned off by the price, don't be. If you early adopted VR, shoot for quality not quantity. This was easily the most fantastic time I've had in VR to date, and cannot wait for the following chapters.			"

Visually it looks quite good, and there are a bunch of fun interactions to make the story compelling. It isn't overly long, but compared to most VR experiences it offers a good length for the amount of polish it has.			"

												The biggest issue I had with this game was simply the fact that it was over fast and ended just as it was getting interesting. What it was is a step in the right direction for what we want exploration games to be in VR, and my critique of the game being too short should speak to the enjoyment I had of the game since it implies I wanted it to continue. Sadly it doesn't, and you are left feeling a bit shocked at how quickly you played through the game considering its asking price. As a game starseed is great, but sadly I don't think I'd recommend it (even at the as of writing this steam summer sale discounted price). If the price included upcomming episodes then I would have recommended it, but right now I'd probably recomend that you wait and see if you can pick it all up later in a bundle after more episodes are released - that way you'll get more value for your money and more content to enjoy at the same time. So for now this is a wait and buy later in my oppinion. PS. It hurts me to give this recommendation because the game itself is really fun and you can see the devs put a lot of love into it.Edit: With the change of the game being included in the purchase of the vive I am changing my recommendation. The game itself is great, the main concern was always the value/time which is now a non concern.Great game, great change and I'm eagerly awaiting the new chapter.			"

												Was fun to solve the puzzles, but it was really short. This was one of the first adventure-like games that I've played with my Vive, and I think it really sets a good standard for the coming titles.I received it as a part of the bundle, so I am not sure that I would be willing to pay $30 for a game I can beat in 2 hours. I support the devs/designers/anyone else and I know how much effort they put into making the game, but it isn't a viable business model if customers will have to drop another $30 for episode 2, then another for 3... however, if all the episodes come with a single purchase... :)			"

												This is easily the best VR experience out there right now IMO.  Really looking forward to episode 2!  Its a bit pricey for the length but its also an awesome experience.  If you have a powerful system with at least a 1080 i would turn the super sampling up as high as you can for this game as it makes reading the text in game MUCH easier.  For most people it will be located here: ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\config\steamvr.vrsettings"" and change ""renderTargetMultiplier"" from 1 to 2.This game sold me on what VR will be once developers figure out how to do VR and once the mass market has VR to make the ROI worth it.

												This game is now included with the Vive upon purchase and for good reason, it is probably the single best showcase for VR, especially roomscale VR at the moment. The levels are immaculately designed. The devs treat you with intelligence by giving you sophisticated puzzles that enhance the experience. The puzzles are tied to the design of the game so they dont feel out of place. They require that you look for things which enhances the roomscale experience of walking around, yet arent overly simple that you solve them immediately. The ending of the game gave me chills, you really feel like you are sucked into a sci-fi movie, well done guys. As has been mentioned numerous times the game is pathetically short. I beat it in exactly 2 hours and I was really taking my time exploring and even struggled with the last puzzle. On that premise I could never recommend a $30 price tag, however this is the best demonstration of VR to date, so on that end I guess it's worth the $30 to see what VR has to truly offer. If you dont love this experience you probably wont ever really like VR.			"

												One of the better looking games for the HTC Vive, it has some beautiful environments and a lot of fun interaction. I love the movement and look of the hands, and the backpack system is awesome.The beach chapter is a fairly good experience to bring out for friends and newbies when you are showing them the VR for the first time. There's a fair amount of high quality content here for someone looking to complete the game though, especially if you take your time and look for all the hidden cassette tapes and listen to them. A few of the puzzles might be a bit difficult but just look at the steam forums to get some hints if you need them.If ever you wanted to be inside a Myst game, this does a fairly good approximation of one. Looking forward to the next chapter!			"

												This is a great chance to catch the game while it's on sale.Just finished this game, after having paid full price. Wow. Yes, it only took about 2 and a half hours to complete. But honestly, I don't get how people can complain about the length of this when the quality was so over the top, and just the fact that this is an entirely new genre!The last 5 or 10 minutes of this game were especially impressive.Looking forward to more!(PRICING RANT: It's not like they just took a normal 2D game, applied a little VR magic, and then upped the price for no reason. The entire design process is new, the interactions are new. Most games or VR products out so far offer 10 to 15 minutes of ""gameplay"" (i.e., just a VR movie) for 10 or 15 bucks. So at that rate this game would be priced at 120 to 160 dollars just for episode 1! But it's not, it's 30. This is a great investment in the future of VR gaming, if you're willing to take the leap.)			"

The puzzles were difficult enough without being annoying. Effects are great even on my GTX 970 and I love how the inventory system is handled.

												Kickstarter backer here. When the Kickstarter ran, I had no idea what to expect, but VR sounded cool and interaction with the Razor Hydra was a great idea.Well, now it's 2016, the Vive has been developed, announced, produced and shipped. The game was the perfect fit for the Vive's setup, even though it started development before all of that, and it shows. It's the perfect showpiece of what roomscale VR can do, it's the most immersive experience I've seen to date.As an old adventure games fan, this pushes all my buttons. It's (rather simple) puzzles, story, amazing scenes and exploration of dark caves. I felt like a child again, that discovered an old underground cave system and goes on exploration with a flashlight and a lot of imagination. Only this time, the fantastic stuff is real, and you are actually inside of it.			"

												For a front runner of the virtual reality market I give this game a thumps up. It is an interest 'tech demo' that will have you enjoy the sights and sounds of being 'immersed' in a game world. However as a 'game' it isnt. Dont expect to be either having your wits or dexterity tested. This is a a point and click adventure without the puzzles. It is a story in a similair vein as Gone Home. Enjoy the ride, just dont press any buttons on the way through.			"

												Fantastic intro, great story line, too short. This game seemed to end just when it was getting started. I don't know if is worth its price, but I thought it was great. The 2 things that really bothered me were: 1. The hands don't feel liek they are in the right position, and also they dont pivot around your wrist when you rotate the hand controllers, rather they pivot around the top ring of the controller. 2. The Characters mouthes never moved, and their animations were a disaster. These things really killed the immersion, as well as the hand issue. I think that the price will be justified for this game when all of the episodes come out, and they make a bundle deal. Honestly was a great experience, just ended too quickly for the price, and there were issues in game that I listed which weakened the immersion.			"

												Best VR game on the market right now if you're a fan of single-player, story-driven experiences.   This is the game you'll use to introduce people to VR.    Although, as others have said, the price is a bit steep for the length of the game.  Still worth it, in my opinion. And to those complaining about it being buggy, I wonder what they're running.  I was running a 780ti and it was choking a bit on this one.   Upgraded to a 1080 and had zero issues.   This one is definitely a GPU hog.			"

												This is reminicent of those old Lucasarts games, particularly I got a strong ""The Dig"" vibe. That said, the way they took that concept and adapted it to tell a story so well in VR, so immersive that you forget where you are and become part of the story is just mindblowing.This game is a must get if you like story driven games. You will not be dissapointed.Keep in mind that each episode sells separately, so it might take a hit to your wallet. Try to think of it as supporting a new platform. The entry cost is usually higher for first adopters :D			"

												One of the best room scale story/exploration games I've played in VR. The world is lush and immersive. The blinking movement gets a little clunky navigating around in tight spaces. And... there will probably be at least one time when you are stuck in the games progress and unable to tell if you are experiencing a game bug or a hardware bug. The fuse box puzzle part of the story is a little frustrating, but once you get through it the pay off is worth it.			"

Contained some jittery bugs at points that have recently been worked out by the devs.  I hoped that it would be a bit longer, but I was satisfied with the experience as a whole and am greatly anticipating the next chapter.

												Having spent my childhood exploring point-and-click adventure games this was my go-to title when I got my HTC Vive. And boy, it delivered my first goosebumps VR experience. Although the adventure is somewhat short and not completely bug-free, it's overall a great experience with varying levels of difficulty on puzzles. Sceneries are rich, and there's a ton of non-required items to play around with to mix things up (which was fun for a VR-newbie). Without giving too much away the last minutes gave me the kind of dimensions I truly hoped VR would deliver. Can't wait for the next chapter in the series to come out.			"

												Just Finished my First play through.  2.3 Hrs.  I took my time too.  Enjoyed the world ALOT.  So nice to see the detail in the game.  As with any consumer I would love more.  The story needs to be defined a little more.  It left to much open and didn't draw me in.  It feels like the show ""Lost"".  A lot of questions and not enough basic story.  But you have hooked me enough for the second chapter.  Also more puzzles would be fun.  Its mostly reading and walking around.  I feel that the $24 I payed was a little much for such a short game.  I know the market for VR games is going to be higher so to those on a budget maybe wait for a bundle when all the episodes are out.  Other than that its a fun game and would say go for it if you got the spare $$.  Def another fun VR RPG.			"

												Fantastic game.The puzzles aren't terribly difficult, but cool nonetheless. I hope the following chapters do have some varying degree of difficulty though. The environment is a pretty compelling experience in VR, and very stable. I was able to play the last 90 minutes straight through with no issues at all. (Although there was one point in the first zone where you are standing on stairs, and if you move it's very disorienting).The game is about 4-5 hours long, but I very consciously took my time to take in all of the scenery. If you're turned off by the price, don't be. If you early adopted VR, shoot for quality not quantity. This was easily the most fantastic time I've had in VR to date, and cannot wait for the following chapters.			"

												$30 is a lot to spend on any game that will last on average about 2 hours. Still, I can't recommend this title enough.I've been a VR enthusiast for about two years; ever since I landed an early number DK2. In those two years I tried just about everything on the old Oculus Share and I've bought pretty much any title on Steam VR and Oculus home with a reasonable rating. In all that time, nothing has made my jaw hit the floor like The Gallery.If you have a Vive do yourself a favor and pick this title up ASAP. And please, don't give up if you get stuck on the beach puzzles. The parts of the game that really shine are the ones that come after you trudge through the sewer.Pros: Most breathtaking VR experience I've had. Period. Lots of effort put into making most objects interactive Very novel backpack inventory management systemCons: Very short (around 2 - 2.5 hours) A bit pricey for the duration As others have pointed out, the solutions to some puzzles are not exactly clear. There are hints scattered around, but the world is very detailed so they're easy to miss. It is extremely rare for me to me use any hint or guides but I did need to in order to complete the episode.Overall, I highly recommend this title for any Vive owner.			"

												I seriously enjoyed this game so much. I have pretty much all of the VR games that are available right now and this one was probably the most immersive. It really makes you want to just stop and interact with everything you see. That being said, 30 bucks is just way too much to ask. Especially if this is going to be episodic. I mean, I'm thoroughly invested in the story but even with that I'm not likely to buy the second episode for anything more than 15 and I will still probably wait for a good sale. 30 dollars for an hour and a half of entertainment is just obscene. All that said, I will recommend the game, but be aware that you are going to feel like you blew a lot of money at the end. Especially since the ending basically hits you like a commercial break in the middle of a good movie.			"

												Very pretty even with a 970, also I appreciate the lack of jump scares even though the setting kind of seems suitable for them. Controls and inventory system (backpack) are good, took some getting used to but that could be due to my lack of VR experience so far. Story was interesting and might evolve to something great with the following episodes. I did not like the blink-to-where-you-look locomotion, however you can change that back to point-and-blink so no issue there.The game took me less than 2 hours to finish with slow/moderate speed so people who optimize price per hour for a game might want to consider whether or not this is worth it. This is, however, a very good showcase of what kind of story driven games with clever controls and pretty sceneries we'll hopefully see more in the future.			"

												I have to recommend this game despite the short it is, because it´s by far one of the best experiences I have had with VR. I think only elite Dangerous can be compared at this time with this game. The graphics are very good and the story is very interesting. The puzzles could have been a bit harder because they are too easy (the fuse one I hate it until I realize there was a hidden clue (not saying which, of course). But again, it´s too short and it´s expensive for the amount of time you play. The experience is worth it despite all. If you can, support the team so they can continue. But as someone said, I hope they will give some discount for the ones who bought the first one.About the price, there is an interesting discussion in Reddit about it: https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/4m9q39/update_on_gallery_episode_2/Now I understand better the price. Yes, it´s expensive, I have to say it but a wonderful experience, the best in VR so far.			"

												The biggest issue I had with this game was simply the fact that it was over fast and ended just as it was getting interesting. What it was is a step in the right direction for what we want exploration games to be in VR, and my critique of the game being too short should speak to the enjoyment I had of the game since it implies I wanted it to continue. Sadly it doesn't, and you are left feeling a bit shocked at how quickly you played through the game considering its asking price. As a game starseed is great, but sadly I don't think I'd recommend it (even at the as of writing this steam summer sale discounted price). If the price included upcomming episodes then I would have recommended it, but right now I'd probably recomend that you wait and see if you can pick it all up later in a bundle after more episodes are released - that way you'll get more value for your money and more content to enjoy at the same time. So for now this is a wait and buy later in my oppinion. PS. It hurts me to give this recommendation because the game itself is really fun and you can see the devs put a lot of love into it.Edit: With the change of the game being included in the purchase of the vive I am changing my recommendation. The game itself is great, the main concern was always the value/time which is now a non concern.Great game, great change and I'm eagerly awaiting the new chapter.			"

												Excellent ""full game"" type of experience in the Vive.  Cool, fun game.  Looking forward to additional episodes!  Any gripes about the length are from folks forgetting that generating high quality linear VR worlds is currently still in it's infancy, and the fact that the majority of VR experiences are currently 5-10 minutes and then rinse and repeat with 8 bit style graphics.  This is much more a traditional game that puts the room scale VR capabilities front and center.  Definitely worth the price of admission.			"

												This was a great game for VR.  The storyline was interesting, the puzzles were interesting, the interactions with various / misc. objects within the game were well thought out.  There were a few issues related to gameplay that was a little clunky at times but most of this was fixed with a reset of the VR system.  The only thing I wished were different with this game is the length and the price. While I received this game as part of a package when purchasing the Vive, I still looked at the cost of the game. I know this is a relatively new space for game development, so I get why the price for this is a bit high, but I am hoping chapter 2 is either a bit cheaper or a little longer.  Keep up the good work!			"

												very good use of the VR platform to build a sci fi myst like world. I dont really have alot of complaints about it it works. Possibly some work on the picking up and placing of objects as they would propel or pick up random objects that i was not reaching for. Perhaps higlight whats being focused by the hand or tool if the object range is too sensitive or even make the interaction space smaller with the hand. Over all very good game so far, looking forward to chapter 2.			"

												Wow. As far as puzzle games go, this one was pretty cool. Object interaction is good.Beware that if the ground is uneven and you turn, the camera has the tendency to move either up or down as it's trying to change your vertical position in the world (it seems). Quickly induces nausea. The story is very interesting...but I wish the game had gone farther. I messed around with stuff and still got it done in 1.5 hours. If it hadn't come for free with the Vive, I'd be pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I understand this stuff is hard to develop for, but come on! $20 per game, they say 4 episodes total...that'd be $80 for what amounts to a full game!Will I buy episode 2? Maybe...but episode 1 ending left me with more questions than I've had since Lost aired on NBC. Unfortunately these short games seem to be all the rage in VR right now, so hopefully in the future we'll start seeing things a bit more fleshed out as studios get more and more comfortable with the dev cycle. I'm recommending this because 1) It was free 2) the story is interesting 3) gameplay has a lot of promise			"

												The Gallery - Episode 1: Call of the Starseed really surprised me. I received a copy free with my Vive and neglected playing it for a while in favour of more well-known titles such as Audio Shield and Job Simulator. When I finally booted it up, I did not stop playing until the credits were rolling and I loved every minute of it. The mysterious narrative and gloomy setting of the first chapter was an instant hook and I remained engaged throughout the story. The game is predominently a puzzle-based adventure where atmosphere and story take centre stage. The puzzles were well thought out and challenging, though I felt that the '3Bs on the B' puzzle was a little too tricky to be the first challenge of the game. The soundtrack is outstanding and the high graphical fidelity really shows off the potential of the Vive hardware. I loved the ending and how quickly the game changed its tone as the mystery was revealed, however, the cliffhanger was painful and I hope the next episode is in the works and scheduled for release soon. My main criticism of the title would be the game's length. It took me just over 90 minutes to reach the credits, though considering the game's price tag this is understandable and to be expected. Overall a fantastic experience and I would recommend this to every Vive owner.			"

												very good use of the VR platform to build a sci fi myst like world. I dont really have alot of complaints about it it works. Possibly some work on the picking up and placing of objects as they would propel or pick up random objects that i was not reaching for. Perhaps higlight whats being focused by the hand or tool if the object range is too sensitive or even make the interaction space smaller with the hand. Over all very good game so far, looking forward to chapter 2.			"

												The locomotion takes a little getting used to, but it has the most developed interface, narrative, and graphics I have played in the Vive. I got this as a demo, but it is more fun and more complete than many games I paid full price for. I look forward to the next chapter.			"

												Whilst rather short, I did get the game via redemption so it didn't really bother me. The game has certainly had quite a bit of effort put into it, and the story telling and VA are quite nice and at times remind me of Rick & Morty.Only negative things i can say is price and at times getting glitched into walls.

												The game/experience is relatively good and engaging, but not worth the full price of $20. It's a very slow story that doesn't get interesting until the last 5 minutes. A lot of the physics and mechanics of the game are very crisp (the blink-to-move is REALLY awesome). Hopefully the following episodes are cheaper because the story is interesting enough that I'd want to play the next episode.			"

												The production quality of this game is good, and I really liked the music. That's about it. The game is short, there's barely any story, and only a handful of puzzles, only one of which actually took me some time to solve. The VR mechanics are basic environmental interaction.Not to mention this is just part one. If you want a good adventure game, this isnt it. If you want a cool VR experience, this also isn't it. I'm glad this came free with my Vive. Don't waste your money.			"

												This was one of two promotional games I received with my Vive. At first, the puzzles were a bit strange, but once I got the hang of the storyline, it was fine. There's beautiful eye candy all around, very cinematic... it's much like being in a movie with puzzles to solve.Though somewhat short, I really enjoyed it, and loved the end chapter. I look forward to more of The Gallery.			"

												Magic. The only word to describe it, it reminds me of a more adult Disney movie. This is the definite real experience for VR, this debunks all the non-believers of VR saying they are just 'tech demos', this plays like a full game, looks like a full game and there is only more to come! I beated the game in about 2 hours, mainly because I sucked at the puzzles. I still had a ♥♥♥♥ing blast though, I can't wait for the second episode!Pros: + Great atmosphere/writing + Great voice acting + Geniuinly puzzling puzzles! + Great professional graphics + Story rich with great immersionCons: - Not really a fan of the episodic formula - The backpack system is a little faulty, you can't have two items from your backpack in each hand because you still need to put the backpack on your back.  - On the final part of the game, when you are moving down the elevator and twisting and turning in different directions to the starseed. It is REALLY nausiating, i had to cover my eyes because I was ready to throw up. This only lasted for a very short bit, however.REALLY good game for VR, 9/10			"

												I get some framedrops here and there with a AMD R9 390 on default settings (medium graphics), but apart from that, the game is absolutely incredible so far. And the story has that mysterious, supernatural, ""something is out there"" vibe known from games such as the old Myst or Atlantis. I'd absolutely play this if it was just a regular game, but the very well done VR implementation (backpack is genius!) makes this so much more intense. I have always been more interested in exploring new worlds rather than getting stuck on puzzles all the time, and so The Gallery EP1's pacing is just right.Recommended with full of love ♥			"

												★★★★★ 5/5TLDR;Can throw starfish.☺Pros- Can throw starfish.- Putting a conch shell up to your ear plays the sound of the ocean. Sweet one guys <3- The first storyline-oriented VR game i've played, and it's beautiful.- Scenery is of amazing quality and maps feel real.- Puzzle mechanics are fun, requires you to use your brain rather than faceplant the keyboard to complete the game.☹Cons- At times it was hard to figure out what to do, or where to go. (This can be put down to me, so not really a con)- Not enough starfish.I'll update this review regularly. :)For more VR game reviews and recommendations, check out my profile. :)			"

												I got this game for free with the Vive. It has some of the best graphics I've seen in VR, and some of the best, immersive narrative also. The only problem is that I didn't care much about the story, or get drawn into it until the end. I didn't even really know what was happening the entire time. It was still worth the play through, being as immersive and polished as it is compared to other VR games that are out.If I had somehow known how much enjoyment I'd of gotten out of this game, I think that $15 would be the most I would pay. For someone who really likes puzzles (light puzzling here) or is just super interested in this type of game then maybe $20 would be worth it to them.			"

												Up until I played this, I was not convinced that VR gaming was ready for more involved gaming adventures that you typically see in AAA titles.But this game has to be one of the most spine tingling and immersive things I've played...  Amazing, great sound design and an ingenious UI for handling inventory.Some may say $20 is a bit much for a game this short (I beat it first time around in a little under 2 hours), and I'll admit I got it for free with my Vive, but given the amount of effort that went into this game and the enjoyment I have gotten out of it, I'd say it's worth it, and I'll gladly pay $20 a pop for future chapters! I cannot wait to see where whis story leads to next!			"

												hey_that's_pretty_good.aviOnly really felt worth it because it came free with my VIVE. Not a fan of these ""episodic"" type games; $20 seems a little excessive for the 2 hours of gameplay (probably closer to half an hour of actual gameplay; I'm just a retard and had to break every object in sight, and at least 30 minutes of cutscenes.)A complaint I have would really be with the cutscenes, which felt awkwardly long and dragged-on. Seriously, did we have to watch every little detail of the machine powering up?That being said though, I was really excited to FINALLY see someone take a crack at a VR game with some actual plot which wasn't just some arcade thing, and this game definitely set the bar pretty high for any others.All in all I'd say it's definitely worth playing, but really only if it came bundled with your headset, or you've got obscene amounts of money (which we snobby VR headset owners do, mmmyeeeeess, quite so)			"

												This game was a trip!  Very good!  I seriously HOPE they add the Walkabout control method  (and other popular locomotion systems as well, to cater to individual taste) but other than that...  wait, how much is it?  $@)? $20?!!  woah...  okay, well I got it for free with the Vive so...  I guess if you had to pay that much... well it's not perfect then, but I enjoyed it very much.  one of the few VR games with hand presence I've played on the Vive, it's pretty basic but it's enough... The VR adventure game revival excites me.Add Walkabout and I'm in heaven.  my brain appreciates the physical map of the actual space...  I mean, walking around 1 to 1 throughout the world feels more natural than anything I've ever experienced in a video game...  Walkabout needs to become a standard method in room scale... any game that has you exploring needs it...			"

												I got this free with my Vive and so far the experience has been fantastic. Out of all the VR titles available at the moment, this is probably one of the best examples of a VR game and what can be done. From the start I was sucked in and immersed, walking around and just trying everything and being in awe of little things like using a torch ingame to find my way around or accessing your backpack. The standout for me was picking up a big sea shell on the beach and holding it to my ear and hearing the ocean, like you would with a real shell. It was the little things like this that blew me away. I feel like I'm in a classic adventure game instead of just doing a point and click around the screen. The only criticism is that I know this game is part of a series, and I am hesitant to spend £15 on each episode for what only amounts to about 2-4 hours of linear gameplay. For a lower price point I would say absolutely, but for £15 I think I would wait till a Steam sale or until you can buy all the episodes together. On that note, I can't wait to get home tonight to pick up where I left off			"

												Up until I played this, I was not convinced that VR gaming was ready for more involved gaming adventures that you typically see in AAA titles.But this game has to be one of the most spine tingling and immersive things I've played...  Amazing, great sound design and an ingenious UI for handling inventory.Some may say $20 is a bit much for a game this short (I beat it first time around in a little under 2 hours), and I'll admit I got it for free with my Vive, but given the amount of effort that went into this game and the enjoyment I have gotten out of it, I'd say it's worth it, and I'll gladly pay $20 a pop for future chapters! I cannot wait to see where whis story leads to next!			"

												A great game that shows how fun and engaging VR can be. Fun puzzels to solve, great music, and amazing voice acting. My only complaint is that it isnt longer. Game takes about 2-3 hours to beat at this point.			"

												Good VR experience, but story is kind of boring so far.  May have liked it if I could finish it, but it keeps crashing on the third chapter.			"

												I received this for free with my Vive purchase.It's an excellent RPG adventure. It's not open-world (which I like). The game gently guides you through the story.It's very well made. If you want an adventure, then you must try it.			"

												I got this game bundled with Vive. The visuals are great and really immersive. The puzzles are interesting though some interactions are a bit clunky, but overall the controls are pretty intuitive. I really liked the hidden easter eggs too.			"

												This is good but not worth $30. It's too short. I'd say $20.Update: They changed the price to $20, so it's a thumbs up now.			"

												I got this game free when I bought the Vive. When I first started the game I felt ""This is pretty polished but it's just alright."" Long story short I beat it in two sittings because I couldn't get enough! By the end I was so heart broken that it was over! I can't wait for episode 2! This game is a must have for any Vive/Rift owner!			"

												This came with my Vive, but I would gladly pay $20 for it. Little to no replay value, but incredibly immersive and a great first chapter of the story. I'm very excited to see where it goes from here!			"

												A touch on the short side, but that's to be expected of episodic content. I felt the voice acting, animation, and environments were all well done (and made me a bit nostalgic for a vew VR rides I've tried at theme parks and arcades over the years. I'de definately recommend this game.			"

												The game is really well put together and is one of the most compelling experiences on the Vive so far.But I simply cannot recommend the game based on the amount of content in the game. It took me a fair amount of time to solve the couple of (actually very simple) puzzles that are there, the time taken mostly by not noticing visual clues which lead to the solution of the puzzle. But even with this relatively slow problem solving the whole game lasted 90mins. Its like a single level of a game.I fully understand the tiny market the developers are dealing with here and they would like to pay their own wages and invest in the future of the platform, but I have come away from this game feeling very impressed with the content that is there but unhappy with the amount of it.I feel like even within the small level that you play through the developers could have stretched out the content, maybe making it a little more difficult or simply putting more puzzles in each stage of the level.I think ultimately it comes down to this: Are you prepared to invest $30/£23 in not just your own experience but in the future of the platform and the developers, because you have to want both as the experience itself just isn't worth the asking price in terms of what we are used to as far as games go.I wouldn't have chosen a 'yes' or 'no' for the recommend option if I didn't have to as I think it hinges on the above question. Personally I think bringing the price down to £17-18 would make it easier to accept and help the game gain wider adoption ultimately resulting in not much loss of revenue, if any at all. Having said this I expect the developers have done more research into the market than my anecdotal guessing.Edit: Since writing this review the price has dropped down to £14.99. this is about what I would consider 'right' for this game, it remains one of the most polished experiences yet.

												I can see the developers have lowered the price so I am giving this a Thumbs up now. Its around 2 hours long, but after almost a year of games, this is one of the better ones around and worth buying. When Episode 2 comes out, I will be buying that as this is very well made!			"

												A very good game. Profits a lot from Vr. BUT it's too short for the price.			"

												Fantastic game, very real and great pizzles. The story is compelling and DAT ENDING.Faster content releases would be very much welcomed though, as it has been a year since this was released and Episode 1 only takes around 2 hours to complete, at a jovial rate.			"
