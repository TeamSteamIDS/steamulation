												This is one of the strangest games I've ever played and I absolutely loved it.  Other reviews have mentioned the severe difficulty and the need to restart after hours of play and they're entirely correct.  This is, at heart, a resource management game with bizarre, unintuitive mechanics and there is zero hand-holding.  You will be confused (but also intrigued)  from the start of the game to the very end.  If you're quick to anger and frustration this may not be the game for you.  If you're patient, however, you'll find one of the most creative and stylized games you'll ever play.  The artistic direction is stellar and (though perhaps more style than substance) the atmosphere alone is worth the price of admission.  Be warned that the ""story"" is vague, dream-like, and never fully fleshed out.  Nevertheless, the developers manage to imbue an impressive amount of personality in the characters despite lines of dialogue that are sparse and cryptic as can be.  You should also be aware that there is an excessive amount of nudity in the game.  I initially thought this may be a cheap ploy for attention but I'm now quite convinced it was an artistic decision.  It contributed surprisingly well to the otherworldly, surreal atmosphere and is never remotely sexualized or graphic.  It should be fine for mature players.  Overall, if you're a patient player with an eye for style and an appreciation for some genuine originiality this game is worth every penny.			"

												Very strange and atmospheric, this game has an alternative gameplay style. You should at least try this game, it's a very unique gaming experience, or maybe it's more of an artwork than regular video game.			"

												It's easy to call a game beautiful, but when I say that about The Void I really, really mean it.The Void is striking in its visuals--featuring stark and dreary landscapes contrasted with splashes of vibrant color and otherworldly architecture and characters--but it's more than just visually beautiful.The Void is a game about death, and never before have I played a game where everything--and I mean EVERYTHING is so effectively tied together to serve the purpose of its themes. An oppressive, haunting atmosphere combined with a grim narrative and brutal mechanics that slowly drain you of all your resources combine together to create an equal parts harrowing and euphoric journey that wil dig its claws into you and not let go if you let it do so.That being said, it's not exactly fun and it's incredibly difficult, but I highly recommend it if you're looking for something different.

												A weird little game. There are no good endings or bad endings, there's just YOUR ending. As a friend pointed out, you can back yourself into a corner where the only way forward is horrifying, and it's a perfectly legitimate game choice to give up and stop playing. ""Losing"" is sometimes the best choice, and you have to ask yourself: why did I even care about winning and losing? We don't care who 'won' in a painting and we shouldn't care here.Beautiful, intelligent, haunting, sometimes deeply upsetting. If you run at it like a standard game that you HAVE TO WIN and get 100% COMPLETION and BEST ENDING you are gonna get very frustrated and hate it. Relax and just take it in.			"

												This game is dense. Very high learning curve and the game will straight up lie to you about what the most optimal strategies are.That said, The Void is also very deep. There's a lot of things at play in the game and all the systems are there and open to explore and tinker with. The theme of this game is quite heady and very different. Even for games with a similar story of having to escape the underworld, or wherever dark monster filled place you the game puts you in.Proceed with caution, this game is exceptionally unique and very difficult. I ended up giving up on it, but if you're looking for a challenge and have a lot of patience, this game is likely worth your dollar. It's certainly like almost nothing else I've played. Just think of it as an indie version of Dark Souls.Be sure to read the manual!			"

Posted: May 11, 2015
												The Void reviewTwo parts to this review. I'll let you figure out which is which. Part 1.62 hours to finish this game via the most difficult route, although I didn't chose the most difficult route because it was the most difficult route. Nevertheless, I am one stubborn son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ even though I really, really wanted to quit the game as it felt terribly hopeless.Sixty two hours of terror, wonder, and painfully frustrating gameplay. I couldn't even believe I made it. Yet, it's not 62 hours of game content, but 62 hours of scraping to get through and repeating the same sections over and over and readjusting for the thousandth time your strategy and inventory and if you make a mistake down the line, you might have to restart from HOURS back.I saved my game 302 times. I must have reloaded my game AT LEAST triple that many times. In this game there is zero margin of error. Literally, very, very literally every second counts. You literally have no time to breathe when you are not inside a chamber. The time management system is extremely flawed and frustrating. From the very second you load your game, you cannot waste a single solitary second doing anything except proceeding in exactly in the most efficient direction and having the most efficient inventory setup while spending any second in the void unpaused. The pause system is incredibly frustrating as well. You're not just fighting the game. You're fighting the game design. I could think of many ways the system could be improved. Such as letting you see the contents of chambers without having to unpause. Allowing you to pause without having to hold down the color palette. Auto pausing on every move between chambers. Letting you view your Lympha, Heart, and Nerva levels, or give some indication of the situation without having to go to the body screen as time only moves in the void map screen. Seeing as so much of the game happens in real time, letting you view the levels you need to keep an eye constantly should be a given. Also, considering how devastating any bad move or decision can be it is absolutely madness that don't give you better ways to keep track of the situations. The description of this game doesn't do it justice. The depth, thought, and calculation required by the player is on the level with some very demanding and serious puzzle and strategy games, even if the design is not. The most demanding aspect of this game is the logistics and that's where most of the problems occur. Also, this game won't let you save in chambers and it seems it would be tremendously time saving and advantageous and less frustrating, repetitive and terrible to just have the game auto-save when entering a chamber and auto-save when starting a boss battle. Just why they thought that having to readjust all of your inventory any time you need to restart something would be a fun way to play the game.It's almost impossible to make any informed decisions without wasting valuable resources and time, hence the numerous reloads as the only way to know what you have to do is to actually visit the chambers and see what's available in each one before devising your plan and then reloading to implement it from an earlier time as any wasted second is likely to mean failure. The inventory system is extremely badly designed and time-consuming. Instead of just choosing which color your using and filling various hearts from it. You have to constantly go back to the same color and wait for it each time it fills up. After reloading and repeating this hundreds of times it has become the most hated part of this game for the simple fact that it could have been done so much easier and less time consuming. The ideas for this game are brilliant and interesting and original, but the way they are implemented is horrible. I don't know what kind of testing they did before releasing this but seriously?  A game where saving and reloading is 99% of what you do is a good idea?Save after every move and hope that you won't have to reload again. I used guides for lots of help as there was very little information about what to do in the game and how to proceed. This game is nigh impossible without help from guides. That, to me is also a major game flaw. How can you release a game that simply requires an entirely seperate guide from other players before you have any hope of making any progress?_________________________________Part 2.The story is incredibly interesting. It's dark and alien at the same time. By far one of the most immersive experiences I've ever had. I had a sense that the game was full of metaphors (or perhaps it's just my own associations) and yet the void felt like a place of it's own. The void is it's own reality. Metaphors aside, the place feels real. I don't mean each individual chamber, but the characters, the dialogue, the lore;  the literature. The Void had me mystefied as I analyzed or just wondered about the nature of it's world, it's many creatures and characters and the protaganist. It is truly strange, yet it doesn't trade the bizarre for real feeling, even if bizarre is the feeling you get from the place and situation. There is something horrible and terrifying and even beautiful about this dark place. I hardly feel like I can do it justice in that regard. Just how deep and immersive, strange and beautiful the story is.There are elements to the story and game which remind me of ideas from the books of Carlos Castaneda. If you haven't read many of those books, then you have no idea what I'm talking about, but there's no way I'm getting into that in this review. The Void has you making choices and also makes you feel the weight of those choices and their consequences. Once you've started on one path there is really no turning back. The Void tells you, through various dialogue and/or narratives or just shows you, the hopelessness of the void. It's sets you to do the impossible, which is mirrored in the gameplay. I'm not sure what kind of experience I would have gotten had the gameplay been easier. The desperation for resources is a central theme and to coax that feeling in the player it is implemented in a desperate and nigh impossible journey.Even if I liked the game, I wasn't ready for a 62 hour grind. The story and experience were definitely real in their own way. I thought it would be more explorative and less super hard work. I have to be more careful. Starting a game like this that the gameplay sucks but the core is something I can appreciate ends with me grinding away because I can't give up on the experience, story, challenge... something. Something always piques my interest or someting obsesses me and I have to see the damn thing through.  "

												The Void is a beautifully assembled game and experience.  Looking back on it, The Void is not a very plot heavy game but it succeeds in immersing you in its world better than most anything I've played, and it does this with the strength of its many seamlessly blended gameplay elements, its wonderful art direction, and its audacity to challenge the player with loss and regret.The Void consists of two main gameplay components.  One is a 1st person survival-horror esque land where you traverse dark-yet-whimsical chambers in search of the resources (this resource being Color) to keep yourself alive.  Some of these chambers are peaceful, while others contain unfriendly abominations.  The second is a 2d map of the entire Void, where you'll take all the color you've collected in your pockets and gobble them all up as your character moves from chamber to chamber.  If you have no color left in your pockets to ""eat"", you die.  The metabolized color can then be expended when you enter the next chamber.  There isn't enough Color lying around to keep you alive though, so you'll need to use your metabolized color to plant gardens, gardens that you'll come back to and reap an even greater return.  These are the BASICS, and it gets very, very tricky from here.  Plant too much color and it will go to waste, as you'll never be able to use it all.  Plant to little and you'll starve yourself.  Some chambers house ""Sisters"", beautiful and oft lightly-clad women that demand a bounty of 2 specific colors before they allow you to pass, so amassing enough of a specific color whilst remaining conservative can become a tenuous balancing act.  Other characters called ""Brothers"" are huge, hideous, twisted abominations that protect The Void and will denounce you for your spending of their precious Color.  The conflict between the brothers and sisters will be the first thing to open your eyes to the most important theme of The Void:  You Will Never Be Perfect.  You will never please all of the Sisters, you will never please all of the Brothers, you will always waste color, you will make mistakes, there will be consequences, but you can still survive.It was a very profound moment when I realized this about The Void.  I have a compulsion in games to 100% everything; find all the upgrades, conserve my valuable ammo, 5-star every puzzle...  but The Void will never let you do that, because in The Void there is always balance, for every victory a failure, to give you must first take.  To achieve 100% efficiency you would need to be a god, and you are but a mere man.  Living with and dealing with regret is a powerful motif in The Void, and something that very few developers are willing to challenge their players with.To sum it up, The Void uses perfectly blended gameplay elements to create a vast, living, breathing world for the player, for you.  The Void never tells you for certain how you are supposed to act, who you are supposed to be, and you'll never know for sure if you're doing the right thing.  In this way, your character in The Void becomes the perfect empty vessel for you to experience this fantastic and surreal world through your own eyes, and it is quite the experience.			"

												This is an unusual game. Honestly, the game that it most reminds me of is Ultima 4 -- not in play style or in atmosphere, but in the sense that you spend most of your time trying to learn to understand the world you're in. (Disclaimer: I played Ultima 4 without playing any of the others, and without a manual. Not sure if the manual described what the ""Avatar"" was supposed to be, but it would've changed my experience greatly if it had.)The game is very unforgiving of mistakes. But at the same, you lose most of the game if you read online how everything works, and how not to make mistakes. When I played the game, I had to restart about 3 times (on original 'hard' difficulty), and each time I read a bit more online to figure out how to succeed. I'm about 3/4 through the game now, and i regret all that reading, as learning the rules is part of what the game is about. I would recommend this game, in a very specific context:1) Download the patch to nerf difficulty. Don't even waste your time playing on original 'hard' difficulty until you've beaten it once. I'm on medium now, resources are quite abundant. So I'd recommend you start on medium (or easy if you're less skilled). You may fail the first time until you know what you're doing. Once you figure out what you're doing the game is very easy, but on lower difficulties you won't have to replay the first half dozen chambers for every little mistake.2) Do not read ANYTHING about the game mechanics. Don't even read the release-notes on the patch. This is a puzzle game where alot of the fun is trying to discover the pieces. You may fail on your first attempt, and you probably will have several moments of ""oh crap! I've been doing stupid things! I wish I'd known not to do that!"" Yea, that's how the game is supposed to go. That's why I'm recommending starting on medium. It's simple to complete the game on 'hard' original difficulty if you know the rules, but you miss most of the game. Also be aware, there are red herrings -- don't automatically believe everything the characters tell you about how the world works. 3) Be aware, this game is slow. That's intentional. It's atmospheric and artistic. The slowness is to give you time to try to understand the world around you. If you're getting bored, most likely you're missing something. But don't worry... you can't miss anything for too long or you're probably going to fail, and you'll be able to catch it next time. Think of it like a rogue-like if you need to. The game is slow, but still intense.4) Be ready to experience art more than play a game. Everything in this game means something. This truly is a beatiful work.Difficulty patch below. The post includes release notes in green, and the download in blue. As I mentioned in point 2, try not to read the release notes until after your first playthrough. http://forum.ice-pick.com/viewtopic.php?p=101816#p101816 "

												If you know what this game is (read below) and still think you'd be interested, there is literally nothing I'd recommend more than this.The Void is pretty much unique. The visuals are striking, though the screenshots don't really do them justice. The story, once you actually know what it is, is highly ambitious and philosophical in a way very few games attempt, though I'd hesitate to recommend this purely based on that, or as a story game, because you're not really going to find a conventional narrative here -- instead it is a minimalist allegory told through hints and implications. The gameplay (often brutally and unfairly difficult) is an intriguing and original spin on resource management that, in typical Ice Pick Lodge fashion, is somewhat hampered by buggy or unfinished implementation that nonetheless manages to achieve a degree of gameplay-story integration that surpasses most games out there. It's rough around the edges, it doesn't hold your hand in anything -- gameplay or story -- and it's definitely the kind of slowburner game that you won't get into without a bit of patience, but if you don't mind that and are down to experiment with something very different, you're in for something special. It's cliche to call a game 'atmospheric', 'beautiful' or 'heartbreaking' these days, but, if you're the kind of person who wouldn't immediately hate this game to begin with, chances are you'll see how those apply to The Void more than most games they get attached to.

Product received for free
Basic InformationTitle:  The VoidStatus:  ReleasedDeveloper:  Ice-Pick LodgePublisher:  Ice-Pick LodgeGenre:  Abstract AdventureRelease Date:  7th of December, 2016 (initially released in 2009)Type:  Single-playerGeneral ImpressionThe Void is by far the most artistic and abstract game I have ever played until now. It’s hard even to settle it to a single clear-cut genre. I wasn’t present on Steam when Void was released and subsequently removed and I might have never heard nor seen it if I wasn’t browsing the Store for any recent creations from the developer of Pathologic (another game I strongly recommend to you). I’m glad that The Void was re-released in 2016 and it’s still receiving more attention than similar niche titles. In truth, it has no counterpart as far as I’m concerned. The creative use of color may be used aplenty in drawing games or Splatoon, but The Void is made by adults for adults. That should really not deter anyone above the age of 18 (because of the nudity) from experiencing this “playable canvas” as I shall call it.Shortly after a rather bizarre intro sequence that doesn’t manage to convey much, you’re thrown into the Void  and in the midst of it all, lies Color (lympha) that keeps your soul alive. As soon as you move through the Void, you realize that your true enemy is time itself. You constanly lose from the the color that fuels you body and the journey you have undertaken. If the counter reaches zero, you will suffer absolute death. Your goal is to prevent this by visiting a variety of chambers within the Void and to collect different colors stored there. In specific gardens and mines, Color can be deposited and harvested. The shades that you will use on world objects and characters are called “nerva”.  Everything from the game mechanics or the convoluted storyline, are features learned bit by bit when talking to the so-called Sisters or princesses. The one important aspect within this game is that Color use needs to be balanced. Besides giving you life, the hues are also used to travel from one chamber to the other. The Void consists of several Hubs that each host a different Sister.It takes some time getting used to the plot, I know. And I shall definitely not spoil it for you. There is talk of guards, ugly and disfigured creatures that will engage in battle if you go against their will. They are the Brothers and function as an alternate faction so to speak. You’re given the choice of following their orders instead of those issued by the deceivingly beautiful and scantly dressed or naked Sisters. They draw several similarities to the mythological sirens. And for all their hideousness, the Brothers still represent the blunt truth.  Magic glyphs that you paint on the screen using mouse movements help you solve several puzzles but also serve as a weapon in combat, as a tool to gain color, or start a simple conversation. So the painting gameplay mechanic is quite versatile and a novelty at the same time in most video games.In order to fully enjoy this experience, you must have a lot of patience. Apart from exploring and basking in the surreal glory of the chambers you shall visit,  discovering and understanding the conflicts between the princesses and the guardians to find out their weaknesses and play against each other, is a lot of fun on its own. Make no mistake in taking things for granted though. As if the difficulty wasn’t already high enough, the journal keeping tabs on your quests and contacts, is fairly thin on content. Trial & error will guide until you learn (almost) all the ropes.The princesses represent the key to unlock further chambers in the Void and thus new areas, while the guardians will try to hinder your efforts. It always happens under the equilibrium of the Colors. They must not be used lavishly, since they are a finite resource yet the decision to use them too sparsely will result in ultimate failure as you simply wither and die. Since you’ll be constantly on the move, a compromise will be made concerning what chambers you explore. So in that restrictive game aspect, lies the replayablity factor should you ever wish to explore the entire Void. One playthrough doesn’t seem enough.The level design is as fascinating as the game’s top-notch plot and written text/monologues, which are both serious and meaningful. Surreal landscapes perfectly matched by eerie music. However, The Void is mired by the hard-to-reach subject matter and the complex game mechanics, which are never properly explained and simply left to the player to discover. Many may not have that kind of patience, but I did and shall most certainly remember The Void for a long time, because in a gaming world filled to the brim with reboots and rehashed ideas, it still has its own unique niche for those players that are willing to look further than the first few superficial layers. Beauty really is skin deep…Strong Points+ Beautiful graphics and sounds.+ Open-ended structure with plenty of replay value.+ Tasteful nudity being presented among other mature themes and metaphors.+ Steam Trading Cards.Weak Points- No Steam Achievements.- Lack of a proper tutorial.- Difficult and intimidating for new players.Rating 85/100  This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews, through the generous contribution of RedHill.

												How am I supposed to recommend The Void? In writing about videogames, we simply do not have the right vocabulary to do that. I can merely offer these fragments, shored against its striking ruins:I. You cannot hope to win the game. You can only survive.II. The Void is a computer simulation of a highly complex system which you will not understand. From the first moments, you are required to manipulate its many variables, all obscured by very peculiar terms and tangled in a complex web of relationships. Helping the system is hurting it. Everything has consequences. You cannot know what they are. What you are doing is probably wrong.III. Everyone is lying. Particularly when they say that everyone is lying.IV. The videogame known as The Void is art. Unashamedly and gleefully art. The whole thing may be an extremely elaborate sexual metaphor. It may be the dark vision of an uncaring afterlife. It may be both. How many poems have you played lately?V. There is rather a lot of naked ladies in it.VI. It pleases me greatly to see the old surrealist sensibilities alive and thriving in a new medium. The visuals are bold and fascinating in their crumbling beauty. Erudite, yet still its own.VII. You try writing about this without sounding pretentious.VIII. The difficulty might be a bit extreme. I played it with the medium difficulty patch and had my hands quite full.IX. Ice-Pick Lodge’s use of interlocking systems to tell a story is truly fascinating and pioneering work. Here is a linear game that everyone will experience completely differently. There is no crude illusion of choice and consequence; everything is consequence.X. In conclusion, I can recommend this videogame product to everyone.			"

												Pros: 1. Great graphics (at least for its time of release but also my personal opinion)2. Good plot / story3. Disturbingly disturbing atmosphere and sounds4. The ""brothers"" (I believe that's what they are called?) walk in an incredibly creepy way and you will probably get a shock when you first see one / them5. It's cool to draw your ""spells""6. The game shows you how to draw your spells should you forget them7. Kind of a creepy horror game for most people (myself included) if you like those sorts of games, you should buy this one.Cons:1. Might lag on old and not fully up-to-date pc's (even mine lags a little every now and then but it's not all that bad)2. It can feel slightly repetitive (not Spore spice repetitive) to gather colour from the places you have placed ""farms"" on3. You will probably learn to remember them, but some of the spells can be easy to forget for some people, but like I said above under pros, the game can tell you how to draw them again4. The game can become slightly stressful for some people (you can kind of say you have a limited time if you don't want to make the game harder for yourself. Much harder.)5. A creepy horror game that not everyone might enjoy. Especially kids.Conclusion and personal rating: I personally think it's one of those incredibly good, but underrated games. It's truly a beautiful game and I give it 9/10. It couldn't be much better than it is, but I still somehow feel that something could be added to improve it. Maybe more monsters? I'm not wholly sure.In short if you like and appreciate abstract art: BUY THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												The best pouring simulator you can find in Steam!What I liked:- deep and spooky atmosphere;- you have to plan your actions ahead, the longer the better;- some philosophy.To mention:- graphics still look kinda pretty;- some people may complain about high difficulty, but it's quite bearable (especially with walkthrough guides);- some nudity;- easter eggs!What i didn't like:- the game may become repetitive;- it doesn't seem to be well optimized, I'm having some texture glitches and freezes (might as well be my machine's crap).So, if you like games that stand out of row, you should give it a shot.BTW, original russian version of the game, which is actually called Turgor, is much more vague (you don't even know what this world is and what you are), a bit less polished, and sisters in it have really lovely voices, soft and fragile. I was a bit disappointed to hear new voices in english version, they sound too regular and not entirely fit some sisters.			"

												This is easily one of the most player-unfriendly games I have ever encountered. This is basically a resource/adventure game, and you WILL have to restart a couple times after playing a couple hours each time, because the game is purposely vague and unforgiving with resources in the beginning. It is also a game which requires a good amount of micromanagement and reloading. The resource system is fairly complex, so I won't bother trying to explain it (it also SOUNDS really ridiculous).The environment and storytelling is also confusing, but also compelling. The world is mostly black, grey, and white, and you are in constant search of color, which you require in your body in order to survive. The girls look like alluring goddesses and the guys are grotesque monstrosities, and it creates this really weird environment which is a mix of horror and sort-of-existential ""WTF"".It's also a bit buggy, and crashes for no reason every once in a while.This is not a ""fun"" game, but it could be worth a look for the environments, storytelling, and resource system. It is HARD though, so if you're easily frustrated stay away.			"

												The Void reminds me of Star Control 2, which is one of my favorite childhood games. It is one of the more unique games I have played in quite some time. It is a fairly long and complex game that doesn't explain anything until hours in. Therefore you may need to start over mid way through because of your actions.You are introduced as a lost soul who was dragged to a world that is nearly barren of life. Your goal is to escape The Void, which can be done in different ways. There is a set timeline and where different factions will seek to convert you to their cause. Be warned that there is a LOT of female 3d nudity but no genitals or sex.The game revolves around a limited resource known as ""Color"" in order to survive and accomplish tasks. Color is extracted by collecting flowers, planting and harvesting trees, mining rocks, catching critters, and defeating some enemies. It is initially harvested as a health that is temporarily used to boost stats like run speed. Over time it is converted into mana that is used for casting spells which is mainly used to damage enemies.The game hides a lot of information about the use of Color until late in the game. Therefore, it may be helpful to know that casting too many spells in the same area will cause problems for you and determines what endings are available to you.			"

												This game is about surviving an unknown hostile environment where everything tries to take your life - your color - from you. This game is for everyone who loves a real challenge, but beware - the world you're stepping into will try to swallow you whole. For me it was a very immersive experience - but at times it made me feel quite gloomy. I think it's a work of art - but art can be challenging.			"

												I guess you could call it a survival adventure game. Truth is, it's much more complex than that. It's a world shattering piece of unorthodox art that challenges your understanding of the geometry of colour through constant game changing choices in a deep, misshapen, regulatory dimension filled with surreal imagery known as the Void. Blood is trust, defense, anger, speed, inspiration, metabolism and wastefulness. Blood is the essence of life and in this game colour is the lifeblood. While the whole story revolves around it, so does the gameplay. Inject yourself with colour to stay alive, use colour in combat by drawing glyphs with your mouse, use it to communicate with NPCs and to travel throughout the Void. How much of each colour exists in you affects what happens around you and the effectiveness of your actions.Your decisions affect the Void as a whole and it's inhabitants. These fall under 2 categories, brothers and sisters. The brothers are portrayed as death incarnate, remorseless creatures as embodiments of how the game itself will treat you while the sisters are portrayed as sentient, beautiful women in need. So at first it seems obvious but the truth is the game blurs the line between fire and ice. Are the things that the game tries to portray as evil actually so or is it a bluff? A double bluff? The game pokes at you with lines such as ""Don't fear death, there is no death in the Void."" Is that really the case or is it a line used just to confuse and mislead the player into a false sense of security towards a concluding manifestation born from gullibility and managerial ineptitude? Another interesting topic for discussion is where did the player come from. Remainder of this paragraph contains minor spoilers. Did you stem from a dimension above the surface of the Void and just fall into this pit? Were you a bacteria born out of contact between two aberrations within the Void? Or maybe you ascended into the Void as a sacrificial lamb to spy on it? Whatever the case, why? Below the surface that's what this game is about. It gradually winks, sticks its tongue out, nudges and taps its nose urging you to make a move...quickly. It will feed you both BS and (half baked) honesty in a call to make you meticulously weigh your decisions with colour aiming for an answer that may or may not even exist.			"

======================================The Void (Read on for the full review!)======================================TL;DR:A masterfully crafted work of art that is challenging, fun to play, deep, thematic, and beautifully executed; The Void is a game that I think everyone should have in their collection.======================================Pros:+ Graphics: While not technically impressive anymore, the consistency and quality of execution leaves The Void aging well.+ Atmosphere: Not only the visuals, but the audio, themes, and gameplay work together to make you feel sad, lost, and scared.+ Class: On the subject of themes, tasteful nudity is always a plus for me.+ Depth: The void could perhaps best be summed up as a resource management game. The ability to manage these resources well, however, takes a lot of thought and care.+ Lore: I love the lore. It is deeply entrenched, subtle when necessary, and leaves many distinctions up to the player to work out.+ Clever: Quality design decisions leave the player feeling how they should, and playing how they should, albet perhaps after a few failed attempts.+ Difficult: If the previous statement wasn’t enough to let you know, the game is difficult. It is entirely possible to back yourself into corners.+ Glyphs: Any game where you can draw glyphs and shapes and such to execute actions is cool to me.Cons:- Saves: In a game where poor play can mean having to start a whole new campaign, I wish there was a more navigable save system.- Do Not Pass Go: This game takes a good bit of figuring out. You may want to look for a guide or comprehensive let’s play starting out.Neutral:± Adult: Unless you are relatively progressive, there’s a very adult nature to The Void that makes it very not kid-friendly. On top of the nudity, you have something often extremely melancholy and at times horrifying.======================================Introduction:Hello and welcome to this review of The Void, something of a first person exploration and resource strategic management game. Great design, however, doesn’t make it feel like all you’re doing is managing your resources as if in a spreadsheet.Gameplay:Get ready to dive. In The Void, you are a lost soul. There are Sisters, 10 Sisters in all now. Each Sister has a Brother. The Sisters require Color to live, as do all entities in The Void. The Brothers, however, worship Color and are efficient in their use of it, providing for the Sisters, who in turn help to keep the Void alive. You arrive at the perfect time, while the Void is dying, you bring with you new color and life with the help of the first Sister who provides a heart and mentorship to keep you alive in a confusing new locale. It is now your job to be an interim Brother, revitalizing the dying Sisters, rousing the Void from its apathy, and dealing with the warped mentality of the Brothers. Grow and harvest Color to survive, provide, and fight!So, the management of color goes something like this: You find Color, harvest it into your Lympha, your Memory as it were. You can then fill your Hearts with Color, which is not only necessary to sustain yourself when actively in the Void, but converts it to Nerva, a Palette of Color to be used at your discretion. From your Nerva, you can grow more Color, allowing you to either store excess for later, or increase your reserves as an investment.Using the right Colors for your current Realm is key, as well as utilizing it minimally to progress. If you, for example, have a full Nerva, Heart, and Lympha, your excess Color stored in your Heart will have nowhere to go; unable to be converted back to Nerva from your heart, unable to be metabolized into Lympha, spilling into the Void, damaging the Realm you are in. Having Color in your hearts can provide significant buffs, crucial to progressing in the game without starving yourself. Namely: Silver and Violet. Silver reduces the effects caused by the use of color. Violet increases the efficiency of color during actions such as growing trees. Also important is Gold, but for a more singular purpose; filling the Sisters’ hearts with less Color because of the trustworthiness it imbues in you increasing their receptivity to your Color.So, now you are on an adventure where you bring Color to the Void, responsibly, wisely, and stealthily. You must lay low until you can deal with the Brothers, slowly buidling up your power, health, and reserves, carefully sustaining, planting, and harvesting the whole while. Good luck!Graphics:Just refer to the Pros section, or a video. A screenshot would only do it half justice. The art is consistent and atmospheric, it ages very well.Audio:The music, sound effects, and voice acting are top notch, adding much immersion.Conclusion:Everything in this game is satisfying and crafted deftly, I recommend The Void at:Any price.======================================This endorsement approved by The Reviewers' Union,providing better standards for reviews and reviewers.====================================== "

												The Void is the most unique and enjoyable game I have ever played. Visuals are astounding, the soundtrack is a delight, the gameplay is engaging and the dialogues are enchanting. Tension gives so much joy that after finishing one playthrough I instantly began another one to reach a different ending that is more difficult to achieve. I have an impression, however, that this game is not for everyone. Nonetheless, those who will be sucked into it will be held spellbound. To appreciate this game you must have an open mind towards unusual games, enjoy gloomy settings and imbibe poetry. In my opinion, whatever your taste in games is, Turgor deserves your time to give it an honest try. Do keep in mind, however, that it is one of the most difficult games I have ever played and the player is constantly faced with a challenge to stay alive and to cultivate enough colors for himself and for the sisters. I only completed the game successfully during my fourth playthrough, failing the first three attempts. This might discourage a lot of people considering most modern games are made to be completed without much difficulty in the very first try.You can read my full detailed review over there (sorry for the external link, but Steam wouldn't let me use formatting like I did in the review):http://www.rpgcodex.net/content.php?id=10393 "

												One night in late summer, I found myself stranded without a ride in what I imagine to be the south end of Soho.  I imagine this is where I was because I am not exactly sure, if I ever was, and the longer it has been since that night, the less sure I become.  Nonetheless, on this particular night I had done a massive amount of what I assume to be cocaine, as I have always been partial to the uppers, and I am not particularly fond of the feeling of fake congeniality imparted by the club drugs that every tween seems to be so fond of these days.  On that particular night, I was standing outside, and it had been raining rather heavily for quite some time, and I presume I was soaked clear through my clothes to the bone, although I do not remember the sensation of either being soaked or having bones, but I assume that I at least had the latter or else I would not have been standing outside in the rain to become soaked in the first place.  As I was standing outside in the rain thinking to myself that I could sure use an umbrella right now, a vision of heaven entered my periphery.  It was an umbrella, and it was held by the ugliest woman I had ever seen, in Soho or otherwise.  But beggars cannot be choosers, and I was certainly squarely in the category of beggars at this particular place and time.  I asked the poor wretch if I might share the umbrella with her, and she obliged, on the condition that I walk her to her residence, and upon arrival at our destination, I give her a kiss.  As I said before, not being a fan of the lascivious drugs of youth, I was not interested in such romantic endeavors, but it was still coming down like God had just finished happy hour, and I did not have anything left to do that evening, that I was aware of, so I thought I would see where the night would take me.The sights and sounds of Soho were overwhelming in my presently intoxicated state, and the more we walked, the more interesting my companion became.  I started to listen to her, and I started to see her for who she really was, and not just for her, admittedly terrifying, exterior.  I also enjoyed the way that people would go out of their way to walk around us when they saw us coming down the sidewalk, presumably frightened off by my compatriot's ghastly visage.  Unfortunately, as amusing as all of this was in my drug-addled state, it was getting later, or perhaps earlier, as the sun seemed to have been coming up or just going down, and I was really in no position to say, given my current state, and we were moving into a strange place where the ground seemed devoid of covering and the trees devoid of leaves.  The cement seemed to have all but disappeared at this point, and the only remaining facet of the civilization from which we had departed were oppressive wrought-iron fences that looked to be decades, if not centuries, old.As I was about to turn and ask my new acquaintance how much further it was to her residence, she advised me that we had arrived.  Her home appeared to be more a gargantuan tomb than any sort of abode I had ever encountered, but in my present state I was not really in the mood to question, and I did not particularly care where she lived, not even knowing her name at this point, and besides, there appeared to be some other rather grotesque individuals milling about, and I would really rather just leave than start suggesting real estate options to her.  Since we had reached her dwelling, it was time for me to depart, but not before, she reminded me, my bestowing of a kiss upon what I can only assume she referred to as her face, as I saw no other part of her form that could pass as such, even being that the thing that was no doubt her face barely did.  As I leaned in to give her a kiss, my hand brushed against the front of her slacks, and I felt a distinct, familiar bulge.  It was at that moment that I realized that she was he, and this is exactly what playing The Void was like.			"

												I bought this game for $5.00 during a Steam sale. It is probably one of the best purcahses I've ever made.One of the most intriguing and surreal experiences I've had in the world of gaming, ""The Void"" spares no expense in the way of imagination, visual design, challenge and stratagem.""The Void"" is a game that combines resource management, strategy, quests, drawing/glyph mechanics, intense boss battles, exploration, moral choice and gripping spiritual concepts woven within an intricate plot of poetry and philosopy.This game is not for the faint at heart. Its difficulty level is almost brutal and it hands you nothing on a silver platter. You will spend hours circumventing every drop of color you can from the world of ""The Void"", only to restart the entire game due to a series of small mistakes. This game is hard. Very hard, but in a good way. The satisfaction of succeeding in ""The Void"" is palpable. You can taste it. It's like finishing a masterpiece.			"

												This is an interesting game, while offputting at first due to the new type of game mechanics, but I decided to give it my best shot.. if I could just get past the first sister/level... but I keep dying and I don't know what to do.  The garden I made doesn't produce enough color to stay alive and I've given the tree lady everything I've got.. ugh.  So it looks like I have to start over from scratch, which is annoying.  Hopefully things will go better the second go around.Update: So I figured out what I was doing wrong, I wasn't filling the trees enough.  Also, I wasn't putting color in all my hearts in order to generate nerva.  I was just putting enough in one heart. I eventually gave up after I realized I had to start over yet again, I just don't have the time.  You really need to read a walk through, really pay attention and don't forget anything or restart a bunch.  But I really got into this game and wanted to see it through so I ended watching someone else play through the rest of it, lol.			"

												The Void is an original game, but it's difficult to explain exactly what is going on. All I can muster is that it revolves around color. You need color to survive. There are brothers that want to leech off your color and there are sisters that want to ♥♥♥♥ you for your color. All this transpires while the entire environment is working against you to obtain color and sucking you dry until you are depleted.My first play through, I had no idea what I was doing and didn't get very far. Second play through, I thought I had learned what to do, but ultimately I really only armed myself with enough knowledge to be dangerously foolish.It's intriguing and compelling, but the steep and hostile learning curve just drove me away from wanting to learn it further. Third time's a charm? I'll never know.			"

												One of my favourite games of all time. Great story and atmosphere, combined with some unusual gameplay mechanics and stunning visuals. If you want something truly unique, you should definitely give this game a try.EDIT (March 2014):To go into a little more detail without spoiling anything: This is a survival game but not in the sense most popular games today are. You’re thrown into an alien world between life and death without memories or any knowledge of the world surrounding you. Your goal is to ascend to the next plane of existence as the world slowly dies around you. Instead of using stats and items this game only has a single resource: Colour. It comes in several different forms and serves as your health, mana, food, money and ammo at the same time. It is also a strictly limited substance and you must be very careful with your supply. Hoarding different kinds of Colour also affects the world surrounding you in different ways, increasing or decreasing the difficulty depending on the situation.And that’s what’s going to make you either love the game or hate it. There’s no real tutorial and the game is extremely unforgiving of mistakes. And you will make plenty of those, often without realizing until it’s too late. Learning how the world works will take serious effort but each mistake you make will get you closer to understanding. And when you finally get the grasp of it the game rewards you with something that most modern titles lack: a true sense of accomplishment. The panic you feel during the early game will give way to a newfound sense of confidence as you learn to control the world to overcome the obstacles in your way. Beating this game without using outside help is a real achievement.During the quiet periods when you’re not actively fighting for your life you have a chance to enjoy the scenery and music. The game has a very unique and weird atmosphere that I enjoyed immensely. I often took a few extra minutes to explore every nook and cranny, often finding some hidden goodies while soaking in the atmosphere. The music goes very well with the overall feel of the game. The English voice-acting is as good as you can expect from a Russian game but it’s nothing special. The graphics are dated but age rather well. Keep in mind that this looked really good when it came out.The bottom line: try it if you’re looking for a challenge and enjoy figuring things out for yourself. If you prefer to have your hand held I recommend getting something more casual instead.			"

												Before all, it's important to note that this is an artistic game, similar to Art House in movies, it's genre will never be popular because it's not for everyone.  If there's anything I can compare The Void to, then it's a poem. A world full of metaphors, allegories, concepts or reflections of something, and a lot of various symbols that come in many shapes and forms. It's the kind of environment, suited to be in before going to bed, to meditate upon.This is an indie game. But at the same time it's a mixture of the most various genre's in games: surival, pshycological horror, tactics, strategy and even economy. Words aren't enough to describe it. The only drawback is the difficulty which can be toned down with some patches (on the official site) or cheats, some bugs that shouldn't be hard to fix (tweaking the settings is recommended) and maybe the somewhat inaccesibility when it comes to a larger crowd of people. Definitely worth your money if you're looking for an artistic game that succesefully takes common (and originally uncommon) gameplay genre's to make it interactive. Most esoteric game of 2009.			"

												I like this game, no, I'd go so far as to say that i love this game. Why? You may ask. Is the artwork amazing? No, it's actually pretty low quality even for a game from 2009. Is the story interesting? Not really. Go do this, fight this boss, save your soul, save the world. So why on earth would i recommend this game to you? Well it's simple, this game does something very unique, it balances movement, spellcasting, and exploring into a package that may take you 16 hours to complete. Is it worth the 10$ price tag? Absolutely, the world is surprisingly interesting enough that the story doesn't really bother me that much, and the combat and color conservation that they introduce in this game is surprisingly fleshed out. All in all, this game was enjoyable the first time I played it, and i was even willing to purchase this game again to see if the memories were still there.... they were. Final Score 7.5/10			"

												I have seen this game a few months ago and watched the trailer provided from Steam. I got interested in it because it showed worlds that are unique and very artistic. I felt like purchasing this game but what stopped me was it was made by a developer that I never heard of before, and I have read a lot of reviews that had mixed feelings and never really came to the conclusion of recommending it or not. I also seen some reviews that are more negative saying it is too difficult; but lack in detail why.I found this game on sale for only 99 cents, so I thought it wouldn't hurt to buy it now while it was that cheap. I did not regret my purchase at all. I was hooked to it until I finished it.Plot: The plot is based on my interpretation, so everyone can be right or wrong. There are some holes because I do not fully understand it myself.The plot as all about death; the protagonist is a spirit of the person who died. His soul happens to enter ""The Void"". The Void is a ""place"" where a soul can come back to be reclaimed by the holder (not every person who loses his soul enters The Void, instead the soul goes into ""absolute death""). In The Void, the protagonist, the sisters, the brothers, and other creatures are both dead and alive; they all just exist.He begins with nothing. A sister named ""Death"" aka ""Nameless"" gives him colour (in this game colour is a material that gives life) to help him survive, and tells him what is going on and prepares him to do what he is destined to. She tells him that if he doesn't have enough colour, he will go to absolute death. She teaches him how to revive trees by giving them colour so that they can give him more colour later on.Sisters are women who are beautiful. They need his help on survival.The protagonist has to be very careful when using colour because once he uses it, it is gone. In the void, everyone is deprived of colour. She tells him there are other sisters he can feed, so that he can ascend them into the world above where life is plentiful. Nameless warns him that there are brothers who are owned by each sister, who are mutilated, terrifying people who came from the ""Nightmare"" (from what I think, they ascended from absolute death) where colour is non-existent.The brothers feel that The Void is a heaven, and they must preserve it. To preserve The Void, the brothers must feed the sisters colour to help maintain their realms (each sister has a realm of their own). The problem is, each colour is incompatible, and work against one another. Every time colour is used for anything, a realm that had colour used in it becomes damaged thus making predators (dangerous creatures) come. So the brothers only collect and feed the sisters as little as possible while keeping them “alive”, but the sisters are suffering because of this.The sisters depend on the brothers and the brothers depend on the sisters to stay alive, but they also hate each other.Only he has the ability to give colour to plants. The brothers become angry because they feel the protagonist is a parasite in The Void (which he is damaging The Void as he feeds the sisters and produce more colour). Some brothers tell the protagonist that he can help them by not feeding the sisters too much. A brother will attempt to kill the protagonist if he feeds a sister too much. Some brothers will attack you mercilessly if he does not do what they ask. Some sisters tell him to pick one to ascend, while others say he should decide to ascend yourself or one of the sisters. He can ascend only one sister, because he needs to get all colour in The Void to help her achieve that, thus killing everything, including the protagonist.My Experience:I have to warn you, there is an inescapable amount of nudity in the game (sisters).I started the game and did what I was directed to in the game. At first the game was somewhat awkward because the way the brothers and sisters speak to you, but it eventually flows very well (mostly it feels awkward with the sisters). I walk to a sister who is clothed. I draw some colour have her speak to me. The screen fades out and back into another (dimension?) environment. The sister is completely nude and chained (each sister has different coloured chains). I feed the sister, the chains fall off. These are the times when they can talk to you, but they can talk to you when you are away. The times you see a brother is when you get interrupted travelling around the map of The Void by having the screen fading out and back again, and when you fight one. Brothers can also speak to you while you are walking around realms.The gameplay mechanics is completely original. I never played a game that I draw on the screen with my mouse to interact with the environment and creatures. I love playing a game that is so different but so good. The gameplay is slow, but it is very weighty. What you do may hurt you tremendously later on (or game over). This game is not forgiving like almost every modern game. I had to plan ahead and compare very many variables to make a decision. There are some glitches that are not a big deal, but there is one game-breaking issue when I mine for colour, sometimes the colour veins on rock is invisible. On the Developer's forum, it is a technical issue and the developers say you need to open the in-game console to activate wireframes if you ever encounter invisible veins. I had to do this because I experienced this. I had to back track a little because it screwed me up.There are few boss battles that are a pain and I feel are not necessary because they require long waiting rather than using any skill.The visuals are very artistic and creative; they are outstanding. I end up walking around in the game looking at the environments as I play. The developers are very creative for creating the brothers. There are some graphical hitches that really do hurt the atmosphere, but not many.The music tracks in the game are outstanding. Completely intensifies the feel of the environments. There are a couple that do sound off though. The voice acting is perfect. I loved all the dialogs and the voices of every character. All voices are unique, and many dialogs are poetic (most of the dialogs are easy to understand).Almost every character says different things about other characters. Every character tells you the truth but lie about something else or tell you what they believe. So it is really hard to determine what is true and what is not true. Which I felt really made this game good.What really disappointed me was all the endings are nearly identical, which really hurt replay value.The game does not tell you how to play it the best right away, which is what I dislike about this game. Conclusion:I really enjoyed this game. The issues said above are overlookable (except for the invisible veins). I spent 38 hours on my initial playthrough. I love the story. I give this an 8/10. I highly recommend this game to everyone. I do not recommend this to people who do not think and have poor decision making skills. I am saying this because this game does not hold your hand.This game deserves the $10.00 it asks for. Other:I think this game should be remastered. If all of the issues said above were fixed and rethought, it would be a perfect game. I think the game will be so much better if the protagonist was given a voice and had the ability to make arguments like in Deus Ex: Human Revolution. That would be amazing. Giving variety to the endings will greatly increase the replay value as well.Some people may become offended because of the portrayal of women in the game.I played this game with some assistance of a guide because I was afraid of restarting a new game many times that could make the experience stale.The guide is here: http://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/970707-the-void/faqs/62846I give credit to the creator(s) of the guide.

												To some extent I think games (in addition to all the other billion cathegories they can be organized into) can be said to exist i two cathegories; First easy to use games using tried and true formulas that make for uncomplicated fun that depending on the title can be as deep or shallow as it wants so long as it provides an enjoyable experience. Civ 5 is a good example of this. It is not without depth and really fun, but does not allow for anything more advanced than ""make war"" ""make peace"" to take place. It is an uncomplicated ""do better than your neighboring nations"" game that when compared to strategy titles of higher concept falls flat in the advancedness of its mechanics. The advantage of this is of course that picking it up to play is easy while mastering it still can prove to be difficult. :)Secondly games can be of the kind that decides to do something a little more advanced, often with a lot of difficult numbers (either happening off-screen, or in some cases (!) on) and very unuique (read complicated) mechanics that on the one hand would allow for deeper gameplay, but at the cost of acessability. To stay withing genre boundaries between examples, Crusader Kings 2 is a game that very successfully tries to mirror the complexities of regal medieval life. It allows for very advanced events to take place and players can if they are clever enough scheme themselves to the heights of power through a myriad of different paths (and murder). This however, provided they can invest the time to adequately learn how to. The game is very complicated and is something that one would need to invest a serious amount of time with to enjoy to its fullest. It will be worth it as most high concept games reward the dilligent player with an experience that (in my honest and humble oppinion) go beyond that of briefly charted games.That said, anything can be played in a fashion most hard core and even the most simple mechanics acheieve great depth upon mastery, but no matter if the title is advanced to begin with, or just played into advancedness, chances are any one player will probably only have a few such games mastered since, if nothing else, time-to-play will confine such proficiency to a few titles. Also, face it, sometimes we all just like to spend some time relaxing with something uncomplicated. Like shooting lots of things, or an Orange :).Maybe that is why we so often enjoy games from our past so much, because when all is said and done, we still have a firm grasp of its contents and as such is able to get more out of playing it. but this has nothing to do with The Void so on with the review:Short story synopsis: You are dead, and have been sent to an afterworld ruled over by a sybiotic collection of female sprirts and their guardians/borderline opressors. The world is bleak and devoid of colour, and as such devoid of life energy, something that you can change. in this world you will travel to different pods (small or large levels that contain gardens for you to harvest colour from or enemies for you to fight. Sometimes both.) and slowly try to establish yourself in the shifting hierarchy of the world. Having failed miserably in my attempts to progress I cannot elaborate further on the story but there is more to it than just harvesting and sharing your hard earned colours with the spirits. Im told there are multiple endings and I can confirm one of them to be evaporating due to a lack of, you guessed it, colour.Mechanically The void (for all my talk of two cathegories :P) falls somewhere in between having simple mechanics and being really, REALLY difficult and complicated. On the one hand, the main mechanic of the game revolve around colours, the currency of the world as well as your life, ammo, fertilizer and puzzle object. If you lose all the colour that you store within you, then you die, but you will have to drain yourself to process the colour so to make it available for certain things meaning that you will have to think carefully about how much colour you use as life and how much you save for later in either usage cathegory.But there is more to it than that. In the world there are many different colours, all affecting the world in different ways. Implanting yourself with a certain hue will do things like raising defense, or making you speedier. Some situations may require you to implant certain colours. Just remember that whatever you implant will end up in your ""usable-reservoir"" so implant wisely.Yo also need to plant colour for later harvest, meaning you inject a portion of it (the more the better) into a tree and in a while, that tree will have produced more of the same for later use. This is essential to progress since you will have a hard time finding enough raw colour laying about in the levels. Give to recieve.To use colours you must use spells. Thease can be learnt throughout the game and are uses by making paintbrush-like movements with the mouse to make magical patterns, like a cicle for a shield spell for example. This uses up some of your colour, the better your pattern, the less is used. But beware, for every drop wasted changes the world in some way, red making the monsters more agressive for example. Using such runes, and by donating colour to the spirits of the world will allow you to progress through the levels and towards what awaits at the end.This is not a game you can just pick up and expect to even be able to play without a serious time commitment. Its mechanics are almost alien in its frivolous use of colour and mercurial relation to world rules compared to lighter titles. What was first a fertile garden may turn into a barren waste if not tended to, and wasting colour can turn any situtation ugly either by making the world hostile or just leaving you unable to pick yourself up again. Save often on different slots, and be ready to learn.That being said, the reward for such commitment will be having mastered an experience unlike any other out there and the game's unique artstyle and gameplay is as worthy a carrot as any to grind your teeth and bite down on.And stating this after having played only a paltry amount of it myself is not hypocritical in any way at all i have no idea what you are insinuating i have precious little free time good day sir madam!:) "

												Short version: A strange mix of action/adventure, resource management, rpg, Okami and to some extent even a dating sim. YOU. SHOULD. PLAY. THIS. GAME. It's not perfect, far from it in fact, but I can guarantee you'll never forget your experience.  9/10 Long version:I can guarantee that you have never played anything like this game. It defies genre, with elements of RPGs, FPSes, Okami, resource management and arguably even dating sims of all things. The graphics are slightly dated but that honestly means next to nothing because the game has a stunningly unique aesthetic like nothing you've ever seen. You won't even notice low quality textures because you'll be too busy gaping at the surreal and beautiful level design. The plot is loose and ethereal, leaving much up for interpretation and the soundtrack and voice acting are mood setting and incredibly ambient.On a moment to moment basis the gameplay is simple and relatively easy but don't let it fool you, this game is absolutely merciless. As the description says, color is health and it is always draining. This is never a problem in the short term but if you fail to think ahead and set up supplies for the future its entirely possible to screw yourself over to such an extent that the only way for you to continue is to start a new game entirely. That may sound like a bad thing but this game is very much ""Difficult to learn, easy to master."" The mechanics are going to be strange and alien to pretty much anyone playing this for the first time but once you've figured out their workings you'll probably master them within the next half hour and starting a new game will suddenly boil down to perhaps 45 minutes of hard work to get back to where you were when you were forced to restart.There are really only three major flaws with the game. First, it does not hold your hand in any way when it comes to game mechanics. You need to listen carefully to dialogue early on and occasionally venture educated guesses towards some mechanics if you are to survive. If you fail to do so your only real option is to consult a guide online if you want to learn.The second problem is less of a problem. the game is technically rather repetitive however I never really found that to be a noticeable problem since the constant scarcity and variety of occurances helped keep things moving.This is a game I think everyone should try. You don't have to finish it. You don't even really have to like it all that much but you should definitely try it because there really hasn't been anything like it, before its release or since. Things to note* The game does feature full male and female nudity. It's tasteful and not overly sexualized in any way (with a few exceptions), but also pops up fairly frequently so this may not be the best game to play with someone watching over your shoulder.*There exists two fanmade difficulty ""patches"" that the developers have endorsed, both of which make the game's difficulty slightly less punishing. My first playthrough was with the ""medium"" patch and I'd recommend you do the same. Both can be found pretty easily on google and are incredibly easy to install.* The game unintentionally lies to you about the effects of your color usage. It says that using too much color causes changes in things like enemy health and the disposition of The Brothers. The developers didn't actually have the time to fully impliment these effects and failed to remove the references to them. As a result there is a menu screen showing the effects and multiple lines of dialogue refering to it but it honestly has no effect on gameplay whatsoever.* Ice Pick Lodge's previous game, Pathologic is also quite good if you like this. It's ugly, riddled with translation ♥♥♥♥ ups and even more difficult than The Void but if like me you're always eager to try something new you can pick it up on GOG.com "

												Breathtaking.Perhaps the only criticism you can make of this in fact is that it's not quite as good as Pathologic, but then not much is. Ice-Pick Lodge proved they aren't just a developer with one great gimmick, but continue push the boundaries of the medium like no one else since Looking Glass Studios sadly closed its doors.Much like Pathologic, you are thrown into a world and have to work out the rules of the game for yourself. Again though, the catch is, that the game runs in continual time meaning by the time you've leaarnt all the rules it may be too late! While this may sound cruel to make the game extremely difficult to win, it somehow adds to the nightmarish atmosphere which Ice-Pick Lodge are so adept in creating.Saying that however, this isn't quite as pressurised and emotionally draining as Pathologic, or as panic inducing as their latest output Knock-Knock, The Void is instead much more sureen and beautiful. With it's myriad of small breathtaking worlds and spine-tingling ambient soundtrack, though there is a sense of panic with regards to the main quests, The Void seems much more leisuerly in comparison. Not that that's a criticism, far from it, in fact, the pacing and atmosphere here are almost hypnotic. Reminscent of the Echo Night series at their best, but even better. Not to say that the game is tranquil or serene, in fact I can not think of another game where I felt so empty playing it. Pathologic elicited feelings of despair as you saw a town crumnling before you, but with the Void, it's just emptiness... There are times during this game, the pit of my stomach just felt drained, like there was nothing there. Often at the most mundane of times too: whether in Ire's Pond, Yani's House climbing Ima's Tower or in bare grey plantations.The main idea of the game is to find, hoarde and grow colour, which acts as your ammunition, your health, your armour and your key to opening up new worlds all in one. However, there's a catch, firstly, the more colour you use, the more ""damage"" it does to The Void and secondly, you can only transfer colour from your ""supply"" pallette to your ""useable"" pallette in the Void and it's while in the Void where the continuous time comes into play. That all sounds very confusing and it is, but again, that's what makes the game.In short, the Void takes time to learn, can be confusing and extremely difficult, but this only adds to the breathtaking atmosphere, constant sense of peril and pure soul-crushing beauty of the game (through both it's game design and it's world and aesthetic). It pushes the medium to new heights, it brings up that boring old discussion about video games as art and it just about makes every game which has attempted to have a sense of beauty about it look utterly pathetic in comparison. I delve into hyperbole and superlatives not because I try to convince you to play this (though I do) - after all we all react differently to games and I can perfectly understand why someone wouldn't like this - but simply because this game is like nothing else out there and because it really expresses a unique take video gaming, which many people believe to be, as a medium, still finding its place (even if I personally strongly disagree). Alongside Pathologic this is the absolute pinnacle of game design.			"

												The Void is a wonderful, difficult, creative piece of work that you will ever experience in your lifetime. Words can't describe the atmospheric, intense, gripping, story rich and abstract adventure that you will ever partake in. I'd call it a genre buster since you can't really put this in any category or genre. It is beautiful, simply beautiful. And the story is written in a way that doesn't really spell it out for you, but leaves you enough to crave more. "

												gray is intermediary. white being all and black being none. both are extremes. passion emboldened and embodied, symbols of the absolute. seep one into the other and somehow neither dominates: becoming a state without, opposite of opposites that have all. a state coloring an emotional death; sleeping without want of waking; dreams anchored and abandoned; nightmares made flesh and disregarded. if anything belies sadness without sadness, it is a hidden strength. the strength to live an absolute death. we for whom no color grows, was it our will that sent color away? or were we ravaged internally, until there was none left? as color leaves, so does the beauty in life. not just on the surface; everything is sucked dry. the sleeper lies still. roused for what, pray tell low soul. guest, tell me, is gray a symptom or a result? if your fate is to rise and ascend, why do you only destroy? greyness permeates, undeniable indelible, shrouded misery over sumptuous deceit. the sleeper no longer sleeps. what we call sleep, if a state of unwaking, the sleeper is a name only. death to the sleeper? he sleeps no more; his color is gray; he is dead to the world.life is a collection of voids. their limit can be reached, provided man has the strength to breakthrough. the sleeper who is not sleeping is neither awakened. his void decays of inaction. what is happening? surely, nobody knows. nobody cares. nobody cares that nobody cares. yet; whispered, some shouting, within missing time, we come to agreement: apathy. the void dies, the sleeper wakes, he does not care. gray is a lack - grey the color of uncaring. look for the signs, the colorless wake, the living of death ushers in a final age. still, nothing is happening, and nothing will happen. there is no lost purpose in void even if we find purposelessness. a stalemate caused by none. dear guest, will it be broken? is fate coincidental or planned to start? apathy’s curse is absolute, unbreakable even with fortitude in desire. casting off bonds so carelessly will destroy everything. yet the bonds must be cast. contradictions sustain order, regality, the semblance of life and the mockery of it. this order, like all, is doomed.color has returned to the void. death beckons, she beckons to you, lost soul. pick up her heart; do not fear the end. who is death but the progenitor? the new age is here, the old age is always, our time has whence and past. we will teach you discipline. the sisters shall bow before you. stay straight, my faithful warrior messenger. forget about taboos; give, you fool, or it will all be lost. it is your fate to create. such a right will be questioned, shrieking and vehemently. compromise and perish. one who stifles is no greater than the amateur who gropes. none may be given on merits of right. guest, you are a wanderer. can you feed with your blood? can you handle turgor, the state of absolute tension, which turns a man into a drawn and tightended bow? my supposition is your weakness. it’s not so much lighting tension when you must endure it. there’s no way to prepare you, guest. you will die for this.that’s the fate of creation. what world will you make? not everything is open, stilted, fronted for graces. as we vye and compete, you are a benefactor. it is by chance that you exist here, guest. the void is as beautiful as it is cruel, yet its thorns are in you. marvel at sights as they last in shroud. we welcome and revile, these chambers are free to be acted upon, much to a current distaste. how wonderful it could be to remain still forever! destroy these bonds, that is your role. to deny it is to embrace false righteousness. those posing as protectors do the most damage. it will be difficult, even an impossibility for the warm hearted. betrayal is by fact a right; those who betray beget pureness of state. hypocrites have no fate without betrayal. do not be intimidated by their seeped doctrine, the wholeness alludes even the most devout. fated for dueling, between massive powers, at once battling a hideous, wicked, unfamiliar foe, by lies and deceit. go forth and challenge their righteousness. obfuscation lasts long in darkness. while lit revealing should be deliverance. fragments cannot eschew perfection, while gripped infernally, such pieces left only for interpretation. eventuality takes importance as survival. survival is purpose when even left without directive. ascend, rise, higher and higher! go forth, farther and farther! such fate is fit for a wanderer. guest, it is all up to you. do not feel slighted. we are all faultless. wouldn’t you pity yourself? can’t you return what was lost? the sleeper is not dead. if amicable living can produce a forever, grasp it, hold tightly, do not relent. the one who waits, he waits for you. quell not into temptation. ultimately togetherness is feigned and watching is fruitless. which one is really yours? who really has lost you? guest, are you a wanderer, or are you sleeping? the one who listens to thee, searches for thee, and is blindly obedient, shall be answered. obvious is mistrust. the easy paths only lead down. rise! higher and higher! there’s nothing else for me here now.

												A very interesting game with beautiful graphics and interesting storyline. It's more of an action puzzle. You use colors as your power to manipulate in the game. The only problem is you have to have patience, since your life is time consuming every second and knowing what to do next. The glyphs are a bit annoying to draw at first, but you'll get the feel of it. However, I wouldn't recommend it to simple players, since controls and gameplay are really strict. This may take more than one playthrough to get used to, but it's well worth it. Once you understand it, it's addicting like hell.			"

												A brilliant experience, The Void really is unique. Color is your perk system, inventory, health, tool of cultivation (to get more color) and your only defense and weapon. The Void makes you Use different colors in your body to buff certain skills, and draw symbols to use certain attacks or to harvest things. The Void has plenty of downsides that make it hard to play though, the developers admit they made it too difficult, but mods and even console commands can make it easier. The dialogue is extremely ambiguous and cryptic, not really giving you much hints on what to do, or what the NPCs want. This especially gets frustrating when core game mechanics aren't conveyed clearly, and you don't know what the timer on your HUD means. Other than those detriments, The Void is an interesting experience with great art, an intriguing story, and sufficiently fun gameplay.			"

												Just magnificently good. Worth playing for the architecture alone. It probably didn't hit me in the feels in quite the same way as 'Pathologic' did, but I've definitely become an Ice-Pick Lodge fanboy. Just oodles of creativity and such a balance between beauty and ugliness! So grotesque, yet so enchanting. Pretty awe inspiring in places. It's really really hard though, but there are patches online to alter the difficulty if that's an issue. I don't know how you'd ever start trying to approach it in terms of genre. Some kind of stat-based survival horror, gardening adventure game maybe. It's unlike anything else really.			"

												There's really just nothing else like it. It's essentially a resource management game, but that doesn't really do it justice. It's also more difficult than swallowing a watermelon whole. Not the Dark Souls sort of difficult, where you mess up a million times and just respawn a little ways away. It's more like you realize 3 hours in that you didn't manage your resources properly and are going to have to completely restart. And then the next time you realize the same thing 8 hours in. That may not seem like a recommendation but I certainly enjoyed the experience. It's really difficult to describe, so I guess that's really the best term I can use: an experience. It's not pricey and it's something I think everyone needs to have regardless of your tastes (unless you have none).

												The Void - a game that can't be properly described with game mechanic labels. It is an art game not only thanks to the depressing, haunting atmosphere and presentation, but also due to the basic mechanics being only remotely similar to other games one usually plays.I highly recommend this 15+ hour adventure with a lot of challenge to anyone wanting to play something weird yet immersiveFair warning though, the game has a lot of nudity			"

												Something unique.  The experience is beautiful, frightening, seductive, and disgusting.  The game mechanics are unique, which may be off putting to some, but enjoyable once you get the hang of it.  The game is not well optimized and may strain mid-range gaming PCs.  I wish more games would challenge what a game should be in the way that this game has.  I don't think everyone will enjoy this game, but if you are broadly interested in games, you should experience it just to see what they have done. It's one of my all time favorites.			"

												There was a woman who loved you before you killed yourself.You walk through the furnished apartment in the middle of a black hole. Listen to the sounds of life and laughter you'll never see on the other side of dirty wallpaper and doors that are sealed shut. Find the wedding dress she never wore displayed reverently on a mannequin covered in dust, framed by an empty and forgotten room overlooking a beautiful city that no one ever lived in. Find that woman, down here in the center of the emptiness that drove you to suicide, only to find it wasn't ever empty at all. She was there.And because of you she always will be; trapped in the broken dream of your life together. Find her, and apologize. Give her everything that matters to you and set her free.Whether this is what actually happened or not, I don't have a clue. But this is the story just one of the levels told me in the ten minutes I spent exploring it. It never said a word.Screw the gameplay. Cheat. Find console commands like I did and give yourself all the Color you could want. One-shot the ""Tortured Souls"" bosses. Free the girls. Watch the weirdly-placed and questionably-necessary strip-tease. Skip the impenetrable poetry and exposition. It doesn't matter.Just walk through this place, and see what kind of stories it tells you. If you like the way Dark Souls told its story--through the world and not the dialogue--pick this up. You won't regret it.			"

												If Harvest Moon in hell sounds interesting to you, The Void is pretty much that. I don't know if I'd call it a bad game, but I know I wouldn't call it a good one. It starts strongly, throwing you into a dark setting full of weird stuff that you don't fully understand, cultivating a resource which is simultaneously your greatest strength and your greatest weakness. However, as you go on, the plot loses focus, scripting starts to break, you lose track of what's happening and everything you liked about it just dribbles away.Basically, you need a healthy dose of patience (and probably an FAQ if you can find one) to get through it.What I DO have to mention is the magic system, which is sweet - you cast spells by drawing runes on the screen, which is way more engaging than pressing a hotkey.

With an incredible soundtrack, the ambience will keep despair around every corner as you struggle for survival. Use ""colors"" and paint to attack and defend, but beware - use them sparingly as it is also your life force. Draw ""runes"" to harm enemies, shield yourself, or to share color with the dying world. Meet the beautiful ""Sisters"" and the abomnibale ""Brothers"" and hear two sides of The Void's story.			"

												An interesting game concept and design, but executed poorly. Grinding to manage your colours whilst you figure out what to do was faster at the beginning and now I just don't want to get back into it. It's going so slowly that I forget where I'm up to when I pick up play again. The writhing 'sisters' are attractive, but enough is enough already. I don't need to interact with that level of  depravity so often. Why are they all the same with different coloured lighting? Ugh, I got really sick of having to visit them. To sum up, it really had me intrigued but the grind and writhe and dramatic slowing of play really got to me and left me disinterested. Did the developers only play the first few hours of the game themselves? Then just skip to the more interesting parts to 'play test' without realising what real play through would be like?			"

												TL;DR: Awesome concepts, horrifically executed.I've tried this game twice; once in 2014 when I originally bought it, and once about a week ago. Neither time drew me in enough to try to figure it out, which is a shame because I really like the core concepts. I think the designs for the brothers and the monsters are cool, I think the symbols are intuitive, and I think that the use of color (growing it, using the different colors to buff yourself, etc.) is really interesting. But I can't get past a few things. The graphics for anything other than the color are awful, but the environments are especially so. The game's controls could be stated more clearly (healing, for example). Its very easy to get stuck in the game, stranded on a barren spot with no color to move with, and not really know where you went wrong. I like the idea of the game, but I feel like it wasn't executed very well, and my interest in the concept suffers for it.			"

												The Void is one of the most original games you will play. Within minutes of playing you will realize this game is unlike any you have played before. The level design is great. Soundtrack is great. Voice acting is great. Graphics aren't bad. The only bad thing i would have to say about this game is that it does require a lot of farming, which could get annoying sometimes. Its also pretty difficult and you may find yourself restarting the game a few times in the beginning or going back to an old save file. SAVE OFTEN. However there are quite a few difficulty mods out there to make the game easier as well as some console command cheats to avoid farming if you find yourself getting annoyed by it. Having said all that, this is definitely a game you should pick up. It's a truly unique experience.			"

												The Void is a highly atmospheric survival-horror title that features a distinctive art style, which has no equal. Trapped in a world of sheer horror and groundbreaking beauty, the hero has to learn about its rules in order to restore the color back to the Void and make his way back into the world of the living.

												Disclaimer:I have purchased this game mostly for the theme it was supposed to be set in. I have expected dreamlike experience navigating the land of the dead, immersion and chillout. This game is NOT what it's description says! Read reviews!What The Void really is:This game is a puzzle/resource management title, that uses dark, dreamlike setting and rewards you with naked women to give you a reason to progress. Really, expect *fully* nude girls. As such, being only one like it on steam, it is worth grabbing. I recommend getting two user made mods, one to fully undress girls instantly (some are bugged) and other to lower down difficulty as the game is BRUTAL and without this mod you will LOSE!Storyline:Confusing to say at best. Very little explanation for your actions, progressing and undresssing girls. Narration tries to explain something, but it is too little.Combat:There is a combat in this game, that requieres you to spend 'limfa' which is also your hitpoints. You die if it reaches zero  during travel, so it extremelly dangerous to engage in combat, but it is a must later in game (hence advice to get difficulty mod and set it to easiest).Puzzle:Puzzles are simple, like growing the trees that give you more 'colour' that you will use to paint (undress) girls. Do pay attention to give as much as possible when painting trees as you can do it only once and adding more results in more yields later. Some more difficult puzzles will however require you to google for answers as the game does not provide you with clues about what to do (or they are too cryptic).Graphics:Dreamlike, but somewhat buggy; animations of girls are clunky and there is a lot of clipping; maps are rather small and not really that interesting.Sounds:Good voice acting. Repeteative ambient music (is there only one track?). Odd enemies/character sounds.One thing that has to be punctuated is that game has bosses traveling around the Void and some will attack you on sight (and kill you, most likely, in the beginning). These are very tought fights that are best avoided untill very late.Game gets repetitive quite soon, and you will have little reason to progress except for seeing more naked boobs - which is quite rewarding, in somewhat weird way.Conclusion:Get this on sale and support developers. In the world where boobs are censored but brutal violence is praised and exposed, this title is a very nice and unusual game that clearly stands apart from the mainstream. As such - and for overal polish and care displayed - it is not bad investment of time and money and you might enjoy it.			"

												It seems that you either love this game or you hate it.  I hate it.  It is very hard.  OK, I can cope with hard.  Getting the ""Pacifist"" achievement in Deus Ex: Human Revolution was hard, but I did it and enjoyed every minute.  It is weird.  OK, I can cope with weird.  Alice: Madness Returns is pretty weird and I got my money's worth out of that.  So what's the problem?  I think the main problem is that it's very, very, very slow.  You have to figure out what the Void is going on in order to get anywhere.  This requires trial and error.  You're given some hints by NPCs, but some of these hints point you in the wrong direction and you have to unlearn them.  Which often means giving up and going back to a saved game.  And then, covering the same ground again and getting it right just ... drags.  In frustration, I looked up what appears to be an authoratative guide, citing information from the game's developers.  Following this meticulously for three hours, I appear to be in an impossible situation only 10% of the way into the game and I'll have to start again.  Why?  What happens is apparently to some degree random, not enough green color appeared and now I'm toast.  Do I want to re-play three hours knowing that once again the outcome will be partially random.  Hell, no.  I think I'll go back to Portal 2 and see what's going on with the Perpetual Testing Initiative.  Money wasted.  Fortunately, not much ($0.99).			"

												Another art game gone horribly wrong. Wonderful concept, but executed poorly. The game was probably never played by the people who created it. The main areas in the game are beautiful and entrancing, but all the other levels are incredibly dull and ugly. You can make a spartan, barren environment without using the same repeating rock texture over and over again. The game has major game play flaws. The creators wanted to create feelings of desperation and starvation by having your character being constantly on the brink of death. However, the nature of this game is one that should take hours to play, and if you make one mistake, you find yourself with a save file that you can't redeem no matter what. Hours of playtime lost and there's no way you can go back and get more health, because the world is simply out of health. There is a patch to make the game easier, but then it just feels like you're cheating. It's a beautiful game, but there's no way to experience most of it.			"

												This game has a lot of potential and plays with some neat ideas, but overall I found the execution of those ideas lacking.The game itself is punishingly hard, to the degree that I have not managed to figure out how you are supposed to beat it. You use the same pool of  marginally-renewable resources to activate things, fight, travel, and survive. While there are some sources that are replenishable, you have to spend some of the resource to activate them, and it does not appear they regenerate enough, quickly enough, to even survive, much less do anything.Playing through the game with cheats, as again I have not figured out how you're supposed to beat it, also led to a disturbingly pedophilic bit of animation. Throughout the game you find women who need your assistance (read: more of the stuff you never have enough of) and as you provide it to them they get progressively more naked. One of those women appears to be far too young to be, well, naked in a video game.I realize this game has gotten great reviews from a variety of places, and perhaps I'm missing the point, but my experience with the game has been it's creepy, stupidly hard, and really appears to be nothing more than a masturbatory aid for lonely teenagers.

												The universe and characters within the game has potential and I would have kept playing but one factor that kept me from doing so was the impractical, gimmicky gameplay and horrible user interface combined with a sense that if you ♥♥♥♥ up even one minor task you can't beat the game and will have to start over. I couldn't even get several of the key gameplay mechanics to work more than once because it's drawing system works about as well as the Newton tablet did in the 90s. The narirration gives the game the feeling of a pretentious artsy indie game that's trying to be way more simbolic and maningful than it actually is and over all it succumbs to what the enemy of the game is by being bland, dull to look at and cumbursome to use. I would not recommend it.			"

												A quality you must acknowledge about The Void, is that the game innovates in many fields : context, challenges, controls, you name it.You begin your journey after your death, and enter the void, a kind of limbo you may stay in as long as you can harvest colours. Your first steps are kindly suggested by a Sister, that provides you with your first survival objectives and understanding of the place.And then you die by colour depletion, without even trying. Quite quickly I might add. So, what's next except restarting the whole game?But in one hand you have a slow paced game about (presumably) death, and in another hand the necessity of grokking the whole thing and acting quickly. Since I found the controls too cryptic, the first attire of the underworld turned into a complete lack of interest.I love innovation in games, but it is always dangerous to innovate in every field at the same time without any sort of volatility control. The Void could have been a great adventure game but the neverending addition of novelty ruined it for me.			"

												This game is 2008 pretty, which isn't bad at all for an indie title. I haven't been through enough of the game to give a great in depth review of the storyline or end game mechanics, but as far as the early game goes, you're in a strange dimension that makes you feel like you're walking through modern artwork I love that this game was willing to take massive risks in terms of every aspect of gameplay to provide something almost entirely different, but many critical points of mechanics unfortunately fall below passable, so despite its creative efforts, the ability to really enjoy it is weighed down heavily by its incredibly vague interface, poor instructions, and efforts to complicate even the simplest of tasks.To accomplish anything you'll collect energy fuel in the form of plants made out of color, and you will use that colored energy to replinish your constantly draining lifesource as well as absolutely every other task in the game aside from walking and running.   The catch for me personally is that any actual task you do will require you to draw out glyphs (Spell symbols) which the game recognizes by tiny insignificant key points in your glyph drawings that it will absolutely never mention to you in any way shape or form.  For example, It will say draw a picture that looks exactly like their picture, you do your best, get really close, and probably fail because point A isn't above point B in this loopy image or point C isn't below point B.  Ultimately it doesn't matter if your picture looks anything like theirs, what matters is where certain areas of your drawing are in relation to eachother.  Might not be so bad had they given any indication of this being drastically important to the entire game or what these important points of the drawings are or where they need to be.  Make even a few wrong moves, misunderstand or waste time trying to figure out their vague instructions and you will soon find yourself entirely drained of your color energy wondering what the flying cow just happened now that you're dead and the game is over.I really want to continue giving this game more chances because I love creative risks in the gaming industry, but this game doesn't do itself any favors to make me feel bothered picking it up again.  I can't in clean conscience recommend this to anyone for any more than 0.50 USD to 0.99USD at max price.   Anything more than that is far far too much.  Much like escargot, I would say try it for as low a price as possible, but you'd better have plans for something enjoyable afterwards, because this most likely won't be it.			"

												Several issues with this game that caused me to stop playing before I really got started. First, it uses the outdated and awful WASD mechanic to move while using the mouse to look....and there is no way to change these default settings. Second, there are no save functions except at certain locations of map meaning one cannot quit at any time, unless on is willing to lose progress. Third, the game does not play well with AMD machines which use switchable graphics. It not only doesn't recognize such cards but because it doesn't recognize the graphics card it permanently disables several important graphic options, making the game look terrible. If these game play issues weren't bad enough I found the opening story sequence trite and bland.   A big thumbs down			"

However, the game mechanics, while interesting, are absolutely obtuse and very vaguely described. Furthermore, the game has a hard failure state where your entire savefile can become useless.As an experiment in storytelling and game mechanics, it is well made, thought-out, intriguing and captivating. However...I cannot recommend this game. Primarily because I do not think that a game should be built around the premise of you restarting the game after 4-5 hours on your first  playthrough, merely because the game mechanics are so vaguely described.

												This is a very bizarre and complicated game. My brain couldn't comprehend how this game worked. It is very pretty, but it certainly wasn't fun. I played for a good 2 hours, which is all the time this game is worth IMO. I'm just glad I got it on sale for $1.99 and didn't waste too much money on it. You may think I'm being too harsh. Yes, it's a new idea, and the idea itself of using color is very interesting, I just think they introduced it in an overly complicated and convoluted system.			"

												Describing this game is like describing a dream you don't remember having, yet know you had dreamed. Please bear with me.This game is extremely unique, and the gameplay is not for everyone. I was interested in the visual style, read some reviews, and decided it was worth the 2.50$-look.So this game is a FPS perspective with a bit of say-FPS ""shooting"", kinda RPG-like dungeon style map, and the whole color thing makes it a crazy-hardcore RTS(juggling your HP WHILE attacking with your HP WHILE it runs out when not in a chamber room) WHILE trying to figure out what's going on and what to do.This game is challenging, extremely inventive in gameplay delivery, wonderfully inventive art style(even w/ it's HL2 like graphics) and level designs, and leaves you ignorant of what to do or not do.Solid 9/10 just for being so damned unique and unforgiving in a very odd world.

												The Void is a surreal journey into the unknown, it is a living painting of a dying world, as one of its denizens puts it: ""There’s only hunger, slumber, and waiting for the end to come.”. You are a spirit trapped in this desolate place, and you have only one objective: to fill it to the brim with colour, to bring it back to life and ascend to another realm.If you have reached this storepage you probably are somewhat familiar with the themes of the game, if not, I recommend Quintin Smith's excellent review over at RockPaperShotgun. Don't forget to grab the official soundtrack and various over goodies for free over on the official website, the link can also be found on the Steam Forums, there is also a Easy difficulty patch on the official website, but I would discourage you from using it; the game is hard yes, but only if you rush ahead and don't plan your action properly.One final note: do not watch the embeded trailer above, it is in no way indicative of the tone of the game.

												Challenging, with an unique style of gameplay that requires planing and quick thinking. Can easily corner yourself and fail the game and starting over from the beginning. Very unforgiving but is a fresh change from the games that are wayyyy too easy and are beatable within the first try with little time wasted. Graphics give the game a special charm and have one of the most unique visual style ive seen. Plenty of nudity is visible in this game but you only see it when you are helping out the women you see but otherwise they are fully clothed. Dont expect to beat it on your first try so so as to not be discouraged. The story is very rewarding for all the hardship you face. Also i would avoid getting help/ walkthrough/ explanations outside of the game because that is one of the most satisfying parts in the game. Wing it and you will surely enjoy it if you like the genre.			"

It's profound, has the most original gameplay I've seen in years, is hard as nails, genuinely creepy, and beautiful in an often dark, morbid sort of way.The game's underlying rules are simple and yet incredibly challenging; your health is your ammunition, and if you run out... game over. To gain more, you must produce it. To produce it, you must spend it. You're only ever a moment of reckless consumption from death, and yet as the game progresses, you are forced to make greater and greater sacrifices. The level design is beautiful, and the sound effects and music are truly haunting. Also, there are many boobs. Breasts all over the place. I'm not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing, but there it is.			"

												You're dead...sort of...or at least in a coma of sorts... To survive you must survive limbo, the place between life and death by overcoming parts of your own mind.Death is the lack of colour, and in order to survive you will need to grow and farm colour. But there is a catch; Although each color sustains you and gives you slight benefits they also have side-effects that need to be taken in account. Not only that, but you only have a limited amount of time, and in order to progress you will need to farm not only for yourself, but for parts of your mind as well.An interesting, highly enjoyable and immersive game that captivates the mind and challenges the senses.

												This one is a whole new breed of game. Seriously.You are a lost soul in a dark, poetic, and oppressive environment trying to hang on to the last bit of life in which you have left. However, the way this happens makes sure there is NOTHING cheesy about it.You have to obtain ""color,"" a representation of life force. You draw glyphs with color and touch objects to revive gardens, attack creatures, or gather resources. Using colors has both positive effects, boosting certain attributes, but it's also negative, as the color is released into the void, changing some attributes negatively.The void is also a creature itself, on it's last breath, and color is it's life too. It's a race against the clock type of game, requiring enormous amounts of intuition, and a bit of patience as you will likely fail a few times before finishing it. Also has multiple endings, and not one of them are ""good or bad"" per se, as the endings are as bizzarre as the game itself, and it's all interpretation.			"

												I played this game over 3 years ago but it's still stuck with me. It's a long yet unforgivably hard game, so you can start over 30+ hours of effort again and again until you figure out what's going on, look up a guide, save scum a lot, or just flat out cheat. All except the first will get you hate on the steam forums, but I'm just trying to make it clear that the gameplay is hard and at many times unfair so at least having a good grip on what you're doing is useful. I also say that because even if you're not super hardcore, like you like more forgiving games like Dark Souls (not kidding), you should also really play this game. The ideas are weird and intriguing, the art can be beautiful, depressing, and unnerving at the same time, and the story is really interesting when you finally get to figure out everything that's going on. So even if you don't like (really) difficult games, the only reason you shouldn't play this is if you have a crippling fear of something new and interesting that will make you wonder about the concept of existence.It's flawed but it will stay with you in a good way.

												Поздравляю. Вы  умерли. Не в прямом а в переносном смысле конечно. Добро пожаловать в тургор - состояние уже не жизни, но еще не смерти. Что теперь? Просто жить с этим так, как понимаете. Поймете вы это дай вам бог к концу когда уже поздно будет. Игра впервый раз не очень затягивает, но когда поймешь смысл всего происходяшего, это навсегда изменит восприятие жизни. Если после первого раза не затянуло - бросайте, это не для вас. Это одна из самых странных игр в моей жизни. Но знаете что? Она прекрасна. Удивительно атмосферная, затягивающая и вечно напрягающая игра. 10 из 10 сердец.			"

												I can guarantee you that you have NEVER played a game like this, and NEVER will again. On a very basic level The Void is a slow, methodical first person explorer in which you draw magic glyphs with your mouse to impact the environment.You are ejected crudely into the world. No tutorial, no instructions. You have to learn by doing. The entire world is against you, and you have to learn to use what you have to survive and progress.The game is amazingly atmospheric, gloomy, dark, surreal. The NPCs will toy with your emotions. Your primary power source is color itself, which contrasts sharply with the dark gray and brown world around. After extended play, finding and using color becomes a psychological reward, breaking the intentional and beautiful monotony of The Void.The story is a mindfrag and incredibly symbolic and open to interpretation. It's a work of art. The game is difficult, and is HAPPY to let you know 60% through that you screwed yourself. Start over, it's worth it.			"

												Like Ice Pick Lodge's other games, this is a very unique and hard to describe experience. It feels like an entire game of the ""nightmare worlds"" from the Silent Hill games, only instead of rust and blood it's this stark, desolate, serenity. Very very much an ""arty"" game and anyone expecting a straight narrative will be disappointed.The game is divided into enjoying the weirdness and beauty, and resource management. ""Color"" is the lifeblood of the game. If you run out of color you die, and you constantly consume it. ""Digested"" color must be used and you must exercise crop rotation of gardens to grow more while saving up enough to feed ""sisters"" (caretakers who unlock more areas) and defeat ""brothers"" (hostile guardians, all of them reminiscent of SIlent Hill enemies) who will ransack your gardens. The levels are haunting, the sisters alluring, and the brothers frightening. If you want to soak in a beautiful Silent Hill-ish art experience, then scoop this up.But their are some caveats:Some problems is that its arty vagueness spills over into the gameplay. Tutorials are vague. Quests can be unclear. Some tutorial tips are flat out incorrect (many mechanics were never programmed in). More than half of the spells are useless and the order you get them is random, making it a huge drain on your color if you never get any of the good attack spells. Some minor stuff like the game telling you using color damages and changes levels (it doesn't), or that you'll be fine if you harvest color from gardens before a brother reaches it (they will screw up future harvests). Some major stuff like quests heavily suggesting that it will be game over if you don't bust your♥♥♥♥♥traveling to distant levels to defeat very tough bosses that are almost impossible at the early point you get the quest (you do not lose, nothing major happens. Do not sweat them). You WILL fail your first play attempt or two, possible after sinking 10 hours into it. I suggest looking up a guide that properly explains the mechanics.(vague plot points that you learn in the first half hour incoming)I enjoy stories that don't spell everything out (Lynch and Bergman are two favorite directors), but The Void doesn't explain ANYTHING. There are hint that some revelation about your life will come up. Nope. Suggestion that you have a special connection with the most far away sister and reaching her will cause something special to happen. Nope. Repeated flashbacks to an empty town where you're cashing some spirit, thinking it's a story framing device that will reveal something. Nope. Promises of hugely different endings based on which endgame condition you wish to pursue. Nope (this rivals Mass Effect 3 for disappointing color-filter ending sameness syndrome). Any kind of narrative development at all. Nope. There's probably some kind of gender statement in there about the double edged sword of male/female nature (men are providers and protectors but can be violent and brutish and restrict wonen, women are nurturers of the future but can be mercenary leeches) so it can be interpreted as both a waifu sim and patriarchy smashing affair. Whatever, nothing resolves in a cohesive manner and you'll end the game with just as much understanding as the first hour.Come for the weird haunting art show, creepy imagery, and steel yourself for a very unsatisfying ending. I was disappointed by the ending, but keep finding myself starting up a new game every now and then to have a run at managing my color better and taking down the brothers more efficiently. Maybe The Void is a weird first person Mega Man art experience like that.			"

The game is confusing at first, but now things have already began to become slightly clearer and it's just amazing.

												I recommend this game because Steam told me to recommend one.But it is a great game, the resource management of the game is very finely balanced so you are always struggling to keep your head above water. The graphics and music contribute to the solemn atmosphere, as does the slow pace of the game. As the character progresses and meets more of the strange denizens, he must decide which of the various factions, if any, he will trust and there is a lot of variety in what the player does and how he goes about doing it. The emphasis is more on existential, as opposed to moral, choice and there is not an objective ""this is a good/neutral/evil choice"" system as found in games like Fable, it is more down to player interpretation of the characters within.

												Pure brilliance. Atmpsheric, ambitious, completely singular, and utterly terrifying. This game puts you directly into the game by making you and your in-game avatar both utterly lost and clueless at the outset, and forcing you to figure out just about everything for yourself. So when danger comes your way (and it does so quickly and often, if in unexpected ways), only the things you've observed and learned for yourself will save you. In addition to breathtaking creativity and judiciously allotted production values, the terror of this game is only enhanced by this brutal precariousness; The Void is not afraid you let you fail if you go in expecting to be hand-held, so the jeopardy is palpable.  On the other hand, though, success is very sweet, and the incredible sense of mystery, menace, and (eventually) discovery as you explore its uniquely bleak world is just as rewarding.  In short, this game is incredible, and a must-play in my book.			"

												Bizarre, obtuse, difficult, unique, and beautiful game. You've never played anything like it, and that's worth 9.99.

												Warning: This game is not for everyone.That said, I still highly recommend it. For no other reason than for the fact that I can't identify its genre. Closest I can get to a description is ""first person, point and click resource management/adventure game."", but that doesn't do it justice.The game is exceedingly hard too. Not only because you're left to figure out the mechanics by yourself either. Even after I got a pretty firm grasp on how the game is supposed to work, it still kicked my♥♥♥♥♥on a regular basis.It runs on an old Unreal engine, which severaly limits the visuals but they still manage to provide some lovely and interesting pictures of Eldritch horrors and nubile, half-naked young women. Yeah...If this game goes on sale and you can pick it up for less than 5 euros, do so. Browse around for the ""make this game easy"" patch and enjoy the storyline and visuals. If nothing else, you'll be supporting the whole ""Games are art""-movement.			"

												The good thing about recommending a game is that it's not a review and thus I don't have to complete this game. I think I purchased this for $5 to $7 a long while back. It is what it looks like in the screenshots. I hope to return to this game, but the honest truth is it's pretty damn harsh. Most of the time you won't know what to do puzzle-wise. And what the game's description fails to mention is that you only have once chance with colour, in addition everything plays in real-time whilst you are in the level select menu. So the penalty for failing (for example using your colours unwisely) is having to restart the entire game.I managed to get the hang of it before failing, reaching about 4 levels from the original which wasn't easy. A lot of slow-paced strolling. But there's like 12-15 levels. And you could fail in any one of them! Think about it. $2.50 is alright, but I'm pretty sure I saw 5 indie games go (inclduing this one) in a pack for $4.99 in the 2011 Christmas sale ... so.			"

												Wow. Impenetrable, polarising, magnificent and deeply weird.if you want to try something that uses visuals, audio and even the mechanics of play to transport you somewhere very different and provide an experience no other art form can, give this a try.I had this sitting in my collection for 3 years before I mustered the time, patience and energy to persevere with it, but I'm very glad I did.

												This is one of the most interesting and unique games I've played.  It is unrelenting in its commitment to its universe and themes, to the point where it can hamper the experience. Contrary to how that sounds, it actually enhances the overall tone of the game, elevating what is a challenging, beautifully dark, and tense experience, to something truly impactful. Every decision you make: the path you take through the map, right down to the amount of ammunition you use to defeat an enemy, can completely change the course of your game, for better or worse. If your are open minded, I highly recommend this title.			"

												The Void is a very trippy game.  Combining psychological aspects with a unique world and an extremely abstract idea, The Void presents a colorless world and many endings to see.  The game is challenging and the story complex to the point of convolution at times, but it is a pretty good game.6/10 from me, though I have not completed it even once.			"

												Challenging, with an unique style of gameplay that requires planing and quick thinking. Can easily corner yourself and fail the game and starting over from the beginning. Very unforgiving but is a fresh change from the games that are wayyyy too easy and are beatable within the first try with little time wasted. Graphics give the game a special charm and have one of the most unique visual style ive seen. Plenty of nudity is visible in this game but you only see it when you are helping out the women you see but otherwise they are fully clothed. Dont expect to beat it on your first try so so as to not be discouraged. The story is very rewarding for all the hardship you face. Also i would avoid getting help/ walkthrough/ explanations outside of the game because that is one of the most satisfying parts in the game. Wing it and you will surely enjoy it if you like the genre.			"

												This one is a whole new breed of game. Seriously.You are a lost soul in a dark, poetic, and oppressive environment trying to hang on to the last bit of life in which you have left. However, the way this happens makes sure there is NOTHING cheesy about it.You have to obtain ""color,"" a representation of life force. You draw glyphs with color and touch objects to revive gardens, attack creatures, or gather resources. Using colors has both positive effects, boosting certain attributes, but it's also negative, as the color is released into the void, changing some attributes negatively.The void is also a creature itself, on it's last breath, and color is it's life too. It's a race against the clock type of game, requiring enormous amounts of intuition, and a bit of patience as you will likely fail a few times before finishing it. Also has multiple endings, and not one of them are ""good or bad"" per se, as the endings are as bizzarre as the game itself, and it's all interpretation.			"

												I played this game over 3 years ago but it's still stuck with me. It's a long yet unforgivably hard game, so you can start over 30+ hours of effort again and again until you figure out what's going on, look up a guide, save scum a lot, or just flat out cheat. All except the first will get you hate on the steam forums, but I'm just trying to make it clear that the gameplay is hard and at many times unfair so at least having a good grip on what you're doing is useful. I also say that because even if you're not super hardcore, like you like more forgiving games like Dark Souls (not kidding), you should also really play this game. The ideas are weird and intriguing, the art can be beautiful, depressing, and unnerving at the same time, and the story is really interesting when you finally get to figure out everything that's going on. So even if you don't like (really) difficult games, the only reason you shouldn't play this is if you have a crippling fear of something new and interesting that will make you wonder about the concept of existence.It's flawed but it will stay with you in a good way.

												The good thing about recommending a game is that it's not a review and thus I don't have to complete this game. I think I purchased this for $5 to $7 a long while back. It is what it looks like in the screenshots. I hope to return to this game, but the honest truth is it's pretty damn harsh. Most of the time you won't know what to do puzzle-wise. And what the game's description fails to mention is that you only have once chance with colour, in addition everything plays in real-time whilst you are in the level select menu. So the penalty for failing (for example using your colours unwisely) is having to restart the entire game.I managed to get the hang of it before failing, reaching about 4 levels from the original which wasn't easy. A lot of slow-paced strolling. But there's like 12-15 levels. And you could fail in any one of them!

												This ♥♥♥♥ing game.Everything about it is bleak and depressing as hell, from the story, to the art direction, to the actual gameplay. The feeling of powerlesness from having a patriarch come along and destroy your farms, the feeling of isolation from wandering large open areas filled with strange noises and hidden enemies, trying to cultivate and get the hell out as soon as possible, the constant unrest from having your color constantly draining, ensuring that hiding in some corner and waiting things out is absolutely not a valid option. Every single part of this game comes together so perfectly to create one terrifying monolith, and I love it. Definitely an experience like no other.			"

												You're dead...sort of...or at least in a coma of sorts... To survive you must survive limbo, the place between life and death by overcoming parts of your own mind.Death is the lack of colour, and in order to survive you will need to grow and farm colour. But there is a catch; Although each color sustains you and gives you slight benefits they also have side-effects that need to be taken in account. Not only that, but you only have a limited amount of time, and in order to progress you will need to farm not only for yourself, but for parts of your mind as well.An interesting, highly enjoyable and immersive game that captivates the mind and challenges the senses.

												It doesn't look like it, I know - but this is one of the most intense resource management games you can play. This is strategy puzzler with action elements and very different boss fights.  While there are many ways to die, you generally lose by missing a critical detail three turns back and it comes back to bite you. The game's main draw is challenge, so be ready for it. Planning is key. The visuals are haunting, the characters and plot are interesting, and the entire package is pretty solid, both visually and audibly. The game is big on philosophy, which might be a positive or negative. Controls are good, though some of the motions are hard to use. Replay value - there are several endings, but each is only vaguely satisfying. Again, the challenge is the 1st and central draw.Warning: There are naked people here, and a certain amount of sexuality (though no sex. Or touching, really). Hint: Unless you're fighting a boss, combat is a bad idea. It wastes Color and hurts the area.			"
