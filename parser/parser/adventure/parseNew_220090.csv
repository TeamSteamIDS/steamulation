 Intro - About Find the parts you need for your old airplane for someone to help you get out of debt. This point and click adventure, has comedy and wonderful art and puzzles as you make progress. Play as what I can only assume “Tiki” people or as they call it “Afro-Caribbean twist” and make your way around town collecting things you need to use to get farther a long the story rich campaign. Pros & Cons ++  Pros +Appealing art style+Story Rich+Price (Current $8.99 US)+Fun+Comedy-- Cons -Cutscene sounds did not fit video-Short story - 3 hrs average-Some things you need to do are very random and there is no clue on what to do-Tedious walking-Must be a random clicker / Curious Explorer Personal Opinion I found this game very charming and appealing. I loved the graphics and the art they decided to use and made for a much different feel to the game compared to intensely, high graphics. This was a very good game to just sit down and relax to and enjoy a good story with some great puzzles. The ending left off at a hanger which clearly shows there is going to be a 2nd chapter (There is right now). The puzzles were not to difficult though it can be quite a bit tedious running back and forth if you don’t know exactly what you need to do. Most of the time I was walking every where around town about 3 time for one thing trying to find it. I used the guide for about 3 things to help me get back on track. Final recommendation: I really did enjoy the game play and the cutscenes did not bother me all that bad due to the shortness. Based on story, graphics, controls, art, difficulty in puzzles and the amount of things to do, I rate this game and good 8/10. This was a game that I didn’t want to walk away from. The story was great and the personalities of the characters made me feel connected. I cant wait to play the second one!

												I'll start off by saying that this isn't a bad game by any means. But... I can't recommend it.The first problem is the length. This game is about 2 hours long for the average player. It costs $9. It's a point-and-click adventure with no achievements, so there's no replayability. So... yeah, it's not exactly a lot of bang for your buck.The second problem is the visual design and animation, especially the latter. The backgrounds look good, they're all 2D hand-drawn kind of stuff. The character models look less good, basic 3D models with no texturing whatsoever. But the animations... are just problematic. Bad and kind of unsettling, too. The game's heavily stylzed which helps a little but not enough to make it pleasant to look at.Third, there's almost no plot here. Most of the major plot points that will be relevant in the second game are in the first 15 minutes and the last 5. Beyond that, there's nothing but adventure-gamey puzzles to fill in the time. You don't really even get much world development or insight into important characters - presumably in chapter 2 none of these characters will be relevant besides the few main characters, because of how this game ends. The voice acting is laughably bad, and the audio quality of the voice clips varies too - a few characters used pretty awful recording equipment and you can tell. Bwana, the main character, and the chef on the Yacht are particularly bad for how stereotypical they sound, and both are pretty grating pretty fast. That's a problem when you play as the former. But, no, you want to know what the real nail in the coffin is? They set up this game as having unique themes and atmosphere, and... do *nothing* with it. You explore a dock, a bit of a city, and a boat or two. Those are your locales. You perform pretty standard puzzles in all these areas. About the only thing of thematic relevance is the spice recipe section, and even then it's not that thematic overall. It's just... wasted effort to set up these themes if they're not going to be used.Overall, it's a pretty short and average adventure game that costs too much and does too little to stand out. I can only assume the theme and visual design is there because there'd be nothing to distinguish this game otherwise. Like I said, it's not bad, but neither is it that good.			"

												This was a nice game to play, some really good humour and an interesting storyline - The art style and such are reminiscent of Grim Fandango but with a different cultural background. The voice acting is fairly good, although its thrown off a bit by the poor lip synching.Pros:Good humour reminiscent of Lucasarts adventure gamesInteresting characters and art styleGorgeous and atmospheric sceneryFairly intriguing story line - looking forward to part twoFantastic soundtrackCons:Puzzles are very easy for experienced point n clickersIncredibly short for the cost - short even for an episodeSome half-baked animation work			"

												Small, indie point-and-click game. I'm a huge fan of adventure games and just had to try it.Like all other adventure games, it's too short. But this is shorter than most.It just doesn't feel quite finished yet. Not just due to the ""Chapter One"" status, but many of the events and even main characters are presented without any sort of backstory or explanation.The team obviously spent a lot of time on doing animations and the graphical art is great. The dialogue is humorous and who doesn't like a noir setting?If they patch up some of the plotholes in time for a release of Chapter Two, this could become a great game.			"

												This title really surprised me with how well it was made. I came in having no expectations. I had bought the game as part of a bundle on indiegala, and was only really going to try it out while waiting for another (and much larger in size) game to download, and was frankly blown away right from the start.You start off in dire straights with your electricity having been shut off because you hadn't paid your bills for a while. This means you can't make any money because the pump in your gas station that you own an operate relies on the power to run. However with some cheeky DYI smarts, you're soon back to normal... If normal means no customers, which... it does.Luckily as fate would have it a customer comes by, however she's not looking for a fill up, but rather a strange old book. Bwana (the main character) sees an opportunity to make a buck, and before long we're deep into the story trying to fix up an old plane to finally pay the bills, so that things can return to normality of the easy living life Bwana has been living alongside his brother at the docks. The puzzles you come across are fairly straight forward, and no regular adventure gamer should feel challenged by this, however that's totally acceptable since it's clear that the game is really telling a good story rather than stopping you with frustrating puzzles that has you stuck for hours on end. The main character even ""cheats"" while doing a puzzle proclaiming he hates puzzles himself.The game oozes with charm, and I was unable to put it down until I had finished it. It took me around 2-2½ hours to finish, but what an absolute joy it was. The animations were well done, and the voice overs were very professionally made. One of the best things about the game though I think was the music. It just heightened the experience of the game to a level it would not have been at had they not had such a talented musician in their team.Pros/Cons:+ Voice overs are professional and fit the game+ Music has a nice vibe to them and is filled with passion + Story seems interesting+ Graphics are well done and the animations are fluid and oftentimes funny+ The game just oozes charm and is hard not to like- Puzzles were oftentimes a little too easyI recommend this one to anyone wanting a nice and easy adventure game. I'm off to play the next chapter, which I hope will provide the same level of quality.			"

												With all the positive reviews for this game floating around I feel I need to add my input. In short, if you enjoy P&C Puzzle games, do not buy this game. It's quite difficult to find an aspect of it I like- The puzzles were exceptionally poor, lacking in any kind of imagination or ingenuity (Think generic charity shop puzzle-book puzzles and you won't be far off). Where good Point and Click puzzle games move coherently from one puzzle to the next using logical plot points, it feels that the developers simply add arbitrary problems to form a chain of bad puzzles until it is long and bulked out enough to be called a game. This makes the game more of a chore than an enjoyable experience, as there is little in the way of progression or logic. Also, if you don't do the right action in a given time, the main character will explicitly blurt out the solution, cutting all satisfaction from the puzzle-solving experience.The characters were so one-dimensional it was laughable. Worse, some characters arbitrarily changed their personalities, sometimes hating the main character for no good reason, then in the next moment being overly nice with no explanation. Further, the main character was fundamentally unlikeable (This was not helped by the emotionless mask-like faces the characters have). I also thought the voice acting wasn't up to scratch- is it just me, or does Bwana dip in and out of his accent? The animation was quite poor, and at times environments looked very rushed and unfinished. The lip-sync was dreadful, and ruined any immersion the cut-scenes might provide.I also found the game to be completely humourless. The jokes fell so flat it was more of a cringe-worthy experience than a funny one. The only way to get through this game was to laugh at it rather than with.It was very sad to play this game after seeing comments likening this to greats such as Grim Fandango or Monkey Island (two of my favourite games). It is a husk of a puzzle game, and was genuinely the worst P&C puzzler I have ever played.			"

If you got a weak spot for goofy slapstick comedy you are in for a treat.I totally love the whole Jamaican vibe of the main character, it totally fits the easy going vibe of the game.

												The Journey Down is another adventure game. While there are plenty of these floating around now, and I doubt this one is anywhere close to the top(Deponia probably sits comfortably on that throne), that doesn't mean this one is bad, or not worth playing. I found it to be very amusing, well written, well voiced, and having awkward enough puzzle solutions to be worthy of its genre title. Its only real detriment is itself, and by that I mean it's too short. You won't solve very many puzzles in this game only to be surprised that it's over without much having happened in the plot. This game is only the first in a series of planned episodes, as implied by the title, but I still find myself wishing more happened in this one. I don't know the details behind its development and am not curious enough to dig them out, but I assume the creators did what they could. That said, you should enjoy what you have, support the on going development, and look forward to future episodes.I recommend this game, and will be looking forward to the rest of it. The wacky adventures of ""Bwana"" must go on.			"

												8.7/10 – Journey to the Underworld in This 3-Part Series!This story follows Bwana, and his trusted side-kick Kito. They operate a dilapidated gas station in a Caribbean Port. Life was pretty relaxed and casual until the day they came across the journal; a book that describes the underworld and various information about their lost father. As orphans he had adopted and raised them and then soon after disappeared without a trace.The game has some good graphics and follows your typical point and click template. I felt like the production values were on par with major companies if not exceeding in many areas. My favorite part was the voice acting; the characters had soul and some personality that quickly immerses you in the story. This episode was pretty short at just 3 hours; but it was extremely enjoyable and time flew by! This is one of the best kickstarter games I have played without a doubt! If you don't like point and click games this won't change your mind about the genre or anything.Worth the $9; occasionally you can find this for $3-5 on sale. I will be playing episodes 2-3!

												Almost alright, but all the puzzles are either so blatantly simple or nonsensically obtuse that you will spend most of your time searching areas again and again hoping there is something that has now become interactive to solve a puzzle you had figured out in your head screens earlier.  The hit and miss quality of voice acting and choppy cutscenes combined didn't impress me much either and broke immersion multiple times throughout the short playtime.  It might look a little different, and have decent music, but there are plenty of adventure games from more than a decade ago that have better gameplay.			"

												Thing that enchanted me from the very beginning: lovely sense of humour! If character saying ""There's something special about sticking a cold, wet fish in your pocket"" after putting a fish into your inventory, makes you smile - then that's probably game for you. It's typical oldschool adventure game. You walk around, grab objects and solve puzzles. These are usually simple, yet enjoyable. Some are out of ordinary and make you laugh, some are usual for that type of game. I would say that game is perfect if not that sometimes it's ridiculous, like the moment when I had to find recipe ingredient among the books - how your supposed to figure that out? But it's not very often and if you're stuck, there's a great, detailed guide on steam. Story at first appears to not be anything special but I liked the ending. World is weird but really believable. Voice overs are great, couldn't get enough of listening main character lines, it often wasn't funny by itself - actor made it amusing!tl;dr - That's just wonderful game :)			"

												Fans of Monkey Island rejoice, because there's a new kid on the block.The journey down is chock-full of excellent music and gorgeous art (although the tribal character design creeps some people out). Voice acting is also pretty good. The point and click gameplay is right up there with the classics like Monkey Island and should feel familiar to fans of the genre straight away.Dialogue is great, and there are plenty of puzzles to solve and places to explore, although the story could use a little more fleshing out. Here's hoping for that in Episode 2.Brilliant, very polished game, and highly recommended.			"

												Though the artwork was imaginative, it was not visually appealing. Voice acting was uneven, and the fake ethnic accents were so terrible in certain portions of the game that it stepped into the realm of offensively racist. It tried to be funny but mostly failed, possibly exacerbated by the fact that the protagonist comes off as a lazy, idiotic, morally reprehensible buffoon that is very difficult to like. Puzzles were mostly logical but this game was ridiculously short, and even at the discounted price I got it I would expect it to provide me with more entertainment than a free version of Angry Birds. I did get this as part of a bundle so I can say that Part 2 was better, but still ridiculously short. If I had bought Part 1 by itself I would have saved myself the money on buying the sequel.			"

												The Journey Down Chapter One is about two brothers adopted by a man off the street. They're running the gas charter in the bay and struggling with money. When a woman searching for a book arrives, suddenly, they're seeing ""dollars"".... but did they know that the book owned by their father was in their possession and sparked interest... in a powerful man?The first chapter is set in the bay, where Bwana, your character, is working and living. As he needs to get Lyna across the ocean, he has to fix the airplane he's not flying since he was 12. That's why Bwana is messing with gas cannister, trying to get out of a freezer in a yacht, amazed that he can do a ladder with.... nah I'm not spoiling the puzzles.I enjoyed that point-&-click adventure because of the atmosphere. There is clearly influenced by Afro-Caribbean (as the characters are inspired from African masks but the way they're talking and the music is more from the Caribbean). You ask yourself if Bwana hasn't smoked weed before the beginning of the story but well, he seems more like having a cool personnality. And that, dear gamers, that what I ask also from an adventure game: characters with a grey personnality as they're reflecting what we are: imperfect. Bwana isn't stupid. Some of his remarks show someone aware of his surrounding, feeling down because of his father's disappearance. Kito, his ""street"" brother, is a genius when it comes to engineering, despite his cool attitude. Lyna, well-mannered, stays polite and provides information on what may happen in the background. She's never pressuring the boys, apart when the mean guys arrive. Besides, the fact that the ambiance is also leading to a comedy game is also doing that.The graphics are also good: with scenes and rooms looking like in a comic. The only thing that I had an hard time to get used to is probably the characters design.The music, well, is adapted. I really had the impression that I was in the Caribbean. It's awesome.Apart one or two freezes, the game runs smoothly.I've just a little complaint: the puzzles aren't hard at all, true. But sometimes, it's hard to imagine the solution for some of them. Like for the propeller used as a fan by Bwana. But also, as the puzzles aren't so hard, the game is short. As short as a Hidden Object game can be. A little more of 2 hours. I understand that the rest will follow (second chapter is out). But a little more would have been good too.The Journey Down: Chapter 1 manages to entertain me. I'll play the second chapter very soon and I'll buy that third episode without problems.			"

												Comparing this to Grim Fandango is a heresy! Grim Fandango was outstanding in every way possible when it was made! The Journey Down has a lot of stuff ""borrowed"" from grim fandango and it still feels like a mediocre to say the least adventure game. The only thing that is good in this game is the music! The only way to enjoy this game is to let the intro music play in the background and never starting it.I would support the developers and buy the game even if it was overpriced, if they tried to make something that was the product of hard work, creativity and innovation like grim fandango but instead they made a mediocre adventure game that has nothing new to offer and copies elements of grim fandango in order to touch a bit of it's glory.Why would anyone pay 15€ for two really small chapters of a mediocre adventure game with mediocre puzzles that tries but doesn't succeed to keep up with the grim fandango, if they can buy the grim fandango remastered at the same price?

												This is a hidden gem. If you enjoy old-school style point-and-click inventory-based adventure games, you'll enjoy this game. I was a bit unsure, but the unique setting, the charming characters, and the well designed puzzles made this a real treat. There was only one time that I needed to look online for help, and that was just a case where I thought I'd already tried what the solution to the puzzle was. And there was only one truly out there puzzle with that wacky adventure game logic. The rest were mostly sensible and intuitive, with a few light logic puzzles as well. Something else I really liked about this game is that some items are reused in multiple puzzles, rather than everything being one-and-done. Things that would be considered useful tools are in fact, useful in many situations. Outside of that, the art style and music are both fantastic as well. Be advised, it does end on a cliffhanger, and you'll certainly want to proceed immediately to Chapter Two, which is even better than the first chapter.			"

												This game does not present a lot of challenge, as all the puzzles are pretty easy, and there are a lot of hints in the dialogues.The storyline and the characters are not really the strong points of this game. The voice acting is fine, although not particularly memorable. The music is quite good and reminded me a bit of Grim Fandango.I'd say that the best selling point of The Journey Down is its unique art style inspired by African masks.My verdict is such: I would recommend this game to people who want to get acquainted with old-school adventure genre or to people already familiar with the genre who just want to pass a couple of hours.

												As creepy as the characters look, this felt like playing a game made for kids under 10. Sure the characters' accents are funny and all, but the gameplay is very slow and the announced ""brain-teasing"" isn't there at all unless you consider finding sticks for the ladder in the only cupboard of the room you're stuck in difficult.The acting is really good, but unless your kid is a big fan of creepy looking funny guys with jamaican accents, you're not going to want this.

												Good game, beautiful enviroment. The soundtrack is awesome, each area holds it own track - great mix of jazz-reggae. First point and click i've played before, and i'd definitely recommend it. Won't take long to complete though, between an hour or two.			"

												It is really hard for me to decide weather to recommend this or not, but I'd say that I am rather more inclined towards a negative feedback.Positive side:Very nice artwork, music and atmosphere. This is really what got my my attention. The humor is moderate, couple of laughs here and there, but it gets a bit exagerated at time. Cool in over all. The puzzle are simple and positiverly silly at best but if you just play for entertainment, not taking it too seriously (it's not Myst), you'll have a good time.Negative side:Ok, this is the only negative thing I have to say about chapter one. It was way, WAY, too short. You could probably finish the game in less than 15 min. I just started to warm up and really enjoy the game when the end credits just popped up. Shocking! I just couldn't believe it, I thought it was a prank.. but no, that was it, right to my face! That really killed all the appreciation I had for the concept.The fact is that the chapter one is nothing more than a teaser to get you to buy chapter 2. I bought both anyway simultaniously, but I do not appreciate such manipulation from story tellers, it really left me with a bitter after taste.I haven't played chapter 2 yet, and I am not as enthusiastic as before to start it, as it might be just another teaser... Eventhough I got both of them on sales I still feel like I got a bit ripped of, at least for chapter one. For such a short story it's not even worth 1€. The developers offer a free (low res) version of Ch1 from their site, i'd probably recommend that one instead. I could say at least that for the artwork it could deserve some slack, but I'm still recovering from the shock so, NO!			"

												This game. This game is just brilliant. The art style is so unique I adore it. The voice acting is brilliant. The puzzles are creative and challanging for a first time point and click adventure gamer. The music. Oh god the music. IT IS MAGICAL. The only draws are it is a short chapter but it leaves so many unanswered questions and makes me want to play more. The lip syncing could do with some work. But other than that this is a brilliant game. I would reccomend you pick this up and play it.			"

												I loved this game.  I don't like challenging/frustrating games (I play these to relax) so the easy puzzles were right up my ally.  The music is awesome - jazzy authentic reggae that is tailored for each scene.  The Afro-caribbean vibe was on point.  I felt like the characters were long lost friends and the story was interesting and left me wanting more.   I think it is hilarious that some reviewers found the characters creepy.  I have a mask very similar to Bwana hanging in my living room.  I call him Umbutu.  I paid a pretty penny for him too :) Artistically this game is beautiful and clever and I'm about to purchase part two right now!			"

												Overall, this is a solid P&C Adventure game, with reasonably logical puzzles once you immerse, and no Guide-Dang-It solutions- it's possible to work out all the solutions given the information available in the game.  That said, there was at least one puzzle that refused several plausible solutions in favor of what seems to me to be a less-plausible (though more amusing) one, and several in which I knew the concept of the solution, but there wasn't much of an indication about how to actually _do_ that.  Plus the traditional complex ""solve it because it's there"" puzzle that turns out to massively help your protagonist progress in a somewhat illogical way, but that's so common in the genre that it might actually be considered a lack if it weren't present. :-J There is the usual complete refusal by the protagonist to clean up after themselves- I wish more of these games would let us give people their stuff _back_ once it's not needed any more.  Hopefully, there will be uses for the items still in Bwana's pockets at the end of the chapter, instead of the traditional ""lost everything during the cutscene"" trope.The plot was at once engaging and somewhat frustrating- this reads more as a prologue than a first chapter to me- while there is a lot implied, I don't think any of the questions raised are actually resolved in the course of this game, which makes it feel like more of a very long demo than a short game that can stand on its own.  I have the impression that purchasers of this game will not receive Chapter Two into the bargain, which means I just paid for an interactive teaser for the longer saga.  Well played in the short term, but I don't know how long players will be okay with that tactic, whether it was intentional or not.  Personally, I will probably get the next chapter if it's not too expensive, but if there's not some resolution of at least _some_ questions, I will just wait for spoiler-full walkthroughs to get my fix of the plotline thereafter.  On the other hand, I will be looking for the rest of the story, as this has some very cool plot elements, and definitely a non-carbon-copy setting.  The plot, sadly, comes off (at least with the little you see here) as centering on a fairly standard Evil Conspiracy to keep the rich bad guy  up and the little guy down. I could be more specific, but that much you figure out pretty much in the first cutscene. If I refined it further, there would be actual spoilers involved. Given some of the references, culturally this reads to me as more Jamaican than Black African, but the character design definitely reminds me of Black African masks, nicely rendered, so maybe it's a mixture.  Either way, it's fun and attractively rendered.Overall, I would recommend this if you like the price, but be aware that you are very much getting the beginning of something, not a complete episode in a series.  It's a good start, but you won't leave with any real sense of having made much headway into the real story.			"

												I tried really hard to like this game, and recommend it, but it didn't happen.The Journey Down is a point-and-click adventure game with very unique visual style, above-avarage music, fine voiceacting, and a silly storyline with dumbest puzzles ever imaginable. I usually don't look for difficulty in point-and-click adventure games, since I found story to be the most important thing to consider, but these puzzles are beyond any measurement of difficulty. I mean, Broken Age for example, also had pretty easy puzzles, but they made sense, progressed the story in one way or another, and they required some kind of thinking nonetheless. In The Journey Down, puzzles are like ""There's a thirsty guy over here, there's a glass over there, and there's a water tap right there. Now you click them in order."", and they have no contribution to story whatsoever. By the way, you are a reggie guy who speaks five times slower than an avarage person, reviewing literally each and every action you do. Game consistently tries to be funny, especially with accents, but they are flat-out boring, with nothing happening outside. And that's about it.Although it's not the worst point-and-click adventure game ever, there are so many amazing point-and-click games to be played like Monkey Island series, The Longest Journey series, Syberia series, Discworld, Full Thortle, Broken Sword series, and Broken Age, that The Journey Down is not even a competitor.One last thing, if you can compare this game with Grim Fandango, you are clearly out of your mind.

If you've played Monkey Island you know -exactly- what I mean. The journey is as much fun as the destination, that is.I also have to give some kudos to a team of Scandis being able to pull off a reasonably respectful and funny story set in the Caribbean from the perspective of a POC. Whereas Pendulo Studios --- well, if you've played their games, you also know what I am implying.			"

												Enjoyable game. It has a great art style and I like the Jamaican Accent of the protagonist, I don't think I heard that in a (adventure) game before so it was refreshing and enjoyable. Some of the other voice actors are a little weak though. The Puzzles aren't all that hard but I really don't mind that, in fact I prefer it to a degree as long it's not as stupidly easy as Broken Age was. There's plenty humor and it doesn't stand out above the classics, but it's still enough to be entertained and appreciate it. I did laugh a few times, my favorites were the Crane scene, the Pelikan scene and the Concierge! Of course being episodic there is unfortunately no real closure and it is rather short, so it might not be for everyone except for those of us starved for more adventures and it fulfilled that job for me. I'll have to try the other episodes as they come out to see how the story and gameplay develops, but I'd probably recommend the complete thing too :)			"

												Fun little point-and-click adventure game with a focus on inventory puzzles, meaning it can be played by basically anyone. Even me. There's a nice atmosphere with cartoony (but somewhat realistic) graphics and some weird looking characters. Say what you want, but these characters do stand out. The music fits the game in a wonderful way, thanks to these same characters.The game can be finished in about 3 hours, and, let's face it, since this is episode 1 so there are (most likely) more to come (you have to pay for them individually though).It's reasonably priced anyway so you may want to add this to your collection someday.[Rating: 73/100]			"

Product received for free
An afro-noir point & click adventure saga. Chapter OneSteam Release Date: 2013There is very unknown funny quest with Afro-Caribbean mood. Main Menu met me with an awesome melodie. In that moment I totally decided ""That's Great Game!"" It's hard to identify music style for me. It sounds like reggae was played with Jazz rules. Very charming and delightful game. Graphic style is from timeless category. Just remember ""LucasArts"" classic quests like ""Sam & Max"". Characters style of ""The Journey Down"" reminds me ""Grim Fandango"".

Also: - Very logical puzzles. Basically, If you find something you'll already know where it works.- Best soundtrack ever :) Afro-Caribbean spirit rulez!- Awesome characters. Honestly, some secondary voices sounds like ""Google Translator"" man :)- Heartwarming story.- Cutest & kindest humour.- Just one slightly hard puzzle in ""Chapter One"".

It's ideal choice for one/two-time race. Chapter One will take about 3 hours. It's pretty short game and I like it for that. There isn't long walkings, annoying pixel-hunting and pointless dialogues. And I absolutely love this game! Many ""big"" quests must learn from ""Skygoblin"" game how to develop really interesting games.I strongly recommend ""The Journey Down: Chapter One"" to all quest-crackers and old-school pont'n'click fans.

Short version: 82%The first part of a Rastafari-themed very old-school adventure game miniseries that won’t last long, but it will provide much fun during that short time. If you like the setting or classic style point ‘n’ clicks, then it’ll be right up your alley.Long version:The Journey Down as a point ‘n’ click adventure is as old-school as it can get; this also means that the difficulty only depends on how experienced you are with adventure game logic. If you cannot figure out how to use a piece of cheese to get a ceiling fan, then it will be hard to progress. If you have seen more insane things, then the game will mostly be a quick two-hour story.But what a story! Sure, you cannot explore many places, but as it was shown us by companies like TellTale long ago, great and funny games can be made even with one location. Not to mention that the Caribbean/African/Rastafari mixture of themes and the matching accents create a good atmosphere, the characters are almost offensively stereotypical but funny and interesting, the dialogues are witty and well-written, and the miniature plot is exciting enough to make anyone want to play the second part as soon as possible. Overall it’s an enjoyable, but short first chapter of a promising miniseries.			"

												The Journey Down: Chapter One. This game is one that I see as worth playing. The game shows promise with amazing visuals and a relatively intriguing back story, which makes you wonder what will happen in future parts of the game. Everyone mentions the length of the game being short (which it was), but it seems like most point and click adventures from company's like this have been coming out in parts. While I do not agree with many reviewers that this game is at the Grim Fandango or Monkey Island level, I do think that it holds true to what these classics were all about. Something that Telltale and Doublefine have really fallen off the boat at times.Pros:Visuals and AnimationsMusic (Although a few songs are short and got a little repeatative)Puzzles were not absurd and way out in left fieldNeutral:Length of game (about 2 hours x Three Parts = 6 hours theoretically)Cons:Puzzles were a little conservative and Main character offered too much helpCertain character voice acting seemed off and came off a little annoyingInventory sometimes interfered with arrows for walking to another locationOverall a well developed game for a small studio			"

												Points for the distinctive ethnic aesthetic.  Unfortunately, that's the most positive thing I have to say about this game.  It doesn't deliver on the promised laughs and brain teasing.  The puzzles aren't challenging, but sometimes involve re-searching something that didn't yield anything useful when you first tried it, which is annoying in a point-and-click.  The humor comes entirely from playing up the ethnicity - which really isn't very funny - and the idiocy of the puzzle solutions - which is standard fare in a point-and-click, and the execution here is not noteworthy.  Most of the voice acting is done decently well, but one character in particular sounds a bit like a deteriorated cassette recording, and hearing every other sentence punctuated with 'man' gets old.Now, usually, a point-and-click's saving grace is its story, and I'd like to be able to recommend this one on that basis, but I can't.  It's not that it's bad; it's just that there's not nearly enough of it to render judgment.  The game's only about 2 hours long, and most of that is not spent developing the story.  All that you're getting here is a hook for a story, and it's one that could be good, but isn't especially compelling.  This doesn't feel like chapter 1 of a story so much as a prologue, or maybe a demo for the full game.Granted, the price isn't too steep, and it could be worth getting on sale, but if you're looking for point-and-clicks, I suggest you try Daedalic first.

												This is a competently made game. It has a unique art style in which characters' heads are represented by african masks and the jazz soundtrack is pretty chill. During the cutscenes the animation becomes a bit dodgy and artifacts become visible. Overall, the Journey Down appears to be a labor of love with some decent work put into it.Here's why I'm not going to recommend this game: there is no story unfolding as you play the game nor is there any character development going on. This lead me to feel that I have very little invested in the game. I don't intend on buying the second chapter which may be an improvement on this chapter but chapter one is basically a scavenger hunt. You're asked to find some parts to fix a plane. That's it. Nothing iteresting happens in this chapter.If you don't mind having your game being light in the story department this might entertain you for a couple of hours.			"

												First of all, I must say this is a truly amazing and beautiful game. Lately, I have been playing loads of horror and FPS games like TF2, NMRiH, Half Life 2, EP1 and EP2 etc.. And, To be honest, I was getting tired of playing them. But when I played this game, It Re-Indulged me into the world of gaming, As in this game, You don't have to go along and start killing people/NPCs for no apparent reason. It gave me a good break from all the shooting and made me start to think on how to complete levels, Rather than thinking about how much Life or Ammo I have left. The story is great as well, With alot of suspense, Which makes it even better. I'm just glad I found out about this game right  after  the release of Chapter 2, Or I would have been left in the suspense like everybody else who bought the game as soon as it was released.So Overall, This is a really good game and I highly recommend it to any puzzle lover or a person who has been playing too much FPS lately...

												Diamond in a rough.The Journey Down is truly what I'd call a point-and-click adventure game. Unlike many 'modern' titles offering a lot of meaningless wandering and clicking, this one actually tells a story and does it well while at the same time keeping on a fine edge between being overly easy and stupidly hard and counter intuitive.And let me tell you, I got that noir-ish feeling as soon as I started the game - and it's there alright. It's very similar in atmosphere to noir movies, and, actually, leans a bit towards Grim Fandango (the game). The art style, the music, the humor, the characters and backgrounds all blend together marvelously and produce quite the unique atmosphere and thus the unique game.Chapter Two is already out and I can't wait to see it, since Chapter One actually ends with a cliffhanger a few miles high (and I tell you can take it quite literally too).Do I recommend it? For those who appreciate a good noir movie with a pinch of healthy humor it'll score about 10 out of 10. For others probably around 7 or 8, it depends.			"

												Short & sweet. Has few good puzzles and overall nice script coupled with an awesome art style and voice. Way better than the standards of the bundle it was featured in, can't justify a $8.99 price tag on steam though, $2.49 would have been much better.			"

												Fun little indie point-and-click with a great soundtrack and some funny dialogue set in a nice High-Tech Noir city. But like what the title says it is only the first chapter for now. If you can dismiss a cliffhanger, then this is definitely worth the purchase.There's a free version of this game on the official website. But it's a cut down version though.			"

												Developed by SkyGoblin Studios, the Journey Down: Chapter One creates an urban world where the player takes control of Bwana, a cool, Caribbean ""brudda,"" who works at a gas station on a pier.  The game begins when a young woman comes looking for a mysterious book that Bwana's long-lost adoptive father, Kaonandodo, once possessed.  This is only part one of a game trilogy.Though the game is relatively short (if you speed-run it and skip all the dialogue, you can beat it within half an hour), exploring the game and taking the time to look at each detailed scene will give the player an hour or two worth of time. The art style is immediately reminiscent of Grim Fandango, though with a more African and Caribbean theme.  The characters resemble Moai statues or strunken heads in a pseudo-modern setting.The puzzles are designed simply and the game is short enough that you won't have any problem remembering which character required which item or what item was needed to solve which puzzle.  The puzzles are very much like puzzles in the Monkey Island games, and it's clear the studio used LucasArts adventures as inspiration for style and presentation.  The cast is fully voiced and they will give enough hints to imply what they need.  There might be a time when you find yourself clicking everything on everything to  see what works, but the solutions are logical and with enough thought can be solved without ever needing a walkthrough.Though some reviewers have criticised the voice acting (and at times it isn't perfect), the one character I've seen the most criticism from is the main character, Bwana.  He has a thick, stereo-typical Jamaican accent, and despite the criticism, I find him the most charming and funny character, closely followed by his adoptive brother, Kito.  The wit in the writing stands out with these characters and Bwana's delivery on lines is so funny, though many times the limited animation on his face detracts from the seriousness of certain parts so the character often fails to come across as sympathetic in a few instances.The atmosphere created in the game is stunning.  With very little exposition and establishment of the setting, the player is brought into this cool, dark world run by an evil power company.  The painted backgrounds are gorgeous and accurately represent the urban setting cut off from the high-society.  The tone is eerie, with this goofy character, Bwana, juxtaposed by the governement corruption and dirty-dealings going on within the city.  Characters constantly drop hints about the evil power company, an embargo, and other political and corporate dealings that build up the city as a character in itself.  My favourite scene in the game is when Bwana talks with a man who works a newsstand under a bridge.  The man explains how the train doesn't stop at his location any more. That scene captures the setting completely with the ideas of corruption and not looking out for the little man.  It feels like a real city, even though the game only represents a minute fraction of the whole city.Lastly, the most noticably brilliant part of this game is the music.  It is astounding.  The composer who worked for SkyGoblin sadly passed away during the development of Chapter Two, but his legacy lives on through the game's soundtrack.  The soundtrack is available on BandCamp and I fully suggest getting it for both Chapters One and Two.  The music adds so much depth to the setting, creating the final piece to really put the player in this game's world.  It's memorably catchy, and adds an appropriate amount of melancholy to a generally humourous game.If the current price tag for the game is too much (given you are only getting one chapter), I suggest waiting for a sale (I bought it on sale as a Chapters One and Two Bundle).  However, if it's still too much for you on sale, the developer's website has a free, low-res version which makes the game pixelated, making it look much more like Monkey Island. A lot of love and care and research went into this game and I suggest supporting it.			"

												Πλην ίσως του “Cognition”, δε μπορώ να θυμηθώ άλλο, επεισοδιακής μορφής, adventure game που να αδημονούσα τόσο για την εξέλιξή του, όσο συμβαίνει με το “The Journey Down”. Με εξαιρετικό μουσικό-ηχητικό περιτύλιγμα, αξιολάτρευτους πρωταγωνιστές, ιδιαίτερο τρόπο απόδοσης της εμφάνισης των απανταχού χαρακτήρων, πλήθος γρίφων που συνθέτουν μία συμπαγή, τουλάχιστον 4ωρης διάρκειας, εμπειρία και υπόθεση που φαντάζει ενδιαφέρουσα και διαφορετική των συνηθισμένων, διαθέτει τα όπλα για να εξελιχθεί σ’ ένα κλασσικό παιχνίδι του είδους, με τη ολοκλήρωσή του. This first chapter serves as a truly special start for an episodic adventure game. It has many positive aspects packed together -unique looks, lovable main characters, awesome voice overs, a price that makes it a must buy- and contains a respectful number of puzzles. If some of them were a bit more challenging, its length would easily be extended. In any case, it's an ideal and very promising debut. http://www.ragequit.gr/reviews/item/the-journey-down-chapter-1-pc-review "

												I bought this game cause it says 'Great Soundtrack' and I am a huge fan of games with ""great soundtrack"" so, I thought, I shall give it a try!You know what?Best. Decision. Ever. Made. (that day)TJD is an indie puzzle game with rich story and characters (NOT TO MENTION THE BEAUTIFUL ARTWORKS, GOSH) which builds up your affection towards the game without you even realising it. It's the type when you get so indulged to the game that when it ends, you were like ""whaaaaa-? did i just spent hours on that game without me realising?""Seriously, it's that good.I guess the soundtrack really holds the ace card here cause sometimes when I did something and the music turned into some ~soft jazz~ I just sat there and enjoyed the sudden soothing atmosphere that surrounded my room.I noticed a lot of people complaining about the main character's voice (Bwana) but in my opinion, the way the voice actor narrated Bwana's lines is uniquely beautiful. C'mon, we've had way too much games with an American, British, French or Russian accent. We want something new. WE WANT JAMAICAN!Jokes aside, this game is too much of a masterpiece to be missed. Definitely something worth playing when you want to take a break and chill (while still playing games). Gameplay: 8/10Story: 7/10Music: 10/10Ambience: 10/10P.S.: I have completed both the first and second chapters and is now super thrilled for the upcoming third this August! Go get the first-two before the third releases, hoomans!			"

												It's a short point-and-click adventure game with a unique visual style, chillin' reggae music, and fairly straightforward puzzles. The characters are likable and the story is intriguing. It suffers from the typical adventure game annoyance of very slow character movement, but the areas aren't very big, so it's forgiveable. I only got stuck twice, so it's not terribly difficult, but the puzzles all actually make sense. If you think logically, you should be able to manage everything.The most difficult part is simply finding all the locations. Several of them are not obvious at first, and I spent a lot of time wandering around completey lost as to how to progress until I finally peeked at a walkthrough and saw something like ""go to the area behind the charter."" There were at least three areas I didn't find on my own. So if you get stuck, make sure you've visited everywhere you can reach on the map before worrying that you can't solve the puzzle.I enjoyed this game, and I'm looking forward to chapter two.			"

												Artistically excellent adventure in an unconventional fantasy setting where everybody is a roaring twenties African mask-head!  The puzzles are easy to medium.  The story opens strong, and ends in a big cliffhanger.  It's a little short, though.  Outside of the two main characters, the voice work is pretty hit or miss (sometimes sounds like  ""accommodating"" relatives who want to make sure you know how they really feel about the project).A nice adventure though, and it is totally worth it to rub against episode one's rough edges so that you will be prepared for the second, which is about five times better, and much longer!

												Two unlikely lackadaisical heroes running a dockside gas station wind up knee-deep in conspiracy in The Journey Down: Chapter One. Located in an isolated shipping district, the setting and characters in this game are oozing with Afro-Caribbean soul and it adds a lot to the overall foreign feel of the game. For an indie effort, the graphics are pretty decent although little details like character lip syncing and animation consistency are a bit lacking. Conversely, the voice acting is bad aside from the most important characters (I guess they called in friends/family to do the rest). Puzzles are decent and have just the right level of challenge for a title of this caliber. Taking everything into account, the game is somewhat entertaining albeit short (~2 hours). I would recommend waiting until a sale to pick it up.  "

												The Journey Down is a very fun puzzle-game in the style of Grim Fandango. It has nice humour and really makes the player immerse into the story about the mysterious book and the secrets concerning the underland. Nice graphics are combined with interesting puzzles. The only deficit is that sometimes during the cutscenes there appear to be problems with the synchronisation between video and audio. Nevertheless the game is fun to play and I can only recommend it!			"

												Sorry, but even if I hadn't just finished Grim Fandango Remastered, I can't rate this game higher than 2 out of 5.The fact that GF came out 19 years ago (and obviously was played by the developers of this game) shows how AMAZING the quality of every facet of GF was, especially for it's time.Other than graphic polish, I'm afraid this pales in every single way.I'm giving 2 stars for the art work and the homage to GF but I only got 20 minutes into this before I'd had enough...The dialogue is VERY amateurish, but not as much as the voice acting, and I'm not just talking in comparison to GF: It's really, really 'high school drama class' level.Not that the dialogue they were given is anything of note.The first ""puzzle"", opening the fuse box, cuts to a scene where the back drop shows it sealed and taped up again, even though in the previous scene it was open and the tape was cut.Lack of polish like that is a turn off.And while GF's puzzles were sometimes too obtuse, the hints and overt clues in the dialogue made me feel like I was playing a game aimed at kids.Sorry, but I can't recommend this: The dialogue, which is basically all this game is about: Is the weakest link.

The Good: Absolutely wonderful setting -- character designs based on pan-African sculptures, locations inspired equally by big-city noir and Afro-Caribbean urban life, with a fitting jazzy soundtrack. The world-building is not quite as unique as Grim Fandango, but it comes close. There's definitely a Double Fine or late-period LucasArts vibe to the game, which really appeals to me. I'm invested enough in the story to consider buying Chapter 2 at full price. The Bad: The gameplay is as simplified as point-and-click gets. No SCUMM parsers or clue-matching or The Cave-style special abilities. While this makes it ideal for relative newcomers to the genre, veteran players may find it derivative. Most puzzles feel like variations on time-tested scenarios: getting past the hostile guard animal, tricking the snooty doorman, collecting MacGuffin parts (in this case, restoring a plane).The Ugly: Believe me, I prefer shorter games, but the play time for this felt kinda ridiculous, at just under the 4-hour mark. I'll let it off the hook, since it's meant to be part of an episodic narrative, but it really left me wanting more.			"

Furthermore, a company seems interested in this same book that holds some kind of power. Bwana's tasked with first trying to get his plane to work before flying off so that he might help Lina. First, the atmosphere in this game is one of my favorite components. It's a Jamaican/Carribean theme that's on a water front. It has some nice music playing the back, and I love the accents on the characters. The scenery is really amazing, giving it a bit of a noir feel as well. Characters Bwana and Kito are hilarious in their interactions, especially Bwana who seems hesitent of getting into any trouble. Can't say I blame him....The gameplay is your basic point and click game, with puzzles that you must figure out to progress. This is one of the easier point and click games, as I have not had to look up any walkthroughs to get by. That's not a huge complaint, as it is still mildly challenging. SkyGoblin actually has a free version of this game listed on their website in low res. Although, as they are using kickstarter to assist in continuation of the series I heavily recommend just paying for it. Its a great game, and smaller companies need our help for making awesome games like this. Keep in mind the rest of the series isn't out so if you want to wait just buy the game and wait for the final chapter before playing them all. It might be awhile though. Honestly, I have several games in my inventory I'm waiting for completion so its not a big deal for me because I have plenty of other games to keep me entertained.			"

												I got this game as part of a deal on the Humble Bundle, so I did not pay full price for it. That being said, I really enjoyed this game. It's a point and click story game that reminded me of Pajama Sam and Putt-Putt, just more adult. The story is interesting, the art style pleasing and aesthetic, and the OST is relaxing and enjoyable. I look forward to playing the rest of the games in the series and would recommend that anyone who likes this type of story game give The Journey Down a try!			"

												Simple and enjoyable puzzle solving game with great voice acting and, of course, some reggae background music!Character design is unique. Every person's face looks like some tribal village mask. And it fits well with the overall theme of the game. Puzzle solving is relatively easy and the game's duration is quite short. But naah, it's the unique game experience is what matters.Take a break. Play this kind of game once in awhile. Totally worth your money!			"

6/10 - Worth it...barelyAs a point and click adventure game TJD is nothing special.  It has the same old ""go find this bit to fit in that bobble"" and there are exactly enough interactable objects to accomplish everything. The slow movement speed of Bwana also maeks it frustrating to go from map to map finding things.  The interaction with characters is fun though, and the art style is unique.  I probably will not be buying Chapter Two, but this one was okay.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, but it's just not there. I can forgive the somewhat rough animations and moderately unlikeable main character, but this game just oozes other problems. +Interesting art style-Rather dull point and click puzzles-Awkard writing and voice acting -Clearly a prologue to a larger story, but does very little to entice you into that storySome of the voice acting is ok, but a lot of it sounds like it was recorded using very low quality equipment or is very poorly mixed. Some of the characters are well-acted and memorable (the fisherman sticks out in my mind), but a few characters sound like they're trying to over enunciate or put emphasis on every line, which gets grating. Voice line clarity is all over the place and syncing is frequently off, with entire cutscenes being horrendously desynced. Even if you turn the sound off, the writing is nothing special.This is very clearly a prologue to a larger story, but instead does little to actually draw you into that story. Most of the exposition is in a few large, obvious dumps. We aren't so much shown there's a large conspiracy as we are repeatedly told about it. Character relationships jump all over the place, making it hard to get invested in anyone, and it's very obvious from 15 minutes in that virtually all the characters are simply puzzles that could just as easily be replaced by a pile of items and a note. There are elements of a better story here, but for the most part it's just a game of busy work, which is a shame, since the world does seem interesting.Speaking of puzzles, they're pretty bad, even for a point and click. Virtually all of them are use object on object inventory puzzles that may or may not carry a great deal of logic to them. There's a somewhat interesting if basic phone puzzle early on, but that puzzle style seems to be quietly dropped as soon as you leave the house. It's the ""click around the map until you find an item then click that item on every other item in the world"" school of puzzle design.At exactly one hour in, the game crashed, and I just don't think I'll ever be going back to it. It just did nothing to pull me in.			"

												The Journey Down: Chapter One is a good looking, but terrible to play point  and click adventure. The game's artstyle is appealing and all the backgrounds and characters are well done, but thats about all the praise this game will get. The story itself is bland and the delivery is atrocious, the ""puzzles"" are so easy and unchallenging a monkey could probably do it. Additionally some of the characters  are extremely annoying as they try to play it off as funny (I am not even sure if this game has a target audience based on its subject matter). Now given the above I'd almost be willing to count this as a good feature, the game is also insanely short, you can clear it in literally a couple hours. I do not recommend this game to anyone, there are good point and click adventures out there that offer challenge or a good story, this has neither of the two essential elements.			"

												This feels like a First Game. There's an interesting story to tell, but the devs didn't know how to tell it. The game is mostly point-and-click, with an abundance of underdone ""that option doesn't work"" dialogues. Only played it for an hour or so before the tedium of trying to figure out the game's needs got more annoying than the OK story. Didn't help that there was zero effort made to lip-synch the characters. This might prove entertaining to someone with more patience than I, but I doubt it.			"

												Really good classic-style point'n'click adventure game. This really sums up the gameplay and probably how much depth you can expect if you know some other good classics - good story, it hints very well (or, to be more precise, makes you guess) at what might come in future chapters, characters are well written and well acted, and everything looks really nice.The only cons I could point out are the walking about that becomes tedious after a while when you're trying out solutions, and maybe the price-length ratio. But for the quality it's really not that steep (and you can always wait for a discount if you must).I easily recommend this, and will be playing chapter 2 pretty soon.I say Armando imports anguillas to generate electricity from them. :)			"

												An excellent although short adventure, with it’s unique style and characters as it’s main selling point. The puzzles are mostly logical and you won’t find much frustration during the 2-3 hours it takes to complete. And as those hours are spent in an humorous noir setting with a fantastic jazz and dub soundtrack they will fly past quick. Coming late to the game here has it’s advantages as the third and final episode is now funded, in the making and with a probable release during 2016. That makes it three years between the first and the final episode, all individually funded with kickstarters. You can have whatever opinion about releasing a game in such a manner, but in the end it made this game possible, which adventure game fans should be grateful for.Recommended, if you can hold out for the ending for about a year.

												I though the point and click gameplay was actually good with the puzzles being a good level of difficulty.  My main concern was the annoying voice acting. It was a terrible accent and the main character wouldn't stop talking! Chapter 1 is a lot of story without anything really happening until the end. For example, the main goal of the story is to get your plane working, the story is probably leading up to somehting, but having a game centered around getting your plane working isn't that exciting.  I say skip it, I feel the game is aimes at a younger crowd. 5/10			"

												I've seen a couple reviews here that are negative, all of which are complaining about how little time it takes to beat the game.  I'd say for it's price, and the fact that there are (hopefully) more parts coming, this is a perfect amount of gameplay time.  Yes, it only took me 1.7 hours to beat the game, but I enjoyed the hell out of it.  It's an absolutely beautiful game that has an immersive story with an amazing soundtrack.  It has a little replay value (just goofing around and seeing what you can do that you didn't do before), and so again, for $7 (While I write this review, it's $1.39 due to the holiday sale) this is an absolute steal.

												Journey Down is a throwback to classical Point and click games, but is it an Omage you want to play or just go back to the classics ? In Journey Down you play as Bwana. He and his brother Kito are owners of a Gas Sation in a city called ST.Armando. One day a mysterious woman by the name of Lina comes into the gas station looking for a book. Bwana finds the book and Lina is pleased. We find out the book is about a Place named the Edge and Lina wants to go there. So its up to Bwana to take her there.So how is this game ? Well its a simple point and click game and its great. Graphiclly the art is really good and has a great atmoshpere and the soundtrack is amazing jazz music and it really adds for the atmosphere.The puzzles are pretty simple for the most part and some of them are pretty well thought out. Some of them are quite abnoxious. Overall its a great omage to the old Point and click games and its definatly a good time and i cant wait to see where does the story go after chapter one. If youre a fan of adventure games definatly dont pass this up i give Journey Down a 8/10			"

												Do you enjoy a Jamaican accent (Cool Runnings Mon!)? Does a bluesy, rastafarian, carribean influenced world combined with Grim Fandango aesthetics sound entertaining? Then The Journey Down may just be for you!The Journey Down is quite charming. The characters have silly, fun, eccentric personalities that makes them all feel unique.This is in the style of a classic point and click and puzzles range from easy to medium - I wouldn't describe any of the puzzles in this game as difficult (of course this is all subjective).The areas are quite small and there's only about 3-4 main screens you need to regularly travel between so the movement between areas is relatively quick. I only mention this because some point and clicks are plagued by slow pacing due to slow movement/large areas - but The Journey Down is not haunted by this. Very big plus here.You can pick up this little gem for under 2 bucks - there's also a bundle where you can pick up chapters 1 + 2 for 5.99 on sale. That's more than a deal - that's a steal!Overall, if you are looking for a charming point and click with some fairly casual puzzles (nothing too difficult) then I HIGHLY recommend The Journey Down!The Journey Down takes about 2-3 hours to complete.

												Just finished Chapter One (had to play it again from the beginning because I lost the save file, it didn't get to the cloud) and here is what I think: you can complete it in less than 2 hours and if you really think about it even if the guys behind it put a lot of effort in it, it's not worth the full price.When you get past the ending credits, you unlock some backstage that makes you appreciate it a little bit more, forgiving the not so perfect graphics and the easy (way too easy) puzzles (2 or 3).The story has a lot of potential and made me curious enough to get Chapter Two (didn't play it yet), even thought is african/caribbean culture inspired there's a Grim Fandango vibe to it that I really enjoy. The soundtrack is raggae, love the characters' accents. Also, you don't have to walk miles to get stuff done.I'm running WIN 10 64bit and it never crashed.Buy it for half the price, enjoy it fully.

												I loved the Journey Down! The dialogues are absolutely brilliant, and so are the voice actors and the music. The visuals are colorful, elaborate and catchy, and the 2D environment doesn't feel flat at all. The plot isn't too twisted, this game is more about the puzzles - which don't always have an obvious solution. Some solutions really cracked me. Some were obvious, some I had to get help with. But this game is not just entertaining, it also raises relevant political and soicial issues - like the divided society, privilege, corporate power. Two chapters are out now, and it's up to the third to conclude the story. We'll see how much sense it makes in the end! As of now, I have a lot of questions))			"

The soundtrack mainly bases itself of tropical sounds ranging from Reggae to jazz or a mix of the two. On my playthrough I experienced no bugs so in my experience the game is very polished.

												An ubelievably charming point-and-click adventure game. On its' kickstarter page (for episode 3) it spouts that it's on the same level as classics like Grim Fandango and the Monkey Island series. And, it's actually RIGHT! This game is everything you want from a classic point-and-click adventure game. It has the charm, the comedy, the well written and planned puzzles, and it even pokes some fun at some game cliches of the genre. The characters are very memorable, and the voice actors are absolutely perfect. I never thought I'd find a great point-and-click adventure game like this again, but the team at SkyGoblin have shown us that these games can totally still be made and that they aren't solely a product of their time.FOR THOSE OF YOU WITH LOW END COPUTERS - BUY THIS GAMEI have a laptop with an OKAY graphics card, nothing special. But I also have a desktop computer with a graphics card that can only run basically counter-strike 1.6 or gameboy advance roms (I don't support downloading games illegally or games that you don't already own). The reason I bring this up is because The Journey Down: Chapter One plays better on my desktop computer (which basically has no graphics card) than any other game I've ever played on it before. This game runs incredibly smoothly. Sometimes there's some studdering in the walk animation but I assume that's just the game engine and not a fault of computer hardware, but nothing is game-breaking. I'm extremely happy with my purchase and I wish more games were designed with a wider range of hardware in mind so that they are capable of running as well as The Journey Down does on all my devices. Seriously, keep your eye on SkyGoblin for future games, and support them on Kickstarter (currently episode 3 is on kickstarter as I type this) if you enjoy point-and-click adventures.TLDR:Do you like Lucasarts games, point-and-click adventures, or well written stories and characters? Then you should purchase this game. You won't have any technical problems, you'll just have a smooth ride into the awesome southern African influenced gameplay and story that is The Journey Down.Cheers.			"

												The Journey Down was a lot of fun, and I wasn't expecting that going in. The art style of the game is a bit creepy at first, but it's still beautiful, and the level designs are well done. I really appreciated the setting and character accents, because I don't see a lot of Afro-Caribbean things in video games and this is the first time I've really seen on Steam that embraces that. Depending on how perceptive you are, you can finish this game fairly quickly, but it is worth the money and will probably have you excited for the rest of the series.			"

												This is very much in the vein of traditional point-and-click style games like the Monkey Island series. If you're into the kind of puzzles that you play in games like that (including sometimes frustrating video game logic), you'll find this to be a delightful game. In fact, I think a lot of the puzzles and logical conclusions you have to make to reach solutions in this game are actually much more straightforward (and aha!-inducing) than a lot of the puzzles in traditional point-and-clicks.There's a lot of fun humor in these games, and a lot of moving back and forth between areas and basking in your own cleverness when you've finally solved a puzzle. The art and music style is Afro-Caribbean as others have pointed out, and apparently many of the character profiles are based on African masks, which is pretty neat. It's also cool to have a video game that features neary all African characters--I mean how often do you see that? If all of this sounds good to you, then I totally recommend getting this game.			"

												A goofy yet stylish quality start of a series with a superb soundtrack. The biggest con is that it's excessively short - I'd apparently finished it in less than two hours, stuck on a single puzzle which basically involved using a random item on a random item without any in-game clue. I HAD played it once before, but retained almost no memories of the gameplay - though even with that, I doubt it would've taken me much more than 2 hours overall. Just about every other puzzle in the game is at least vaguely logical if you paid attention and checked everything before, which is definitely a plus. Graphically from great to... hm... and mostly quite stylish, some chuckles here and there... Great soundtrack, good voice-acting (though one character, for some reason, sounds like he's talking through a 2$ microphone, really strange). The lack of body would have me consider a non-recommendation, despite all the obvious positive sides, but together with the excellent Chapter Two, it's a thumbs-up.			"

The Journey Down oozes with style through its beautiful hand-painted backgrounds and pleasant color palette, excellent soundtrack and voice acting, engaging story, hilarious dialogues and original characters, coherent puzzles and just plain brilliant fun. It reminds me about everything that makes point-and-click adventures one of my long-term favorite genres, without any of the annoyances that plagued it along the years.The first chapter offers approximately 2 1/2 hours of entertainment, including a few nicely produced cut-scenes, dialogues and gameplay, and is clearly meant to be followed by the second and upcoming third chapters. In many ways this has all the winning characteristics of a good Monkey Island, especially the humor and overall positively carefree vibe, with all the piratey bits replaced by African-inspired culture set in a more modern setting. Kudos to a very creative team! Looking forward to play the rest of the story.			"

												In short: This game is absolutely awesome. Truely, one of the, if not the best adventure series I ever played, in one line with masterpieces such as Monkey Islands, Grim Fandango, Simon and Sam&Max ... maybe even better than those.Ultra funny, great soundtrack, awesome voices, marvelous graphics and last but also very important a thrilling story. I'm absolutely stunned.The puzzels are very logical, no stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t combinations, maybe sometimes even a little bit to obvious, could be a little trickier sometimes. And just as it ought to be there are plenty of hidden hints in the dialogs. Perfect!The story is the perfect combination of thrilling adventures with enough hilarious dialogs to ease up the excitement so it never gets too tense. Bwana, is cool with any situation.The dialogs are brilliant and the voices of the characters are a true pleasure to listen to, especially of course Bwana and Kito.The whole adventure is supported by an awesome chilling and thrilling soundtrack.All together a true masterpiece. My new favourite adventure.The first part is a little bit short but honestly, time flys when playing such a great adventure. The second part is of perfect length to my taste.			"

												I have to admit, we don't see too much of fantastic point and click games nowadays, but this one turns out to have a great storyline! The Journey Down has a great story and me just playing this game brings back those days when LucasArts released a bunch of point and click games, and this turns out to be amazing. After 2 hours of gameplay, this game turns out to be short, but it's gonna take long to figure out the puzzles that pops out around the storyline though xD. Even though, the first chapter turned out to be very good, i'm totally going to get the second chapter sooner or later.			"

												I dedicate this review to Esky who asked me to tell him what I thought of this and then proceeded to wait patiently for an entire year before I actually played it.This was a fun point and click despite its length but I don't think I'll be getting the other chapters. Not because I dislike it in particular but because I don't see it staying interesting. I'm rather picky when it comes to point and clicks and like them to be very weird and cerebral. For example I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream, Kentucky Route Zero and even Myst.Even though this has a really neat aesthetic including the African masks and great characters (the two main guys remind me of the Jamaican bobsled team, and that's awesome) it's just not bizarre enough for my standards of point and clicks to devote two more chapters of time to it. I just don't think I can give it the attention it deserves. At the end of this I was just reading the subtitles and skipping voiced dialog. Which I feel like an♥♥♥♥♥for doing because the VAs are great.Basically if you like point and clicks with a passion you'll probably like this. The puzzles are just as silly and rewarding to complete as ever. But if you're like me and really need the existential horror or just plain twisted realities to keep yourself invested you might not.			"

												While I enjoyed The Journey Down: Chapter One, I don't think I can recommend this product. Don't get me wrong, the storyline was pretty good, and the graphics were nice, if a bit simplistic. There was humour present, with a slightly dark edge to it, and the puzzles were, well, puzzling at times.Sounds good, doesn't it? It is, but for the price you pay for it, it feels more like a demo than part one of a game.Is it Steamified?Yes and no. There are trading cards to collect from playing through the game, although there are no achievements. Shame. There are several places, even just in the first chapter, that would have lent itself well to an achievement system. Expect to have to play through the game several times to reach the limit on collecting trading cards.This game was reviewed as part of the Steamified Community Reviews program.For similar reviews and great giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com "

												Everyone thinks he is a writer; if you enjoy mediocre writing, or listening to terrible voice acting not matching video - buy this game and enjoy. If you are hoping to click through it and get to actual gameplay, nice graphics, interesting art style and good music - good luck. It's difficult to enjoy all of those things after really disappointing intro and dialogues.P.S. maybe you just need to be high on something to really appreciate this, who knows, haven't tried.			"

												This isn't a great game.The game's art is weird. The backgrounds looks very nice, but the 3D models just look flat, bland and out of place when they are joined with the backgrounds. It kind of feels like a low-budget kids cartoon.The music and voicing is okay, but there are some serious issues with syncing the voicing to the animation at times.The game itself is fairly short and all of the puzzles seem to be the ""run to the other edge of the game area and collect an item"" type. There's not much variety to it.To me it's just a bit boring.Also, the game crashes. There's a fix the creator identified in the forums which involves renaming a file. That shouldn't be necessary for the player to do in order to play the game.			"

												THE JOURNEY DOWN: CHAPTER ONE is an wonderful Point'n'Click Adventure that really feels like an old lucasarts adventure.You play as Bwana a guy who runs a gas station with his friend. A woman comes to the station and wants to find an old book she is looking for. After Bwana and her found the book they have to get the old airplane of the gas station running to fly away with this secret writing. And that's all that awaits you in the first chapter of THE JOURNEY DOWN. Gameplay-wise the game just feels like a wondern lucasarts-adventure. And the humor of the game reminds me even mor of the golden age of Point'n'Click games. The tasks you get seem easy at first but when you try to solve them you figure out that you have to to three other tasks to get back to your main task. And the puzzels in this game are engenius. Complaints?: NOPESo if you like the Point'n'Click genre you have to play this game!			"

												Awesome. Brilliant. Fantastic. All words that describe the wit and dark humour behind this great game. And, I haven't even mentioned the the truly amazing soundtrack yet. I havent played many adventure games at all, so I had some reservations about buying TJD. The trailer got me interested enough to put this into my fav's list, and when it came up in the summer sale I took a chance and bought.TJD is a lighthearted game but with some stunning visuals and fantastic music. The gamplay is no walk over however, or maybe I am just a bad adventure game player but some of the puzzles had me stumped for a while. The story is shaping up nicely and I'm looking forward to chapter 2.Definite BUY.			"

												One of the best point and click adventure games I've ever played. All the puzzles felt logical(or at least intuitive) and you never really found yourself with inane traditional 'board game puzzles' like sliding tiles or similar rubbish.The dialogue is hilarious and the music is pretty nice to listen to. Animation suffers slightly but if you're into adventure games you probably don't care about that.Hard enough to get stuck, but not so hard to the point where it felt like ""How was I suppose to work that out?"" but rather ""I can't beleive I didn't think of that.""

												If you like point and click adventure games and the silliness that the genre sometimes entails, ""The Journey Down: Chapter One"" is certainly worth giving a shot. The game has a really great visual style based on African masks.  It's very reminiscent of Grim Fandango.  The game's first chapter is a solid couple of hours with some good puzzles, and even though the game is fairly linear, you might get stuck a few times trying to find some obscure item hidden in the background.  There's only one or two examples of what I'd call ""pixel hunting"" in this game, and one of them is fairly apparent in the Giant Bomb Quick Look of this title.I don't know if I'd say the game is as funny as the best games of the genre, but it's pan-African-Jamaican style is certainly quite charming.  The world feels very lived in, even though it's only the first chapter of an episodic series.  My main reason for comparing it to Grim Fandango is that there is clearly a larger universe being set up, one far beyond the gas station where you start the game.  The game isn't called ""The Journey Down"" for no reason.I'll let you know now: you can't make the character walk any faster, but it's not really a problem because there are only a few main locations for your character Bwana to go.

												An enjoyable couple of hours to spend if you're looking for something a bit old school. This is a standard point and click indie game in the same mold as Machinarium, just a bit lacking in polish. The backrounds are beautiful but the character models aren't. Voice acting is decent as are the puzzles although very easy. Vague tasks make these sorts of games a headache for me but this didn't have too many moments of those. I got this as a gift but not sure I'd buy it for £5. It's ""bundle game"" worthy and if it's sitting in your libary unfinished, clear it in a few hours, it's worth it (if you like pointing and clicking everywhere).			"

												Thoroughly enjoyed the humour and setting after a few minuites in, the scene setting didn't take long, but as this look and feel is new to me i didn't feel taken by the game from the get go.I am happy i took the time to persist, as short as it was for the game to get good.The music was absolutely phenomnial, i found myself jiving in my chair the entire way through (aside from one or two scenes), i had gotten to listen to the composer before hand and already had a clue on what score this game could provide. To have the backgrounds and scenes change to match each music score, gave me an enjoyable ammount of immersion.The puzzles, whilst not too taxing on the grey matter, were fun to work through. I had myself laughing at outcomes and clicking my fingers in realization as things came together.Only draw back would be, one or two puzzles did feel a little ""Oh i know how this goes"" kind of style.The voice acting was very good, nice mix of accents. But, the only thing that let me down, the entire game, was the levels and quality of a few lines. The audio sounded like it was changed later and added in, or the overal quality was changed mid line. (Don't let that put you off, as it's the only draw back)The art, well it speaks for itself in the screenshots, fantastic all around. Lots of attention to detail for me. Certain parts felt like a throw back to older Adventure PnC games, which gave me great nostalgia.			"

												I thought it was wonderful. Wonderful voice acting with minor quibbles such as audio quality not being standard in parts. Graphics were good, not likely to tax any machine you have as it seems everything is pre-rendered. The humor is good, and it's amusing and cute. The music is very catchy and memorable. Puzzles are easy but there's a little too much backtracking, and it's overall rather short. I wish it was three times as long. It took me about 2 hours.Overall I'm very excited to see what happens to Bwana and Kito, my new Rastafarian buddies.			"

												Awesome. Brilliant. Fantastic. All words that describe the wit and dark humour behind this great game. And, I haven't even mentioned the the truly amazing soundtrack yet. I havent played many adventure games at all, so I had some reservations about buying TJD. The trailer got me interested enough to put this into my fav's list, and when it came up in the summer sale I took a chance and bought.TJD is a lighthearted game but with some stunning visuals and fantastic music. The gamplay is no walk over however, or maybe I am just a bad adventure game player but some of the puzzles had me stumped for a while. The story is shaping up nicely and I'm looking forward to chapter 2.Definite BUY.			"

												The Journey Down (Chapter One) is a short (part of a) game that basically unfolds on a really standard plot in an unusual atmosphere. Think of it this way: the world and the characters do let your imagination think more than what the story and the dialogues will actually do. That said, it's filled with humor and non-sense and puzzles resemble this attitude in a way that most of the time will make things harder, not because you're going through an hard-to-solve puzzle but just because the solution is totally non sense! To be fair, there's a bit of a path, but solving some puzzles will require you to look for the ""hidden object"" around"" or do the last thing you'd think of.Overall the game is fun. But basically there's just a few places you can walk through, and you'll have to go through each one over and over and over again. Really, it's not just about backtracking, it's just that it feels physically cramped to some point Regarding the interaction, you have a decent amount of things you can interact with, but a lot of em will simply be plane objects with no use for either the story or the gameplay.What saves this game in the end is how the hand drawn visuals work with the audio part, to make an atmosphere where the humor can play its own part: it's a fairly decent game you can relax with, chill while listening to the soundtrack and solving these wierd puzzles.

												Journey Down Chapter One seems to be a pretty good game. it has a nice art style, and is one of those games where you click everything to absurdly solve rather difficult problems or puzzles (ex. finding stale breadsticks in order to fix a ladder). You play as Bwana at a rundown gas station that isnt doing too well and the point of what I've played so far is to basically serve a rather suspicious customer named Lina, who wants to go to some mysterious place called the underworld. The game also has some incredibly good music. Overall it's pretty good.But a problem that I have with the game (and this is probably only me) is that the game crashes every 10 or so minutes, and while it does not take long to start and saves very often, it's still pretty annoying. The crashes are a bit odd, as I don't have lag or anything in game. And if it were a problem with the point that my computer counld'nt handle it, I won't be able to do much since the options in the game are pretty bare. But that's just me.			"

												This game is very short.  You'll finish it in two hours.  With three more chapters to come, it's wiser just to wait for them all to be released and eventually bundled at a discount price through Steam.  The game is a competent point-and-click adventure game.  It's whimsical solutions are enjoyable although the puzzles aren't challenging.  The dialogue is grating and some of the voice acting sounds stiff.  The main characters are done well but other characters just come off flat and uninteresting.  In fact, one of the character''s voice sounds like it was recorded through a phone.Unless you're some diehard adventure game fan who has to have every title out there, you're not missing much.			"

												After finishing chapter one, I was reminded so well of what adventure games were back in their golden era. While I haven't started chapter two yet, I can tell you that chapter one has a LOT of great things going for it:- The first thing you'll notice is the music. It's a great soundtrack that fits very well into the atmosphere of the narrative. - The atmosphere is absolutely enchanting. It is a good example of what an awesome ""feel"" for a game can be and at the same time disappointing because you don't get to experience the city itself. The characters are interesting and they also fit really well into the theme and style.- Easy interface. It's an old school point and click adventure so there is minimal hud and it just has what it needs.-One major gripe I have is a lot of the acting. The sailors in particular are especially bad and while it serves its purpose, it's just a testament to how great everything else is and how surprisingly bad some of the acting can be. The main characters do fine, though, so it shouldn't be a deal breaker if you love good adventure games.-The puzzles themselves are great and I they never felt too difficult. I never had to consult a walkthrough so maybe I got lucky because as much as I love the old point and click adventures, they made me feel pretty stupid after finding out how to complete an obscure puzzle. Luckily this didn't give me that feeling and even if you do need a walkthrough, you'll probably facepalm yourself wondering why you didn't think of that instead of, ""How was I supposed to figure that out?!""-I got through the game in a relatively short time and while I enjoyed every bit of it, I did wish it was a bit longer. Like, I said, the atmosphere was great so I could've spent a lot longer there but no game lasts forever. If you're an adventure game fan, this has great atmosphere and puzzles and is worth picking up! 8/10!  "

												6/10 Lively and full of character. Point & Click without madnessThis was actually my first P&C.  I quickly got frustrated and had to immediately pull up a Walkthrough video. You can deal with this one spoiler.  It is the FIRST puzzle!!  It needs to make a slight bit of sense.  Planting dowels maybe, or perhaps a broken broom.  No: breadsticks.  Come on, guys.  You have to try a little bit harder than that.  A bit of humor does not save this impossibly illogical solution.  Why not use pencils or drinking straws?For the rest of the game, most hurdles to continue were mostly obvious.  The fishing pole was used 3 times.  One function was NOT at all an acceptable, rational use.  Nevertheless, you should be able to progress with minimal reference to a Walkthrough.6/10 Finish the entire scenario and this entire Chapter 1 is over.  Not too long or tedious.			"

												Background: Love Point and clicks.. loathe reggae music. Picked up during the steam summer sale for penniesThe Good:* Backdrops are charming and well designed* Distinctive characters * Music and voice acting are good quality* Story is both in turns intriguing and mundaneThe Bad:* Puzzles are simple, boring and sloppy at times* Animations are rather clunky looking and ruin the charm* Found the characters voices distractingly OTT* Script drags and becomes laboured and you just skip it* Lip-sync is often off* Very short Impressions: Was impressed by the initial visuals but rapidly lost interest in the awkward animation, irritating voice acting and rather poor puzzles (one I knew how to solve wouldn't let me until I re-clicked a clue I'd already clicked earlier). Early puzzles are extremely simple.. bordering on not being puzzles at all which I took to mean this was more like an interactive story rather than an adventure. For the sake of more steps or complexity it could have saved the game.Conclusion. I can't condemn a game I didn't enjoy when I know  my irritation at the Caribbean overtones that are turns off's for me will not bother others. As others have noted it was 4 years between chapter 1 & 2 in a proposed series of 4 games.5/10. Solid mechanics and visuals let down by unappealing characters and gameplay. "

												If you grew up on old school adventures such as Monkey Island, Broken Sword, Grim Fandango etc, this game is bound to give you a sense of nostalgia reminiscent of those games. After a series of major disappointments with point & click adventures in the past few years, it feels truly refreshing to find a game with as much soul as The Journey Down. The characters are memorable and relatable, the locations are nice and captivating and the game feels ""just right"". It feels and plays largely like a child of the Monkey Island series and Grim Fandango.On a more technical side, I wish the game supported native 1080p without streching the graphical assets. Gameplay and puzzle-wise, most puzzles are pretty logical and easy to solve. You will rarely have to try the ""combine everything with everything"" approach, that, sadly enough, seems to be extremely prevalent in the genre. Kudos to the devs on that one.Highly recommended.

												The Journey Down: Chapter One is a fantastic, but short, PnC (point & click) adventure game.  The game's content is very similar to Grim Fandango.  While the graphics are cartoonish and flamboyant, the humor and overall vibe is directed towards an adult audience.  The gameplay is not like Grim Fandango, but rather the style of the old school Monkey Island series.  Manipulating inventory is easy, as you just drag an item over to another item, whether it be on the screen or in the inventory.  There aren't any complex inventory combinations, and the puzzles are very intuitive.  The one thing that bothered me about the game is they sometimes drop hints when you are attempting to solve a puzzle.  This might be nice for games where the puzzles are less intuitive, but the puzzles in this game really aren't that hard to begin with.  The other problem I had with the game is how short it is.  I solved the entire game in two hours, which includes me leaving the game open while I made a sandwich.  I thought to myself ""Oh.  It looks like I got about a third of the game done by now!"" only to realize at that point, the entire game is only one chapter...  Oh well.  I still look forward to the next iterations.			"

I found the game really short (3h) :\ Last time i played a point and click was more than a decade ago with freddi the fish (so I may not be familliar with the length of those games)I loved it!			"

												If you want a good, two hour point and click adventure about fixing an airplane, this is hands down the best option on the market.  Art Style is unique and interesting.  The voice acting and dialog are both generally solid, although it sounds like they were not always done with the the best equipment, and audio levels seem to vary oddly.  Story is good so far, there just isn't that much of it.  Puzzles take a bit of thought, but generally aren't too frustrating or obtuse. Part two is purportedly coming out in soon (Summer 2014) interested to see where they go with this.  This scratched my adventure game itch without outstaying it's welcome. 7.3/10			"

												I was pleasntly surprised by The Journey Down: Chapter One, and am really looking forward to Chapter Two. This game was reccommended to me by a friend a while back -- I saw that it was 90% off during the Summer Sale (for $0.69) and decided to give it a try. The game is well-exectued, and delivers about what you would expect from a casual point-and-click adventure. The story is entertaining and straightforward, and the puzzles are well-placed and logical (even somewhat challenging, at points); the story is well-paced, and can be finished in under 2.5 hours. What stood out most about this title was the unique art style, consisting of 3d rendered characters on a 2d hand-drawn background. As a long-time gamer who has rarely seen this concept executed, I was rather impressed by the general mood and depth these environments were able to confer to the overall experience. With that said, this game is not for everyone, and especially not for those gamers that demand a constantly active and physically engaging experience. However, if you have fond memories of a time when point-and-click games were genuinely appreciated, especially titles like Grim Fandango, The Neverhood, The Secret of Monkey Island, etc., do yourself a favor and check this game out.

												A delightful point and click game, with very high production values, logical, fun puzzles, and a quietly awesome soundtrack. The story seems good too, but it's a little hard to judge, seeing as this is only the first chapter. What I do know is that several of the characters have already endeared themselves to me. Bwana himself, Mama Makena, and Makote, even the Dockmaster, who only has a couple of lines. I'm usually wary of episodic games, never knowing how much you'll have to pay in the end to get a complete story, or if you'll EVER get the whole story (I'm looking at you Insecticide *sob*), but I'm going to shell out the 8 Euro for chapter two right now. At 70 cents chapter one was a steal.			"

												The Journey Down (Chapter One) is a short (part of a) game that basically unfolds on a really standard plot in an unusual atmosphere. Think of it this way: the world and the characters do let your imagination think more than what the story and the dialogues will actually do. That said, it's filled with humor and non-sense and puzzles resemble this attitude in a way that most of the time will make things harder, not because you're going through an hard-to-solve puzzle but just because the solution is totally non sense! To be fair, there's a bit of a path, but solving some puzzles will require you to look for the ""hidden object"" around"" or do the last thing you'd think of.Overall the game is fun. But basically there's just a few places you can walk through, and you'll have to go through each one over and over and over again. Really, it's not just about backtracking, it's just that it feels physically cramped to some point Regarding the interaction, you have a decent amount of things you can interact with, but a lot of em will simply be plane objects with no use for either the story or the gameplay.What saves this game in the end is how the hand drawn visuals work with the audio part, to make an atmosphere where the humor can play its own part: it's a fairly decent game you can relax with, chill while listening to the soundtrack and solving these wierd puzzles.

Some of the lip syncing is a little off and the puzzles are mediocre in difficulty at best. However the game art is beautiful, the characters and jokes are very enjoyable.

												If you grew up on old school adventures such as Monkey Island, Broken Sword, Grim Fandango etc, this game is bound to give you a sense of nostalgia reminiscent of those games. After a series of major disappointments with point & click adventures in the past few years, it feels truly refreshing to find a game with as much soul as The Journey Down. The characters are memorable and relatable, the locations are nice and captivating and the game feels ""just right"". It feels and plays largely like a child of the Monkey Island series and Grim Fandango.On a more technical side, I wish the game supported native 1080p without streching the graphical assets. Gameplay and puzzle-wise, most puzzles are pretty logical and easy to solve. You will rarely have to try the ""combine everything with everything"" approach, that, sadly enough, seems to be extremely prevalent in the genre. Kudos to the devs on that one.Highly recommended.

												A mixed bag. It really comes down to what you are looking for. Probably best suited for a younger audience. Pick up on a sale or skip.Length - about 2 hours without replayability.One of the strongest points in my opinion is the setting and the plot. The characters are human enough to be relatable, but alien enough to keep it fresh and interesting. Everything has some style to it.The voice acting for the main characters Bwana and Kito is done pretty well. It's got that stereotypical Jamaican thing going for it, but it's done pretty well. For most supporting characters it goes only downwards tho - in some places the dialouges have different audio filters applied on the same characters for no reason but oversight, as well as random volume fluctuations. The biggest problem of the game however is its rather unimaginative gameplay. The puzzles are not hard to figure out at all and the items are fairly easy to find. There is no replay value, as all puzzles are always the same and there are no optional locations or choices to be made. Most of the conversations are just made to further progress in the game and the ones which are not, don't add anything to the game aside from random tidbits of information of the world.			"

												Background: Love Point and clicks.. loathe reggae music. Picked up during the steam summer sale for penniesThe Good:* Backdrops are charming and well designed* Distinctive characters * Music and voice acting are good quality* Story is both in turns intriguing and mundaneThe Bad:* Puzzles are simple, boring and sloppy at times* Animations are rather clunky looking and ruin the charm* Found the characters voices distractingly OTT* Script drags and becomes laboured and you just skip it* Lip-sync is often off* Very short Impressions: Was impressed by the initial visuals but rapidly lost interest in the awkward animation, irritating voice acting and rather poor puzzles (one I knew how to solve wouldn't let me until I re-clicked a clue I'd already clicked earlier). Early puzzles are extremely simple.. bordering on not being puzzles at all which I took to mean this was more like an interactive story rather than an adventure. For the sake of more steps or complexity it could have saved the game.Conclusion. I can't condemn a game I didn't enjoy when I know  my irritation at the Caribbean overtones that are turns off's for me will not bother others. As others have noted it was 4 years between chapter 1 & 2 in a proposed series of 4 games.5/10. Solid mechanics and visuals let down by unappealing characters and gameplay. "

												In the Journey Down, by SkyGoblin, you will take on the roll of Bwana, a pilot who is scared of heights, and who runs a fuel station on the outskirts of the town St. Armando. He lives with his best friend Kito. It doesn't take long for something mysterious to happen as a professor's assistant shows up looking for an old book. This is where the adventure really starts to begin, and its going to be up to you to escape and save everyone.Graphically I can definitely feel the African tribal theme showing up in all the character designs. All faces seemed to be modeled after tribal masks, and definitely add something extra to the personalities of the characters that you will encounter. There's also the different area designs, you will of course spend the vast majority of your time around the fuel station, but you will also get to see a cafe, a yacht, and a railway stop. All of these areas have this painted feel to them, but in a crisp way that draws the player into the scenes. As this is a point click and adventure, you will notice that sometimes the items you get to interact with are very obviously placed, and other times you will have to pay attention to your surrounds to find what might be hiding behind a door, on a bookshelf, and a wall, and more.The music and the voice acting in the game kind of gives me a Rastafarian vibe, with a little twist of African tribal feel. I do think that there are some characters that might be laying it on a bit thick, but for the most part all the voices fit their parts for the game.The controls in the game are as you might imagine them to do, you are going to move your mouse around the screen, seeing what or who you can interact with, and you are going to click to interact with whatever is currently selected.This was one of those games that seemed interesting, and that I just had to at least try out, and I'm glad I did. Though the theme and feel of the game was a bit different than I have played, the storyline was definitely something that the further I got in, the more I wanted to know more. That being said there was quite a bit of distraction, as point and clicks usually cause, so that you had to do some puzzle solving, or item combining to complete a goal, or get past an obstacle. I was impressed with the amount of completely different characters you had to deal with, and some of the puzzles that I had to take on. There are some put this here and that will solve the problem puzzles, and there's also those puzzles that you will have to find the solution elsewhere to solve. Now this is only the first chapter, and I have to say that after playing this, and recording the playthrough for it, I am dying to get my hands on chapter 2. Thankfully that chapter is already out, I just hope that SkyGoblin can keep them coming. So if you are looking for a point and click adventure featuring a cast of characters that sort of fit the mold, and at the same time don't, you might want to check out this game. What I mean by that is that even though you are playing the part of the reluctant hero, this hero is probably a little different than you are used to, be it in the humor of the game, the appearance, or just the way that he interacts. This is definitely a game to at least try out, I know that there's a low-res free version of first chapter, but I would recommend throwing down the money to get the high-res, it looks really good. So with that I'm going to give this first chapter (which is about 2 hours long) a 9.0 out of 10.			"

												At the start the game seemed to be really boring and annoying. Most because of the really long dealogues. It is not the easiest game, sometimes you will be running around the places and doing 10 times the same thing until you will realise you need something else, it doesn't really have continuesly going moves or so, you can go to do many things at once. It was pretty easy to lost in the first minutes of gameplay. Graphics are really nice, the one thing wich distracted me were the faces of the characters, I think it could have been made just real life looking, but that is just my personal opinion. Soundrack music is alright, in every different place it will be other, which is really good. Character's voices are nicely done. The one thing you can really notice is that some of them voice is not that much clear. I don't know how long is this game, but I been playing 2 hours (I am not the fan of this type of games) and as far as I have done is put engines in the plane. My verdict is that if you like such type games I really think you will find this to be awesome game, but in my case I don't feel like I will be playing it any more.  "

												This point-and-click adventure game is well thought out and I found it fairly enjoyable. I loved the African theme goin' on in the game and loved the design of the puzzles. There were only a few puzzles that felt a little grasping as far as using actual logic to figure them out. This is kinda the first P&C game I've played, so I ended up having to look up a couple puzzles after going everywhere and trying to figure out what I'm supposed to do. I thought the characters, dialogue and setting were all well done and created a suprisingly entertaining atmosphere for a game this cheap. That said, the chapter isn't all that long and really just depends on how long it takes you to solve the puzzles, which weren't very difficult, and for a more versed P&C games, probably a bit boring as it's not much more than checking every scene for anything clickable. In the end, I don't know if I can recommend this to P&C fans or if I can recommend it to people not-so-into P&C games. But, I enjoyed it and I don't regret the purchase. I think if by looking at the video and screenshots, if you feel interested in the game, it's worth the purchase; it won't disappoint. I also have to note that this is very much only the first chapter and doesn't offer much more than being an hour or two more-or-less introduction. I felt satisified with where it went and where it ended, but as far as value I couldn't really recommend it unless it were on sale. Right now it's only 67 cents so you would be crazy NOT to get it. //7|10\\			"

The only complaint i really have is the transition from one place to another is a little slow, and one of the items was really overly difficult to spot, but this may not bother most people. All in all, not a bad little game for about $6, would definitley recommend it.			"

												THE JOURNEY DOWN: CHAPTER ONE is an wonderful Point'n'Click Adventure that really feels like an old lucasarts adventure.You play as Bwana a guy who runs a gas station with his friend. A woman comes to the station and wants to find an old book she is looking for. After Bwana and her found the book they have to get the old airplane of the gas station running to fly away with this secret writing. And that's all that awaits you in the first chapter of THE JOURNEY DOWN. Gameplay-wise the game just feels like a wondern lucasarts-adventure. And the humor of the game reminds me even mor of the golden age of Point'n'Click games. The tasks you get seem easy at first but when you try to solve them you figure out that you have to to three other tasks to get back to your main task. And the puzzels in this game are engenius. Complaints?: NOPESo if you like the Point'n'Click genre you have to play this game!			"

												This game makes my head spin man just simple but I'm to dumb to get it man kidding the game is actually pretty easy to the ones that are used to play this kind of game and really hardcore to the ones that are used to play games where you barely think. This game is like totally fun makes me laugh every time I play it due to the accent of them. The game runs pretty smoothly and it's really enjoyable All I gotta say is worth it if you get it on sales for like less then 5$ you'll be happy with your buy			"

												A mixed bag. It really comes down to what you are looking for. Probably best suited for a younger audience. Pick up on a sale or skip.Length - about 2 hours without replayability.One of the strongest points in my opinion is the setting and the plot. The characters are human enough to be relatable, but alien enough to keep it fresh and interesting. Everything has some style to it.The voice acting for the main characters Bwana and Kito is done pretty well. It's got that stereotypical Jamaican thing going for it, but it's done pretty well. For most supporting characters it goes only downwards tho - in some places the dialouges have different audio filters applied on the same characters for no reason but oversight, as well as random volume fluctuations. The biggest problem of the game however is its rather unimaginative gameplay. The puzzles are not hard to figure out at all and the items are fairly easy to find. There is no replay value, as all puzzles are always the same and there are no optional locations or choices to be made. Most of the conversations are just made to further progress in the game and the ones which are not, don't add anything to the game aside from random tidbits of information of the world.			"

												If you grew up on old school adventures such as Monkey Island, Broken Sword, Grim Fandango etc, this game is bound to give you a sense of nostalgia reminiscent of those games. After a series of major disappointments with point & click adventures in the past few years, it feels truly refreshing to find a game with as much soul as The Journey Down. The characters are memorable and relatable, the locations are nice and captivating and the game feels ""just right"". It feels and plays largely like a child of the Monkey Island series and Grim Fandango.On a more technical side, I wish the game supported native 1080p without streching the graphical assets. Gameplay and puzzle-wise, most puzzles are pretty logical and easy to solve. You will rarely have to try the ""combine everything with everything"" approach, that, sadly enough, seems to be extremely prevalent in the genre. Kudos to the devs on that one.Highly recommended.

												Picked it up primarily because the art and music reminded me a bit of Grim Fandango. The storyline has some sparse similarities to GF, but is original in its own right and I loved the Afro-Caribbean flair; coupled with the graphics, which were kind of a cartoonish noir, and it was really enjoyable. I thought the dialogue was a little tacky at points, but that really didn't detract from the humor or the overall quality of the game. A bit more difficult than I expected it to be, which was a pleasant surprise; it mixes traditional puzzle-solving with the usual point-and-click puzzles, which was pretty refreshing. It's a bit on the short side, but hey, it's only the first chapter--and seven bucks is a fair price.When you beat the chapter, some bonus behind-the-scenes material is revealed, which I personally loved because I like seeing the creative process for games. Planning on playing chapter two when my next paycheck comes in, and I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants a light, fun point-and-click experience.			"

												At the start the game seemed to be really boring and annoying. Most because of the really long dealogues. It is not the easiest game, sometimes you will be running around the places and doing 10 times the same thing until you will realise you need something else, it doesn't really have continuesly going moves or so, you can go to do many things at once. It was pretty easy to lost in the first minutes of gameplay. Graphics are really nice, the one thing wich distracted me were the faces of the characters, I think it could have been made just real life looking, but that is just my personal opinion. Soundrack music is alright, in every different place it will be other, which is really good. Character's voices are nicely done. The one thing you can really notice is that some of them voice is not that much clear. I don't know how long is this game, but I been playing 2 hours (I am not the fan of this type of games) and as far as I have done is put engines in the plane. My verdict is that if you like such type games I really think you will find this to be awesome game, but in my case I don't feel like I will be playing it any more.  "

												Background: Love Point and clicks.. loathe reggae music. Picked up during the steam summer sale for penniesThe Good:* Backdrops are charming and well designed* Distinctive characters * Music and voice acting are good quality* Story is both in turns intriguing and mundaneThe Bad:* Puzzles are simple, boring and sloppy at times* Animations are rather clunky looking and ruin the charm* Found the characters voices distractingly OTT* Script drags and becomes laboured and you just skip it* Lip-sync is often off* Very short Impressions: Was impressed by the initial visuals but rapidly lost interest in the awkward animation, irritating voice acting and rather poor puzzles (one I knew how to solve wouldn't let me until I re-clicked a clue I'd already clicked earlier). Early puzzles are extremely simple.. bordering on not being puzzles at all which I took to mean this was more like an interactive story rather than an adventure. For the sake of more steps or complexity it could have saved the game.Conclusion. I can't condemn a game I didn't enjoy when I know  my irritation at the Caribbean overtones that are turns off's for me will not bother others. As others have noted it was 4 years between chapter 1 & 2 in a proposed series of 4 games.5/10. Solid mechanics and visuals let down by unappealing characters and gameplay. "

												If you want a good, two hour point and click adventure about fixing an airplane, this is hands down the best option on the market.  Art Style is unique and interesting.  The voice acting and dialog are both generally solid, although it sounds like they were not always done with the the best equipment, and audio levels seem to vary oddly.  Story is good so far, there just isn't that much of it.  Puzzles take a bit of thought, but generally aren't too frustrating or obtuse. Part two is purportedly coming out in soon (Summer 2014) interested to see where they go with this.  This scratched my adventure game itch without outstaying it's welcome. 7.3/10			"

												I was pleasntly surprised by The Journey Down: Chapter One, and am really looking forward to Chapter Two. This game was reccommended to me by a friend a while back -- I saw that it was 90% off during the Summer Sale (for $0.69) and decided to give it a try. The game is well-exectued, and delivers about what you would expect from a casual point-and-click adventure. The story is entertaining and straightforward, and the puzzles are well-placed and logical (even somewhat challenging, at points); the story is well-paced, and can be finished in under 2.5 hours. What stood out most about this title was the unique art style, consisting of 3d rendered characters on a 2d hand-drawn background. As a long-time gamer who has rarely seen this concept executed, I was rather impressed by the general mood and depth these environments were able to confer to the overall experience. With that said, this game is not for everyone, and especially not for those gamers that demand a constantly active and physically engaging experience. However, if you have fond memories of a time when point-and-click games were genuinely appreciated, especially titles like Grim Fandango, The Neverhood, The Secret of Monkey Island, etc., do yourself a favor and check this game out.

												An enjoyable couple of hours to spend if you're looking for something a bit old school. This is a standard point and click indie game in the same mold as Machinarium, just a bit lacking in polish. The backrounds are beautiful but the character models aren't. Voice acting is decent as are the puzzles although very easy. Vague tasks make these sorts of games a headache for me but this didn't have too many moments of those. I got this as a gift but not sure I'd buy it for £5. It's ""bundle game"" worthy and if it's sitting in your libary unfinished, clear it in a few hours, it's worth it (if you like pointing and clicking everywhere).			"

												One of the best point and click adventure games I've ever played. All the puzzles felt logical(or at least intuitive) and you never really found yourself with inane traditional 'board game puzzles' like sliding tiles or similar rubbish.The dialogue is hilarious and the music is pretty nice to listen to. Animation suffers slightly but if you're into adventure games you probably don't care about that.Hard enough to get stuck, but not so hard to the point where it felt like ""How was I suppose to work that out?"" but rather ""I can't beleive I didn't think of that.""

												Thoroughly enjoyed the humour and setting after a few minuites in, the scene setting didn't take long, but as this look and feel is new to me i didn't feel taken by the game from the get go.I am happy i took the time to persist, as short as it was for the game to get good.The music was absolutely phenomnial, i found myself jiving in my chair the entire way through (aside from one or two scenes), i had gotten to listen to the composer before hand and already had a clue on what score this game could provide. To have the backgrounds and scenes change to match each music score, gave me an enjoyable ammount of immersion.The puzzles, whilst not too taxing on the grey matter, were fun to work through. I had myself laughing at outcomes and clicking my fingers in realization as things came together.Only draw back would be, one or two puzzles did feel a little ""Oh i know how this goes"" kind of style.The voice acting was very good, nice mix of accents. But, the only thing that let me down, the entire game, was the levels and quality of a few lines. The audio sounded like it was changed later and added in, or the overal quality was changed mid line. (Don't let that put you off, as it's the only draw back)The art, well it speaks for itself in the screenshots, fantastic all around. Lots of attention to detail for me. Certain parts felt like a throw back to older Adventure PnC games, which gave me great nostalgia.			"

												This is a reasonably solid Point-and-click. The puzzles were pretty simple... a bit too simple in my opinion, but it's nice that you never fall into the ""missed one item and can't continue 'til you find it"" or ""TRY COMBINING ALL INVENTORY ITEMS"" traps that adventure games are so infamous for. It's pretty short as well... only took me about an hour and a half to complete. But all these little things are made so worth it by the art. I am in love with the backgrounds in this game. I find the character concepts very neat, too, and the storyline intriguing so far, though it's barely mentioned (just in this chapter, hopefully) to be honest. Definitely worth picking up, especially on sale. Looking forward to the next chapter.			"

												First of all, this game is a steal. I've seen it as low as sixty nine cents, sure, but even at twelve bucks for this and its sequel it's a heck of a value. Charming, pretty easy, and short.But it does have a heavy dose of adventure game logic. The fact that the game goes to great lengths to poke fun at adventure game logic(""I hate puzzles!"" exclaims the main character) does nothing to ameliorate the fact that it relies on some goofy leaps of logic. That said, it's otherwise well written, well performed, and beautifully scored. The aesthetic is especially interesting, raster backgrounds digitally painted over free hand sketches with characters rendered in a heavily subdived prerendered 15FPS 3D meant to imply stop motion animation. However, it often falls short of this ambition and just looks like early CG. But when it works it's actually extremely lovely.Obviously, if you really want stop motion animation in your point and click adventure game, go grab Dream Machine. The Journey Down is a unique voice in games. I found its characters goofily endearing, and enjoyed my time with them.			"

It takes place in a relativly small area, but there are a lot of things do accomplish in it.Overall the game feels dated, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it.I absolutely recomend it, but not at full price, wait until it goes on sale, or if you can get it through a Humble Bundle.

												Good game, I really liked the first episode! The character design was good and the level was beautifully designed. The music fit in to the game and contributed to the overall atmosphere. There were many puzzles. Most of them challenging enough. I would like to see more of them in the next episode though and maybe some more difficult ones and not just item based missions.The characters were cool but the dialouge could be shorter. I ended up clicking my wat through most of it. But nontheless it was a very entertaining game and I hope to see more in the next episode!			"

												The Journey Down is very much like Grim Fandango's totally chill, Jamaican younger brother. Although Chapter One offers only a slight taste of what is to come, the flavors of chili, salt, motor oil, ginger, lemon, and chervil make a surprisingly good combination. Just play it. You'll get it.			"

												I just finished chapter two and admired your concepts again. I already wrote a review with my feelings for the second one, so I keep this short.This game has very, very beautiful and original concepts. Puzzles are not challenging and there are no moments like ""how the hell should I put this there"" much.Characters are quite lovely, also their conversations and dubbing is awesome, and again quite original.I highly recommend this game if you want to relax and enjoy while playing and adventure game.

												It is a real short game, but still funny as it's seems.Pros:- Incredibly charismatic characters (especially the two main: Bwanga and Kito);- Good voice acting;- Really nice art (-African masks/culture inspiration; -Noir movies atmosphere; -Reggae/Jazz Music; -Jamaican accent)- Amazing soundtrack;- Bwanga's commentaries about things;- Crazy and absurd problem solutions;Cons:- Sometimes, Bwanga walking through scenarios seems to be too slow;- Some crazy and absurd solutions may be way too much;- The chinese cook;- I understand that this is just a chapter, but the gameplay is really, really short for it's price (can finish in 2hrs);Conclusion:This is a great game to get start into the point-and-click genre. Also good for kids, and definitly deserves a place in Library for it's cultural value.			"

												just finished the first chapter, and loved it from beginning to end. can get a bit frustrating at times, but be sure to check for some really small details is all, that are kinda easy to miss. alot of the puzzles tend to make sense, unlike a lot of other adventure games where you spend half your time clicking everywhere and trying to make an item do something in an enviroment or mix it with another item. a problem that seems to persist in many adventure games, where logic kinda goes out the window for some things.awesome dialogue, great setting, music, etc. loved the first episode, and starting on the next one.

												This is a reasonably solid Point-and-click. The puzzles were pretty simple... a bit too simple in my opinion, but it's nice that you never fall into the ""missed one item and can't continue 'til you find it"" or ""TRY COMBINING ALL INVENTORY ITEMS"" traps that adventure games are so infamous for. It's pretty short as well... only took me about an hour and a half to complete. But all these little things are made so worth it by the art. I am in love with the backgrounds in this game. I find the character concepts very neat, too, and the storyline intriguing so far, though it's barely mentioned (just in this chapter, hopefully) to be honest. Definitely worth picking up, especially on sale. Looking forward to the next chapter.			"

												The Journey Down: Chapter One is a good sign of things to come. It's a point-and-click adventure starring a cast of characters modeled after tribal masks (haven't come across any from Scratches yet, so we should be safe). You play Bwana, and your goal is to get your airplane running so you can make some money to pay the power bill. The chapter's pretty short; I finished it in about three hours. But it's filled with some beautiful art intermingled with some 3D models, as well as probably my favorite element of the game: the *excellent* reggae soundtrack. Voicework is adequate. It's clearly performed by the creators' friends and volunteers, leading to a couple voices that don't completely fit, or a few that sound as though they had some poorer quality mics. None of them are so bad as to spoil my enjoyment of the game, however. The mood is lighthearted and humorous, and the characters are generally lovable. Puzzle solutions mostly make sense, and the behind-the-scenes shots unlocked after finishing the chapter are actually pretty interesting, too. I'll be looking forward to Chapter Two.			"
