												Loom is a great game. Unfortunately just not this version.The version that Steam uses is a direct Windows port of the ""talkie"" CD released in 1992, which adds voice acting and VGA graphics, but at a cost. They removed a significant portion of the dialogue to fit the (uncompressed) voice acting on the disc, reducing the story and detail. Furthermore they censored many, many scenes. http://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=802320 has a pretty thorough list of censored and missing content. There isn't even almost any background music due to the dialogue taking all the space. As a result of all these, many scenes become rushed and lack the pacing or emotion they're supposed to have.The voice acting isn't very good either, it's average at best in my opinion. The technical implementation is also somewhat bad due to being one of the first voice-acted games ever, as many lines are cut off abruptly at the end.If you want to experience Loom, I recommend you to find the original EGA version or the FM-Towns version, neither of which are for sale sadly. The FM-Towns version has VGA graphics if you can't stand EGA, but the original looks really good in my opinion and has the best EGA graphics that I've ever seen. The best sound option in the EGA version is AdLib/SoundBlaster by default, but there is a patch[www.vogons.org] available that adds a MT-32 option (note however that you either need a real MT-32 or know how to emulate one).

												I really hate to say I don't reccomend this game, but as some other people have said, it's unfortunately the inferior version. I have played the EGA version all the way through and I think it's a pretty good game. I wouldn't rank it high among the LucasArts classics, but definitely something worth checking out. It's got a good plot and has an interesting take on the point and click genre; the only item here is a staff that can play music to perform a draft. You learn more and more of them as you play through the game, and use each draft to help get you through a puzzle. It's a fairly short game, but a good one.Unfortunately, LucasArts decided to include the CD version of this game instead of the EGA or FM-Towns version. While it has updated 256-color VGA graphics and voice acting, all of the dialogue and music had to be stored as CD audio. The voice acting is sloppily done at times and the music doesn't play very often, killing a lot of immersion. They also cut down the dialogue considerably, leading to some rather confusing moments in the plot. It's really a shame; I'd love to reccomend this game, but I just can't. There is a site that offers the FM-Towns version though, if you have bought this version. Since that's generally considered the best version (it has all the positives of both PC editions and none of the negatives of either), I'd say go on ahead and buy it and follow their method to obtain it.

												There must be something wrong with this adaptation. The dialogues are off, and it horribly feels like something is missing from the gameplay itself. There's no indication of the notes on the distaff, and the drafts are almost impossible to play. I had to give up after a while, and this is seriously aggravating because I remember this game very fondly.I advise not to buy this version. It is horribly adapted.			"

												Loom is unique. There is no game quite like it in the history of video games. As a professional singer and music teacher of many instruments, I still love the challenge of musical pattern recognition and recall of this wonderfully interesting game. I just saw the manual too and gosh, what a lovely throwback to the past when games really were works of art one could keep in the packaging and manuals that came with it. The music geek in me loves how one is supposed to use pencil to dictate the melodies one encounters in the game. It may be slow going for many of us (myself included) who are now so used to faster paced narratives in video games and other media; however, there is such a charm to it as well as some rather fiendish puzzles that had me cheating via online hint guides which incidentally one would have to pay and arm and a leg for with Lucas Arts hintlines, or so I hear. I give Loom 5 stars out of 5 for absolutely everything though I wish I could make bloody Bobbin Threadbare move far quicker- He is a tad snail like in his gait. Regardless, do play this gem while you have to chance. It is one of the best in the genre of adventure games and one of LucasArts finest offerings in this Musician's humble opinion :) Enjoy, Loom everyone. I am on my 4th playthrough and here's to many more :)			"

												What a strange little game.  Of all the point-and-click adventure games I've endeavoured, this one is by far the shortest.  Although a bit convoluted at times, the plot is an interesting little adventure with seemingly huge obstacles that can be bypassed with a unique game mechanic: a musical stick.  The graphics and environments are lovely, and very importantly, the voice acting is fitting.  I also finally feel like I'm on the inside of the LucasArts secret club.  Finally, all those obscure Monkey Island references to this game make sense!Definitely give it a play.  It's a quick little adventure with a famous classical piece as the backdrop.  You really can't go wrong, and you'll be singing Swan Lake tunes for the rest of the day.			"

Loom			* 6/10As part of a Lucasarts bundle I had this adventure for a long time. When I was a child I read in those paper things called videogames magazines about many graphic adventures nd one of those was Loom. In these days I had a chance to play something so I decided to start Loom... And Finish it. The playtime over there is correct. But let's talk about it later...Loom is a graphic adventure directed by Brian Moriarty that sees You as Bobbin, a recluse and almost despised wizard apprentice. Bobbin is summoned by the elders of the village and for some odd reason they're all transformed into swans along with all the villagers, then they fly away. Now bobbin is the last of his village and can pick up his staff to go and search all the lost swans. VERY abridged version.The very innovative interface of the game requires the use of the aforementioned ""distaff"" which can play all seven notes ( you start with three, and unlock one by one the other ones as you proceed with the game). You can combine the notes into quartets to perform determined actions... Or better, spells (you're a wizard apprentice after all). How do you know the combinations? Along the game you'll see things happen which will emit notes. Simply repeat those notes to perform that action. Very creative indeed.Unfortunately the game is very short, even though the story was so promising, and some puzzles were quite interesting. And the worst thing is that the ending is kind of cut, or suspended. The story never really reach a conclusion, and if it does it's a really dark one (no spoilers, please).There are dialogues, but they're just a little more of the essential. Still I really appreciated the voice acting of the characters.+++PROs+++ INTERFACE. This note interface was a very innovative system, it was a different and creative way to move into this adventure, it fitted perfectly in the game's story and setting and seems odd to me that no more games of the same kind were made. STORY. I have to say that considering the lenght of the game there's a nice and interesting story behind all the game, And with a nice revelation at the end...---CONs--- STORY. ...Too bad that the story is abruptly interrupted at the end. Without spoilers, The end is a complete suspension of the story, obviously leaving every situation as it is. There were plans for sequels which never saw light, there were fan sequels project which never saw light except for Forge, with one chapter out already, but I have no idead about the project actual situation. DURATION. And this is the other bad side of the game. It took me 98 minutes to complete the game... Speechless... O.o "

AUDIOPeacefulVISUALBeautifulDIFFICULTYModerateVIBENostalgiaCRAVINGMystiqueON SALESometimesPROS: Mysterious and alluring world that is rich with lore. Interesting musical system, no hand-holding. Nice voice-acting.CONS: First game of a planned trilogy that never came to fruition. Starting the first game to a project that's been unfinished for around 25 years now may sound completely absurd to people who have never played Loom. Understandably so. Many different versions of Loom were released, and I'm disappointed to see that this was not a version cobbled together for the most content available.WORTH: I found this purchase to be worth it full-price, though it tends to go on sale 3-5 times a year for even cheaper. You are paying for a game that's coming up on 30 years old whose story is incomplete, so determine its worth with that information how you wish.OVERALL: A piece of point and click history.

												Pick this one up, turn it on and ignore it while you emulate the proper EGA version. Slightly better graphics and a poor voice-over track does not make up for the sheer amount of content that has been censored or cut from the original EGA version of this game.That said, I'm so very glad that I finally played this. It was complete delight to get from beginning to end and I am absolutely floored that nothing else became of this game. It is a true LucasArts gem.			"

												While not perfect this game surely represent one of the many steps the great LucasFilm (then LucasArts) took in its way to glory. The game per se is a short, straightforward and thus much enjoayble, point and click adventure with one of the most efficient and minimalistic User Interface. Your Distaff (a musical stick) and a square for closeups of interactive items.By any modern standard is a little thing, there are better indie products for (probably) less cash, but for one thing.This game has a soul that begs to be found.It asks to be played, remembered and passed on the next generation. Maybe it's a combination of music, colours, and the memories of when I played it at the sweet age of eight.If you decide to play it- take your time with it: get a pen and a paper, a hot beverage and just glide through it- much like a swan would do on the surface of a crystal-like calm lake.It's all it asks. And it doesn't take up that much time. It may really leave you something unexpected.:) "

Classic DOS game!In the 25 years since its release, LOOM still finds a way to enchant all those who come across it.An interesting and creative take on Tchaikovsky's ballet, Swan Lake, you play as the young Bobbin Threadbare of the Weavers who upon his birthday discovers that an evil is fastly approaching and intends to consume the world. When the Weavers depart from their world, Bobbin must venture from his village to reunite with his people and unwittingly uncovers a plot to seize control of all humanity.Personally, I rate LOOM with a moderate difficulty. Those who are not familiar with the DOS action-adventure games of old may find the controls a bit tricky, especially in regards to Bobbin's Distaff, an instrument with which he can cast spells called Drafts that take the form of small pieces of music.The key to this game is exploration, investigation, and patience. Interact with everything and everyone you come across and attempt spells on them to unlock bits of dialogue and helpful clues as to how to move forward throughout the game. Some puzzles are easy and quite straightforward while others.... not so much. The story, however, is worth all the trouble.Classical music aficionados will also recognize samplings from the ballet within the game's score.Length: 2-3 hours, if explored properly.			"

												Wow, I can't believe how much I liked this game. To start off this was one of the lucasarts games that I have always wanted to play ever since I was a child, back when you talk to the pirate in the Secret of Monkey Island. When I found out that I could buy this game, the Dig, and two Indiana Jones  games...wait what! Yep, that is pretty much how it happened. Of course the game shows its age as it was made in 1990 and the game is quite short and simplistic in nature, but for some reason that style of game played to the theme of the game. The distaff I thought was genius and for once I wasn't mad that they didn't have a point and click adventure with an inventory or command buttons. Without revealing much at all, the one thing I was sad about was that the game in a sense the game leaves some things open. Quickly knowing that there was just Loom, I searched the web for the sequel and sure enough there were plans to make two other games that sadly due to a lack of time back in the day where never made. I hope that this review paints a picture of what the game is like, so that you can decide for yourself if you like it. PS I finally understand that the quote from the Secret of Monkey Island, ""I'm Bobbin. Are you my mother?"" comes from Loom!			"

												Loom is a LucasArts game that started it all.  It's a point and click adventure game of old that instead of utilizing inventory as puzzles it uses musical spells.  Help Bobbin, your character, save the universe.  Old school graphics with great wonderful sound and a story that is very fun to follow.  This is a short and enjoyable old-school game.			"

												Bottom Line: I'm glad to have shared this with my kids, but sad to have tarnished my own childhood memories of it. If you haven't played it, you should; if you have, keep it safely glazed in nostalgia.Years ago, I played the EGA version of Loom. It came in a box with a book-on-tape that described the setting and the game's backstory and a lovely and creative manual that included a host of ""drafts"" (or spells) that weren't included in the game but which expanded its universe.  The game charmed me before I even installed it, and once I did, I was captivated by its gorgeous art, which used minimalism to make a 16-color palette more than ample, and its beautiful arrangement and rearrangement of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake.  The gameplay was simple and approachable for a kid, with no inventory to manage, no death, scant dialogue trees to wade through, but the puzzles were clever and made me feel clever when I solved them.In the quarter century since first playing Loom, whatever flaws it had were forgotten and its many virtues grew, as is the case when you fall in love with something as a kid. When, in interviews, I was asked about Primordia's inspirations, Loom was always among the first I mentioned, and I would always recommend it for people as an entry point to point-and-click adventure games. So, when my four year old was looking for a game to play after we did Primordia together, I naturally got us Loom.It has not aged well, the VGA ""talky"" version is somewhere between the restoration of the Great Wall and the ""restoration"" of the Ecce Homo painting in Borja, which is to say not very pleasant. Moreover, I had forgotten (or been unable to recognize) many flaws that exist even in the EGA version.- The additional VGA colors conceal the artistic feats of the original, and in some instances simply look worse. This video makes the case well: 


YouTube™ Video: LOOM™ EGA vs VGA - DOS Nostalgia 

			Views: 12,895		

			Support DOS Nostalgia on Patreon: https://patreon.com/dosnostalgic A long overdue video about differences between versions of LucasFilm Games' classic LOOM.		

- The sampling of the voice over is extremely poor, and many audio clips are mistimed and oddly cut.- Most of the music was removed from the game.- Certain scenes are shortened (not so badly, in my opinion) and certain parts were bowdlerized.But even setting aside the problems with the VGA version, the game itself is ludicrously short -- we beat it in under two hours, taking time for the four year old to take her stab at the puzzles.  While the game feels open and experimental and somewhat exploratory on the initial island, it becomes increasingly linear, and the last act of the game is *entirely* linear, with every sequence an exact duplication (in gameplay terms) of the last:Walk left, enter portal, cast heal, enter portal, cast close, walk left...Bobbin is not as endearing a character as I remembered, and neither is Hetchel -- the loss of the audiobook introduction to her, perhaps -- and Chaos is much less threatening.  While some of the puzzles remain relatively clever, others are easy and sometimes tedious (in particular, the main puzzle in the blacksmith guild, which is worsened significantly by voice over freezing you out of interactions).  I appreciate brevity in games more now than I used to, but every sequence feels two or three puzzles too short, and as a result none of the characters ever has anything more than a cameo, save for Rusty, whose ambiguous role in the story is as puzzling to me at 36 as it was at 11.Despite these ample flaws, I still think Loom is a very special game. Its gentleness and the novelty of its spell-based puzzles are undiminished with time, and many of the scenes remain striking, even in VGA. There are many other games where you'll get more bang for your buck, but I think it is still a good entry point to the genre, and an important piece of adventure game history, one that shouldn't be forgotten.

												It is difficult for me to criticize this game. I love Loom and consider it is one of the best point and click games I ever had played. Unfortunately, this game has one but very important flaw.So, what is good in Loom? First of all, it is a beautiful game with charming backgrounds. The most important part of game - the story - is excellent. This is the story about young magician, who suddenly found himself in center of dramatic events, and story is very well designed. Main character is charismatic and I feel sympathy for him. When the chaos is right there and even the wisest can not find anything better than escape, even then someone just need to stand and fight while he can.I really liked the fact that in Loom player do not need to collect a bunch of strange stuff and use it in weird illogical combinations, as we usually do in hundreds of ""another generic quests"". In Loom we play as a magician who interacts with surrounding world by using his magic. To cast a spell, player must play a short melody, using a few notes in right order. With time, our mage will study new notes and new melodies, that allows him to make new wonders. I really enjoyed using this musical magic, it was interesting and exciting for me. I must notice that it is impossible (at least it was for me) to memorize all spells, so I recommend to prepare a pen and paper before launching the game.Of course, I should mention background music, soundtrack in Loom are compositions of the famous russian compositor Tchaikovsky.Going back to the story... well, it is good - really touching and beautiful story - but it is too short and not finished. You can finish Loom in two or three hours and it ends at the most interesting place. So dramatically unfinished! It was a big disappointment for me, I liked the world of Loom, I would like to learn more about its history, I would like to see a sequel so much! In Loom ending is... it is not the ending, it looks like it is only the beginning of story. But, unfortunately... that was all.Loom is something like an interesting book, in which half of the pages, including the last chapter, was lost and never found. So much unrealized potential... I am sad about this.Well, anyway. Can I recommend Loom? Of course! Even more, I humbly believe that, if you love point and click genre, then you definitely need to try this game. I mean - despite incompleteness it is still one of the best games, precious artifact of the Golden Age, so why not?			"

												Far different from the typical ""combine every item in your inventory with every other item in your inventory"" LucasArts games, this focuses more on music to create spells. Like other LucasArts games of the era, be sure to save often with lots  of separate save files, because there are chances for you to be unable to continue the game if you forgot to write down a spell somewhere.This is not the original game version, which had no voice acting and low-quality synthesized music. It has voice acting (decent) and higher quality music, but as with the original game, there's not a constant flow of music, so there's a lot of dead space. What music there is, however, is beautiful Swan Lake. This version also has some cuts from the original, a few bits of dialogue here and there, and lots of closeups. Apparently there was also some censoring so there's no evidence of blood or death anywhere, so that's a little disappointing. Overall, if you like classic adventure games, you should ABSOLUTELY play this one. There's nothing like it.			"

The dialog is much shorter, dumbed down, compared to the original DOS version.what is worse is that draft weaving is so laggy it breaks immersion. when I type ""eced"", the basic Opening draft, Bobbin chants the ""d"" four seconds later.All in all, a poor port.

												One of the adventure-games of Lucasarts which took a different approach at adventure-gameplay.In Loom you take over the control of Bobbin Threadbare, a member of the guild of weavers.There is no inventory whatsoever, the only thing you're equipped with, is a magical staff.With this staff you can cast tunes (or spells if you like; you just need to click on a certain part of the staff to play a note; four notes will make a tune).As you progress, you learn more and more tunes which you can cast onto different items, persons or other objects.I really like the mysterious and strange fantasy-world, though the game is not very long, nor is it very challenging but still, for me Loom is a rare pearl in adventure gaming. Sadly, the plans to make it a trilogy were never fulfilled, so it feels a but unresolved at the end.			"

												Of all games I've ever played, this is the one I most wish had continued with it's promised sequel(s). I honestly don't remember which version I played when it was a single CD, but this does seem a bit shorter. The story is poignant, the art and music are beautifuly done -even when they aren't 'pretty'. The puzzles tend to be narritively inclined, that is, there is often straight forward spell to weave in a place that makes sense to do it. Yet for many puzzles it is not casting of the spell itself - it is the cascading effects afterwards, that let one progress. In retrospect it has been an interesting and subtle commentary on the use and misuse of varying forms of power.			"

												Loom is one of those forgotten treassures.Unlike most of the games from the early 90s, this game aged surprisingly well. The entire gameplay is based on playing music (it works a lot like the music minigames from ""The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time"") and the whole atmosphere is simply beautiful. The protagonist, Bobbin Threadbare, is very lovable, combining both a heart of gold, a surprisingly sharp tongue and curiosity for his surroundings.I am very glad I played this game and I hope that more people will play it.

												To put it simply, this version of the game is missing a lot of what the full package should have been. I haven't even played any other version prior to trying this one, and I was wondering why it had absolutely 0 music except for a couple of cutscenes. It seemed totally odd, most games even of this era always had music in the background. It seems this version removed a lot of content (text dialogue and music) to fit full voice acting audio on CD back in the day. That's no good, and for this reason I'd recommend looking elsewhere for the original version of this game unless you want to play it with absolute silence.The storyline is pretty interesting, and gameplay is a bit different from normal point and clicks since instead of collecting items you memorize tunes to play that activate incantations, sort of like ocarina songs in Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. It's a cool mechanic, and what makes the game unique. I can see why it was well received in the past.Regardless of the game's quality, the experience of this version is damaged due to removed dialogue and music to allow space for complete voice acting. Not really worth it, I'd say, look for the original version and play that.			"

												LOOM is the work of art from Lucasarts, who back in the past were a dominant game developer. Released back in 1990, this point and click adventure game became one of the best known of Lucasarts enormous library.You play the role of Bobbin, a wizard who is ready to see the council to become a full pledged wizard. As he gets to the council the higher elders are cast into swans so they can escape 'Chaos'.It is up to the player to help the higher wizards return to the world and close the gates of chaos's world forever, where you must solve the hardest of puzzles, and of course master the grand instrument 'LOOM'.This game is amazing. The music is absolutely stunning, soothing, and really captures the mood of the game. Sure, It's a hard game, and without writing down each spell you are stuck, but with that all checked, this game is definately worth It's weight in gold.LOOM is a must buy for anyone who loves the point and click genre. It's a game which cannot be missed on Steam.			"

												This is a classic mystical adventure that resembles other games made by lucasarts during the beginnings of Guybrush Threepwood. I cheerish this game mostly out of nostalgia. It provides an interesting mechanic of 'Loom Magic' however it can be complicated and frustrating if you cannot determine the correct Loom to play. Or even play backwards.			"

												Unlike other LucasArts adventure games, the story of Loom is more of an elaborate fairytale rather than a classical adventure. It centers on two tropes well known from fantasy stories: the creation of worlds and objects through weaving, and magical music spells. In the course of the game, the player has to play the notes of the spells (called ""drafts"") in order to manipulate the environment. As a newly learned draft is often not immediately used, it's advisable to jot down the music sequences in order to have the right spell ready at the right time. I can recommend the game to anyone with a penchant for good storytelling.			"

												Loom is awesome, unique and poetic. It features two of my favorite lines of dialogue ever:""My destiny is in your hands, Elders.""""Our hands are empty, Hetchel.""However, those lines are not present in the version that is available on Steam. As others have said, this version is terrible, a crime. However, I recommend you to buy it. Because once you have it in your Library, you can right-click on it and download the game manual. It is not actually the game manual, but the Book of Patterns, a piece of literature that you need to keep at hand while you play Loom. Steam features the best digital version of this book that can be found anywhere. Once you have downloaded it, don't bother to install the game. Instead, download some good old floppy version of the game and play it on ScummVM. You won't regret it. "

												LOOM is somewhat of an oddity or one might call it an experiment. It doesn't look like other LucasArts adventure games and it doesn't play like them.You learn short melodies that become your powers and you use them at your own choosing at appropriate points and on appropriate objects during the adventure to make some progress, all while listening to classical music.It isn't very long or complicated and its more something you have to experience, though it's definitely a more traditional game (i.e. it doesn't play like Dear Esther or Journey or any of those games where you typically make progress without much gameplay mechanics required on your part).LOOM is a very old game now. I enjoyed it and I think it should be tried at only $4.99 on Steam at the time of writing.			"

												Ultimately, it was difficult for me to choose whether to choose yes or no for this game - I enjoyed myself (although I tend to be notoriously easy to please), but I don't think I would recommend this one to most of my friends.Loom is a point and click adventure game which focuses on the use of a music to invoke magic to solve problems. The story feels a little disconnected, although it does make sense within the world, but in an odd change from the usual inventory management of these sorts of games, I didn't find the music methodology to be exceedingly engaging. I did not play the original (which apparently had a more involved story) so that might have helped to grab my attention a little bit more.The game's alright. Not great, but not bad. There's just better examples of the point and click adventure game genre on Steam, so unless you're REALLY into this genre, it's probably not your thing.			"

												I see a lot of people saying that this version is not a good one. Well, I've never played this game before so have no previous experience with the game to compare this to another version. But after 30 minutes its kind of boring and I have no idea what im supposed to do. I click on a tree with a hole in it and an owl hoots. I click another tree. Theres another owl in it. It hoots also. A third tree also contains an owl. this hoots as well. the fourth tree does not have an owl in it but after moving further I find the fourth owl which flys in to the hole of the fourth tree. I click the fourth tree now and all the owls hoot one after the other in a different tone. clicking a different tree changes the order in which the owls hoot. Now im sure there must be some sort of order in which I need them to hoot I guess but is this really how the game starts?I move on to a different area by the see and see four seagulls. I click one and all four sound one after the other. Again same as the owls. Now I'm kind of bored :SThis game seems a bit of a bore to me. Theres not enough story set up for me to want to solve these boring puzzles. I found some clothes that seem to indicate I need to dye them. I've knocked over the dye, but can I put the clothes in the dye? nope :( Maybe I need to understand the game controls better as its an older game.Maybe its just the version. Maybe its the game in general. Seems too outdated for me to carry on with this.I'll try again another day but after my first attempt to play this, I've been left confused, bored and a little tired with nothing to grip me in to the story. It's a shame because I've read good things about this game, and is from what I've heard a bit of a classic adventure game, which I do enjoy.Based on what I've played and from other people about this version I would avoid buying this. Or grab it on sale. "

												I'll divide this review into two sections. One for the point and click veterans and one for those who haven't played it before.For the new players first:Loom is closer to being a point and click than anything else adventure but it is unique. There are no inventory based puzzles, and only a few conversation based puzzles. Instead your character makes progress by casting 4 note long musical spells. Figuring out which spell you need can be as challenging as many traditional point and click puzzles.The game is short but it has a properly charming storyline set in a completely weird fairytale-like universe. I think that alone is enough to make it worth its price. It also has 3 difficulty settings since a lot of the game is based on music. So it doesn't matter if you're tone deaf, pick the easiest setting and you'll not lose any of the game.Reasons to play it... In spite of its age, Loom has a truly arresting atmosphere, an intriguing and mysterious plot and great atmosphere. The difficulty settings allow anyone to play and enjoy it. Reasons to not play it.... very few... if you can't handle outdated graphics, if you only like object based puzzles... and you really need the sound on so don't buy it if you hate Tchaikovksy. The background music is mostly Tchaikovsky.For veterans such as myself:This is a very faithful update that has caused me no trouble working on modern windows machines. There has been some very decent voice acting attached to the game. The only negative is that the inclusion of voice acting meant that the producers had to cut down the dialogue so what was already a short game is even shorter. "

												LOOM the game is an absolute work of art. On the scale of story to gameplay it's firmly in story, but what a story! Absolutely lush visuals (for their time), a wonderful soundtrack and a fascinating plot make this a memorable experience for anybody. Relatively daring for it's time, LOOM doesn't have an inventory, or dialogue trees, or even puzzles in the normal sense. Rather, you have a distaff which can be used to cast spells (which you pick up along the way) to alter your environment and advance the story. And it works beautifully. The only downsides I can see are that it's rather easy, and you can finish the game in less than three hours. And it ends on quite a cliffhanger.LOOM the digital release is a bit of a letdown. This would have been the perfect time to release the 30-minute audio drama prologue which accompanied early releases of the game, but it's nowhere to be found.In addition, this is the VGA version of the game. Whilst it is the nicest to look at of all the PC releases, it does suffer from one rather large, glaring fault. Rather than use digital audio files for the speech, they (for some bizarre reason) chose to use CD audio. Which artificially limited the game to just over an hour of dialogue. So they cut chunks out of the game so it'd fit. That means this version is missing bits of dialogue, certain object descriptions, some puzzle solutions etc etc etc. Why not let us have the EGA version as well? Sure, the graphics have fewer colours, but at least the game would be complete!Or better yet, give us the FM Towns version. This obscure Japanese console got the best of both worlds - the VGA graphics, but the full story! There are guides out there for how to patch the Steam version to use the FM Towns port (should you happen to have a copy lying around), but it would have been nice to have it included. It's not like it'd be huge compared to modern games.I'd still recommend the game because it's so good, but if you play it and enjoy it, it's worth digging out one of the other versions just so you get the full experience.

												I had a good time playing Loom. It's an adventure game that does away with a lot of the previous staples of adventure games, and tells an interesting story in a creative world. It's been a while since I played it last, but there were two negatives I can remember: it takes a bit too long to explore the world, and some of the songs required to finish the game weren't properly explained, and I had to look them up. Despite that, I enjoyed it, but it's not for everyone.If this sounds like your style of game, $5 will be worth it. If not, there are better adventure games to look in to (like most of the Telltale Games).			"

												LOOM the game is an absolute work of art. On the scale of story to gameplay it's firmly in story, but what a story! Absolutely lush visuals (for their time), a wonderful soundtrack and a fascinating plot make this a memorable experience for anybody. Relatively daring for it's time, LOOM doesn't have an inventory, or dialogue trees, or even puzzles in the normal sense. Rather, you have a distaff which can be used to cast spells (which you pick up along the way) to alter your environment and advance the story. And it works beautifully. The only downsides I can see are that it's rather easy, and you can finish the game in less than three hours. And it ends on quite a cliffhanger.LOOM the digital release is a bit of a letdown. This would have been the perfect time to release the 30-minute audio drama prologue which accompanied early releases of the game, but it's nowhere to be found.In addition, this is the VGA version of the game. Whilst it is the nicest to look at of all the PC releases, it does suffer from one rather large, glaring fault. Rather than use digital audio files for the speech, they (for some bizarre reason) chose to use CD audio. Which artificially limited the game to just over an hour of dialogue. So they cut chunks out of the game so it'd fit. That means this version is missing bits of dialogue, certain object descriptions, some puzzle solutions etc etc etc. Why not let us have the EGA version as well? Sure, the graphics have fewer colours, but at least the game would be complete!Or better yet, give us the FM Towns version. This obscure Japanese console got the best of both worlds - the VGA graphics, but the full story! There are guides out there for how to patch the Steam version to use the FM Towns port (should you happen to have a copy lying around), but it would have been nice to have it included. It's not like it'd be huge compared to modern games.I'd still recommend the game because it's so good, but if you play it and enjoy it, it's worth digging out one of the other versions just so you get the full experience.

												Play this version rather than the EGA or FM-Towns version (ScummVM still hasn't made a useable version with inputs for pixel-perfect aspect ratio adjustment). The voice acting is worth hearing. The edits made removing the character close-up portraits are for the best (they're poorly drawn and don't have formative lip-sync anyway, and the animation is minor. Any scene deletions aren't important to the plot. The game can be beaten on Expert in about three or four hours tops if a walkthrough is used. Play it for the story and the acting--adventure games seem to run along very similar lines and there's nothing that makes it do what others do any differently--your inventory is just moved into memorized sequences, so it's not like the game has no inventory. The writing is kind of confusing, with techno-magic babble confounding things. The audio drama is available online and worth listening to, since it's pretty much bare soundstage play acting (and since the acting is the best part of the game). The music is the most public domain-y generic stuff you can hope for, but it least it's not fully orchestrated and is MIDI (if you're going to listen to an orchestral version, don't go to a game to get the best arrangement of this particular song that repeats almost the entire stinking game with no contextual changes like in later LucasArts games). The story doesn't wrap itself up well, instead of ending on an ending, it ends on a beginning. If you're going to end on a beginning, tell the rest of the story, otherwise you've released a one-thirds finished story. Nice art design and acceptable animation, but nothing that will make someone's top roundup of vintage game art. Play it as a slightly interactive cutscene, not as a game. 30%.			"

												Loom was a play to my childhood long ago. a system I had once forgotten. Provided you have a pencil and paper to remember th esongs, the game is fairly easy to get through. A fantasticly interesting tale that has you explroe every inch of this world. I really wish that this formed a sequel. As replacing most of the puzzle solving with magical spells was a delightful change of pace. If Monkey Island reccommends it. what's a dollar or two for a good hour and a half of gameplay?			"

												As a gigantic fan of the Monkey Island series, I just had to buy Loom for 1,50€. And believe me, it's a fantastic game.The story is so fantastic and the characters are all so memorable. The animations look amazing and the music is wonderful and fits the game perfectly. I really like the gimmick of using your distaff to make music to do numerous spells, never have I ever seen anything like it, but I love it. The game maybe doesn't have the humor or replay-value like Monkey Island does, but Loom surely is a great LucasArts point-and-click adventure every fan just has to try out. "

												Though not entirely forgotten, LOOM is rarely the first game mentioned on a list of SCUMM engine masterworks. Make no mistake, however, because it is brilliant and immersive. Unlike most SCUMM games, LOOM is rarely funny, and tries its very best to build a universe taht you can believe in. Also, its soundtrack (and various story elements) originate from the Tchaikovsky masterwork Swan Lake, serving to bolster the games lofty high brow tones and sense of believability.Given its dirt cheap cheapness, its hard to think of a reason not to play through this once, simply to say you've experienced it.

												Typical Lucasarts pointandclick adventure, it's fun if you don't think about it too much. The storyline seems to drop you in at random and expect you to understand what's going on and why. Playing through the game does answer some of these questions but not all of them and the ending leaves a lot of threads dangling. Also get a notepad before you start playing and write down the enchantments because they are not stored anywhere but in your head, and they are randomised in each game. I'm recommending this game because I'm such a Lucasarts game fan but it's not one of their best.			"

												Great Lucasart classic. The last game before the first Monkey Island game came out and the first one to include voiceover. A bit ""odd"" controls but a good story. Great atmosphere. A must for Point´n click adventure lovers.			"

												A sweet little old-style platform/RPG style game, but really, really short - I was very disappointed by the ending and how quickly it ended and due to the nature of the game there isn't much replayability. However, I really enjoyed the game for the short period it took to complete it - a nice way to while away a couple of hours.			"

												Great adventure. I remember watching my mother playing it back when it came out like two decades ago, but never had the occasion to play it myself. I really enjoyed the puzzles and even had a laugh or two. That said, it's quite short and easy compared to other LucasArts titles (or so it seemed to me), even playing it on expert mode. Also, I ran the FM-TOWNS non-voiced version that can be downloaded here: http://steamreview.org/external/loom/ (after purchasing it on steam), which seems to have some dialogs and scenes lacking on the voiced version here available.

												Allah.Game is about a kid who always wears hood up because he has bad skin.  The kid is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child who not wanted.  When everyone turn to swan for no reason he gets blame so steals magic staff to turn white into green.After turning everything white to green he breaks into glass shop, then scares campers, burn a dragon before getting blacksmith killed.  He then use Pele power to make sword not straight.  The kid is bad news who does nothing good but only make mess for others.Finally kid turn into swan and leaves world in a mess.  No follow up game made so story just end with everything in bad way.  Maybe game is a prequel to Scotland.The game is pretty short and not very hard.  Like a semi.			"

												A classic graphical adventure by Lucasarts. If you're not afraid of (really well done) pixel-art, this should be a treat. It's not as challenging as many games in the genre, but I found it really fun to play because of the story and the style of it. Of course, it's quite cheap these days, so if you like adventure games, give it a shot.			"

												An old game from the 1990;s however this was one of the games along side the legendary ""The Secret of Monkey Island"" series that made adveture games what they are now. You need to re-visit these games to see the true form of adventure games. With LOOM you need to have a pencil ready to write down musical notes. If you have a ear for musical notes then this should not be a problem. LOOM has a great story line (which I won't spoil here), but you need to see it to experience it. The ending was not what I thought... Cheers to the Monkey Island Series however. .... Damn great adventure game franchise....			"

												This is a beautiful game and a masterpiece in my opinion. It is like playing in a lucid dream; the game is old, but the art is still gorgeous. The story is very original. The music is enigmatic, tranquil and blissful. I enjoyed every moment of Loom, but I really wish the sequel was made; the ending is good, but some loose ends were not tied up. The game is an ethereal beauty and a special memory.4.5/5			"

												Typical Lucasarts pointandclick adventure, it's fun if you don't think about it too much. The storyline seems to drop you in at random and expect you to understand what's going on and why. Playing through the game does answer some of these questions but not all of them and the ending leaves a lot of threads dangling. Also get a notepad before you start playing and write down the enchantments because they are not stored anywhere but in your head, and they are randomised in each game. I'm recommending this game because I'm such a Lucasarts game fan but it's not one of their best.			"

												Provides a good and rare feeling of well developed story. Point-and-click quest stands a bit out of the row due to an original spell cast system. A bit melancholic, but impressively grasping story development. By the way, one of the three cases in my whole gaming experience when a game played through in the distant 1990s deserved another completion in 2014.			"

												This game is a classic for a reason.  Even though it is short for an old-time adventure game, it possesses a number of fantastic qualities.  The world of Loom, being revealed only in very broad strokes by what we would now consider very primitive graphics, is evocative in a way that many other games fail to achieve.  The gameplay, in which one uses notes played on a magic staff to produce various 'drafts', sort of like magic spells, to solve problems is a fascinating mechanic.  The ending hints at a continious that never was, which is a tad bitter-sweet, but I'd still highly recommend the game.			"

Neutron bombs have eradicated all life, leaving only YOU to wander through the wreckage. No other characters, no conflict, no puzzles, no chance of dying and no interface make this the easiest-to-finish game yet! Just boot it up and watch it explode!Wait, wrong game. It's actually a fun little game filled with drama and colourful characters in an epic setting set to the music of Tchaikovsky.			"

												This is one of my favorite games. It's a simple, light-hearted adventure game where you have one mode of interacting with the world: your distaff. Weave musical spells to bend the world to your whim. It's a very simple way of interacting with the world  without being brainless, or demanding weird leaps of logic, like so many of its peers did. Loom also has one of my favorite examples of a ""Bittersweet Ending"". It's a perfect family game. A whimsical, interesting story; fun puzzles; gorgeous pixel art; and a Tchaikovsky (Swan Lake) soundtrack. I believe everybody should play this game.			"
