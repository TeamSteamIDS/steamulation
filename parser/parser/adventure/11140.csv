												Sherlock Holmes is one of the most well known detectives. So many movies, TV shows and games are based on the adventures of Sherlock Holmes and his trusted companion Dr. Watson. But will Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened will be a game Sherlock Holmes fans Want to play ?Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened is a bit of a departure from the more kid friendly games and what I mean by that is that the previous Sherlock Holmes games were pretty tame compared to this or even the later games in the series.Story wise this is an interesting title. Sherlock Holmes has to solve a supernatural case which involves the legendary Cthulhu created by H.P. Lovecraft. Some illegal immigrants go missing and soon wind up dead in crime scenes that look like ritualistic sacrifices and it's up to you to solve the mystery.As I stated before this is a departure from the more teen friendly games. This game has this unsettling mood. The atmosphere in every location feels great even though the graphics don't look that good. Locations range from Asylums, to swamps in New Orleans and abandoned light houses and you can explore everything at your own pace and there is a lot of stuff to find.Now originally this game only had the first person mode, but the remastered edition has an added third person point and click mode that helps out in some locations which have bad textures (I'll get to that in a moment)Graphics look outdated. Some of the items you need to pick up blend in with the environment. Some of the lip syncing is just hilarious when the character models look like dead people. Some of the environments looks empty, but that's only for a second. Now I want to cover the most important aspect of a Sherlock Holmes game and that's the puzzles. After playing Sherlock Holmes Mystery of the Silver Earring I was put off with the illogical puzzles. This time I was surprised with how smart the puzzles actually were.  Now there was some hard puzzles and some of them are kind of stupid, but mostly really smart and well thought out puzzles.Voice acting ranges from well done to incredibly horrible. Some of the voice acting is just incredibly funny. When they talk about serious situations all I did was smile at the voice acting. If you do plan on playing the game I do recommend saving quite frequently and backing up your save file, cause there is a bug where you can lose your save file. Apart from that there's not many other bugs.The game took me 8 hours to finish and apart from the one run of the game you will do, there's not much replay value as nothing really changes. In the end I have to say I loved my time with Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened and I might say it's the best Sherlock Holmes game I've played to date. The interesting story and puzzles are great in this game, because I felt they were the biggest flaw in The Mystery of the Silver Earring. If you like Adventure games, Sherlock Holmes and you like the work of H.P. Lovecraft you will love this game. Final Rating:8/10 - Worth to consider buying it.

												I started Frogware's Sherlock Holmes series in chronological order of the games. Currently, this is my favorite Sherlock Holmes game. I have always been a fan of H.P. Lovecraft  in addition to Sherlock Holmes. The only way to make it even better is to include H. G. Wells to the mix, but I digress. This game set the standard of how the rest of the Sherlock Holmes Adventure Games are presented and produced. The story walks a fine line between the two worlds of H.P. Lovecraft and Sherlock Holmes and surprisingly the resolution is satisfy for both worlds. The adventure felt like Sherlock Holmes was on the case while the Lovecraftian themes never felt like a gimic. When I finished I sat back and pondered if the Lovecraftian themes were real or not; which is how Lovecraft should make the reader, or in this case the player, feel. This is also the fist Sherlock Holmes game where I took extensive notes with a pen and paper. I am not saying that the game presents a bad summary of the clues or even that you need to take physical notes, but I found that it was more enjoyable when I did. I never felt, atleast to my memory, that the game was unfair with its puzzles or logic. Furthermore, refrences will appear from this game to the next game in the series, Sherlock Holmes - Nemisis. So to fulfill that experiance you should probably play this one. In summary: This game does a fantastic job combining H.P Lovecraft and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's worlds. This is a rare game which uses Lovecraft correctly, which will please any Lovecraft fans. Buy this game if you are a fan of either litature. I also suggest this game to individuals who would like to try Frogware's Sherlock Holmes Adventure series but are not sure which game to start with. This game is a great Point and Click game with a strong atmosphere. I at this time of writing palyed this game for 9 hours, and after writing this review I want to replay this game from the beginning.			"

												I've been enjoying the modern reimaginings of Sherlock on CBS (Elementary) and the even better BBC series.  So, when the Sherlock collection went on sale on Steam, I decided to give it a try.  Of course, this game portrays the original Sherlock Holmes.  This is mostly typical point-and-click adventure fare and puzzles, with a little more than the usual pixel hunting due to the forensic nature of the story.  For a game created in 2006 and then ""remastered"" in 2008, the production values are low, but the voice acting is pretty good.  There are a few brain teasers thrown in, which can be difficult, but there is a built-in hint system.  The game requires a little bit of deductive reasoning, but it falls short of making you feel like Sherlock.  All too often, you gather all the evidence only to have Holmes pull it all together in a cut scene.  The story is kinda slow, but it comes together nicely in the end.  All in all, not a bad game, but not great either.			"

												The setup sounds great, Holmes & Watson inexplicably drawn into a world of fantasy horror... Except the follow-through is a boring and groan inducing embarrassment. It has little to do with either the works of Conan Doyle or Lovecraft and the tonally devoid hot mess that follows is evident of that. Looking at it simply as a game it's a frustrating series of clumsy and broken puzzle mechanics; if you've come for a narrative or engrossing world though then you're really in trouble. The plot attempts to string together kidnappings in England, an asylum in Switzerland, a swamp in New Orleans and finally a lighthouse in Scotland using some vague Cthulhu cult to no definable end. It's all so disjointed you realize about halfway through that none of the developers actually read any of Lovecraft's stories. Professor Sullivan has a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo but nowhere in the narrative is Innsmouth (home to The Esoteric Order Of Dagon) or any of the creatures of Lovecraft's mythos. Cthulhu himself is never even mentioned by name! So what you're left with is less a sect and more a social club that stuff dead people full of squid and call it a herald of the apocalypse. It's also really, really ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. It doesn't work as a mystery, it doesn't work as fantasy horror, and it just plain doesn't work as a game.			"

												The Awakened is a great starting point for players new to the Holmes series. In this installment, the balance between puzzles, dialogue and hunting for clues has been perfected, and the new in-game hint system *usually* has the answers if you're stuck. There's been a pretty good graphical update, and the addition of the first person camera angle has totally removed the previous games' problems of pixel hunting and difficult controls. I personally encountered no technical problems playing on Windows 8.1. If you're a fan of the classic Sherlock Holmes, Awakened may not be for you. The story has a lot of paranormal elements, which may be a turn off for some players. However, I am typically not a fan of paranormal mysteries and I was still able to enjoy the game. Each location has a totally different atmosphere, so in a way there's something for everyone. The mystery is interesting and intriguing without being convoluted, and at around 8 hours the length feels just right.			"

Sherlock Holmes: The Awakening Remastered			* 7/10This is my third Sherlock Holmes Adventure From Frogware and let me get straight to the point: this was quite unexpected.This version is a Remastered and modified edition from the original game so it presented itself as a classic Point and Click Adventure Like its predecessor but it still keeps the option to allow you play it in First Person View, which along the adventure it really proved to be useful to move fastly and to notice places, items or other particular useful details.Aside From that the thing that really got me unprepared was the total tone change: it's not a secret, in this adventure Our Holmes And the Good pal Dr. Watson will investigate murders and disappearences that will lead to a cult that worship Chtulu himself. So obviously this adventure won't be a classic adventure in the high society London (well, at least not entirely), but the settings and the character will be quite dark and even disturbed sometimes. Don't get me wrong, I don't get impressed at all by anythig I saw here, it was simply unexpected.Anyways this dark tone is a good innovation, but not the only one. The Sherlock Holmes adventures seem to be improving title by title. The interface is now polished and intuitive (not over-decorated) and the brief quiz has been resized to be a single question to be answered by writing the answer (nothing too complicated, it usually is a thing or a name -spoilerless-). A good innovation is the clever use of the map, which can be used to move fastly from one place to another. Unfortunately I've still noticed few issues here and there with the hot zones while using the classic point & click interface, but actually nothing that bad. Another thing that often annoys me is that you need to accomplish every action to move ahead or to allow an action prior to move ahead. I know it's right to have Sherlock analyze everything and talk with everyone, but some riddles are easy enough to be solved before they're supposed to be (an example? The lemon plant).I enjoyed the story n this chapter even though I've missed the final Sherlock monologue where the guilty is revealed (though it's fine in a Dark adventure like this, and the One behind all is revealed at the very end, and I appreciated the consequences of this adventure).+++PROs+++ CHTULU. This chapter's story revolves around Chtulu's myth, hence the cult, the temples and locations you'll encounter or visit are quite disturbing and this unusual setting is very innovative for a Sherlock Holmes Adventure. INTERFACE. From this chapter the interface is not over-decorated and is now intuitive as it was supposed to be. It features also the orginal First Person View and a map system that allows travelling from place to place faster.---CONs--- ACTIONS REQUIRE ACTIONS. I know it's right to have Sherlock analyze everything and talk with everyone before you move on, but some riddles are easy enough to be solved before they're supposed to be so I don't get the sense in preventing certain actions.

												This game is a bit of a departure from typical Holmes, as it mixes in a Lovecraftian element that gives the story an unearthly taste.  I don't have a problem with that, but if you're not really a fan of sort of ""out there"" paranormal storie, you might not appreciate this game.  However, even if you're not a Lovecraft fan, you might be engaged enough with the story to enjoy this too.Gameplay is pretty standard pointy-clicky fare.  As in most of these styles of game, the puzzles range from very basic to ridiculously difficult, but thankfully there is an in-game hint system that does help a lot to keep frustration to a minimum.  The only truly difficult part I found was a point when you're in a dark area with a lantern and must find all the clues to progress; the last ""piece"" was very difficult to locate in the dark.For mystery/detective fans who also are fans of Agatha Christie, there is a delightful ""easter egg"" partway through the game.  As a Christie and Doyle fan, I squealed like a wee happy baby.  I won't ruin it here, just keep your eyes and ears open for it. :DMy single real complaint (and it's just a nitpick really) is with the sound; there's a point where there are a lot of people using alert/warning whistles and they were piercingly loud (and over and over and over again, ouch my head).  I didn't even have the sound up that loud but I thought my eardrums were going to rupture.  Just a minor thing to keep in mind; you may want to keep the volume lower or even off when you hit that section.So go grab the Sherlock Holmes Collection where you can get all six of the games at once and save a good bit of money.  They're definitely worth it for fans of Doyle's Holmes.			"

												This game has too many flaws to be recommended on its own. I bought it as a bundle containing a lot of Frogware's Sherlock Holmes and enjoyed it thinking that the other games were enough for the price I payed but I wouldn't pay for it on its own.The reason I don't think it is worth buying itself is the badly executed gameplay mechanics. Through the game you have to switch between third person and first person. A lot of the first person perspective gameplay is just too difficult. The areas are huge. I don't think many people like pixel hunts in giant 3D environments.. There is a hotspot highlighter but not all hotspots highlight depending on which perspective you are playing from. You also have to get really really close to some of the hotspots to make them highlight.The trigger mechanism of the game is also annoying. The game will wait until you have located all the hotspots in a certain area before the plot can advance and some of these aren't very relevant to the plot and can be really hard to find.In theory you can consult the game's built in hint system but it reveals more spoilers than help.This is all a shame as the plot and character scripts are really, really, good. Playing it with a walkthrough close to hand I actually really enjoyed the story and some of the puzzles which didn't require too much hunting in huge 3D locations.If you happen to be buying a bundle of Sherlock games then 'Testament', 'Silver Earring', or 'vs Arese Lupin' are worth about $10 each on their own so don't be put off by the inclusion of 'Awakened' but I wouldn't buy it alone.

												If you're a fan of Lovecraft and a fan of Doyle's Holms, than this is the game for you. Just don't expect a masterwork.Adventure-wise, the game is not that engaging. The puzzles are either obvious and straightforward, or a devil to solve. But on the rare occasions when the balance is struck, the game really flows nicely. In all other cases, there is quite a comprehensive in-game hint system/walkthrough, that only very rarely doesn't provide adequate answer.But the reason I love this game is the mashup with Cthulhu mythos. While the delivery is a bit ham-handed and does not depict properly the creeping madness and true horror of Lovecraft, visual elements at the least finally bring to life some of the horrific scenes of the Mythos. There are so few games which have actually allowed us to take a walk through this setting, that it is worth playing Sherlock Holms: The Awakened just for this aspect.			"

												The third of the Frogware Sherlock Holmes games is by far the best of the bunch (out of the three) and considering it was released in 2006, graphically, it holds up reasonably well.The adventure contains a great plot that takes you to numerous locations, fantastic voice acting (especially from Holmes and Watson) and a very handy built in hint system for when you get stuck, and you WILL get stuck as a couple of the puzzles are (at least I thought so) incredibly hard.One annoyance is when you know what you want to do next, but the game won't let you because you have not done things in the “correct order” you might want to unlock a door with a key, only to be told that it cannot be done, yet once you talk to somebody and they suggest using the key on the door, magically it now works. It's not a game breaker, but it can get frustrating at times.If you are looking to step into the shoes of Sherlock, and prefer the classic tones of Basil Rathbone or Jeremy Brett, this is the game you are looking for!

												Frogware's Sherlock Holmes series is one of my favorite adventure game series. The first few games had a rough start and varied in quality, but with The Awakened they started a trend of making great original stories with interesting crossovers - in this case, the game is a crossover of Sherlock Holmes and the Cthulhu mythos. As with the rest of Frogware's later games you can choose to play the game in first person, which I always appreciate in games. The puzzles aren't necessarily hard, but there are points where they require knowledge you might not have necessarily found before you're expected to answer, like one puzzle that requires you to know that the eidelweiss is a national symbol of Switzerland. Even though this edition of the game was released later in the series, it is still a remastering of one of their earlier games, so the animations and voice acting for secondary characters aren't always that great, but if you're a fan of Sherlock Holmes I'd still recommend giving it a try, especially considering that the full collection tends to go on sale for around $10.

												I purchased the Sherlock Holmes collection and this was the first game of the series before the recent ones that installed properly and played fine. It's a good version of the original that now gives you the option to play in third person mode, although I find the original first person mode much better. Granted the graphics aren't as good, but it still provides a challenge. This is a good game to get people started into the fantastic Sherlock Holmes series, especially if they like games that require patience rather than just shooting everything in sight. 9/10			"

												Brilliant game, so far probably my favourite in the series. It's really well designed, the puzzles are good and the story gets very interesting and sinister. It looks very nice too, I actually had the urge to take screenshots often, because I liked the sceneries. A great thing about this Remastered version is also that you can switch between classical point-and-click style and a first-person perspective. You can play either way, depending what you like more or, like me, keep switching back and forth between them to look at everything from a different perspective.What some people might not like is the presence of some supernatural elements in a game about a detective known for logical thinking and solving regular human crime cases rather than dealing with cults. As I managed to find out these supernatural elements are related to the works of H. P. Lovecraft, but probably very loosely. I don't know for sure, since I'm not familiar with his works, but I expect his biggest fans as well as biggest fans of Arthur Conan Doyle might both be disappointed and feeling the game messes up everything about their favourite universe. But I'll tell you something... I really don't mind. It may do some things differently, it may break some established canon, but it's a pretty damn cool and involving story. Don't treat fictional works so seriously, don't say the writer tosses in his grave, don't clench your fists in anger. This is just derivative work and it should be allowed some artistic creativity. Enjoy it for what it is, because it's actually really enjoyable and for me this was an unforgettable experience.			"

												Welcome to my review of Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened - Remastered Edition!In A Nutshell: Pros: -Fun, Sherlock Holmes Storyline-First OR Third-Person Viewpoint-Nice Voice Acting-Immersive, Victorian World-Somewhat H.P. Lovecraft Inspired-Manual Saves!Cons: -A Little Glitchy + Numerous Bugs Reported (By the Steam Community)-Controls Are a Little Wonky (Either navigating in third-person, or highlighting objects in first-person)-No Windowed Mode (Possibly No-Big-Deal?)-Less Cthulhu Aspects Than Expected Full Review:   As someone who loves both Sherlock Holmes themes and Point-&-Click Adventures, I was excited to give this one a go, especially with the “Remastered” label attached to it. Despite the lower price point, I was pleasantly surprised by how nice this game looks, not to mention the versatility of being able to switch between first-person and third-person perspectives; both modes have their pros and cons, but it was refreshing to have either the standard Point-&-Click method (which works best for finding the clues, in my experience) or a free-roam, FPS-style viewpoint.  I enjoyed the storyline, and it definitely had a Lovecraft feel to it, though I expected that theme to be a little bigger and bolder overall. The voice acting is really pleasant, and it definitely helped to improve the overall immersion of the game. The graphics aren’t cutting-edge, but they are certainly up to par, and I appreciated all the tiny little details in the scenes, whether it’s a melting candle, or variety in books on a shelf. All in all, this is a title worthy of the Sherlock Holmes legacy, and while I wouldn’t rate it as my absolute favorite in the genre or in the world of Holmes, it’s definitely a worthy addition to any Point-&-Click library!In Conclusion: 6.5/10 This review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

 5/10 - Somewhat brokenGraphics and resolution updating was well done for this collection.  However, on 8.1 (64)  the game often freezes and hiccups.  In one area, when Holmes and Watson are on their way to the continent from the docks of London, the application crashed with an error message of ""tools.dialog cannot be executed"".  Seems like missing assets, etc... After a reload, it won't get past that point.All Holmes games are fun, but crashing will kill any title.  Knowing that it may be my configuration I'll leave it with a 5/10.			"

												If you are a Sherlock Holmes junky like me, go ahead and buy it for giggles.  Otherwise this game was heavy on gore and game mechanics, not so much with story.  Watson is mostly stupid in this game, unlike the originals, and follows you around and gets in your way.  It is nice to vent your frustrations on him, but they could have done without him entirely.  It's not really a whodunit game where you are shocked at the end, like the original stories, it's more like ""oh there is a guy who is the perpetrator, lets solve more annoying puzzles and search for rediculously small hints.""  The puzzles themselves didn't really make you think hard, it just kinda made you feel stupid.  XD  The difficulty of this game was moderate to hard, but it comes with a hint system that was built in, which is a pro.  The voice acting for Sherlock is nice as well, along with his lovely top hat he wears on occation...  But overall the game just sucks.  Don't waste the money, and more importantly, the time on it.

												GOOD: Excellent plot; perfectly meshes the mythos of Cthulhu with the legend of Sherlock.  It has an in-game hint/walkthrough.  A few moments of genuinely creepy/horror stuff.EH:  This game came out in 2006. It probably looked super nice at the time, but it occasionaly shows it's age.  The voice acting is alright, but sometimes it comes across as blatantly reading a script.  Sometimes there aren't logical connections in puzzles; as in you will have figured out what to do, but cannot figure out the extra hoop you have to jump through.  Thankfully there is an in-game guide to help.BAD: The game does not tell you how to play at all.  Never tells you the controls or what types of things you can do.  The game engine itself is rather ""stiff."" Certain things have to be looked at the perfect angle to interact with, some character animations look very awkward.  Some scenes that are to convey danger fall flat due to the weird/stiff animation.  My advice:  remember that this game came out in 2006.  It's a point and click game, so you should be playing for the story anyway.			"

												The first game in the series with real potential, The Awakened feels like significantly less a chore than the previous games. It also features very little self-purposeful puzzles, and instead focuses on what feels like actual detective work. And quite gruesome kind at that, which is only fitting giving the story draws from the Cthulhu mythology. The game doesn't quite live up to its promise, though, the story often getting sidetracked at the most crucial of times. Player's role in the deduction is fairly small, with only the occasional text input required to continue. Voice-acting is still abhorrent, mercifully aside from Sherlock himself.			"

												It was ok. Whenever you get stuck, it's because you missed a small item or a small clue, not because you're bad at combining. Sometimes I got stuck at solving riddles because it was just illogical or because I had to trigger something first.Example:Mosquitos are blocking a path, according to a book I found I can pass them with lemon juice. There's a blood trail, so I definitely know I have to go there. So I pick up a lemon tree, but whatever I try, I can't get past them. Later I have to put something heavy on a platform, but even though there are lots of heavy objects in the room (stairs, tables, whatever) I have to place the lemon tree on it which doesn't even look heavy. Some time later I'm suddenly I'm told to get past those mosquitos and I have to walk all the way back to the lemon tree to get a lemon. Everything I find behind those mosquitos is a dead end with two further clues I need to finish the chapter.Sounds easy? I needed a walkthrough for it. Not because I'm stupid but because the game is too linear and doesn't give you enough freedom for solving riddles.Considering the design, it's not a good adventure. However, I liked playing it in first person. The atmosphere was nice and towards the end very lovecraftian. But don't expect to actually find something out about Cthulhu, I'm not even sure if his name was mentioned in the game lol.So yeah, I quite enjoyed the game. Not always and probably even less if I wasn't familar with Lovecraft.I'm not sure if it's a good game for Sherlock Holmes fans or adventure fans in general.			"

												Sherlock Holmes vs Cthulhu, it shouldn’t work, but it kind of does.Tracking an evil group of followers across the world is entertaining, and the discovery of a dark plot across the world fits somewhat with the take that Frogwares have on the character and licence.Unfortunately, the usual Frogwares problems are here en masse --The atmosphere is often inconsistent with the theme - instead of a dark, brooding adventure into an ancient cult, you get a trek riddled with bland, insipid dialogue and voice acting, and inappropriate reactions and asides that have no purpose.-The third person navigation is easier for spotting items, but is reliant on poorly placed transition points, and while moving around in first person is far easier, it literally requires you to be on top of objects before you are able to interact with them.-The progression can be incredibly frustrating - in most point and clicks, gameplay consists of picking up and examining everything you can, but in Awakened, you actually need to have a reason to look at or pick up an item, or even to use something you already have and know what to use for. The environment also needs to be finely combed for hard-to-see clues before progession is triggered, even if the conclusion is blindingly obvious already. Overall: 7/10			"

												Quoting from my blog post review on 3/3/2007 (which, FWIW, was probably before the ""remastered"" edition was released): Not bad at all. First of all: It's a traditional adventure game (albeit with a 3D, ""Gabriel Knight 3""-esque interface, rather than 2D point-and-click) featuring Sherlock Holmes investigating a global conspiracy of Cthulhu cultists. How could I _not_ play this game? Better yet: Despite being essentially a _Cthulhu by Gaslight_ adventure, it also remains true to the authentic Holmes stories by _not_ including anything that is unequivocally supernatural. The story ultimately leaves it ambiguous whether the cultists' activities would actually have awakened Cthulhu and destroyed the world, or if they were merely insane. Furthermore, this game is blessedly free of anything like the obnoxious timed stealth puzzle that intruded into the previous game in the series. The graphics are at times breathtaking, with lovely animated reflective water, bump-mapped surfaces, lovingly modeled gory, dismembered victims... Voice acting is consistently above-average for computer game voice work. I didn't encounter any game-crashing glitches. All in all, a solid game for adventure fans, Holmes fans, and Cthulhu fans.However, I will say, ""The Awakened"" is sort of an uninspired title. I sort of prefer the original French title, _La Nuit des Sacrifiés_. Also, in a peculiar affectation, many of the characters in the game appear to be named after various personalities from the early history of pen-and-paper RPGs: There's a Dr. Gygax, a man named Arneson, and a couple of books authored by E. Otus and D. Niles, although they seem to have left out the obvious Petersen.			"

												Great eerie atmosphere, along with the ever-present feeling of dread and something being not quite right.Also, as events narrow down into something too out-of-the-ordinary, even for a Sherlockian story, you start to wonder if this will be the ever first time supernatural makes its presence into the famous sleuth's line of work.Unlike Sherlock vs. The Ripper (though for that title placing the player in East London mostly, it was quite adequate, given the subject it dealt with), in this title, you do have quite a lot of change of air, so as to speak, given the quite varied scenario you face along the whole game playing experience.

												Fun detective game with a supernatural twist!With excellent graphics, good voice overs and a gripping storyline inspired by HP Lovecraft this is my favourite Sherlock Holmes game to-date.The controls are easy to get to grips with and the game draws you effortlessly into the combined Worlds of Sherlock Holmes and HP Lovecraft. Honestly - a Cthulu cult vs the World's greatest detective - what could be better?!This version of the game (the remastered) allows you to play in both third-person and first-person perspectives and switch easily between them. Surprisingly this is a lot more useful than it sounds - where you might miss something in third-person you might notice a clue or an item otherwise missed when switching to first.			"

												Welcome Detectives  and P&Cers :)Do you like mystery, Sherlock Holmes and a good piece of Lovecraft?Our calls have been heard (rather long ago), but I doubt most will like the answer.Pros: - be the greatest detective, Holmes himself.   Either in third person or glorious first person view. - rich cast of characters, most with above par voice acting - an interesting, but short narrative based on Lovecraft's Cthulhu myth - a few decent puzzle/detections are spread through out the game - the literature and letters throughout the games are stellar - awesome setting, London, a mental institute in switzerland, Nawlins and moreCons: - atrociously stiff animation - hilarious 'action' sequences'  - there's the occasional unintented funny moment - too linear in the crime scenes - those graphics O.o - controls and detection of clues is wobbly and flunky. Verdict:This one is really hard to recommend. The Awakened does do a good job in terms of mood and capturing the weirdness of Lovecraftian lore, yet it never comes into full swing thanks to the liveless movements of the characters and borderline silly action sequences.it will not be the greatest challenge in terms of puzzles or point & click, and ends rather abrupt.Only fans of either Holmes or Lovecraft should gives this serious consideration, as it will never rise above average in any aspect.

												I recommend this game--but with a few caveats.  It's a treat to see Sherlock Holmes in the Lovecraftian universe, but the game does show its age a bit.GraphicsThe graphics are at times good, and at times awful.  The scenes in New Orleans, for example, were quite nice to look at and the models reasonably complex.  However, the textures aren't great close-up and there are some scenes that simply lack the quality of other adventure games, even older ones.  Compare The Awakened to Syberia--the developers of Syberia created a masterpiece with the technology available which still holds up to this day.  Playing The Awakened, I got the impression that Frogwares didn't really spent that much time on it, and didn't utilise the game engine quite as well.The character models are nice to look at and there's resonable variation.  The animations aren't great, with repetitive and quite awful movements and characters frequently seem to be interacting with invisible objects.AudioThe music in this game is good, as is the general soundscape.  However the voice acting leaves a bit to be desired.  Holmes in particular sounds quite awful, although Watson is quite good.  The voices frequently don't match up with the movement of the lips.GameplayIt's quite fun!  The puzzles are reasonably challenging and the pace is quite good.  I could have wished for bigger worlds and more interactions, but all in all it was quite good.PlotHmm.  It's difficult to really put into words.  This was...  a decent effort at capturing both the Sherlock Holmes and Lovecraftian Mythos worlds--there are better efforts in the literary sphere, with books such as All Consuming Fire which also ties in Doctor Who.  The plot meandered a little, and at certain points didn't appear to make sense.That said, it's still quite interesting and at times quite grisly.  The end was good (but could have been better) and the epilogue was a little confusing in one major point, which I won't give away here.OverallThis is a solid game, but I get the impression a lot more effort could have gone into making it an absolutely amazing game.  I recommend you pick it up during a Steam sale and play it through when you're home sick and can't be bothered watching Netflix (which is what I did!).			"

												Up until the latest installment of the Sherlock Holmes series (Crimes and Punishment), this game used to be my favorite of the series. I will admit that I am biased because I'm a big HP Lovecraft fan, so having Sherlock Holmes investigating a Cthulhu Mythos inspired case, it was hard not to like.My only two problems were  1) It wasn't long enough and 2) Going to Louisiana.

												Sherlock Holmes and HP Lovecraft mythos? It’s actually more common than you would think. There are books filled with short stories of this cross over, and a few have Doctor Who in it as well, maybe one day that game will come out…Anyway, this game has a good depiction of the Mythos, which always gets high marks on my book.It’s old, and a bit clunky as such, but has a decent game play and it’s easy to follow. Try it, it’s a fun ride.And yes, Sherlock Holmes would be highly resistant to some of the insanity effect in the sense that he’s already not all there to begin with. He’s highly logical mind automatically discards most occult possibilities and focus those phenomenon as being the result of biased reports, drugs and crazy people doing and believing in crazy things.

How could I _not_ play this game? Better yet: Despite being essentially a _Cthulhu by Gaslight_ adventure, it also remains true to the authentic Holmes stories by _not_ including anything that is unequivocally supernatural. The story ultimately leaves it ambiguous whether the cultists' activities would actually have awakened Cthulhu and destroyed the world, or if they were merely insane. Furthermore, this game is blessedly free of anything like the obnoxious timed stealth puzzle that intruded into the previous game in the series. The graphics are at times breathtaking, with lovely animated reflective water, bump-mapped surfaces, lovingly modeled gory, dismembered victims... Voice acting is consistently above-average for computer game voice work. I didn't encounter any game-crashing glitches. All in all, a solid game for adventure fans, Holmes fans, and Cthulhu fans.However, I will say, ""The Awakened"" is sort of an uninspired title. I sort of prefer the original French title, _La Nuit des Sacrifiés_. Also, in a peculiar affectation, many of the characters in the game appear to be named after various personalities from the early history of pen-and-paper RPGs: There's a Dr. Gygax, a man named Arneson, and a couple of books authored by E. Otus and D. Niles, although they seem to have left out the obvious Petersen.			"

												I recommend this game--but with a few caveats.  It's a treat to see Sherlock Holmes in the Lovecraftian universe, but the game does show its age a bit.GraphicsThe graphics are at times good, and at times awful.  The scenes in New Orleans, for example, were quite nice to look at and the models reasonably complex.  However, the textures aren't great close-up and there are some scenes that simply lack the quality of other adventure games, even older ones.  Compare The Awakened to Syberia--the developers of Syberia created a masterpiece with the technology available which still holds up to this day.  Playing The Awakened, I got the impression that Frogwares didn't really spent that much time on it, and didn't utilise the game engine quite as well.The character models are nice to look at and there's resonable variation.  The animations aren't great, with repetitive and quite awful movements and characters frequently seem to be interacting with invisible objects.AudioThe music in this game is good, as is the general soundscape.  However the voice acting leaves a bit to be desired.  Holmes in particular sounds quite awful, although Watson is quite good.  The voices frequently don't match up with the movement of the lips.GameplayIt's quite fun!  The puzzles are reasonably challenging and the pace is quite good.  I could have wished for bigger worlds and more interactions, but all in all it was quite good.PlotHmm.  It's difficult to really put into words.  This was...  a decent effort at capturing both the Sherlock Holmes and Lovecraftian Mythos worlds--there are better efforts in the literary sphere, with books such as All Consuming Fire which also ties in Doctor Who.  The plot meandered a little, and at certain points didn't appear to make sense.That said, it's still quite interesting and at times quite grisly.  The end was good (but could have been better) and the epilogue was a little confusing in one major point, which I won't give away here.OverallThis is a solid game, but I get the impression a lot more effort could have gone into making it an absolutely amazing game.  I recommend you pick it up during a Steam sale and play it through when you're home sick and can't be bothered watching Netflix (which is what I did!).			"

												As a Sherlock Holmes fan, I really enjoy a game that makes you thinks through the clues and information you gather to make deductions and solve this case.			"

												Well, this game, and series, got dark really fast. Sherlock Holmes investigates the disappearance of some young men and travels to near and faraway places to find out what happened to them. Beware of blood and gore. This is atually the atmosphere of HP Lovecraft starring in Sherlock Holmes and some stuff gets really dark, bloody and spooky. Not recommended for children.The game looks pretty good. The graphics and animations has again improved since the last game, and some minor flaws in animations and light settings is the only things to complain about there, as long as you keep in mind that it's not the newest of games.The options also lets you choose between third and first person mode, which is very nice, and you can change between mode with the push of a button. Personally I preferred first person as it just felt smoother and easier to move around with.The game did bug out on me once and only once, so make sure you save the game as you progress.This game does not have a failstate, so no matter what you do get to the end. You can really not do anything wrong as Sherlock will not leave areas before he has done all he needs to do and will tell you so. The game also has a built in guide that goes in steps from slightly nudging you in the right directions, to telling you the spefics of the puzzle/room you are in, so you should never be stuck. No badges or achievements here either, so you can safely spam the hint button without fear of losing achievements. No real replay value, as nothing can change from each playthrough, but definitely worth playing through that once.			"

												Sherlock Holmes and HP Lovecraft mythos? It’s actually more common than you would think. There are books filled with short stories of this cross over, and a few have Doctor Who in it as well, maybe one day that game will come out…Anyway, this game has a good depiction of the Mythos, which always gets high marks on my book.It’s old, and a bit clunky as such, but has a decent game play and it’s easy to follow. Try it, it’s a fun ride.And yes, Sherlock Holmes would be highly resistant to some of the insanity effect in the sense that he’s already not all there to begin with. He’s highly logical mind automatically discards most occult possibilities and focus those phenomenon as being the result of biased reports, drugs and crazy people doing and believing in crazy things.

												I am big fan of Sherlock and Lovecraft mythos, so the story drew me in immediately. The game offers a possibility to play 1st person or 3rd person, unlike the previous installement. In my opinion, the 1st person option makes life so much easier, because you don't have to deal with clunky screen change which does not pan in the right direction. One thing that annoys the heck out of me is that it keeps constantly crashing and freezing, and you can no longer see your mouse on screen. So I am saving every 2 minutes as I go along.			"

												It wouldn't work. No matter what we did to try an fix it it would not run. Spent 2 hours reading guides for the error that popped up and nothing. The worse part is, is that I bought it with all the other Sherlock games so no refund all because Jack the Ripper worked.			"

												Inferior in every way except technologically to the previous installment. The themes and mechanics aren't very Sherlock-like, in many ways it feels more like a Broken Sword or Tomb Raider game. Some puzzles are also extremely difficult and the game does not help you by structuring the deductions in the form of a quiz, which was a great feature of the previous episode.			"

												Wow.  This was an absolutely wretched game.  Worst aspects of a pixel hunt game, a boring story, terrible voice acting.  The idea of Holmes vs the Mythos is a cool one, but has been much better executed before.  Mechanics so clunky that even when I was referrring to a walkthrough directly, it would often take me 20 minutes to click on whatever specific drop of blood I had failed to click on so the game would move on.  I don't understand how there got to be so many games in this series, but no one should endure this game.  I kept hoping for a creepy payoff, and it never came.  Lame right to the closing minutes.
