												So, I do recommend this game, because it's wicked fun, especially with two players, but it does have some problems.I got this game because I'm really into Batman, and I wanted to try to get my 7 year old daughter into it too.  I was playing Batman: Arkham City with her, but my wife found out about it, and she was not happy.  So, we agreed that this way more kid-friendly game was probably a good compromise.  And it is pretty kid-friendly as far as content goes.  The characters are fun, and building LEGO stuff in-game to make vehicles and such is a blast.  As far as my goal of getting my daughter into Batman, it worked like a charm, and now we're watching the movies and TV shows, and as soon as she can read I will start getting her some of the old comics.  So there's that.Now the problems:  controls and bugs.  The controls are pretty decent in single-player mode, but all hell breaks loose in multiplayer mode.  Inside a level, if you and your partner are together in the same location, and one of you moves even a tiny bit while the other is doing something where you have to stay in one spot (i.e. aiming a batarang or Superman's heat vision, spraying something with water, etc.) the aim gets totally thrown off.  If your partner is say, just hypothetically, a willful 7-year-old girl who will not listen to repeated cries of ""STOP MOVING, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!!"", it becomes hard to complete a task sometimes.  Also, if you and your partner split up, the screen splits to give each player a view of where they're going, but it doesn't split just horizontally or vertically, it splits based on where you've moved.  So, if your partner has moved above you, it splits somewhat horizontally.  However if they move off at an angle, the screen splits perpendicular to that angle, so it's not always nice and square and you end up not being able to see much.  Controls with the vehicles are mostly good, except for the flying vehicles for some reason.  It seems like they're unable to move in the vertical axis and the horizontal at the same time.  When completing flying challenges, it was mostly moving forward, stopping, then gaining or losing altitude, then stopping, then moving forward again, rather than a more fluid motion.  If the flying vehicles controlled more like the flying characters it would be better.Also, maybe this game was rushed, or maybe it's just me, but there seem to be a surprising amount of bugs and stuff in the game.  Sometimes it crashed if another program required attention or if a notification popped up from Windows, and sometimes it crashed for no reason at all.  Also, there were many places in the game where a character could get stuck and there'd be no choice but to have the other character go somewhere to unstick them.  For example, you can get stuck in a few of the gargoyles on the rooftops of Gotham City, and this would require the other player to stop what they were doing and go enter the subway system, so that both characters would be reset to whereever you exited the subway.  It's little, but when you're playing with a kid, and you can't drop what you're doing to go unstick them for the fourth time, it can become an issue.Oh, and my wife wants me to note that since the male characters tend to have more useful powers than the female characters in this game, that the unlockable Batgirl character should've been allowed to use both Batman's and Robin's power suits.  I tend to agree.All this aside, the game is really fun, with a ton of characters to unlock, vehicles to unlock, decent level diversity, and a pretty fun overworld to explore.  The inclusion of most of the 1989 Batman film soundtrack and the main theme of the 1978 Superman film is awesome.  The game ran smoothly on old hardware (3 year old video card in a 7 year old computer) and Xbox controller integration is very nice.  I'm definitely looking forward to further LEGO games, especially LEGO Marvel Superheroes.8/10, would play again.			"

												It's the Justice League + an open-world Gotham full of shenanigans + writing that's going to mock its source material at any chance it can get + one of the strongest Lego games I can think of. If your friends will visit your place, it has 2P local co-op too.  When the worst thing I can level against a game is ""it's a bit similar to the last one, but not in a bland way"", I would say that gets my seal of approval, yeah. Huge tip: rush through the story mode ASAP before you go back for collectables/unlocks, the simple ability to swap characters/turn on some of the cheats really makes that more pleasant.My only complaint: game does not feature Green Arrow, but Black Canary got in somehow. Ah well, that'll probably come up in the sequel it teases at the end. (Spoilers: it teases a sequel at the end which will probably be crazier than this.)			"

												I 'finished' the main story of this game (with help from GameFAQs and some Youtube.I'll admit, I feel 'stupid' playing the Lego games as I quite often don't 'get' what I'm supposed to do to complete each area, and I wish the saves were at any time and not so rare, as sometimes I've lost progress because I needed to quit for the day and couldn't save some progress.Still, the game is fun, its enjoyable, and worth buying.I hope there's a sequel, and it seems to hint so at the end of the game. I won't spoil the ending, but its worth watching.The voices are great. The levels fun. Its a keeper. "

												This really should've just been called LEGO Justice League as it does have quite a few members in it, but the focus is clearly Superman and Batman with a story similar to the Animated Superman episode where he works with Batman against Lex Luthor and the Joker.The game surprised me since after the first level it lets you walk around Gotham as a big open world! Not only that, but because of this that means there are many criminals hidden that you have to defeat before aquiring them as spare characters and the missions, like the last game, are replayable to get all the secrets that you either missed because you didn't see them or missed because you didn't have the powers needed.There are a lot of villains in this one, some obscure ones too like Hush too. The story is very fun, but also quite epic too which is what I've grown to learn from these Lego games and I have a hell of a lot of fun with them too.If you liked the pervious game, you'll love this one and if you want to buy this one and havn't played the first you're likly to enjoy it as there is no continuation with the story of either games, but it has been improved immensly since the last game.

												The Good:* Great, campy, 70's characters, story and visuals* Lots to do and collect* Storymode: good Lego fun around 8 hours* Replay value with Freeplay clocking in around 16 hoursThe Bad:* Messy hub map interface is confusing for a long time* Flying (esp with co-op keyboard) is almost impossible to control* Crashes every few hours* Small roster of characters with samey powers* Batarangs have very limited range and weapons fire slowly* Short 8 hour campaign is all over too soon* Freeroam has only 5 kinds of task repeated dozens of times* Co-op mared by bad design (paralysed on: change character, pick vehicle, open map, fight character, start mission, gold brick) really slow save every time you complete a task while baddies beat you up.Background: Just finished Lego LOTR & Marvel. Like Batman comic books. Indifferent to the 80's-90's movies. Disliked Lego Batman 1.Impressions: TT's continual changing of the hub world interface really bugs me. From game to game I have no idea how to navigate and spend ages trying to find a story mission.After playing Lego LOTR and Marvel this feels like a huge let down. Which is unfair since this is a smaller and older game but it makes you appreciate how much better the games got after this.Recommended for: TT Lego fans and those who like Batman really.Conclusion: 6/10. You can bump this score up 1 if your not a Gloomy Gus like me.**SPOILERS AND HINTS**I wrote this to help newbies understand how to play the game better and not flail around like I did. Follow these tips in the order shown and you'll get more out and less frustration. The spoilers are very mild (are they even spoilers?) but I'm aware not everyone wants hand holding and they are around mechanics of play, there's nothing about the story or exactly how anything is done.How to Play:1. Complete story mode first* You need to unlock characters in the final mission, don't even start on freeroam or freeplay till you complete2. Find Characters with unique talents* In freeroam (use batcomputer, pick a white dot and select to be teleported into town) fly around the sky and head for red skylight beams and land* Use the computer terminal to find a baddie, note where they are standing as they taunt you (ground, top of building, etc)* Use the ! MARKER tool to drop a marker on the baddies face in the MAP. Head for the red ! in your batcompass, locate the bad guy and walk up to them* Most baddies just take a few punches while other require you to do some cleanup or damage to the local environment before take down* Only buy the ones you want as money can be short at first: Lex, Ivy, Aquaman, Joker & Riddler are the only ones you really need3. Red Helper Bricks* To help even more get some red bricks for the now familiar helpers (esp. indicate gold bricks, attract studs, indicate mini-kit parts, stud multipliers)* Use the batcomputer or the terminals around town (blue skylights easily found with a flying character) and press SCAN on the MAP to find Red dots* As before use the marker system to mark the red dot, go to it and complete a task to reveal the brick for purchase4. Freeplay re-runs of the story missionsNow you can better complete freeplay re-runs of the story missions with all the tools you need.* Use the Batcomputer and select the numbered disks to play the story missions* Ideally collect all the minikits, rescue the guy in peril and get 100% on the stud collector for extra gold bricks5. Get Cash for freeroam vehicles, characters and red bricks* To get cash I found the stud multipliers, turned on, switch to Green Lantern, build and smash the green piles around the streets in the middle map for purple and blue studs6. How to use the Map system.While Scanning you also reveal dots that lead you to the following...* Citizens in Peril: Save the poor soles from their situation for a gold bricks* Collapsed arches: rebuild, if you have enough gold bricks, to reveal a bonus character to buy* Beat up baddies: beat enough and you can add them to your roster* Stud trails: leading to gold bricks which require certain outfits and characters* Gold items: Melt with heat vision to reveal gold bricks* Riddler/Joker boxes: Only they can open these and usually have a red brick in them* Flash Builds: Only Flash can build these structures* Vehicles: Shown on the map and take serious cash to buy* Environmental tasks: shooting stuff, remote-control, riding and pulling switches * Water: Aquaman can swim underwaterIn Missions...* Black bricks: Only Lex's ray can shatter them* Ivy flowers: Able to tunnel through the ground			"

												I've had a lot of fun playing this game with my kids. Young kids. 4-6 year olds that have had a blast.Big open world, that once unlocked, makes the game replayable.Even for an old guy like me, who enjoys open game worlds like GTA 4 and 5, I found this game very entertaining.I found this game more fun than the more recent LB3. I can't understand why the developers have steered away from open world gameplay with more recent titles.			"

												An open world lego game, similar to the Marvel Superheroes Lego game.  Lots of characters, vehicles, levels to play (and re-play), and an open world to fool around in.  I don't know what it would be like to play this with an adult (probably less frustrating) but my 6 year old absolutely loves the game, and it gets a huge recommendation from me for anyone with kids.  The entire series does, really.			"

												Of all the Lego games out there, Lego Batman 2 is the best I think. It took what worked from the other Lego games, and added more stuff to make it even more entertaining. What I think is most important to take into account here is the effort that was put into the voice cast. This was the first lego game that featured talking characters and they did one hell of a job. You'd expect this kind of quality from the Arkham games, but Lego has quite the list of A-list voice actors repraising their roles from the 90s cartoons. Additionally, this instalment adds the members of the Justice Leage as playable characters, making this the best Superman Game ever made. There is one reason to play this: to fly through the sky as superman with John Williams' score in the background. Need I say more?			"

												Another fun Lego game this was :DIt's a pretty big game so if you want to finish it 100% you should take about 18-20 hours which is nice.I'm always a fan of allot of gametime.Currently im at 60% and finished the game so im done with the game, because it has no Achievements.The storyline was a good one and the missions are lengthy.Mainly using Batman & Robin and they can use suits which have different powers, its well done.3 things in this game irritated doh:- #1 is Flying, its not very good. - #2 is The map, when ever you bring it up you must go esc > show map (and it keep shows Batcave and not your current location so you must scroll threw the map everytime)- #3 is Gold Bricks, do you even Gold Brick? because it has 250 of them and when you find 1 you have to wait like 30seconds after you get it before you can move. It's so dumb first it saves and then you can't move. So you end up keep being killed by random spawning enemy's.Other then that great game and a good deal in the Lego Batman Trilogy Pack.			"

												LEGO Batman 2 is awesome.Let me break it down; Lex Luthor loses Man of the Year to Bruce Wayne, madness ensues when the Joker breaks the ceremony, cue Bruce Wayne leaving and reappearing as Batman. He saves the day. But, an angry Lex has a new weapon used to let the villains of Gotham loose from Arkham Asylum, the Joker wreaking the most havok. Batman manages to re-capture most of the villains, but the Joker is still on the loose. The rest of the game is an epic story of cat vs. mouse searching and fighting in classic LEGO fashion. Destroying stuff and collecting studs. Unlocking characters and wreaking havok.What's noteworthy about LEGO Batman 2 is the full voice cast, the open world Gotham, which, while not huge, is respectably big if you're running around as Batman instead of flying across the map as Superman. The graphics are impressive, it seems TT keeps outdoing themselves with the lighting and textures on a number of the models. Gameplay is classic LEGO gameplay. Jump, punch, switch character, special move and camera/movement.I have to say, especially with how the game ends, I'm very excited for LEGO Batman 3, which will be set in space featuring a different villain, Green Lantern's foe Brainiac.9.3/10			"

												As far as LEGO games go, this game is definitely... well, a LEGO game.What I mean by this is that if you have ever played a LEGO game in your life then you already know everything there is to know mechanically about this game. In my experience, LEGO games are not so much about ground breaking, innovative gameplay; but rather, immensely enjoyable fun for the whole family that comes in all kinds of assorted flavors. Personally, I find the Star Wars flavor to be the best out of all of them, but for the same reason that a die-hard LOTR fan would tell you that the Lord of the Rings LEGO Games are the best.Overall, if you haven't ever played a LEGO game, then don't just buy the ""latest and greatest"". Buy a flavor you love, and I promise you won't be disappointed :)			"

I bought this quite a while ago, but I've gotten into it a lot more than I thought I would. The game is crafted very well, being able to play as Batman, Robin, Superman, the rest of the Justice League and all of Batman's iconic villians. It also has a bit of humour in it, so that's good as well. I've always liked these games, especially this one.

												It's a great game; the voice acting and the story are fantastic. However, if you've played other new Lego games(such as Lego Marvel) you will be disappointed by several things. The flight controls are wonky, the map is hard to use, and no matter who you unlock you WILL have to use Batman&Robin's suits now and again. It's still a great game though. Also, you get Superman very early and he's one of the strongest characters in any Lego game. Then you just start breezing through.			"

												LEGO Batman 2: DC Super HeroesStory - Pretty good, it's been a while since I played so I can't quite remember the plot, but the missions were beyond amazing. Good puzzles! It might be me, but it is more harder to earn studs (LEGO money)  in this game than any other LEGO game. 9/10Storyline Length - It's not too long, but it's not too short. A couple hours.AI - Well, it's LEGO, they're not dumb, but they're not smart. I can't really complain anyway, it's a children's game xD I absolutely still hate the way the city is still in chaos when you finish the game. I mean, I can see why, but I don't really like it. 7/10Experience - As I said before, city is still in chaos when you finish the game and it's hard to earn studs in this game, there are a lot of characters and a lot of puzzles. You'll have the absolute time of your life finishing the story. Great game! 8/10Graphics - It's LEGO, can't really complain. I like childish things though, so it's a 10 xD 10/10Sounds / Voice Acting - Good voice acting, good sounds. I can't really go into full detail on this, but it's simply amazing. 9/10Controls - I'll admit, it's easier to play this game (or any game, for that matter) on a controller, I'd say this game is one of the harder ones to learn on keyboard. 6/10Overall - 8/10LEGO Game, Batman, lots of characters, great storyline, what more could you ask for? Wether you're an adult or a child (go ask your mother right now xD), you will enjoy this game.			"

												Ok the reason I'm giving this lego game a thumbs up is because it's storyline mode was much better then most of the other lego gameshowever the free play mode is where I almost gave this game a thumbs down-it has wayyyyyy too many Identical missions for gold bricks (literally copy and pasted over and over at different parts of town)-it has 250 gold bricks which honestly should have been only 100-150 the rest were just identical fillers-the really bad flying mechanics/camera angles when near buildings-many bugs which show the wrong locations for things/ bugs of things being in wrong locations- one bug in particular is for a minikit  and unless you shoot down statues in a particular order and dont shoot down a previously shot down statue only then can you get that minikit so yes I was considering this game as easily one of the better lego games until the story ended and the crappy filler started for the rest of the game			"

												LEGO® Batman 2 DC Super Heroes™ is just that.  Its basically a who's who of villians & heroes from the DC universe. pretty much what Lego did for Marvel they did for DC. the game play is the same build items to help you solve puzzles or problems yo may encounter. But with every Lego game that never gets old. the story this time is basically Batman and Superman stopping both Lex Luthor and The Joker. throw in the rest of the Justice league and the rest of the Legion of doom and you are in for a fun time. controls are the same, just with the keyboard. so if thats not for u use a controller. but if all you have is a keboard i suggest using the number pad for action keys like tag jumps attack and action. i use them and works great. as i said in my last few lego reviews if you like the games  and their silly humor i recommend it. if not then pass it up. 10/10			"

												My boys love this game. And why wouldn't they? It's Batman and Legos. Gets a little frustrating when I have to bale them out of a level that they are stuck on. You basically have to rewalk the whole level to see what they missed. But the complaints are mainly due to my kids being young and lazy when it comes to playing this game. Its a good game if you love comics and Legos. If you love one or the other then maybe think hard before buying.			"

												LEGO, Batman, computer games...you would think combining them would create something wonderful. Sadly, not with 'LEGO Batman' and 'LEGO Batman 2'. I played 'LEGO Batman' and didn't really like it, thinking it was rather dull, frustrating, and hard to control with the keyboard. I later went on to 'LEGO Batman 2', hoping and half expecting improvements.'LEGO Batman 2' is a whimsical and charming game, and improved upon its predecessor by having actual voice acting in the game. (The first game just featured characters making sound effects, like grunting.) However, this game still has the clunky keyboard controls (the default configuration makes no sense to me), unfriendly camera angles, and wonky pathfinding from the first.In the end, 'LEGO Batman 2' is a mediocre PC port of a console game at best. TT Games did not bother to optimize it for the PC. The game does not automatically start in your system's default graphic resolution on the first run, which is unacceptable for a modern PC game. Plus, 'LEGO Batman 2' is best played using a controller because its keyboard controls are unintuitive. Reconfiguring the default keyboard controls improved my gaming experience a bit, but I still had to fight the weird game camera positioning.Furthermore, 'LEGO Batman 2' is really designed for co-op play because the character that I was not controlling was not helpful in fighting off bad guys and solving puzzles in the single-player mode. Yet, the game does not offer online multiplayer. Having two people playing side-by-side may be nice (and nostalgic) if it is done on a console, but less ideal on a PC, especially if both players have to huddle around a single keyboard. That may be acceptable or tolerable back in the early 90s, but not in the 2000s.  Both 'LEGO Batman' and 'LEGO Batman 2' capitalize on our love of LEGO and Batman. It is unfortunate that TT Games did not put a bit more effort into making 'LEGO Batman 2' more PC-friendly, let alone improving on its gameplay. It is frustrating and disappointing to see TT Games seemingly coast in what they do despite having the lucrative properties of LEGO and DC characters to work off of.			"

												Lego Batman 2 DC Super Heroes is yet another yet another LEGO game made by Travellers Tales. This one released in 2012. Yep, casual platformer, but the first Lego game with talking characters and free-roam. It also came out for Xbox 360, PS3, Wii, WiiU. And it also had handheld versions which are Nintendo DS, 3DS and PS Vita. They are quite different. Like, a lot of stuff in gameplay is different, levels were changed around, abilities. Oh, and no free-roam.Consoles also had DLC and achievements. No achievements for Steam. As for DLCs, you are missing out on Heroes and Villians packs, each with 5 characters. Which are probably as good as reskins.Technically, while it's better optimized than Lego Harry Potter 5-7, it's still known to be quite buggy. It still crashes sometimes, you see. I actually had two crashes in a row for pre-last level. Well, at least this game also introduced checkpoint saves.It also was using the language that I had on my OS/computer, not what I set in Steam. Which annoys me, since hearing voice in English and seeing subtitles in different language confuses my mind, as I understand both. No, translation wasn't word-to-word, that's why.Anyway, once again, it's a casual 3D platformer where you have infinite lives, has almost no challenge in combat, beat up everything to collect as much studs as possible to unlock neat stuff of tons of chars and collecting everything.Again.But this time with new additions.Again.If forget that these new additions are quite important to Lego series.For normal levels there isn't much new to write about. They seem a bit more fun. And whole combo-numbers thing changed: instead of working as studs multiplier like in the first game, it does something else. If you do a throw on enemy while the combo is ongoing, upon death he will drop 100 * Combo Number of studs. And if you do the finishing move thing, the combo number will be doubled. It's not exactly as enganging mechanic, just kinda there to make you vary things up, I guess. Shame that x10 is the max.Oh, and no more vehicle levels. Instead we have on-rails shooter. Which is nice fun, sensetive aiming aside.Now, as for important ones, characters can now talk and hub got expanded enough to be counted as free-roam now.Thanks to characters talking, the plot stepped up. While many will miss lego meme action, I think that it's a welcome feature. Like a good action/adventure/comedy, the story is quite awesome in this one, enganging. It sure beats a bit of repetetiveness of Lego games. It sure shows that this game for once has it's own storyline instead of being forced to do what movies have. Well, if forget that it also flopped a bit: It seems to mostly focus on Batman and Superman vs Lex Luthor and Joker. No villian story. And the other DC heroes, which are Justice League, appear only in the last two short levels. For shame!Ah well, at least it's awesome to play as overpowered Superman.Heck, there even was ""Lego Batman Movie"" released in the next year, which is based on plot of this game, even using modified cutscenes from here.And then there is freeroam. Between missions and so you can explore the Gotham city, which is three island with tall buildings. And tall buildings. With lots of goodies hidden in them. And you might think: Hey, I can just fly with Superman to get all the goodies. Not to mentioning that game playes Superman theme when you fly with him, which is super awesome. But sadly, the flying control in free-roam sections is badly done. I mean, it's all fine when you are just flying, but when you want to land on top of building then it goes awry. I don't feel like descripting so I shall just yell ARGH. There, good enough of explanation?Fine. It's mostly because you can't just drop immeditly to the ground and trying to tilt character down to the ground while flying will probably making him suddenly turn around and refuse to land. Or don't know, it's just painful.Then again, game itself thinks that it would be too easy if you want to get gold bricks this way and instead it will want you to find Robin or Batman costume on the ground and then climb on top of building without losing it by changing character. Which is fun from what I tried so far. Yay climbing.Navigating through it isn't as easy either. Sure doesn't help that path-studs seems to not always appears in time or take sharp turns.Anyway, for story walkthrough it was a fun game that I beat on a single breath, but I am not sure how it is when trying to collect everything. Still will take it over older titles.			"

												If you have played an Lego game then you have played them all.  Most of the mechanics and gameplay stay the same throughout the games.  That is not entirely a bad thing as the Lego games are fun, and always fun.  Lego Batman 2 is no different.  You start off with Bruce Wayne taking the Man of the Year award and throughout the game you fight classic, and some obscure DC villains among the likes of Joker, Lex Luthor, and Riddler all the way to Man-Bat and Killer Moth.  Through most of the game you will controller Batman, Robin, and Superman.  Towards the end of the game though you will be able to play as the Justice League and this is where the game really starts to shine.  Having the ability to play as all of your favorite DC heroes is an amazing addition to an already fun and enjoyable game.Lego Batman 2 is a fantastic game if you love Lego games, or just want a fun, quirky Batman game.  This game is obviously not going to be as dark and serious as the Arkham series but that does not mean this game is any less spectacular.  Lego Batman 2 is a must buy for any Lego fan or Batman fan.

												One of the more polished and creative titles in the licensed LEGO® video game franchise, alongside LEGO® Star Wars™ III: The Clone Wars™, LEGO® The Lord of the Rings™, and LEGO® Marvel™ Super Heroes. All of them released between 2011 and 2013, which was a good time for the LEGO® franchise when they were just making the transition into voice acting, while retaining much of the signature LEGO humor and introducing gameplay machanics  that went beyond just building things or blowing them up.

												Graphics: 4/5Gameplay: 5/5Story: 3/5Characters: 4.5/5Overall: 4/5I really reccomend this if you are a big batman fan like me (hence the name) or you want something really casual, this game is for you. The graphics where really smooth but sometimes it would switch from place to place. The gameplay is basically like every other Lego game... BUT WITH FRICKING VOICE ACTING! I do like it but I really miss the old traditional grunts and sound the older Lego games had. I rated the story the least because somehow I think this is more of a Superman/Batman and friends story more than a stand alone Batman game. They should have made THIS game a Justice League game with more added cities you could roam and also more backstory to the other justice league characters. and then another Batman game its self. The characters in the game are very good but sometimes characters like The Flash or Aquaman (expecially Aquaman) are very forgetable. Its like them saying hi to Batman then leaving. Overall I think this game is very good on PC/360/PS3/3DS. Thats right I think it's good on 3DS. It has no roam but It's more like a traditional Lego game and more characters! "

												Grand Theft Auto Gotham, with Legos.  It's a surprisingly good blend of Adam West Batman with Tim Burton Batman.  Lots to unlock and a good-sized area to explore outside of the regular main quests.  Amusing cutscenes, good puzzles, incentive to explore...I'm enjoying it.  Downsides:  Camera is not your friend sometimes, and you'll want to use a gamepad (which was awkward to get working to replace the keyboard-only default controls).  Also no online play, which is a shame - just two people on the same computer.			"

The game has its traditional Lego game levels but its hub world is one giant sandbox like GTA allowing you to drive over enemies and civilians. The hub world serves as unlocking mostly all of the characters and vehicles. On the negative side Superman's a♥♥♥♥♥♥and flying is a ♥♥♥♥♥. Still really worth getting if it's on sale, like now.			"

												This is another game in the long line of lego games. At this point one should know what they are in for, short story and limited plot. The fun of these games lies in the replaying of levels and finding new ways to collect all the stuff hidden around the level. In Lego Batman Dos this is taken to a new level with the introduction of an open world Gotham that one can tool around in. Theres tons of things to do and collect but it becomes repetitive about half way through. Only a completionist would love everything this has to offer. In the end its another cute lego game and has a bunch of content.			"

												Such a fun game. I've played only the story so far, with no side missions and it took me roughly 8 hours to complete (blame all my other, unplayed games). The story was simple but fun and well executed, with a good dose of humor. Switching between characters could use some work though, as well as the AI of your fellow hero(es), and sometimes characters can get stuck in the environments. Other than that, it has no big flaws. It's a free roam game, so there's plenty to do besides doing missions. The game showed me I only completed 17.5%, so it could take you well over 30 hours to fully complete; it's BIG.The graphics were excellent, with plenty of detail even though it's all LEGO parts. The animations were cute, the voice acting brilliant. Fun times all around !If you have the money to spend, go buy it. Do yourself a favor.[Rating: 83/100]			"

												This game is absolutely amazing and exactly what you want a LEGO game to be like. There is great humour and a brilliant plotline along with hours and hours of enjoyable playtime. DC fans favourite heroes and villians are all featured in their own LEGO adaptation with great fun and hilarity ensuing.The best feature is a whole city of three parts to explore with oodles to do and just place to explore ig you want to.Easily the best LEGO game out there today.

												This might be the definitive LEGO game. I think this is the first one to introduce voice-acting into the humorous cutscenes, and it really works. There's a big hub-world in Gotham city with a lot of collectables, and it works really well, much better than in LEGO: LotR, I think. There's a tonne of DC characters in this, but they mostly come in towards the end, but they do make replaying levels for that addictive 100% a lot more fun. As always, this is best enjoyed playing local co-op.			"

												Remember when getting 1,000,000 studs was an achievement in itself well I do. In a matter of 8 hours I managed to grind my way through the boring levels that really didn't feel fun like some of the levels of the other lego titles. and grab all 20 or so red bricks and grab 500,000,000 studs in that time as well. it was insanely easy to get money, and characters.overall the game is just too easy no challenges exept for the lego gotham gold brick level. doing freeplay on the levels didn't feel like a real free play because in the end of some of the levels you'd still need batman and robin to proceed through them so it felt like playing the game in story all over again. Now the way the story worked was really horrible. you play through 100% of the story as batman and robin(sometimes), then superman comes in about 10-15% in. The rest of the justice league doesn't show up until the last 2 missions of the story. only 10% of the story. BUT I loved the uniqueness of each of the characters, the open world style gotham was the most fun of the whole game. I absolutely loved going through gotham and grabbing the gold bricks, each time getting one was different. and saving the citizens was also just a blast. like i really was trying to save gotham's citizens from danger. The vehicle's were fun, each of the boats had different speeds and handling capabilities, as well as the cars. The planes were fun. BUT the helecopters were a challenge in themselves their handling was really difficult, long hard turns, and rising in the air(including flying characters as well) was slow and just no fun to try out. If you were to get this game it'd be only for the open world hub, not the levels or the story.  really I'd give it a slight 6/10 just because of the fun I had with the open world.			"

												LEGO Batman 2 was originally supposed to bring together the two most popular and successful DC superheroes in a spectacular team-up. Unfortunately Scooby-Doo was unavailable due to legal complications and was replaced by Superman. The odd couple of the DC Universe, Batman-Superman is one of the most oxymoronic superhero team-ups ever, after all, one of them is powerful, smart, and amazing, a veritable god amongst men, and the other one's Superman.The reason this team-up works is because Batman makes up for all the weaknesses of Superman. For example, Superman has a fatal allergy to Kryptonite, an ultra-rare substance that can only be found in supervillain gift shops and sometimes on eBay. Superman is also hyper gluten-intolerant and can be killed by a well thrown muffin. Fortunately, none of the supervillains know this. Batman of course has no weaknesses. He's only slightly vulnerable to guns and knives. And sharp sticks and heavy rocks.Everyone thinks Batman wears Kryptonite underpants because Superman is a dirty alien and Batman doesn't trust him. This isn't true. He does it to protect the self-esteem of his friend. If Superman was foolish enough to use his X-Ray vision to check out the size of Batman's package he would be totally embarrassed by his own inadequacy and probably fly off into the Phantom Zone in shame, never to return.The reason why recalcitrant loner Batman is so awesome, is because of his tragic past. Born as Bruce Wayne, his parents were wealthy billionaire philanthropists who made regular fully tax-deductible donations to charity via their anonymous Panama trust fund. As founders of the ""Wayne Foundation for Kids Who Can't Read Good And Wanna Do Other Stuff Good Too,"" they were also extremely humble and modest. They even built the tallest skyscraper in Gotham and named it Wayne Towers to remind everyone how humble and modest they were. Sadly they were murdered in a botched robbery when Bruce was very young. As to why two wealthy individuals would want to rob a homeless peripatetic hobo remains a mystery to this day.Instead of wallowing in self-pity and turning to hookers and cocaine, young Bruce became obsessed with vigilantism and justice. However he had a strict credo against killing and felt that all criminals could be reformed, even the hardened psychotic ones. A policy he no doubt stole from the Greens. One day after attending PAX, he had an epiphany. Perhaps he could reform criminals by scaring them straight. He also realised that what really terrified people to the core of their souls was bad cosplay. However, becoming obese and dressing as Lara Croft was not a realistic option. Dressing as a bat was the next best thing.Because Superman wants to be more like Batman, he also conveniently has a tragic past. His real name is Kal-Fail and although raised by humans, he is really an alien from the planet Krapton. The Kraptonians were a highly intelligent and advanced race that somehow managed to blow up their own planet in an event known as the ""Great Fuster Cluck"". Superman named his alter-ego Cluck Fuster Kent in memory of this event. Superman's real dad Kal-Zone tried to warn everyone but nobody trusted him because he looked like choleric phone-throwing New Zealander Russell Crowe. Superman only survived the catastrophe because his parents were ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They really hated him and sent him on a one-way trip to Earth, one of the worst places in the universe. Even episodes of Hanna Montana didn't deter them from this lunacy.Coincidentally Kraptonians look identical to humans which was fortuitous for Superman and the budget of every Superman movie ever made. Growing up in Kansas, Superman fights for Truth, Justice and The American Way. Enigmatically, Superman doesn't explain what The American Way means except perhaps hinting that it's orthogonal to Truth and Justice, but it probably involves eating copious amounts of high fructose corn syrup[drhyman.com]. Fortunately for Superman, he derives all his sustenance from sunlight which is not only fat free but gluten-free and approved by the Heart Foundation.Naturally Batman and Superman don't always work alone, but are part of a crime-fighting bowling club named the Justice League. All members of the Justice League have wonderful powers that rival even those of Superman (but not Batman). Fortunately for fans, some of the more notable members of the Justice League like Flash, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Cyborg and Martian Manhater become playable characters towards the end of the game.Flash, also known as ""The Fastest Man Alive,"" gets his superpowers and reputation from being very fast. Testimonials from his numerous disgruntled ex-girlfriends confirm that he's entirely deserving of his unflattering sobriquet. Nobody is sure exactly how he uses this talent for crime-fighting, and nobody really wants to know, but it works.Wonder Woman is named after the enchanted Wonder Bra that she wears. It has the uncanny power to hypnotise men sending them into a vacuous drooling stupor. Also voted the ""#1 Superhero I want to be caught by"" in Supervillain Monthly five years running.Green Lantern derives his power from bad poetry. Before he fights, he recites a poem about the brightest day and the darkest night, the birds and the bees, and what not. While his opponent is trying to work out whether it's some kind of magic haiku or maybe a clever pickup line, he runs up and kicks them in the bread basket. It's a technique so effective it's been used by the Guardians of the Universe to keep the peace for thousands of years.Cyborg as his name implies, is half-man and half-machine, deriving his superpowers from an accident involving superglue and a washing machine. Now all he wants to do is clean up crime. Just don't ask him where his USB port is.Martian Manhater is possibly the most controversial member of the Justice League. A feminist alien cougar from Mars, also sometimes known as Left-Wing Liberal Chick, she gets her superpowers from getting people all riled up over gender inequality.LEGO Batman 2 is a vast improvement over LEGO Batman, with better visuals and dynamic split screen for co-op mode. The plot is your typical buddy superhero melodrama spiced with irreverent comedy. Humourous banter during cutscenes accentuate the friendly rivalry between Batman and Superman, playing the slightly dysfunctional but successful relationship to good effect. The addition of voice acting also greatly enhances the storytelling with Batman voiced competently by Troy Baker instead of the inimitable Kevin Conroy.The most significant enhancement to gameplay is the open-world LEGO rendition of Gotham City that is impressive in both scope and detail. The entire city is quite large, even containing a zoo, and an amusement park with working rides. Although there are fast travel points to expedite travel, it's definitely more fun to walk, drive or fly. Unlike it's squeaky clean counterpart Metropolis, Gotham is a dark gritty city, ensnared in a preternatural perpetual twilight. Supervillain henchmen prowl the streets waiting for vigilante justice to be meted out upon them, and the city itself is replete with puzzles and challenges to complete.As with the prequel, this game is better with a co-op partner than solo. I had the opportunity to test this with a 4-year old co-op partner whose favourite activity is flying around Gotham as Superman; even though I helpfully suggested many times that Batman is a far better character. Having completed the game to 100%, LEGO Batman 2 is definitely bigger, longer and better than it's predecessor, and gets another two thumbs up from Batman and jaywalking Robin.			"

												Argh. Basically, I was disappointed with this game. I played the previous one on ds, and I loved it. Absolutely love it.Starting this game, first few minutes, it was alright.But the more I played it the more tedious it became.The enviroments were large in area, but lack in detail. You can stray from your objective and explore aimlessly into empty areas. Countless times I've found myself on top of a tall building and then, realising that I had nothing to do there, jumping off to my death. I never thought I'd say this for a game, but some invisible barriers would be nice.  I just feel like this game drags it on a bit too much, maybe I'll go invest in the ds version.			"

Playing Superman-at-large is a lesson in patience-while-being-pummeled-to-death-by-marshmallows-(-or-something-)-:-)-)-)Free play (and changing characters in this mode) has been reduced to a farce.I've pointed out my issues with other LEGO titles; but I still had fun playing them; so had my kids; this one sucks; says me; say my kids.

												Really bad game compared to the rest of the Lego games that has been made. 1st Lego Batman is far superior than this and yeh I know the Justice league is in this one but that dont make it better. The movement is super slow when in the city. One minute your running super fast next you are struggling to even turn left or right. And no it's not my game lagging for those that might think so. The Hazard suit is the worst of em all. Most annoying♥♥♥♥♥♥i ever dealt with!!. Theres no suit upgradfes from what i seen so far which is a big letdown seeing how it takes 3 damn hits with the batarang per object to demolish em. 1st Lego game i have not liked as of yet. Played Lego LOTR and Hobbit, HP years 1-4 and 5-7, Marvel Super Heroes and Star Wars the complete saga and all those games were made properly. I would hate to see what the 3rd lego Batman game is like . I know i aint gonna get a refund for this trash so i will have no choice but to get steam to remove it from my library permanatly like i've already done to plenty of other trash games ive sadly purchased over the last 3 years			"

												Normally I love and adore LEGO games. Figuring out the puzzles and going back through the game to get all the collectables and unlocks are a huge part of the game for me. However the open world enviroment that is required for this now is painfully boring and in the end not really worth it. First time I shelved a LEGO game after compleating the storyline. I was very let down by the Open World enviroment and hope this is not a trend to come in future LEGO games.			"

												Faulty's scorecard :-1) Essential purchase2) Recommended purchase3) Recommended purchase during a sale4) Not recommended unless heavily discounted5) Not even recommended for Steam game collectorsHold on to your blocksOver the years we have seen Traveler's Tales take several iconic film properties and give them the LEGO makeover. This strategy has proven to be incredibly successful for both Traveler's Tales and publisher Warner Bros. with LEGO games consistently outselling numerous other big name properties and franchises on the consoles and now to coincide with the release of Jurassic World we get the LEGO version which also happens to contain condensed LEGO versions of the first three movies including, of course, the biggest blockbuster of 2015 so far (until the new Star Wars movie arrives) - Jurassic WorldThese people obviously never watched Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds. A Screenshot of LEGO® Jurassic WorldBy: Sir FaultyIf you are not a fan of this kid-friendly branding exercise, the humor or the simplistic puzzles then I suggest you stop reading now and move along. However, if you happen to enjoy a bit of LEGO mayhem in-between playing your other games, enjoy the sly parodies on display or just happen to be a massive fan of the film franchise then LEGO Jurassic World pays just enough lip service to the originals that should have fans chomping at the bit.Once again you will find yourself exploring various film scenes from all four of the movies smashing everything in sight to bits while piles of unbuilt LEGO will bounce up and down around you indicating that you can build some sort of device or structure that will enable story progression. While LEGO Jurassic World does incredibly little to tinker with what makes these games so addictive and well loved amongst many, the game mechanics have been slightly overhauled indicating that Traveler's Tales seems to be getting a better handle on the LEGO engine than its previous iterations but like any film licensed product LEGO Jurassic World has the air about it of something that was rushed to the market in order to meet the deadlines determined by the release of the film. Characters repeatedly get stuck in the environment causing the player to have to reboot out of the level and restart it. This can sometimes get incredibly frustrating especially when you are near the end of a level only for this to occur forcing you right back to the beginning. Traveler's Tales have implemented a save feature at certain mid-points in the levels but they very sporadic with some not having any save feature mid-way at all.LEGO Jurassic World_Jurassic Park 3-5 A Video of LEGO® Jurassic WorldBy: Sir FaultyPart 3-5 of Jurassic Park in LEGO Jurassic World playing story mode. Played on PC through Steam. Game can be purchased at the following link:- While I did not experience many bugs throughout my first playthrough, perusing the forums reveals a host of issues that are preventing people from completing the game. While from a production stand point LEGO Jurassic World looks fantastic and is a very strikingly good looking LEGO game; the game does tend to feel a bit more rushed than its predecessors but I suppose that boils down to the fact that most of the scenes in LEGO Jurassic Park mimic the fight and flight scenes from the original movies which does require the action to fly thick and fast. With that being said there is hardly a lull in any of the games 20 chapters (5 across each film) as they move at a breakneck pace. As a huge fan of the franchise I really enjoyed the LEGO treatment given to the films so much so that LEGO Jurassic Park has emerged as my favorite LEGO game to come from TT Games thus far.Where the game does tend to falter is in the use of its voice overs. Certain scenes are mixed in with the original dialogue from the movies but the movie dialogue sounds tinny and it becomes quite jarring to hear famous lines from the movie sound like they being beamed in from the inside of a soda can compared to the clarity of voice work composed specifically for the game.Now I am sure we can settle this amicably A Screenshot of LEGO® Jurassic WorldBy: Sir FaultyLEGO Jurassic World is not going to win over any new fans but for those who enjoy these kinds of games it's a fun and wild romp through all four films and is the perfect game for families playing some couch co-op over the weekend. The humor is as sharp as ever and should have most adults that play it giggling away like children. LEGO Jurassic World gets the all clear in my books. You are free to enter the park.If you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-Curator Rater Was this review helpful?

												LEGO Batman 2 is the first LEGO game that I’ve actually finished. Well, I may be slightly abusing the term “finished” here. My playthrough ended recently at 22.3%. So “abandoned” might be a more apt characterization, although in fairness to me, I did complete the story mode. I started playing the first game in this series and abandoned it fairly early on, probably due to the fact that the keyboard-and-mouse controls are abominable. Setting up a controller to play and actually playing with a controller are a breeze but do not–under any circumstances–attempt to play this game without one.All of the LEGO games are built on a similar foundation: smashing enemies and collecting bricks/studs with which to purchase unlocks/abilities. There is some platforming involved but puzzles are essentially limited to figuring out which superpower/suit is needed to remove an obstacle to progress. As such the gameplay is amusing in short bursts but tiresome over the long haul, especially if you’re 1) over the age of 10; and 2) playing by yourself.The story is a slight but entertaining tale that begins with The Joker and various other Bat-villains robbing the guests at Gotham’s Man of the Year awards ceremony and segues into Lex Luthor recruiting The Joker to aid him in his bid to win the presidency of the United States. Batman and Robin eventually have to call Superman to help out, and eventually, with the Last Son of Krypton greatly weakened by exposure to Kryptonite, the JLA shows up to aid in the capture of the evil duo. (Interestingly, Superman is almost too powerful in this game, as he’s essentially invulnerable to harm and has abilities that the Dynamic Duo need four different suits to replicate.) The game doesn’t take itself too seriously and once you get past the major conceit that all of these characters are essentially self-aware toys, it’s pretty funny.Once you’ve completed the story in LEGO Batman 2, you can take any currently-unlocked character and faff about in Gotham City, looking for imperiled citizens to rescue or miscreants to defeat. Although the game drops frequent hints about nearly every other aspect of gameplay, the method of actually unlocking characters remains somewhat obscure. Occasionally during a fight (for characters) or while wandering the cityscape and passing near an object (for vehicles), you will receive a button prompt and a message advising you that you can purchase that item for x number of studs. Once you do, that item is added to your roster/garage. In the course of your travels, you will discover items that can only be interacted with using the abilities of specific characters such as Poison Ivy, Man-Bat, or The Joker. However, actually obtaining those characters appears to be a surprisingly trial-and-error affair. Upon completion of the story, I had Batman, Robin, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Cyborg, and a few assorted goons unlocked for a grand total of 12 out of 60 unlockable characters. (You can also replay any section of the story in “Free Play” mode (meaning with access to any unlocked character), but of course this approach suffers from the same shortcomings I mentioned above.)The game looks and sounds great, but we come back to the fundamental problem of gameplay and the nature of LEGO games. These are games that are meant for kids and co-op. They are meant to be played several times, uncovering more bits and bobs on each playthrough. These are all concepts that are antithetical to the way that I play games. I don’t have kids or a gamer spouse and I rarely play through a game more than once. Kids don’t really mind repetition and doing the same thing ad nauseum; in fact, I’d venture to say psychologists probably have some term for a childhood phase during which they absolutely thrive on it. As an adult, I don’t normally bother with replays simply because if a game offers nothing new on a replay other than a different character, it doesn’t have enough novel content to justify spending my time.

												... originally i wasn't going to write a review... this game had definate problems... but it was one of the first open world lego games,so i was willing to cut it some slack.  i mean there is an ungodly amount of padding when it comes to the collectables. you can't really use one of the main draws of the game, the fact that you can play as a bunch of the differant dc characters, until the end of the game. the fact that the flight controls are vomitaious pig droppings.  but again i was willing to overlook these short comings... THEN THE GAME DECIDED TO SCREW ME!  to get all of the characters you have to get all the gold lego blocks, that means saving all the citizens, doing all the chalanges in the city, doing all of the god awful races with the god awful flight controls, getting super hero in all the levels, and getting all the mini kits, and here in lies the problem, one of the mini kits in level 13 was glitched... look i don't know if i just got screwed or if this is a problem across the board. but this was serously the final straw for me. when i played lego marvel i loved it and when i saw lego batman 2 on sale i thought i hit the freaking jackpot, turns out it was more like the video game equivilant of the short story ""the lottery.""  it's fine if you're just gonna play through the campaign but if you're just gonna do that wait for it to go on sale cus thats only about a third of the content, and i certainly can't suggest this to collectithon fan like me for the reason above... all i can hope for is that beyond gotham restores my faith in this team. (addendum: as of 11/6/14 i have found out that the minikit was not glitched and it was in act my fault. i rescind my claim that the game screwed me, but my other point about this game still stand)			"

												LEGO Batman 2 is the sequel to LEGO Batman... which is obvious. I don't completely know why I got this since I didn't care much for the first LEGO Batman, but this one is an improvement. I'm not too far into the game, but I can tell you it is definitely not bad.The story isn't too bad. The Joker is trying to defeat Batman once again, but this time Lex Luthor is by his side along with many other villains. Like LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, this game mixes the super hero/comic book storyline with what you expect from a Lego game very well. The gameplay is pretty much what you expect from a Lego game- do missions, build stuff, get gold bricks, get characters, etc. It is fun, but there's something about the LEGO Batman games that seem a bit boring to me as far as levels go and I don't really know what it is. When you aren't doing missions, you can free roam around Gotham City, like you can free roam around New York in LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, and this is pretty fun. The graphics for LEGO Batman 2 are about the same as most Lego games. Gotham City has the kind of look that reminds you of the Batman Arkham games, which fits very well with Batman. The animations look good as well.Probably the main problems I have with this game are what I mentioned before about the levels and the amount of characters. I don't have all of them yet, but there don't seem to be very many. From what I can tell, there's probably around 50 of them. Not bad, but still much less than I expected.LEGO Batman 2 definitely isn't the best Lego game so far, but it is definitely not the worst either. It has a plot that goes good with both Batman/DC Comics and Lego, entertaining free roam, and a good amount of characters. However, if you're looking for a Lego game that you'll be playig for hours at a time, go with LEGO Marvel Super Heroes or LEGO Star Wars.I give LEGO Batman 2 an 8/10.			"

												This is a fun game. Tends to be on the easier side, but it is a lego game. I really, really wish that there were Steam Achievements for this game, as I would probably have another completed game. I got this game on sale for $5 and got 24 hours of play out of it. I am happy with that. There were a few bugs here and there, but it wasn't bad. This is the first Lego game I have played since the Star Wars Lego games, so I don't really know how this compares against more recent titles. Have fun playing it!			"

												Do you love the DC Universe, particularly Batman and Superman?  Have you ever wished that you could enter into a living, breathing Gotham City just like the one in the comics.  If so, LEGO Batman 2 is the game for you.  This LEGO-ized version of the DC Universe is right at home among such Batman interpretations as the Burton films or the incredible Batman: The Animated Series.  The first truly open-world licensed LEGO video game from TT Games, LEGO Batman 2 features by far the best video game adaptation of Batman's home city.  While Rockskteady's Arkham games feature better gameplay and are better games overall, their adaptations of Gotham itself come nowhere near the version in LEGO Batman 2.LEGO BATMAN 2 gets a 9.5 OUT OF 10			"

												Not as good storytelling as Batman.  Did not like the Joker in this one - the face and voice were grating.  Several of the gold bricks in Gothan were very annoying to find and get. The idle animation for several of the characters were hilarious.  Loved the wing/flight animation for Hawkman and girl.  Recommend only if you are a diehard lego game fan.			"

												LEGO Batman 2 is the sequel to LEGO Batman... which is obvious. I don't completely know why I got this since I didn't care much for the first LEGO Batman, but this one is an improvement. I'm not too far into the game, but I can tell you it is definitely not bad.The story isn't too bad. The Joker is trying to defeat Batman once again, but this time Lex Luthor is by his side along with many other villains. Like LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, this game mixes the super hero/comic book storyline with what you expect from a Lego game very well. The gameplay is pretty much what you expect from a Lego game- do missions, build stuff, get gold bricks, get characters, etc. It is fun, but there's something about the LEGO Batman games that seem a bit boring to me as far as levels go and I don't really know what it is. When you aren't doing missions, you can free roam around Gotham City, like you can free roam around New York in LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, and this is pretty fun. The graphics for LEGO Batman 2 are about the same as most Lego games. Gotham City has the kind of look that reminds you of the Batman Arkham games, which fits very well with Batman. The animations look good as well.Probably the main problems I have with this game are what I mentioned before about the levels and the amount of characters. I don't have all of them yet, but there don't seem to be very many. From what I can tell, there's probably around 50 of them. Not bad, but still much less than I expected.LEGO Batman 2 definitely isn't the best Lego game so far, but it is definitely not the worst either. It has a plot that goes good with both Batman/DC Comics and Lego, entertaining free roam, and a good amount of characters. However, if you're looking for a Lego game that you'll be playig for hours at a time, go with LEGO Marvel Super Heroes or LEGO Star Wars.I give LEGO Batman 2 an 8/10.			"

												Surprisingly fun game. I purchased it because it was cheap, but have fully enjoyed it. Many parts of the game is actually challenging in figuring out exactly what to do. The huge array of vehicles and characters keeps the game interesting. And the free style makes it even more fun. Kinda a calm blend of action mixed with some GTA for good measure. Worth a check out.			"

												There needs to be a third  option for ""do you recommend this game?""Lego Batman 2 introduces a lot of nice new features, like a giant city hubworld to explore that feels a lot like the city from Arkham City, as well as opening up the character roster beyond the batman universe, and many of these characters feel different to play as.But Lego Batman 2 is still a lego game.  A puzzler brawler hybrid that's about a step above a facebook game... and for me that loses it's apeal fast.  It's still got some entertainment value... the original story and voice acting actually serve the game quite nicely.  But if you've played other lego games and found yourself getting bored, look for this on sale or skip it entirely.  After a 10 hour story and 2 hours of just messing around, you may not find yourself anxious to return again.			"

												If you've played other IP-based LEGO games by Traveler's Tales, you already know what you're in for.  If not, you don't know  what you're missing!As usual, this game improves on the system a bit.  The character's powers are quite a bit more varied than usual.  Some characters actually have multiple powers, instead of the usual one-power-per-character.  They also used the power-by-costume system for Batman and Robin, which I'm not really a fan of, but it does add some puzzles to the game.There is also an open world for the maps between the levels.  Think of GTA, but smaller.My only complaint is that there are no achievements for the Steam version!  To get cheevos, you'd have to shell out almost twice as much money and get it on PS3 or 360.  Ah well, no matter.  The goals are all pretty clear in LEGO games, so you don't need a list of achievements to figure out what's going on.			"

												This game is amazing, although the story is a bit short, but that is made up in free-roam around Gotham city. You can drive in and out of the Batcave in free roam, as well as the the enterance for the Batboat and Batwing. I love everything except a couple annoying little things. It is always night and raining. This is exactly how i thought Gotham would look, but it gets a little annoying after a while. LEGO needed to make a daytime option for the game. The flying controls are a little frustrating, but i found myself not flying that much. There aren't a huge amount of characters, but you just have to make do with what you get. Green Lantern was the most dissappointing as you can't make anything with his ring, except for certain points in levels. And once you complete the game, there are some constructs that you can make that stretch all over Gotham. I found this really annoying as when you were driving you would have to doge them as it would sometimes flip your car/bike. One of the most annoying problems was that there were no steam achievements, so once you fully completed the game, there were no steam achevements to do. It sounds like this game is really bad, but i just pointed out the main problems with it, everything else is great.I highly recommend this game.Score: 8.5/10			"

												As a follow-up to the first LEGO Batman title, LEGO Batman 2 has a lot going for it, including a much larger cast of characters, varied levels and a concise storyline, but I think it stands out most for the open-world of Gotham you can explore and (chronologically) the first inclusion of voice-acting to the series. In comparison to its prequel, a number of improvements made the experience much more seamless, including better controls, split-screen multiplayer no longer restricted to a small portion of the level, and puzzles that made better use of additional characters. The vehicle levels, while repetitive, were much more fun to play this time around. I did find some of the Gold Brick puzzles in the open-world somewhat frustrating, whether by poor design or requiring a specific character (and often specific suit). Overall a solid game, the one downside being I felt the new character roster wasn't appropriately integrated, only requiring Superman or Green Lantern a handful of times, and newcomers Flash and Cyborg serving almost no purpose.

Batman and Robin have several power ups in the form of suits Batman has electric, stealth, and bulky bomb suit Robin has freeze, acrobat, and squatter(fluids).The thing I hate the most is Superman he is just over powered someone loved this guy a little to much when they made this game he CAN NOT DIE even when hes crippled any part of the game with him just make it to easy. why play with Batman when you can just play with Superman and never lose.Not A long game took me 3 days to beat didn't get a lot of the golden blocks 100ish.(Computer Specs)Processor: AMD FX(tm)-4130 Quad-Core ProcessorVideo Card:	NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660Memory:	8.2 GBOperating System:	Microsoft Windows 10			"

												Better graphics and a great story, really funny as well. The first time you get to fly Superman around the open world Gotham with the classic theme playing in the background? It will be one of your more memorable gaming moments, a slight shame then that the flying controls are so unresponsive and that the open world just amounts to getting to the end of the game and then working down the map, using the correct character or suit on some really easy to follow obstacle courses and vehicles races.The replay value of the missions is much better, and the red bricks from the earlier games but oddly absent from LEGO Batman 1 are back, allowing the gold bricks just to become progress monitors and a way of limiting which characters you can purchase from certain doorways in the city.Definitely fun, and the voices add a lot, and there is a genuine sense of humour that fits right in with the characters (Batman dislikes Superman, who is oblivious, but Robin absolutely hero worships him, much to Batman's annoyance). The final missions, when you get to play all the Justice League characters (especially The Flash - the animation for him is just superb on every level) is just a little slice of geek heaven. Definitely fun, and definitely worth getting.			"

You'll find yourself picking this up for 30 or 45 minutes every once in a while to achieve a new Red Brick or playable Character. Very fun.			"

												LEGO Batman 2 is the sequel to LEGO Batman... which is obvious. I don't completely know why I got this since I didn't care much for the first LEGO Batman, but this one is an improvement. I'm not too far into the game, but I can tell you it is definitely not bad.The story isn't too bad. The Joker is trying to defeat Batman once again, but this time Lex Luthor is by his side along with many other villains. Like LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, this game mixes the super hero/comic book storyline with what you expect from a Lego game very well. The gameplay is pretty much what you expect from a Lego game- do missions, build stuff, get gold bricks, get characters, etc. It is fun, but there's something about the LEGO Batman games that seem a bit boring to me as far as levels go and I don't really know what it is. When you aren't doing missions, you can free roam around Gotham City, like you can free roam around New York in LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, and this is pretty fun. The graphics for LEGO Batman 2 are about the same as most Lego games. Gotham City has the kind of look that reminds you of the Batman Arkham games, which fits very well with Batman. The animations look good as well.Probably the main problems I have with this game are what I mentioned before about the levels and the amount of characters. I don't have all of them yet, but there don't seem to be very many. From what I can tell, there's probably around 50 of them. Not bad, but still much less than I expected.LEGO Batman 2 definitely isn't the best Lego game so far, but it is definitely not the worst either. It has a plot that goes good with both Batman/DC Comics and Lego, entertaining free roam, and a good amount of characters. However, if you're looking for a Lego game that you'll be playig for hours at a time, go with LEGO Marvel Super Heroes or LEGO Star Wars.I give LEGO Batman 2 an 8/10.			"

												LEGO Batman 2 is a great game, it brings in other DC Super Heroes that one would not normally expect to be in the Batman franchise, these characters include Superman, -- I'll let you find out for yourself, but trust me, it's a great game. Even though it's not the newest edition in the LEGO Batman 2 trilogy, it's still a game worth buying, especially with this snag of a deal! (The deal may be ended by the time you read this review.) LEGO Batman 2 brings a very entertaining campaign with many things to do after completing the campaign. With unique and fun characters to unlock, awesome rewards, and more - LEGO Batman 2 is a game worth purchasing for anybody, despite it's aim towards a younger crowd.			"

												LEGO Batman 2: DC Superheroes does what LEGO Marvel Superheroes did for the DC Universe. It brings live and character to many of the characters from the DC universe, so you can play as all of them doing lots of fun and wacky things within a relatively open world with a linear campaign to keep you busy for 10 hours.As a huge fan of the Marvel game, and having been somewhat disappointed with the first LEGO Batman game, I had high expectations of its sequel. LEGO Batman 2, as I understand it is the first LEGO game which raises the bar of engrossment with added speech to the characters and it's a fundamental part of the fun of these games.You'll obviously get to play as Batman and Robin again with various ""suits"" which give Batman and Robin various abilities. As well as the duo, you'll be able to play as the Justice League members and the supervillans - once unlocked of course. There are incredible single use mechanics where you'll be cruising the streets of gotham tearing apart a giant robot, crashing down to the ground avoiding bits of broken metal and more.The diversity in gameplay will not ever keep you bored or disinterested, and the characters won't keep you from laughing. You'll find as with most titles there's far more content and things to do that aren't associated to the campaign and the campaign makes up for 20% of the completion, providing endless fun for those who have a greater interest in the DC universe. This title is a real winner and is worth the time for anybody who likes LEGO, DC Comics or Batman.			"

												There needs to be a third  option for ""do you recommend this game?""Lego Batman 2 introduces a lot of nice new features, like a giant city hubworld to explore that feels a lot like the city from Arkham City, as well as opening up the character roster beyond the batman universe, and many of these characters feel different to play as.But Lego Batman 2 is still a lego game.  A puzzler brawler hybrid that's about a step above a facebook game... and for me that loses it's apeal fast.  It's still got some entertainment value... the original story and voice acting actually serve the game quite nicely.  But if you've played other lego games and found yourself getting bored, look for this on sale or skip it entirely.  After a 10 hour story and 2 hours of just messing around, you may not find yourself anxious to return again.			"

												For a lego game, DEAR GOD! This was amazing. All of your favorite DC characters rolled in to one epic adventure with legos. Generally Lego Games are glitchy as F@#$, but this glitched maybe twice and they were easy to fix with a reset of the game. Not like Lord of the Rings legos... Don't even get me started on how glitchy that freaking game is after the story is over. Seriously, though! This game is great! Go get it and have fun with Super Man and the Flash!			"

												this game isn't terrible, there are lots of things to do and characters to unlock and my kids found it pretty entertaining, there was one unanimous conviction, this game pales compared to lego marvel superheroes, and not because its DC comics based. the controls clearly evolved as the development studio got better at making this kind of game. control decisions and camera angles in this game was often like pulling teeth.... from a crocadile.... while it was awake. If you've already played lego marvel, skip this title. it will only frustrate you. Here's to hoping lego batman 3 is superior in its execution. i'll give it a tentative recommendation, but be prepared for frustration, finding all of the unlockables was also frustrating because the tools you have to work with are not clear and you're often left wondering how you're supposed to get the gold brick you're staring at.

												Definitely an improvement of the first LEGO Batman videogame.Now featuring:- Better level design (although they are less in number now)- Lots of new characters to play as.- The game's main hub is Gotham City, featuring free-roam across it to hunt collectibles and start the main missions.I can definitely recommend the game, even it the free-roaming aspect of it feels kind of awkward the first times you experience it.

												this game is personally one of my favorite lego games on the planet. it has great puzzles, awesome characters, and a lot of suits with different creative abilities than in the first game. this series has 3 games so far, this one being my favorite, but i am looking forward too the 4th (if there is one) and also looking forward too the new lego batman movie coming out some time in 2017 hoping that it contributes to the series.

												LEGO Batman 2 introduces 2 new things to the LEGO videogames universe: voice acting and open world exploration. The voice acting is cool but to be honest is nothing special. Exploring Gotham City without bothering with missions is actually fun. There's also an original story, and it gets the job done. The game mainly focuses on Batman, Robin and Superman, and only towards the end of the game the rest of the Justice League members are introduced, which is a bit disappointing. But the core gameplay is what you expect from the LEGO videogames formula, which is a good thing. But the game crashed a few times for me, and flying in the open world sucks. Despite these flaws, this is one the best LEGO videogames i have played, and i recommend it on sale you if you like these LEGO videogames.			"

												The game is very good. Along the lines of other lego games with puzzle solving,stud hunting and unlocking of characters. Liked the idea of roaming around gotham city and fighting crime. Found flying controls for characters a bit difficult at first but managed to master them soon after. Pity that DLC characters were not included in the game. Highly recommend the game to all lego/superhero fans.			"

												A great follow up to the first game.  It has a bigger cast but the characters all feel relevant and useful.  One of the funner free roam experiences in a Lego game.  Sometimes I just drive around Gotham just to drive.The story is still solid but I did not enjoy it as much as the other Lego hero games.  It remains nonetheless a solid entry with high replay value for all ages.I recommend it especially for kids and parents that like to play co-op.			"

												Like almost all of the LEGO games I've played, this is a great game for anyone of almost any age or skill level. This is the only Batman LEGO game I've played thus far. The music is excellent, it seems to be pulled directly from the Tim Burton movies, which is great! The stories for the missons are fun, but ultimately don't really matter. Good voice acting to boot.I almost exclusively play this with a young child and it's a blast.			"

												Batman is a popular icon. He has had many games, so many TV shows about him, and a bunch of kids dressed like him for halloween.Anyway, LEGO Batman 2 is a good game. It has cool puzzles, great storyline, but there are a few things about it:if(game_crashes) {The game freezes randomly.That freeze may cause the game to crash.};there fix dat code.It is still good. Other than those bugs, I recommend you play this LEGO game!9/10 would bonk 100 pound weights on the riddler again			"

												Took the gameplay of the original Lego Batman and expanded a ton of it, there's open world, you can drive vehicles now in the game which is really awesome. The only thing I didn't really like is that the side missions probably pertain to unlocking other DC heroes and heroines but other then that it was great. The story wasn't the greatest but it was good.			"
