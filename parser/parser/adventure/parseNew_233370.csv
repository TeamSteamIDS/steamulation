												I initially bought this game at full price due to the positive early reviews (which were mostly based on the first chapter).Unfortunately, the game is severely broken for many users and the developers have done little to fix these issues since the game's release. These are not only minor bugs or annoyances, but critical game breaking issues.I usually love these types of adventure games, but in this case, I have been unable to progress beyond the first chapter (disregard the deceptive amount of hours on record; I have left the game running in the background on several occasions while running errands, sleeping or looking for solutions to the problems I've encountered). It is unlikely that I will get a refund as I bought the game long before Steam's refund policies were changed. Instead, I want to warn future potential buyers of the problems they may encounter.Take a look at the forum posts below:Bug thread (13 pages so far): https://steamcommunity.com/app/233370/discussions/0/846959998013346908/Save games disappearing (this is my biggest issue at the moment, as you can see by my posts to the below threads):https://steamcommunity.com/app/233370/discussions/0/594820656460543503/https://steamcommunity.com/app/233370/discussions/0/540734168144496448/https://steamcommunity.com/app/233370/discussions/0/34095131971716840/Linux/Mac issues (there are too many of these threads to list them all):https://steamcommunity.com/app/233370/discussions/0/540736320066916724/https://steamcommunity.com/app/233370/discussions/0/540732596570915707/https://steamcommunity.com/app/233370/discussions/0/540734792154348290/https://steamcommunity.com/app/233370/discussions/0/540736780877897495/https://steamcommunity.com/app/233370/discussions/0/846959875998907603/https://steamcommunity.com/app/233370/discussions/0/846959876007904035/Etc.More examples can be found on the game's discussion page and I recommend reading through it. These issues have NOT been fixed, despite the game having been out for two years now.This leaves the game unplayable for many people; whether you are going to be one of these people depends on your luck and on your operating system. Mac and Linux users seem to have the most issues. As the game is listed as being compatible on these operating systems, this is inexcusable. As for the game itself (or the little I have been able to experience of it), the story is an obvious homage to Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot. The first chapter starts off slow, but quickly builds up suspense once the titular ""Raven"" makes an appearance. I have heard that the second and third chapters are a bit of a let down compared to the first chapter's conclusion. The puzzles are alright, but nothing memorable comes to mind. They mainly seem to revolve around using the right object in the right location. I didn't encounter any logic puzzles or truly creative solutions. There is some pixel hunting involved, which I found annoying in the initial train sequence (although it is possible to reveal hot spots in the game by using up ""points"", this locks certain achievements from being accomplished). The animation and movement in the game is frankly awful, but I was able to ignore it for the most part. It does not really compare well to contemporary medium-high budget games, and as such the standard asking price is a tad steep. I would write more about the game itself, but my save games were erased three times in a row and I have given up on making any progress beyond this chapter. Basically, if you play on Mac or Linux: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!If you play on Windows... buy at your own risk. The first chapter seems decent enough; I can't personally comment on the final two chapters, but many reviews online seem to paint them in a rather mediocre light. Even if you do not encounter the technical issues that apply to Mac or Linux users, the game is still rife with random bugs which can impede your progress. I'd wait for a sale, or hope that the developers finally take notice of these issues and release a patch. "

												The Raven is one of the more enjoyable P&C adventures I've played in the past few years. And probably the best P&C mystery/detective adventure I've ever played. I really enjoyed Testament of Sherlock Holmes as well, but this was better done, in my opinion.Many, many video games seem to be built by developers, programmers and artists, and then have a story sort of try and glue the pieces together loosely for an enjoyable experience. There is nothing wrong with that. There are a ton of really fun games out there with this formula.In the case of The Raven, it felt like a team of writers (or maybe just one, I dunno) put together a fine story, and then built a game to wrap around it. For me, this was a departure from the typical game formula and a breath of fresh air. BUT, it won't be for everyone.You get to play three different characters in the game (two male, one female) as you both try to unravel a mystery, and become a deeper part of it at the same time. The game play is fairly typical P&C, with a few treats in regard to ""repeat performances"" at very specific ""crossroads"" in the game (I won't spoil it).The game isn't without flaws. There are inconsitent commands when it comes to character movement, occasionally sloppy pixel area matching (when your mouse cursor can either click on an object well outside the object, or not at all). Audio sometimes cuts out, and the cutscenes occasionally get wonky. The game crashed on me a handful of times in the 14 hours I spent playing it. It has some warts when it comes to gameplay mechanics and execution.But all that being said, it was STILL a joy to play. The character development is among some of the best I've ever experienced in decades of gaming. Dialogue that seems nebulous at times ties in wonderfully by the end of the game. In fact, SO good, that you'll even chuckle at the end at encounters that occurred earlier in the game when you realize the full context of the conversation later.There is subtle and mature humor in just the right places when you've had enough serious dialogue. There are extremely mature subjects that are covered, and conversations that really pull you in if you've lived for longer than a few decades on this planet. And when I say ""mature"" I don't mean an ESRB version of it. There's not much in the way of sophomoric language or gratuitious violence. But there are very adult themes that many of us become sadly familiar with (or can laugh about) when we get older. And some we'll never laugh about.The bottom line is that this is a true adult mystery with several wonderful twists, a killer storyline, some fun (but typical) P&C mechanics, and some fun and mostly logical puzzles.If you enjoy a strong story in your games (or at all), or enjoy mysteries, or generally enjoy P&C adventures, I can recommend this. If you enjoy all three, then I think this title is a ""can't miss"" and even a bit underrated.			"

												For a point-and-click adventure game, the main character is endearing, the overal scenery graphics are movie quality (there are weird glitches with the character though), and while it was fairly predictable, it was still good old fashioned fun! The music really fit this game as a time piece, and the dialog was well put together, if not a little long in the tooth.I gave the entire 3 part series of the Raven: Legacy of a Master Thief a 4.25/5.0			"

												This is a classic old-school style point-and-click adventure with some quality graphics, superb voice acting, and a brilliant orchestral soundtrack.  It has a strong nostalgic feel of a Poirot / Pink Panther whodunnit.My one criticism is that the puzzles are pretty simple - sometimes you feel you are just clicking things for the character to reveal the story.  However, the atmosphere and superb voice acting will keep you hooked in, and it's worth sticking with it to the end to reveal the true identity of the ""The Raven"" - the mysterious, shadowy character you chase through the game.The pace is quite slow - but in a nice gentle way.  It's a perfect chillout game for the mature adventure gamer on a lazy Sunday afternoon.			"

												Just finished the game and have to give it a good recommendation. The game has a lot of atmosphere for a very good story that is not transparent. I enjoyed the game very much, the graphics were well done and fit the time of the story very well. It's a pretty simple point and click adventure game, although sometimes it can be difficult to figure out how to advance in the game. Some thinking is required.  The voice acting was done very well in my opinion and the music through out the game was also very well done. Most of the schievements are pretty easy to get, one is difficult and you may need to find some help to get it done as it is a tricky one to get for most. I have over 20 hours in the game but 3-4 hrs of it were AFK time.  It is an enjoyable game without being to stressful so it's fun to just sit down and play it and see what you can figure out and enjoy the story. The only minus I can really give the game is some times the UI can be a bit clunky and getting your character to walk where you want them to can sometime be frustrating but not to the point it wrecks the game.  7/10			"

												Not worth your time or money.I really enjoy point and click games, but this game is really boring, slow paced and nothing left for your own imagination. You are a detective who has to solve the riddle about the masterthief 'The Raven' which has stolen a jewl that is suppose to be shown first time in a Egyptian museum.A long the way you learn a lot about different characters; their porblems, dreams and what they do in general. I thought this was important at first, since I followed every little detail about everyone in case it would be important to ultimately resolve who was the master thief, but no ... The criminal are shown to you near the end, so no guessing and no need to go through the evidence.The game also makes each object you pick so obvious of where to use it. If you pick up a toothpick he's actually saying where to use it, ""I can use it to open the lock to ..."", thus leaves nothing to the imagination.Do not make me start on the animation. You want your character to walk a direction, but first he has to make a 360 degree turn and take like 5-10 steps on the spot before he manage to walk forwards.This is truly a point and click game, and nothing more. With a lot of bugs that seems not to be fixed, and may ruin your game experience.			"

Short version: 91%If Agatha Christie would have written a heist thriller, it would have probably been a lot like The Raven: an interesting whodunit wrapped in an exciting jewel thievery, all presented as a three-part, solid point ‘n’ click adventure game with a clear, comfortable interface. Long version:Playing through The Raven: Legacy of a Master Thief is like sitting down to watch ‘Murder on the Orient Express’ (the ’74 one), which miraculously transforms into ‘The Italian Job’ (again, the original).The story even starts on the Orient Express, where we meet our first protagonist, Constable Zellner, an obvious Poirot homage (we even meet this world’s Agatha Christie). He eventually manages to get mixed up in an investigation against the Raven: master thief who plans to steal two Egyptian jewels.From this point on, we are treated to both a classic English style whodunit murder mystery on-board a cruise ship (a smaller homage to ‘Death on the Nile’), and a heist thriller where many people are not who they seem, and several well-crafted plans are at work at the same time, directly opposing each other. This is also the point where the story introduces the other protagonists, a young burglar couple.Not only the plot is great, but the characters as well. All of them have detailed, often tragic backstories, just like the best Christie novels. And they are played by talented English actors. Since the story tries to imitate Ms. Christie’s work, the puzzles are also straightforward and realistic, aided by a simple interface. Don’t expect an easy game though, because progress usually requires carefully examining every possibility before the game lets the player choose the correct one. The characters cannot run and many tasks are divided into dozens of small steps, yet the pacing is so good that the game never feels boring, and the 12-15 hours of play time just flies by pretty fast.

												As someone who enjoys good point-and-click games, this was an averagely good one, though it wasn't an awesome one. As someone who's read and loved Agatha Christie, the constant references to her books, character and herself are simply adorable.Things I liked about it:The plot felt like a tribute to Agatha Christie's mystery novels, even in certain apparently far-fetched plot twists. There are also nods to what became the ""classic"" plot in mystery novels. I loved it when one of the characters said something like ""what do you think, we're going to come up with new surprise characters?"" or similar. Even the cheesy romance that flourishes in the midst of adversity sounds like a nod to Christie's novels.The music is very nice and goes well with the game.NO PIXEL HUNTING. No extremely absurd combinations of inventory items, like ""oh, let me glue cat hair to a baby rattle to make a crossbow"".The voice acting is not outstanding, but it's good enough to keep you in the atmosphere.Things I didn't like about it:There are several bugs. You get stuck walking but not moving, characters disappear in the middle of dialog, you disappear, objects disappear from your inventory, then they magically reappear. Sometimes you just have to restart from a previous save.The graphics looked unfinished. Sometimes I could see the eyeball through the angle of the eyelid, details like that.The movements were very awkward. Sometimes you arrive somewhere and have to examine an item, and for that, the character stops, turns left, stops again, turns a little more, stops again, then you have the animation of the character examining. Then, a pause, then the character's comment about it, then a pause, and then you can continue. It's not too bad, but it gets annoying after a few hours.There aren't enough puzzles, though it's probably fair to say that I don't count as puzzle using a key to open a door, even though sometimes these things can be considered puzzles by others. The very few puzzles are generally too obvious, especially with all the help you get. Sometimes you examine an item, and the character comments something like ""Oh, that would be useful to do this or that..."".In general, it's fairly entertaining and I enjoyed it, probably because the continuous references to Agatha Christie kept bringing a silly smile to my face. If I had to grade it, I guess it would be 7/10, though I'm not sure I'd grade it like this if I hadn't been a Christie fan.			"

												A series packaged in (the now common) monthly Chapters has finally reached it's conclusion. Fans of Poiret and Agatha Christie Novel style games should pick this up. Or if you simply enjoy good detective stories done well. I enjoyed the puzzles and the voice acting was strong in places but weak in others. The enviroments repeated themselves often as you played similar events from different points of view but it was done in a way that didn't feel lazy or some rehash.  Achievments for perfect scores are broken which annoyed me as I wanted to do a clean hintless run but it takes nothing from the game. Considering this was made during some downtime from The brilliant Book of Written tales you have to give it credit. Over the 3 Chapters you play as various protagonists and antagonists to unravel the mystery of ""Who is The Raven?"" You get bonus points for paying attention and accuising them in the game so its worth uncovering all the clues. Slow paced but understandibly so.			"

												The Raven is a well-presented adventure game with endearing characters, intriguing and enticing story arcs. I found myself exploring every bit of dialogue just to learn more about them, without regard to progression of the story. This game does suffer from sometimes awkward character movement and pathnoding, as well as stilted facial animation, but this is easy to get past and doesn't present much of a problem. Fans of adventure games should definitely purchase this game.			"

												A solid adventure mystery. Story and soundtrack are top-notch. Also contains what is possibly the best lock-picking puzzle I've ever seen. Game is brought down by a few standard adventure game issues. Some required hotspots are really small or not unlocked until the story allows it or, annoyingly, both. And a handful of scenes have terrible  walking triggers, making exiting really frustrating. I frequently had to walk backwards a bit to go foward.There were also a few standard adventure game graphics issues; characters sliding, popping, and the like.But really, those are minor quibbles. The story should be why you're playing this and the story is well worth it.			"

												I really want to enjoy this game. I really do. I love point-n-click games, Agatha Christie, Hercule Poirot, crime and mystery. Yet OMFG the controls. Yes, all you do is click, but trying to leave one area to another is frustrating. I havent even advanced properly in the very first level on the train due to the frustration that I cant leave areas without saving, quitting and returning.Because the Inspectors inventory is on the bottom of the screen, you are trying desperate not to click anything when you want to move onto the next area. So the Inspector starts to spin round really slowly instead. Paid £6 for this in a sale and Im glad I did. Its not worth the full price. The XBox version works a dream compared to this. Such a shame as it has the makings of a good detective story, which we need more of!			"

												Oh my, is this game cheesy.If you like Agatha Christie books/stories, familiar mystery tropes, and goofy, blumbering protagonists with a good heart, then you'll like this game. If you hate the fact that the game is terrible at changing camera angles/placement to put you into a different area, forcing you to fight with the Constable to get him to stop staring out the damn train window (or walk in circles), and just simply walk down the hallway into the next train car, then, well, you'll get a good laugh and be inevitably♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at the same time, yet still enjoy the overall experience. There's really only one type of person who will appreciate this game.======Do I recommend?Sure.  It's fun.But nothing to write home about.			"

Review of The Raven - Legacy of a Master Thief""An Epic Legendary Thief. A Thrilling Adventure. And a Surprising Ending.""The Raven - Legacy of a Master Chief is one of the best detective games you should really play. The story is profound and unique. The puzzles are not that hard that you won't fallout of the story plot. The ending actually surprised me. I really didn't expect it. The Raven is your usual point and click game but instead of just clicking items and picking them, The Raven focuses more on investigating every detail. It means that you have to examine each item in the game many times until you exhaust all that could be examined.You start as Anton Jakob Zellner, a Swiss Police officer, assigned to assist and accompany the famous inspector Legrand as you guard and protect the two jewel eyes that are to be exhibited in a museum in Cairo, Egypt. Your role is mostly what detectives (well, police officers) do in every crime scenes, INVESTIGATE and ANALYZE each situation along with the items available at the moment. The game offers some hints but if you want to be a master detective, you don't need to rely on those things. The game is divided into 3 chapters with each can be played independently from one another.Some Negatives:The only negative I could find is that the game sometimes have some bugs. Some click point areas are positioned ways off from the actual item and the game has a bit of bugs when you try to move your character through a narrow room. There are also times that your character can get stuck.The game is quite pricey but I bought mine on a 75% sale and it was totally worth it.My Personal Rating:Gameplay: 7.0/10Story/Plot: 10/10Graphics: 9/10Music: 10/10Overall: 9.0/10			"

												I don't often write reviews, much less to recommend people not to buy a game but Raven - Legacy of a Master Thief is a game that annoyed me enough to take the time to write a negative review.It has a lot, and I mean a lot of technical issues. It's playable but you will encounter many critical bugs, such as being unable to transition between places because the KB+M control scheme doesn't work properly. You can end up stuck in one scene if you go back an area, unable to return. Animations are very jerky, with many characters looking like ugly puppets when they talk. Movement is slow, tedious and your character sometimes gets stuck into movement or going the other way around than the direction where you clicked. I had to swap to a gamepad control scheme a few times to transition between some areas and then go back to KB+M, because it's even worse than KB+M. For some reason, my game stopped adding new saves after 7 pages of it, which meant I had to manually erase old saves. Naturally, the game doesn't inform you of this upper limit, you get to find out the hard way it stopped recording your saves. And Alt+Tab can crash your game or leave it in a state where the only thing you can see is a dark screen.Next are some gameplay annoyances, some of which are unforgivable for a mystery adventure game. Your character has to walk to switch areas, instead of the standard double click for an instant area switch. When you click something, you can't cancel your movement midway. And since your character moves like a slowpoke, it's pretty irritating. Want to highlight what objects you can click? That'll cost you points, which you can accumulate by solving mysteries and advancing the story.  Oh, and it only highlights for like 1-2 seconds. So you better have eagle eyes and a good visual memory because otherwise, you just wasted those points for nothing.Finally, the only somewhat redeeming element of this game is its story. Sadly, while it starts strong, with your main character being a constable that seems to be based on Poirot. The quality of the story goes down the drain in the second and third chapters, as you switch to new characters, which are considerably worse and then you have to go back through the same story, except with a different POV. It felt like a chore. If I wasn't a perfectionist, I would have given up on this game during chapter 2. Also, it breaks a huge mystery rule, but I'll refrain from saying which because it would spoil the disappointing twist they had at the end.Recap: Don't waste your money on this, there are much better options out there when it comes to mystery adventure games.

The Raven - Legacy of a Master Thief (Chapters 1-3)Adventure games are and have always been my favourite genre.  So when I stumble across a gem like 'The Raven - Legacy of a Master Thief' I wonder why on earth I haven't heard of it before now.Please Note:I have no technical experience in making computer games.  I am purely a game player - the consumer.I am playing this game on a pretty powerful rig with a 29"" Widescreen Monitor.This is a review of the Steam Version of the game.Here's what I think:StoryThe story is written in the style of an Agatha Christie novel with the obligatory twists and turns that just draw you further and further in.  In fact, it pays homage to probably her most famous work, 'Death on the Nile' with a touch of 'Murder on the Orient Express'.  Personally, I've never been good at whodunnits whether in book form or in the movies so no surprise then that I was guessing all the way to the end.  On the other hand I think this just goes to show the strength of writing.The characters were well imagined and fleshed out.  They were likeable and made you care abut what happened to them.  The villains were over the top which reminded you that although you were in the middle of an intense confrontation it was just a game.  The tone of the game was well balanced.  Whilst being, in essence, a crime adventure there were lots of lighter moments and the characters were not without humour.GraphicsWith the opening animated sequence and intro you just know that this game was a labour of love and not just a money spinner.  I think, as with any media format, that the first 3-5 minutes either hook you or sink it.  Well, this definitely left me wanting more.The game's makers got the period spot on visually.  It was like wandering back into the 1950's.  The scenes are beautifully hand drawn and are rich in colour and detail.  The characters' costumes were well designed.  The only issue I had with the visual side were the characters' teeth.  This may have been a limitation of the software they were using as they looked far from natural.  Check out Lady Westmacott's companion.  Her teeth were scary looking!There were some issues with continuity.  For example, one puzzle involves removing a bulb to use in another room.  Five minutes later the bulb has mysteriously returned.  Also, when you enter the treasure chamber in Cairo there is a video camera above the exit.  When Adil abseils down into that same room later in the game the camera has disappeared.I also had a few instances of graphical artfacts appeaing in certain scenes.  This suggests some kind of compatibility issue with my graphics card but as I've had no issue with other games the jury is out on this one.  Either way, it didn't affect the game in any serious way or my enjoyment.ScoreThe score was orchestral and would give any hollywood blockbuster a run for it's money.  It was evocative, upping the tempo when playing an action sequence whilst dropping the tone when someone was relating some sad event.Sadly, for some inexplicable reason, there is no music playing when the credits roll.  I can only assume that this is a pretty big oversight as who would commission an orchestra to score their game and then leave it out completely when the credits roll?!Voice ActingAs I've said in other reviews, poor voice acting can turn a great game into a very average game if not worse.  It's 50% of your connection to the story, assuming that the visuals make up the other half.  Well, in this game they nailed it.  The voices were so natural that I barely had reason to even notice them in the same way as if you were watching a movie.  The voices matched the characters that were speaking, accents and all.  The warmth of Constable Zellner would be hard to beat.  I'm so pleased that the makers went for quality here.GameplayThis element let the game down significantly.  Although the interactive items within a scene were limited, the number of pixels that allows a user to activate the 'Item Label' was so small that finding some items was next to impossible and led to the much derised 'pixel hunting'.Moving from one scene to another or one room to another was just horrible.  This is a fundamental part of any game.  If a player can't progress to the next scene then it defeats the object of being a game.  In my mind, this was probably the most unforgiveable flaw.  How this got past all the beta testing beats me.  To move from one scene to the next involves some 'pixel hunting' and some patience.  The flaw wasn't consistent throughout the game as the flaw was more pronounced in some areas than it was in others.It's a shame that Chapter 3 sees you controlling 2 additional characters.  After controlling Constable Zellner, the main protagonist, for 2 chapters it takes the game in an unusual direction.  The reason for doing this, amongst other reasons, is to avoid the typical 'Last Scene' in most Agatha Christie novels (at least in all the TV adaptations I've ever watched) of one long boring speech on how the crime was committed and then exposing the villain.  As I said, it's a shame that you have to switch characters but the makers made an interesting choice here and I think it works well.An additional plus point was the balance between dialogue and puzzles, not too much of either.  Also, the puzzles were logical and of the right level of difficulty.This Steam version generously offers some bonus features on completion of the game.  However, the most appealing feature for me, the soundtrack (not the score), didn't work.  You can highlight the track you want to hear but nothing happens.  So much for bonus features.  In my opinion it's really simple.......... don't offer what you can't deliver!From about the mid way point of the game I encountered some serious bugs which caused the game to crash.  These involved the controlled character disappearing or getting stuck in a spinning cycle.  From my initial contact with them, the development team do seem interested in logging these bugs and have offered some basic support.Pros*Classic Whodunnit Story*Great Depth*Interesting Characters*Logical Puzzles*Natural Voice Acting*Orchestral ScoreCons*Poor Gameplay Mechanics*Navigating Rooms*Bonus MaterialSummaryDespite having some issues with the gameplay, I really enjoyed my time playing with these characters in the rich environments of the 1950's.  The story is engrossing and like any good novel will have you playing it again to pick up on the details you missed the first time round.  It very much depends on how much the gameplay issues impact on your first play through.If you're an adventure gamer I can happily recommend this title but patience is definitely a requirement.  Patience is well rewarded with this game so go ahead and and give it a try.			"

												Was enjoying the game, played all the way up to Chapter 3 and now I'm in an ""escape the room"" situation and no matter what I do the character just walks in circles or in place infinitely when trying to walk across the room to the thing i need to use. The pathfinding is completely broken in Chapter 3, and usually it just walks into a wall for a minute before teleporting to the destination, but at this part it never gives up and teleports you. And every time it happens, you become unable to open the pause menu, so the game needs to be force-closed. This happened 10 times in a row.It's a shame, because I'd been more or less enjoying the first two chapters, and now I'll probably never finish the game.			"

												The Raven was a fun game with a good storyline and ending. Some very beautiful elements in the game.Unfortunately it does lack polish with the pathing - there are moments of frustration where you have to walk away from areas and back again to try to move between scenes, and I did get stuck in an infinite walking circle at one stage from which I could only force quit and reload (thankfully autosave only took me back a couple of mins).Replayability - you don't learn everything about all the characters until the end, so replaying with that information from the beginning lends a different interpretation to some conversations which is quite fun! There are also some achievements you might not get first round, as there are a few 'event triggering' actions which might make you miss doing something else (not essential for story).I'd recommend, but probably on special as I'm not sure it's worth full price with the pathing issues.

												7.5/10+ traditional point and click adventure game in 3d person with good presentation+ logical puzzles, mostly inventory based and through conversations+ intriguing story with a twist, investigating the case of a master thief (resembles agatha christies novels)+ good production values, good voice acting (although i found the main character's voice a bit irritating :)+ reasonable duration (it took me 10 hours without skipping cutscenes)- easy puzzles overall, some long and unnecessary dialogues- a few bugs, especially at the 3rd chapter, animations that stuck , had to terminate program from task manager and restart- score system, that doesn't really matters (sierra did it so much better so many years ago!)

												This is a game I was following since it was teased. I loved every second of it and the story was engaging. I liked the plot twists and the characters were well-written. I was often distracted by how bad the controls were. They felt like Tanky resident evil controls with fixed camera angles only worse, can you imagine that? But these bugs are merely trivial to what it offered in terms of story that it made me forget about them from time to time. A must-play for any adventure game fan.			"

												I hate to say it, but...this game is just too riddled with bugs to play. Many people have been experiencing things like graphics card related problems, but many of mine have been conversation loops and inability to progress in the story. While I saved often, it was hardly enough.What's worse is that bugs from two years ago are still running rampant in this game without any notice from the developers, which is a shame. The art is nice and the story was truly intriguing, but it was darn near impossible to follow because the bugs kept getting in the way.			"

												This is a Nice adventure to play altough it is not at the top of the category it is much superior to the average level.Before i start, as a personal note, i would say to KING Art and THQ Nordic to consider to add more languages in their adventures cause are a category of games where understanding the plot is everything, so, please, don't forget to add Italian next time ^^The puzzles, that is the most important thing in any adventure and is the thing that i care most are here a bit too easy overall to not even say  that most are almost autosolving once you pick up the various items, i expected some more complex and challenging ones, but i have to say that all of them are at the same time very logical, that is a very important factor for me, so you'll not find any stupid or mindless nosense ones.I experienced only one bug in the ship where if i inspect an item more than 2 times the game freezes, it can be solved (once you know) just not clicking that item more than 2 times, i strongly recommend to save the game often to minimize these issues. Then, in some points of the game the character remain stuck for few seconds before he start moving when you try to take him from one point to another, The background musics, altough are made very well, were most of the time very annoying, well this is just my personal taste so forgive me but i did not like them much.The Graphic Arts in the game are very nice, loved them all, good work here.And now let's arrive to the best thing this game has to offer, the story, altough at beginning i had impression it was too obvious one and very linear i had to change my opinion once started chapter 2 and 3, the devs did an outstanding job here surprising me more than one time, good work KING Art.So at a final sight i feel to recommend this adventure to anyone, specially to those who approach this category of games for the first time cause they will not remain disappointed at all and, for the old expert adventurers, well, maybe you'll complete this game very fast but, trust me, you'll love the events happening here cause are very well directed.My Final Score is 85 /100  "

Sometimes the game didn't transition to the next screen when it should and I had to walk back and forth several times before it would move on. It's an absolutely wonderful story, I've found myself humming the theme song on several occasions and the artwork and voice acting are good, definitely weaker than the music and story, but not something that ever bothered me while playing.Story: 9/10Music: 9/10Voices: 8/10Artwork: 7/10Controls: 5/10			"

												***Only recommended on sale***I'm in two minds about The Raven - Legacy of a Master Thief. The first episode and a half you follow Anton Zellner, an aging Swiss Police Officer trying to impress the Super Detective Legrand by helping him catch the Master Thief Raven. Zellner is a very pleasant character to follow (a welcome deviation from the usual 20 something point and click character), the voice acting is well-done, the music and settings very nice (some odd glitches here and there, but nothing major).The puzzles are very simplistic, but mostly make sense. Since the storyline and the characters were interesting, I did not really care that the puzzles were so easy. An easy going game with a nice story I thought.In the middle of the second episode you switch character and from there onwards the game loses steam. You play the same story, but from a different perspective. Unfortunately, this new perspective brings very little flavour to the story, and the simple puzzles suddenly seemed very tedious without any real story progression. Throw in a few “use the item two times for it to work even though the character gives no indication that would be the case” just to add to the frustration. By the end I was bored by the game... but I persevered because I did want to know how the story ended. Rarely have I been so disappointed. The ending is just… so bad… so so bad. I really don’t think they could have managed to come up with a worse one without involving dinosaurs or robot ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. So in conclusion; I really enjoyed the first one and a half episodes of The Raven and that’s why I’m still recommending it (if you can get it in a sale). But frankly, if you start getting bored after starting on the other half of the game, just quit. It doesn’t get better and the end is not worth playing the rest. Personally it makes me wary of episodic games in general. It really felt like they put most of the effort into the first part of the game and the other half was more of an afterthought where they wanted to reuse the same settings to keep costs down. It’s a real shame because they could have made some really great new IP here.			"

												A good adventure game with it's flaws. I found that the well known nordic and Adventure comapny finally put some action into its latest games moving to a mix of Agatha Christie and Homes style gaming.The games art is good, it's done in a Tin Tin and semi cartoon/ comic style art style, yet real enough not to make you think your actually watching a cartoon; think of games like tourchlight or diablo to get the clay plastic type style of graphics, which I don't really like, but seems many do....so leans more to a novel from the 60s feel, which I guess is the idea of the presentation of the game.Gameplay is good, has a few pacing issues but moves along alright, puzzles are real enough if fairly simple, don't expect some obscure puzzles that may no sense to the world or having you figure out the direction of statues, which is good but doesn't work your brain much  are basic at best. Sound is ok, i found the the first play area, the train is a bit to loud even when turning  up the voice actors voices. Detail is realistic, what you pick up is what you see, so your not ""pocketing"" huge items that somehow go into some magic bag that is held in suspension like a star trek transporter, its nice to see the person wearing major objects that wouldn't fit in a picket, eg you expect a wallet to be in the pocket but how can a AXE fit your your pocket, thus in the game it's something you wear.Story reminds me of Agetha Christie games mixed with secret files Siberia and Lost Horizons, and actually provides stimulating situations without feeling overley static. The notebook updates as you go along and has details of the people, places, and events as they happen, with nice artwork done as if you sketched it, so talking with NPCS about other NPCS will update the details on the other person so you can check out the information, which moves the story along.Game help comes at a cost of point lost, which tells you how your score is, showing you interactions in classic mode deducts points, the same way asking for hint in objectives book does as well, at a higher cost.Downers, sadly I do have something negitive to report, the design of the game left out the ability to change scenes well, transitioning scenes via mouse click, most adventure games allow you to change locations by move along  via edge of the monitor , sadly in this game doesn't do that, it changes scenes as you walk to the edge of the screen, which leads to frustration if you play in classic mode, you can select to play with a gamepad that solves this issues as your stick controls the main figure, so you wont be stuck in area transitions, but that comes at a cost of showing you all the interactive parts of the screen, which takes the fun out of hunting for objects since everything is  highlighted. I know they did this because it was released on consoles, but they should have made the right stick the free curser instead of just a object selector, takes the fun out of it, its the same reason I play these type of games eg: Sherlock Homes with the mouse, because I dont want to be told where all the objects are, so thus you either retry to move to areas or you accept being told what to do. A few path finding bugs had me reloading because the person would get stuck walking and break the game.All and all it was still fun to play, be prepared for a few furstrating click frustrations that are bound to get one or two people stuck thinking there is no further map to progress to when the main lead wont move to the  next area, but the story is decent and the game is entertaining.Also keep saves as you only have chapter select, so found myself playing half the game to get a trophy I missed out on which is bugged so be warned.

												I wasn't expecting much from this game when I bought it but I can now say that it's become one of my favourite graphic adventures.It's hard to find games with plots that don't take you for an idiot these days, and in that way The Raven took a risk. The plot is in no way complicated but it is above what we usually see in videogames. The characters are all likeable and the strings it pulls are darker than I expected for a mystery story with a thief main antagonist.The weakest point of the game is the gameplay, which doesn't bring anything new to the genre and is buggy at times. It is hard to navigate comfortably through the environment, and I had to use a guide after being stuck for a while only to discover that I had encountered a bug instead of a puzzle.Sadly, the character animation and modelling isn't as good as it could've been, and detracts a lot from the enjoyment of the game. It does it's job but better art direction and animation could have easily turned this into a masterpiece, but it still remains an overall excellent game.			"

												Too far from Christie's work to be a directly based digital manifestation, yet too close to be inspired by it.Too straightforward to be a true quest, yet too far from a digital novel.It is a shame, the game had potential. The work of artists is quite magnificent and the plot is mostly just above average if compared to an FPS for example, but it's too shallow for a thriller or detective fiction. The problem is that the gameplay is so streamlined, it is nonexistent. It feels like unpausing a movie when you solve a puzzle, there is literally nothing to divert the attention of the player and to confuse him - what you do simply does not fail.The large locations are wasted because there are at most two-three points of interaction that are easily found without extensive pixel hunting.If I was to choose between recent detective adventure games would rather get myself B. Sokal's ""Sinking Island"" or perhaps ""CSI"" or even ""Evil Under the Sun"" or the great ""L.A. Noire"", but not this failed attempt at a quest. Developers forgot that the player actually has to play.			"

												All 3 episodes were fun to play. The characters were pretty good and their presence in the game believeable. The graphics were decent for this style of game. The only downside I would give was that it was sometimes difficult to find exactly where to click to get a chcracter to leave the scene and go to the next screen on. But all in all this was a good effort by King Art's and for those that have never played the game I would recommend it. If I was going to give this a rating out of 10. If I was comparing this to a triple A title then of course it would score low but if I compare it to other games I have played that are similar to this one then I would give this a solid 7 out of 10			"

												I'd rate this as a 5/10. I would not recommend this game.I picked it up on a sale for $6.00. At that price I can live with the issues. But, for future gamers considering this title at the normal price tag of $24.99 ($29.99 for Deluxe) - I do not believe this to be a worthy spend.The game does a good job with visuals, voice acting, and a decent story line. But, there are two things which have resulted in my negative review:1)	Be prepared for some frustrating character movements - there are times where you just want your 3rd person character to go to a specific location on the screen and he goes to another one altogether - prompting screen load times. This will happen quite a bit. Patience is king here, but I guarantee you this will happen if you use an XBox 360 controller as I do.2)	On two separate occasions (once in Chapter 1 and once in Chapter 2) - the game glitches and you will have to restart a long sequence of actions, repeating steps that lead up to the freeze. On item #2 above - this is extremely tedious and nearly boring. The dialogues all over again because the game sequence got goofed up. I literally restarted the entire chapter and it was 30 minutes of repeating it all over again just because one of the ""items"" got stuck in a loop. It happened again to me a while ago in Chapter 2 in the museum. Rolling my eyes, I have to go through a few game saves to try and not repeat the entire chapter from scratch.Hate to be negative (frankly - on any game developers), because I can tell they put allot of energy into this title. It just needs to be cleaned up (code) and the normal price should be no more than $9.99 in my opinion. "

												I really enjoyed The Raven: Legacy of a Master Thief, despite some moderate issues gameplay-wise.First off, this is very much an old school point and click game. For the most part, the player is never in any real danger. That said, it felt really natural playing as Constable Zellner, a sort of wannabe detective who gets involved in a jewel heist case.The voice acting is quite good in the game, though there's not a huge cast. Across the game’s three chapters, you'll be running into a lot of the same characters and unravelling their personal stories. It was nice hearing varied accents from different characters for a transcontinental trip and while I may not be the best judge of European accents, I felt that the actor portrayals of the characters were some of the best I've heard in recent gameplay. Each actor's performance felt believable and appropriate. Zellner, the rich girl, and the Austrian violinist really stood out to me.Another positive I can say about the game’s dialogue is that despite the dialogue choices themselves being mostly scripted, I never felt left out of the loop as the player. Any follow up questions I thought up based on something in a conversation, were available to talk about further. I never really had a moment where I was screaming at Zellner for not asking an obvious question.Puzzle-wise, the game is pretty solid as well. Most of the puzzles involve standard point and click mechanics such as find this, use that, combine this, etc. What sets the puzzles in The Raven apart from other similar games was that they felt very logical and satisfying. Analyzing crime scenes and overcoming obstacles played out in a creative, but sensible way: Need to open a locked car door? Find a wire and jimmy the lock.I did hit road blocks in a few puzzles for what seemed like unfair reasons. In one instance, I probably spent close to an hour trying to progress because I hadn't click something three times, revealing that I might want to use a specific item. Another time, I got stuck because of a translation issue for one of the puzzle items. Thankfully, these issues were not a huge issue and may have been avoided if I wasn’t playing past midnight.The puzzles felt best in the game when they required a complex multi-step solution or when the puzzles used a mini-game style solution. I would really like to seen King Art focus on these kinds of puzzles in the future as they were highly memorable.On the negative end, the game's presentation can feel rushed at times, with pathfinding completely failing at certain points in the game, requiring a restart of the program. Thankfully, there is a decent autosave feature so I never lost much progress, and I only ran into the issue a handful of times.As far as plot goes, the game was a slight disappointment but still very enjoyable. The first chapter is fairly lengthy and really well done. The second chapter has some strange pacing and cuts away at a dramatic point to restart the game from the thief perspective. The third chapter is almost as good as the first, but felt a little rushed in terms of length and plot twists. The ending to chapter three was enjoyable, but felt a little thrown together, but I honestly feel that way about a lot of crime shows and books as well. Some things simply need to be explained away, rather than making sense I suppose. Overall though, the characters were really well done and it was a fun making the journey with them.Journeying with Constable Zellner was very amusing and made me feel like I was caught up in an old detective story such as Tintin and the like.The Raven may not be for everybody, but those who are able to overlook some presentation issues and a slow pace, will find a great story and enjoyable puzzles and dialogue.

												I am new to point and click adventure games, having missed their heyday, I had never really considered them something that would be interesting.  This game has proven my assumption wrong.  The Raven presents a very interesting story and provided many twists and turns along the way.  I admit, I do have a bit of a penchant for crime/detective stories.  One critical comment I must make is that the controls can sometimes be a bit clumsy, sometimes requiring one to walk towards a ""door"" and then back away a bit or even occasionally take a second pass at it.  This might just be a side effect of my own lack of experience with this style of gameplay, however.I will be watching the developers, KING Art, for new additions to their catalog.			"

												Detective point'n'click adventure. Puzzles are mostly concentrated on talking to people and finding stuff. Unfortunately game has an inbuilt scoring mechanism that penalizes use of hot-spot indicator. Without it, the game has too much pixel-finding tasks.  Game is divided into three chapters.  The first chapter is three times larger than the last two. The last two don't continue the story as per se, but rather retell parts of it.  I much rather would've had three separate stories. Also, the game is rather buggy about the character moving about the screen and scene transitions. All in all, a nice detective adventure game.			"

												Long and boring Vietnamese version: http://sologame.net/review/thich-ghet-the-raven-legacy-of-a-master-thief/The Raven - Legacy of a Master Thief is a point-n-click adventure game developed by KINGArt (who also made The Book of Unwritten Tales). Player plays as constable Anton Jakob Zellner and follows him on the adventure to reveal the identity of ""The Raven"", the notorious burglar who successfully stole the ancient ""Eyes of the Sphinx"". The story isn't so special, but the game managed to tell it through three characters' perspective which is a little bit different and unique. It does have some funny moments and the voice acting is excellent. Some characters are likeable, like Zellner, Patricia, the old lady or the kid; some are designed just to make you want to punch them in the face, like Legrand (uuuugh, I hate that ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) or the piano artist. IMO the story keeps getting better as the game progresses because of plot twist and unexpected moments. It's not so violent or mind-♥♥♥♥ed, but The Raven has its own unique and memorable story (the final twist is illogical, but I can live with it).I have a love/hate passion with The Raven's gameplay. First, it has old-school point-n-click style with puzzles and some minigames, puzzles are not too hard, but they're enjoyable, minigames keep the game from being repetitive with some fun challenges like lockpicking or playing shuffleboard (Matt is a MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING HAX0R, he's OP as ♥♥♥♥, you'll owe him A LOT of ice creams). However, the game suffers from many technical issues, sometimes the game doesn't allow you to move your character out of a room because it's not shown on the screen, you have to lower the resolution to see it. Camera system is another problem, it only stands still in many angles and rarely follows your character as they move around, environments in the game are sometimes limited, so you will have a hard time moving your character because you'll have no idea where they're heading to.Graphics are not so impressive, but it isn't bad either, but there are 2 things that irritate me a lot, first, we have the WORST FACIAL EXPRESSION EVER in a video game, I honestly can't tell if Legrand is smiling while subtitle's showing ""ha ha ha"", female characters don't look good except Patricia. Second, I expected to see more beautiful landscapes and locations, because the story takes place in Paris, I love Paris, I want to see the Eiffel Tower, the Seine river, the Pont des Arts bridge, the Tuileries Garden and the Place Charles de Gaulle,... Do they appear in the game ? Nope. Instead you'll only see a cruise ship, a train and a museum, yay, I'd rather watch ""A Monster in Paris"" again... Good thing is the soundtrack is great, I'd recommend paying $2 more for the digital deluxe edition, the soundtrack alone is worth it.The Raven - Legacy of a Master Thief is a good adventure game, recommended for anyone who's looking for a different kind of adventure rather than Daedalic and Telltale's games. For $7.5 it's a steal. 7/10.			"

												A solid adventure game, but it has some bugs that make gameplay a bit frustrating.  For example, moving between rooms can be very difficult on the train and the cruise ship.  If you click the edge of the scene, your character will walk to the edge and not change scenes.  I don't know how this passed testing.  Encountered some other minor bugs, but the walking thing is very annoying.  Other than that it is an interesting game and fun to play.			"

												It's a fairly well put together point and click game. There's a certain sense of mystery.  If you are the kind of person who wants a good story with some challenge, it's not a bad pick-up when on sale.Pros:--Well done hint & journal & inventory system--High quality voice acting--Several well-done ""twists"" in the story, especially Parts I & III--An extremel large amount of material to read & exploreCons:--Part of the problem is some puzzles based on finding very small areas to click, a lot of replay--Part II a little duller than other two sections--One puzzle minigame, picking a lock late in Part I, is not well made; you may need to find a walkthough to see the mechanics of what you are supposed to do.--Final epilogue twist did not really do anything for me, seemed sort of thrown in "

												As a huge fan of Agatha Christie and of classic point'n clicks I just had to get this game and I loved it!There are some minor animation issues but those are forgettable and don't taint the pleasure.The Raven provides a clever and compelling story full of allusions to Dame Agatha Christie and some of her most noted works. In three chapters set in very well chosen locations the game entertains not only with a thrilling plot but also with several interesting and coherent characters, fine graphics and excellent voice acting and soundtrack. I'd recommand The Raven to all fans of classic point'n click and vintage murder mysteries. "

												This is a lovely, traditional point and click made as a homage to Agatha Christie, and the references are delightful for fans. The graphics are good, the voice acting good and the music absolute perfection.This isn't a hard game, but you can skip entire side plots by rushing. I both like and dislike that, and in the end I reloaded from an earlier save to experience that part of the game. So be aware, and listen carefully to what characters tell you. It isn't however important, but sad to miss parts due to scene triggers.I would recommend this game as a solid title without convoluted puzzles and with steady story progression - all aboard the Orient Express!

												What a masterpiece! This is an extraordinarily well written old school point & click adventure game that plays just like a good crime novel would read. It has you guessing and second guessing up until the end as to the true identity of the Raven (and no, I didn't guess correctly). All the characters are extremely well written with some superb voice acting with a multitude of different European, American and English accents. Everyone has their own backstory and reason for being there - even the ones that don't seem significant at first.Over the three episodes you play through the events in the story twice from different perspectives. Things that seem unimportant or glossed over the first time round become clear when played again from a different perspective later. This isn't the first time KING Art has done something like this - The Book of Unwritten Tales had something similar towards the end of the game - saying any more would spoil it, but it was absolutely brilliant then, and it is absolutely brilliant now as well.The only criticisms I have for this game are that there are a number of glitches in the game engine (which is also true of KING Art's previous games) - some are fairly minor graphical, audio and pathing glitches, and you can tell that the game has actually been programmed to work around many of them - if a character gets stuck for a few seconds they will teleport to where they are supposed to be. I did find that I often had some difficulty getting my character to move to the next screen, though that usually worked after a few attempts, however, on one occasion my character started turning around in a circle endlessly forcing me to quit the game - thankfully it had autosaved about ten seconds beforehand.Don't let these glitches put you off though - the game is so well written that these issues can easily be forgiven. KING Art is one company absolutely worth keeping an eye on.			"

The environment and characters may be a bit childish, but nevertheless the game has some great aspects and decent graphics. The soundtrack and the atmosphere it creates are just phenomenal. It somehow took me back to my childhood made it feel like a crimestory  with a strong touch of a Disney fairytale. As cons id like to mention a few bugs (rare but unpleasant) and although i liked the story, maybe it could have been a bit longer (my actual gaming hours are like 20h). The riddles are pretty fluent and easy but you should expect that just by looking at the game design. But in the end i have to say GOOD JOB!! I WANT MORE!!			"

												As a fan of adventure games, this game looked very intriguing. The story has a nice build-up with classic British mystery elements, however it all falls flat in the final chapter with a very anti-climatic conclusion. It felt like a cop-out to go that route. Other videogames have done this and it just does not sit well with me. It ruined the otherwise decent experience. As far as puzzles go it has some nice moments. Some frustration when you can't find an item you need to progress, but that's just part of the genre. The characters have nice personalities and voice-work. The game does control very clunkily, sometimes it's confusing to find out where to click to change screens etc.Overall it's a decent adventure game, but since this is a mystery game I had high hopes for the story. Unfortunately, this disappointed me so much that it left a bad taste in my mouth and leads to my negative recommendation.			"

												A point and click adventure that starts off promisingly with Agatha Christie, Orient Express, Poirot, Murder at Sea and Master Jewel Thief themes but loses the plot slightly the moment the character switch hits. The idea of progressing the main story up to a cliffhanger, then restarting from the perspective of another character to work your way up to the same point and then see out the story, in theory is excellent, but the story writing from that point onwards is a real stretch. Constable Anton Jakob Zellner was a great character to play as, his part of the story was high quality, the rest I didn't really care for. The percentage of main criminal element protagonists to remainder of main characters was also ludicrous, ruined the story.I could quite easily gloss over that as the game was fairly enjoyable as a whodunnit but unfortunately Raven is marred by bugs. There are issues with pathfinding, the player controlled character moves and turns in a manner even more tank like than Resident Evil, characters will jog in place (meaning a restart), rotate on the spot (meaning a restart), warp and disappear completely from scenes, cameras will lock in place (meaning a restart), items essential to solving puzzles also won't appear as highlightable in some scenes if your using a pad and there are numerous other bugs involving selectable items and characters.....The Captain for example leaves a scene but you can click on where he was sitting at the bar to get the dialogue about about him sweating, in the Baroness room to select and open her portable cabinet you have to click on her bed which is on the other side of the room, in the ship holding cell area the puzzle involving the winch is unsolvable using a pad as you can't highlight the hook etcetera etcetera etcetera.The game is nearly 2 years old, the bugs which I noted are plastered all over the Steam hub and went unfixed marring an otherwise enjoyable game whilst slapping paying customers in the face - it's by far the buggiest point and click adventure I've ever played and with no post release support in 2 years I can't recommend supporting it by buying it.

												A beautiful adventure that is buggy. You need to update your drivers for whatever card you're using. I read that changing compatibility mode to Windows XP helps: right click on the .exe files (there's 2 of them), click properties and then click compatibility Windows XP. That seemed quicker for me. I also read that changing the language to Russian and then German and then back to English again sorts out some bugs, I did this although I'm unsure if it helped or not. My problem maybe that I didn't have a dedicated graphics card (I have Intel HD GRAPHICS) but I eventually navigated the game and thoroughly enjoyed it.Anyway the game itself has a good story with some twists and turns. It's set in a 50s Agatha Christie style backdrop with an Orient Express journey, a cruise and Egyptian relics. It even has a world famous lady detective writer as one of the characters. Visually they are beautiful well drawn environments. Originally it was episodic, hence the 3 backdrops. The characterisation are a big strength of the game and all the characters have a fair degree of depth with their own stories. The main character has plenty of charm. The voice acting is good. The puzzles are all fairly logical for the most part. The music is a perfect fit too.Some people didn't like the change of characters and timeline shift but I did, it explained more of what was going on with the plot. Some people didn't like the twists in the plot but again I did.If you want an adventure with plenty of story depth that keeps you guessing then this is brilliant as long as you can fiddle about with the bugs and save often.

Riddles could be harder, and by harder i don't mean actions becoming suddenly available after some other (seemingly) random event has happened. Sometimes characters talk too much and state the obvious. Enthralling story and switching perspectives by playing other characters was also a nice move. Lacks the humour of Monkey Island. <:)  I enjoyed playing the game, good ole point & click.			"

												I love puzzle games.  Finding clues and putting them together to achieve your desired goal is what I love to do.  The Raven: Legacy of the Master Thief does just that, but it can be frustrating at times.As with most games, there are pros and cons.Pros:- The graphics are well done.- The voice acting, although not top notch, is decent.- Once a object has been clicked on or used, the hot spot goes away letting the player know that there is nothing more to 		   it.- There is a great plot twist in this story.Cons:- Some of the clues are intentionally hidden from view.  So you will be pixel hunting for the entire game.- You must click on objects several times to get the full story.- Although the graphics are good one thing that isn’t is the animation.  It’s very clumsy and buggy.  At one point my 		   character became stuck moving from point A to B.  When the animation is in motion there is not way to stop it. I had 		   to do a hard shutdown which I hate.- The solving of many of the puzzles is much to rigid.Let me give you an example:  At one point, you must uncouple the engine from the rest of the train.  You MUST do everything in order or the puzzle won’t work, even though you know you‘ll have to use the axe on the door to the coal tender.  You have to pull the emergency brake first (which won‘t stop the train), then open the door to the coal tender using a wet (which won’t work either), then you must use an axe to open the door (which will won’t work either… at first). That’s the other thing I don’t like, there are several puzzles where you have to the same thing twice.  What the hell for?  What’s more, there are several  This retail price of this game (at the time of this review) is $24.95 which is much too high giving all of the negative points I just went through (thankfully, I got it on sale).  This game should sell at about $4.99... Tops.			"

												Pros:+ engagind story+ nice graphics+ some good music+ decent voice acting+ action elements that give an illusion of a fast-paced movieCons:- linear- got me stuck once or twice expecting somewhat crazy solution- repetitive musicThe game is rather rational and logical but can get you stuck now and then with a puzzle that doesn't necessary fit into the rest of the gameplay. It's a nice, Agatha Christie style story of a thief and a capturer where player plays both sides and gains both perspectives. I can tell I enjoyed it a lot, there were, however, some aspects typical for most of the point & click genre that can throw off a casual player. I'd give it 8 out of 10 points if it wasn't that damn long - you can feel the story was stretched in a very artificial manner to split it into several episodes; could easily be squished in one. Overall: 6/10.			"

												A very solid if somewhat unoriginal point 'n' click adventure that borrows heavily from Agatha Christie's Poirot and has some very nice, detailed backgrounds and character models (though animation is understandably stiff), a nice score and some interesting puzzles. Movement can be a bit sluggish and I really would not recommend playing it with a controller even though it has that option as examining the environment and selecting specific items, which is essential to the game, is extremely cumbersome with one in my view. It works perfectly fine with a mouse as you'd expect for a game of this type.This is a really charming, old-school adventure that seems to offers a decent amount of gameplay. It may lack humour but the writing is good in my humble opinion and the voice acting is generally spot on.			"

												Having a great time playing this game. I like the art and characters and enjoy being inside a classic feeling crime mystery.The point and click puzzles are simple, partly because the game is streamlined - you don't get an inventory full of irrelevant items, and once you've examined an object - if it is no longer relevant it stops being clickable. Along with hints and hotspot locations this makes the game a fairly easy ride so you can enjoy the story.I've had a couple of times the game got stuck, but nothing a reload and 30 sec replay couldn't fix.Most of all I enjoy the twists and turns in the storyline, lots of fun surprises.

At first I was turned off by the clunky avatars and some movement issues but then the story line drew me in.   The character voice acting was very good with the lead ever so charming.  I enjoyed that he was over the hill, going to seed and losing his hair.  Reminded me of Miss Marple series where due to outward appearances the hero is often underestimated and overlooked.   The landscape graphics were well done, some shots on the ship were really lovely.  The puzzles were simple but as I said, it wasnt necessary to have complex puzzles due to the story and attachment you make with the lead investigator.all in all well done and would recommend this to any adventure gamer familiar with this style of game, fps and adrenalin addicts will not enjoy this slow thinking game			"

												Gameplay isn't hard, though it does follow the ""find and click"" model.  I played and enjoyed this game for the story, which had a great plot twist.  I'm not sure if there were any decisions I made that impacted the storyline or not, but I found the interface of the game serving as a vehicle to progress the story.  And it was a great story.  If you like mysteries and methodical gamepley, this is right up your alley!  I really hope King Art/Nordic do another game like this.			"

												This game is truly a fun puzzle game. It forces you to look around and to click on anything you can which make is fun. One of the things that isn't fun is that some  areas are too dark and sometimes you just want to skip the dialogue. The dialogue isn't bad it's just that you want to solve the problem and move to the next puzzle that you click through it.			"

												A fun and interesting point and click adventure.  The first episode is the strongest and very intriguing.  Some really nice voice acting for the most part.  The music and scenery are very nice and will get stuck in your head.  There's lots of intricacies with the story, but that's all I'll say about it.  If you like detective mysteries and the like, you'll probably love the story in this.  There are some annoying issues, like not being able to cancel a movement or action once you start it (like walking across a room due to a mis-click, for example).  There are also a few bugs that cropped up, though I think only in the 3rd episode.  My advice would be to save often so that you won't lose much progress if you come across one.  Overall an enjoyable game with lots of charm.			"

Story is well done and is taken from various characters viewpoint, so the player is not one character all the time...really novel.  Puzzles are not too hard..not too easy some either :), but there is always an answer in the game somewhere.  Definately have to look around areas and one dies need to use the ole grey matter a bit.  Which is good as it is not fun being spoon fed.  Highly recommend the game.  It is point and click, but not in a boring way. :)			"

												Well-presented, witty and of considerable length, The Raven: Legacy of a Master Thief is definitely worth playing for fans of the Sierra/Lucasarts style adventure game. There's not a whole lot to explain here: Like just about every point-and-click adventure, gameplay involves a lot of pointing and clicking, waiting as something happens, and then pointing and clicking some more. There are some light puzzles, none of which I found very complicated (old hands at these types of games will have no trouble breezing through it), and a bit of mid-game twisty-turny stuff that I wasn't expecting, but otherwise there aren't a great deal of surprises here. Still, the story is what counts in an adventure game, and this one -- mostly a tribute to the works of Agatha Christie -- is pretty decent. I'm fairly gullible, so the few twists that popped up genuinely surprised me, which was nice, as was the ending. I'll never write The Raven down on a list of the greatest adventure games or anything, but it was worth my time.			"

												So many twists, turns, red herrings that aren't really red herrings but are... the plotline is truly captivating. The game started out a little slow, but the characters are well developed throughout the story, unravelling mysteries beyond ""Who is the Raven?"" and ""Wait, what? So who is the Raven really?"" and ""SERIOUSLY, WHAT? WHO?!""The great storyline, the well acted characters with loads of personality, and the cinematic score make it a memorable--and--very replayable experience. This ain't no ""hit it and quit it (at least for 2 years until you forget the plot)."" As you progress through the chapters, you step in the shoes of the other characters--which really enriches the game. Going back and playing it a second time you'll pick up on a lot that you'd missed before, and that's actually part of the excellence of it. Something I also found nice was that you aren't required to complete everything possible before you move on; you can skip some things but still continue the story. Naturally, the completeness of the story will diminish, but that's why you play it again!The only downsides are that the graphics are somewhat dated, even on the highest quality, and the cut scenes are lower quality than the in-game graphics. Which doesn't make any sense. The controls can be a little frustrating at times; I found it difficult to move about from room to room in the train especially, but you figure it out eventually. Fortunately there aren't any glitches that make it entirely impossible to move, forcing you to restart from your last save. That's a plus. Other than that, I only wish there were a couple more puzzles throughout the game. The first chapter is really heavy on the story-telling, which you can still opt to skip through if you're not much of a story person.. but why are you playing an adventure game if you don't like a good story, anyway? Crazy.To suffice, it's a great adventure game with a well thought out plot that'll keep you interested, and everytime you think you know who the Raven REALLY is... well... you're wrong.			"

												Intriguing up to the very last minutes. Very few bugs, I maybe encountered only one real bug. However a slight lack of intuitiveness in moving between scenes might be interpreted as bug sometimes (we need to be placed at the exact right place for the image to shift).The story however is great and no, it is not a poor story where the criminal appears at the very end only. The images are of amazing quality even at low performance and the characters all are very original and do have real personnality.  Recommended.			"

												The short answer is that I liked the game. The long answer follows.It is a point a click adventure that is divided on three chapters. You get to play different characters along the whole game, although I liked the first one the best: Constable Zellner. He reminds me of Detective Culombo. He keeps talking to all suspects, and at the end he gets to know who the guilty is. Although there is no bad decission on the game to make, the player is asked to give out the answers to various crimes. That keeps the game afresh in that you know you might give the wrong answer, even if that does not change the overall story a bit.The game is slow paced, as with many other point and click games. Even in situations where the player character should be stressed, you can take all the time you want. There is the odd puzzle here and there, and some of the interface might have been done better. At some stage there is a door with washed out glyphs and no clear indication where the right position should be. There is no logical puzzle, like a sliding puzzle. Some people have complained about a single room where it was not obvious how to get outside.There was one conversation puzzle I did not like, and that is because how far fetched it was. You are given four hints to four artists that should be related to four animals. If somebody asks you about A. Dürer, you probably would then link him to hares. However, the logical explanation given by the game is that Dürer draw some self-portraits, and that one of the most important ones is hanged in Madrid. Madrid then has in the city coat of arms a bear, so it is a bear then. A similar treatment is given to Picasso and Michelangelo. Thankfully, this puzzle is relatively short.Chapter 3 has showed me some strange artifacts related to the technical side of the game. Pathfinding was not working all the times but the game recovered by moving the character to his or her final destination. Audio effects were also applied wrong and there was this scene where a character was not on the place she should be (player character walks over she!). However, I did not find any serious bug. There are some things that could have been done better. Let me start with the hint system. You are given thousand adventure points at given plot points. You can then spend hundred points for a hint, many times for things you already did. You can also spend ten points in order to locate all objects you can interact in the room. The problem is that they are made only obvious by a magnifying glass. This hint would not be a problem if the magnifying glass would be more visible and did not disappear so fast. Other games have a more noticeable icon, or at least a bright color that is easy to spot.The other thing that would need to have been reviewed is the game save system. Both autosave and your manual saves can send you to one or two actions on the past. It is usually not a problem, but it is not expected. I had no corrupted game save or anything like that.So, in a nutshell, I liked the story far way more than the interface or some of the puzzles.			"

												I've played a lot of point and click games, and personally I liked this one better than the one the same company made ""The Book of Unwritten Tales,"" although that wasn't bad either.  Both tend to have time jumps that make the game more interesting.None of the puzzles were too hard, which is both good and bad.The ending did satisfy me, though I will say that it was a bit like one of the characters put it - there weren't many clues to this ending.Overall I really enjoyed it - I liked all the characters and I had a excited squeal at the end.Was this the best point and click game? No, but if you like murder mysteries, this is really entertaining.  I would, however, suggest waiting til it's 75% off and get it for 6 bucks like I did.There were a few bugs - I have a mac.  My main bugs were at times the visuals would stop working (but the game autosaves every once in a while so  just quit.  It won't make you redo too much), and sometimes it was frustrating going from place to place (what I would do it walk really close to the place I wanted the character to go and then I would walk away and that usually triggered them walking where I wanted them to).But those were minor glitches, and the game was interesting and inviting, so I'd say overall go for it! :)			"

												I have just started and am already in love with this game! Will write more once I have finished it, but for now: wonderful, fluent graphics, the most atmospheric cinematic soundtrack, and easy-to-handle controls. You are immediately drawn into the story.Edit #1: So I played a good portion of the game so far.This adventure game features a most compelling player character! I am so sick and tired of those deep-voiced, good looking 35-years old, male hero types that you get to play in almost every game. This guy feels real and cool and full of humor! I never laughed this much in a point-and-click adventure since Monkey Island. ;)The dialogues feel real, too, and never get boring that would make you wish to skip them.This game thrives of life and realistic characters, and the facial animations add to all that. Wonderful.I did mention the fantastic job the soundtrack composer did, right?Edit #2: Okay, the more you play the game the more you become aware of some graphical glitches and -- at least in my case -- an annoying sound issue (a crackling noise) throughout the whole game. I also checked the forums, and apparently some bugs have been not fixed to date.			"

												First of all I want to say that I hate games, chapters in which are released separetely. Let me explain why. The first chapter in such games usually is good. All who want to play this game buy it at this point. And developers gain major portion of profit at this point as well. As a result the second chapter of such games is released on a relaxed note and not as good as the first one. Here flow of money generally almost stops which leads to devil-may-care attitude of developers to the remained chapters. And this is what we see in this game exactly. Really good and long enough 1st chapter, mediocre 2nd chapter and terrible, full of bugs and illogical puzzles 3rd chapter. This game is still worth of playing, but not for the full price.			"

												I gave this game a shot when I saw it was on sale. As a person who likes the idea of adventure games, mainly the emphasis on storytelling, I'll be honest and say I am by no means a pro of the genre. Often I find point-and-clicks exhausting and puzzles too farfetched to get any kind of enjoyment out of finding the solution. You won't really have those sorts of problems with this game. The puzzles are not at all challenging, often times with characters flat out telling you what to do with what just by inspecting an item, and many of the solutions can be arrived at by exhausting all your dialogue options. For me, the lack of difficulty was somewhat disappointing, but I appreciate that I was able to keep the plot moving without getting stuck every couple of puzzles or so.The story itself is entertaining for a majority of the game, a burglary mystery with some murder thrown in, and I enjoyed the fact that you were able to see the sequence of events from multiple character perspectives. The playable characters were likable enough and you are also joined by a cast of quirky side characters who, for the most part, stay with you throughout the playthrough. Sadly, several are rather underutilized. Probably left in just to keep you guessing 'whodunit?' however unlikely their culpability seems. Worst of all, the ending was utterly disappointing for me, so the conclusion may leave you with a sour taste in your mouth.I really enjoyed most of the game as it has a lot going for it: a charming art style, good music, superb voice acting, and interesting characters but all that gets dragged down by a plot that falls a bit flat in the end. The gameplay itself can be a bit buggy with awkward character animations, but I only had to reload one time, so I hardly noticed. I wouldn't steer anyone away from this game, just don't expect anything too remarkable. Perhaps wait for it to go on sale. "

												First of all, I know there have been a lot of complains and bad reviews regarding the numerous bugs, but right now the game is in an overall playable state, yet there is still a lot of space for improvement.Minor spoiler:  In the middle of the game, that means the middle of the second episode, the story, almost at its end, get interrupted with a cliffhanger. For the other one-and-a-half episodes and you get to play it all again from another perspective, with a proper resolution to it all. The resulting problem is that essentially there are only three different environments in the game, which all are rather small and wear out quickly, especially with that kind of recycling.Well the heist story itself is nice and consistent, but not so special. What makes it interesting is to see it all from the perspective of side characters. You play neither the mastermind nor the star detective. The gameplay is that of a usual point-and-click adventure. There is not much to say about it, except that you often have to click items multiple times to perform necessary actions or get essential information, this can be quite irritating. Also it can sometimes be troubling to switch the camera position so that you can walk across the room.The Raven seems to suffer from the episodic release model. The first episode is done relatively well, but the ohter episodes seem to be rushed out. The character animations are often awful and a couple of simplifications were made, which in result make these episodes also appear to be shorter than the first one.However, the game is rather atmospheric, it looks quite pretty (except for a third of the character animations) and the voice actors do a great job. Conclusive, I would not pay 25€ for the game since it lacks quality, but if you are looking for a nice heist story told in an interesting way and you can overlook some major flaws, then give it a shot.

												I swear I have played this game 3 times since I have purchased it, and I will be playing it again I'm sure. It will keep you on your toes, guessing until the very end. If you love Sherlock Holmes or Nancy Drew - you will love this!			"

												The Raven is a great game in terms of writing. The plot has its ups and downs, mostly ups as it kept me interested. But once you stop playing as Constable Zellner, the game flashbacks and the plot plays out as another protagonist, Adil.The Raven is about the aging Constable Anton Jakob Zellner, of the Swiss police, a respectable and courteous man trying to do the right thing, but also ambitious and over-eager. He takes on the job of overseeing transportation of a jewel from Zurich to Venice, via Orient Express. Along the way, he meets Inspector Legrand, a French Interpol agent, the man who caught The Raven, shooting him dead, years earlier. He also meets several other characters whom he helps out while helping guard the jewel. One of the specific characters is worth mentioning, Lady Westmacott, who is, what I assume, partially based on Agatha Christie, and for good reason. The mysterious plot, characters, and dialog read out like an Agatha Christie novel, where Zellner resembles her most famous character Poirot.But the great writing and plot development are only there for the Chapter 1, and half of Chapter 2. Througout Chapter 1 and half of Chapter 2, you control Zellner as you travel from Zurich to Venice. From Venice, you board a ship that takes you to Cairo. And in Cairo, you explore a museum and hunt the Raven for a final showdown.If I had to sum up the plot while only following the events of Zellner, who is easily the most likable character that also has the best voice actor (some of the other voice actors are atrocious, specifically Adil.) But on the train, without giving too much away, you help characters go about their day and you also end up being the hero of the day when a bomb goes off within the train. On the ship, you solve a murder. And then at the museum, you have your big finale.Throughout the game though, you'll run into Legrand and Constable Oliver, from London, who try to sway you away from trying to catch the Raven. I felt that Legrand found you incompetent.The other protagonists are Adil, whom is suspected as being the Raven's aid, and is later proven to be when he knock's Zellner out on the ship. His story revolves around him being instructed what to do in his attempt to get the jewel. You control him for half of Chapter 2 and most of Chapter 3. The other protagonist is Praticia, a blonde British woman. I won't give anyting away about her.About the game itself, gameplay and whatnot, the first Chapter has flawless sound, pretty good animation, and very few gameplay bugs. It's clear that the developers spent the most time there as nothing strange really happened.In Chapter 2, there are a few bugs and once you take control of Adil, you can tell where they rushed texturing as the background mountains while on the train are clearly unfinished paintings.Chapter 3 had a ton of bugs that were pretty funny. And the walk cycle animations were kind of horrid.I will say that some of the faces on the characters are ugly, specifically the kid Matt, and his mother. A lot of the other prop models and textures were pretty nice though. One thing I also noticed was the lip syncing; while timed well, the o and u vowels, when spoken, didn't shape like o and u, just a and e, made it look very unbelievable for a 2013 game.So, I loved the plot, most of the gameplay, (point and click detective style and puzzle solving) and the locations and some of the characters were interesting.8.8/10			"

												Nice story, but this game has some serious developmental issues and lacks in many areas.Firstly, don't even for a second think that my 11.2 hours of gameplay was spent actually solving puzzles... It was spent watching the characters walking painfully slow, then getting stuck, doing what looks like a moonwalk on the same spot, then turning around 360˚ and finally examining an object. God, buddha, jesus, allah forbid that you forget to examine an object in another room and have to walk all the way back...This is essentially the game in a nutshell.Then, there's the black screens... it literally just goes black and you cant see what you're doing in the menu screens.The puzzles are beyond easy. To the point where I can say it's almost like an interractive novel. The only time I found it challenging (due to frustration) was when it involved pixel hunting, which in many cases - IT DID.The ending was good, I loved the twist. However, it opened up heaps of plot holes as well...I hardly ever write bad reviews, and I did not hate this game (even though it may sound like it), it's just upsetting that it was buggy to the point where it wasnt playable. It had potential to be a good game. I loved The Book of Unwritten Tales Series, which is why I was dissapointed.			"

												I normally don't like point and click games, but this one really was just exciting.The puzzles were easy (for me anyway), but were still quite entertaining. The existence of the minigames made logical sense, such as playing Shuffleboard on the boat.And the plot twists on top of other plot twists made for a story where I actually had to think....But oh was I wrong….Who turned out to be The Raven, the real one, I was not expecting that.This is a long game, but is so worth the time. The gameplay is great. The story is amazing. This is a game I actually WANTED to play when I got home at the end of each day. It easily gets a 10/10 from me. Well done!			"

												Not a bad game. Not great though. Despite it having quite interesting story the gameplay is torturous sometimes.You character quite often have issues with path finding. There are some very misleading puzzles. Character animations are bad, not awful, but honestly, bad.Thanks to good story and good voice acting this game kept my attention to the end. I would recommend the game for the story but beware of issues above.Good thief hunting!			"

												I like adventure games, and I buy a lot hoping to find the occasional gem. The Raven sadly fails in almost every way. It's surprisingly worse than the average discount game I pick up.The trailer shows an interesting premise: a thief, out of retirement, striking again. Secret identities, crazy capers, danger and intrigue - it sounds almost like a Mission Impossible movie.But while the idea is ok, it was ultimately turned into a plodding, dull game. The puzzles are obtuse and require massive amounts of backtracking. It can be hard to find the exact mouse position to move between screens, or do the exact thing the game expects you to. While most of the time you can move things slowly forward, there are quite a few places where it's easy to get stuck and feel frustrated.The game has hints and ways of exposing clickable items, but they come at a cost: using them lowers your score. I wouldn't care if the score were just a number, but it actually dictates the unlockable bonus content and achievements you get. That means functions that might've helped move the game along become totally off limits. They might as well have not even included them.The graphics are ok, but the animations are lacking. And a lot of the set pieces and backgrounds get re-used. It's lazy artwork.The voice acting is possibly the worst I've ever heard in an adventure game. The biggest offender is whoever plays the main character. The character itself is beyond boring to the point of annoying, and the voice acting only serves to accentuate those traits. He says his lines like he has all the time in the world, only rarely showing emotion. The others might have some good moments, but overall they're not much better.The story is disappointingly empty of any meaning. There's a plot, and there are twists, but since you won't care about any of the characters they all feel inconsequential. Despite all the reveals at the end it doesn't feel like you accomplished anything.There's no real journey here. Moving from point A to point B simply isn't interesting without something at stake. Spend your time elsewhere.			"

												I've bought this title as a real mystery stories enthusiast. I was looking for a good storytelling and a brilliant plot. Unfortunately none of those could be found in the game, and the reasons are multifold.To have a good gaming experience the game mechanics should not stay on our way. Unfortunately - it does. The 3D environment isn't really necessary, for there is no practical use of it in the game, and on my i7 4GB MacMini the game lags awfully even on low details textures. I'm a patient guy and I didn't mind the reaction time so much, but I don't see the point in creating a 3D world for which the only use is to constantly walk from one side of visible map to the other just to change the camera position, so we could access another location. 2D would've been even prettier and for sure a lot faster. Maybe the characters would not dissapear so much and their routing would've been better due to easier calculation process.The graphics is not jaw dropping, but it's nice. The world is colorfull, characters nicely ballanced between reality and cartoon proportions. If the game has been better optimalised, we could even enjoy looking at some of the scenes. As it is though, most of the time will be spent with detail level turned down to get some decent realction times from the game engine. Many players experience lighting problems, random characters dissapearience and some other more or less eyes-hurting graphics glitches. I must agree - the game engine silmply does not handle the 3D environment and lightning. It should not disscourage the players though. Music is nice to listen to, but nothing particularly brilliant. Orchestral score is solid and consistent and recorded properely - the sond quality is very good. Dialogues are decent and some lags in them are triggered by the game engine problems and not by the dialogues quality problems. There is enough feeling put into the lines and each character has its own way with the words. Nothing bad in here.What is bad is the storytelling. If you're looking for this king of game, you probably are a fan of Sherlock or other Agatha Christie, which means you'd like to be able to find the killer/burglar/thief by yourself. To deduct it! Unfortunately you won't be able to do it here. Why? Because the game is constanty feeding you false information. Namely - it lies to you. The plot itself is very simple and every mystery stories enthusiast should have it all figured out by the 2nd of 3 acts offered by the game. Your thought process will be constantly attacked by false data that doesn't make any sense. The first act is the only one written corectly, but that's because it doesn't tell much of a story and is a mere prelude to what happens next. No spoilers here, bet trust me - the further down the road, the worse it gets. Characters contradict each other  in simple matters concerning the game world. One would say it's a wonderful, sunny day, but when you go outside it's raining. There is SO many loose ends not making much of a sense. At the end of act 3 you wonder how could they have let the game so ridden with storytelling errors out. It doesn't stick! I can't go into much detail without any spoilers. Trust me or find a topic an the forums when we discuss those errors. There's sooo many of them.Summing up - game is ridden with 3D engine issues and a lot of storytelling errors. You still might enjoy it thanks to the music, nice looks from time to time and some good dialogues. It won't satisfy your Holmes/Christie hunger though and you should be aware of that. Don't be lured by the game discription. It's not worth your time if you look for a mystery to solve with your mighty deduction powers. If you look for an easy going title, go for it. But only in the 75% off. $20-something price is a robbery.			"

												Finally a point'n'click with a not-dissapointing end. I enjoyed this game very well and the ending was also good enough, what is very unique in p'n'p adventures.My only problem was, it's impossible to play on 4:3 monitor. The settings accept my resolution and didn't transform the picture, but cut the both side. So I cannot find every hotspot. But later I set the resolution to 16:9 and then everything went fine.			"

												This is a point and click adventure that feels like it is written around a great novel. But the game falls short with interface, bad graphics, choppy cut scenes, camera bugs that will force you to restart, and a very boring 10-15 hours to play through the whole thing. I spent half my time staring on my clock on he wall wondering how much longer it would take me to get to a good stopping point so I could take a break. I toughed it out and finished all 3 chapters. The story on the whole was excellent. But getting from beginning to end would have been far more entertaining if they just had a book of this I could read. In summary, red the plot on wiki or something if they have it. It is disappointing because most games now days have a terrible story and all blah action. The Raven has a great story, but really drops the ball with the gameplay. Save your money.			"

												Although I enjoyed the game and the story, I wouldn't buy something like this again. Let's start with the good: voice acting, music and atmosphere is well done. Then comes the bad, I don't feel in control as a player. It feels like I'm just going through the motions, and through a motion picture rather than a game. I don't feel like I am making meaningfull choices as a player in the dialogues. Probably because there are no puzzles in the dialogues. Finally, I really disliked the ""third person"" phrasing, e.g. when playing a character the choice would be ""Where is he going?"", instead of ""Where are you going?"", totally screws up the role-playing effect of the game.

												The Raven was dead - or at least to begin with.The career of the world famous ""Gentleman Master Thief"" came to an abrupt and unexpected end thanks to the intervention of a young, up and coming police officer by the name of LeGrand, and a several storey drop from the roof of a building that he was robbing at the time.Flash forward a few years though, to 1964 and questions over his possible demise begin to be raised following an explosive heist at the British Museum, leading to the theft of one of the priceless jewelled ""Eyes Of The Sphinx"".  Has the Raven returned from the dead, or is this just the work of a copycat?  And why has his modus operandi changed to include violence, something which he had previously avoided?Inspector LeGrand, feted for his part in the apparent termination of the Raven previously, is put in charge of both the case and also of guarding the other Eye Of The Sphinx during its long and perilous trip from London to Cairo, where it is to be displayed, via The Orient Express and luxury ocean liner.  However, you do not play as Inspector LeGrand, or even his eager sidekick from Scotland Yard.  No, instead you are Constable Anton Jakob Zellner - an elderly, balding overweight Swiss policeman whose presence on board the Orient Express is the bare minumum of assistance that the Swiss government could provide and who hitherto has never done anything more exciting than walk the same beat every day of his working life - an extremely unlikely hero at first glance and which does make for a bit of a slow start to the game, with plenty of talking and very little action.It is not until about 20 minutes in that you come across a character called Lady Westmacott, the expy of a certain other real life massively successful classic British crime author and you begin to  understand that you find yourself in a lovingly constructed homage to the works of Agatha Christie.  Constable Zellner is a huge fan of her work and it soon becomes apparent that he shares several traits with that of her most famous fictional detective ""Monsieur Partout"".  He has a logical mind and a keen eye for human behaviour, and it is this that helps him get under the skins of his fellow passengers, one or more of whom may be a great deal more than they appear.In contrast with the obsessed Inspector LeGrand, he is convinced that this Raven is nothing more than a copycat and in his own quiet way is just as determined to bring him to justice.  He is also aware that this adventure may be his last chance to accomplish something worthwhile in his life, as retirement is looming and he is in poor health anyway.  ""If I don't do anything exciting I might have a few more years to live?"" he asks, before dropping his heart tablets in the ocean while preparing to disobey orders and sneak onboard the SS Lydia to search for a stowaway.  His adventures will end up taking him all the way to the catacombs of Cairo, while along the way he will save a young boy from a runaway train, survive being bombed, chloroformed, drugged and concussed (not necessarily in that order), solve the locked room murder of a Baroness on the high seas - which enabled me to live out my dream of gathering a group of suspects together before outlining my deductions - before finally unmasking the Raven.However the game then abruptly switches narrative, changing its viewpoint to that of not one, but two different characters whose plots run parallel to that of the good Constables, overlapping with it at crucial junctures.  The trouble was that by then I was really enjoying my time spent in the comfortable and soothing presence of Constable Zellner that this change of viewpoint was initially disappointing and, although it did explain more fully several key events, the game did lose some of its idiosynchratic charm in the process.  One thing it did do well though is to shed new light on some of the games wide and varied cast.  For example a character that is pretty much a one dimensional comic relief type in Zellner's playthrough is revealed as being old, tired and unwell and very much aware that his presence onboard ship is neither needed or particularly wanted by the crew he is supposedly in charge of, and another unsympathetic character confesses that they realise just how hollow their life is, that they are estranged from their family and that they keep their father's pistol on hand for when they want to end it all.  All the separate plot strands then meet together for the climax leading to a twist ending that, while containing at least one giant plothole and relying a little too much on coincidence, was for me perfectly satisfying.As for the gameplay, one thing I did like was the puzzles.  While some of them may be a little obscure and it is worth mentioning that some of them require you clicking on an object twice as your protagonist may miss details the first time, they are for the most part logical and usually involve common objects that you would expect to find in the immediate surroundings.  So while there is nothing here as brain melting as something you might find in the Sam And Max series for example, this can have the side effect of making proceedings a little too simple, there will be very few instances where you will be genuinely stuck.  The score, provided by the Brandenburg State Orchestra is wonderfully filmic and, while the visuals can be workmanlike, the vocals are absolutely spot on, with the characters sounding exactly how you would imagine them to.Now to the bugs.  A quick scan of both the forums and other reviews of this game can soon unearth some real horror stories and to be fair all the glitches should have been sorted out months ago.  I don't know if I was lucky or if the patches have done their job, but apart from difficulty moving from one screen to another in various spots and one instance where I clicked to perform an action and was then stuck in a loop of a character wandering round in circles until I force closed the game down I managed to get through ok.  It is still worth saving regularly though, just to be on the safe side!In conclusion then, a game with a few rough edges, but the strength of the writing and of the characters make it well worth your time.  If it was an Agatha Christie novel, it wouldn't be a blockbuster like Murder On The Orient Express, but one of her lesser known yet solid efforts like A Mysterious Affair At Styles, perfect for a rainy afternoon's escapist fun.

												It's an interesting game if you like some point and click game that has mistery, puzzle and drama backed up with a really high quality soundtrack.The characters are well made with good dialoge and some funny moments that make you giggle from time to time.The locations are well thought out and camera angles are placed in such a manor that you don't miss clues or spend to much time scratching your head what to do next. Most of the hints are gathered from talking with other characters. There are some cases where you might get stuck as some objects are hidden more than others but it is not frustrating to figure out what's next.There are some minor texture and character / object glitches but they don't take away from the overall experience. In my opinion the game should have been more exposed as it brakes away from the flood of other games and it takes on a chance that not many publishers are willing to take on in recent years. I played the Broken Sword series and I enjoyed it very much so if you also have a background from those this will fell right at home.If you don't want to pay full price than wait for a sale as it's worth it's asking price.

												The Raven, a classic feeling point and click game that takes you on a journey to find a gentleman thief. The story is slow in the beginning, but picks up shortly after the first chapter. It will bring you to think deeper about what is going on around you and to think about what every character is doing, and how they are involved. Very sow paced, the movement of characters, the dialogue, the questioning, the stories. It makes you use logic to figure out both hard and easy puzzles, from opening secret passage ways to attaching a light bulb to wires to light up a room, its a very fun and interesting experience.The movement I found was slightly annoying on computer. The angles of the camera made it really hard to see different doors and items at some points. Some rooms would even be pitch black, making to scan the whole screen with your map (unless you wanted to use your detective points, reducing your overall chapter score at the end) Fun twists and characters that you can enjoy, good and bad,Personal Rating: 3.5/5			"

												I'm a somewhat avid puzzle game player. I haven't had much practice with the lateral thinking so this game took me longer because I would get stuck on certain puzzles. While challenging, I did enjoy the puzzles though only having the ability to select relevant items is almost like cheating since you know they must somehow interact together. For a summary of the pros and cons:Cons:-There are some bugs with the character's movements. Especially when trying to transition between rooms. This can quickly become infuriating because you spend your time staring at the courser while slowly scanning the game screen to find an area that will let you say ""Move to other room"". It's really bad in Chapter 1 but be aware and push through it.-One of the scenes in the other chapters are from a birds eye, which is great for an overview of the room but it's significantly harder to know where you should click to interact with people or items. -There is one case with your inventory where you pick up an item and you must click it in your hand rather than access it from your inventory in order to use said item. While this only happens once, it is rather frustrating. -There is not a smooth transition to the next chapter. You have select ""New Game"" and choose the next chapter. So if you haven't saved your progress in a different place so you can get OCD completion, it's a little irritating. And you don't really feel like you can play the whole story through.But those are mostly my nitpicks. Now to the pros.Pros:-The voices become really strong as you progress and they stay true to the character throughout the story. -A lot of story with really strong character development available and if you just want to skip through the words, just keep clicking the left mouse button.-The first two chapters end with really strong cliffhangers so I had to power through the early mornings and finish the game. Totally worth it and I loved the story.-You can use what you learned from the previous investigations to tell the story of what happened. You get an achievement and it feels fun rubbing it in Legrand's face.-There are pretty awesome twists to the story. I did not see most of them coming and it was really a nice, detailed and heart warming story.-This is a slight spoiler but I won't share all the details. You do change what character you follow during the story. You don't control the change, the story does. This does give you a really nice opportunity to hear other people's views and you learn the full story with better details.In summary; a really nice mystery game that is worth getting. Replay is kind of low but the story is really good and taking the time to figure out the puzzles on your own is worth it. If there was a continuation of any kind, I would definitely buy it. "

												I feel as though the writing staff and creative team behind this game distinctly had a good vision, but they lacked the technical skill to pull it off. The plot of the game is fairly well written, the puzzles mostly make sense, and the voice acting is usually not the bad. However, it falls short repeatedly when looked at from a technical viewpoint, which surprising as a point and click shouldnt have a lot of technical failures. First off: all camera angles are fixed, and they quite often -refuse- to change to match your character's location. I'll find myself clicking to an area off to the left, for example, and the character wil just walk against an invisible wall and never make any progress in that direction. I eventually found that, to make the camera shift to the left, I had to move my character to the RIGHT which made no sense. Furthermore, there are moments where the game will essentially freeze up or deny progress. Upon examining an object of the scenery, my character walked up to it, bent over to look at it, and vanished, forcing me to reload a save, and at one point my character just got stuck walking in place. To this I'd usually say 'well, just save the game a lot' but even that isn't a reliable counter measure as the game has, in one istance, just straight up deleted all save from the last 3 hours of gameplay. Its very frustrating, especially since I DID want to beat the game. And even though the game is not very graphically intensive even at the higher resolutions, I had to put it at the lowest setting possible just to make it function smoothly, and my laptip gets REALLY heated up when running this, even though my latop can play more graphically intensive games just fine.Overall, while the story and setting are interesting, the developers very much lacked the technical skill to properly put together a videogame. I think The Raven would just have been better off as a movie or something, because its too frustrating to navigate as a videogame. I liked the things that worked well, but I wouldn't recommend it to other players.			"

												Basically a tribute to an Agatha Christie/Hercule Poirot novel. The protagonist looks like Poirot, and there is even an elderly female mystery writer on holiday, on a train that looks a lot like the Orient Express. Good effort, nice visuals, but the puzzles are mostly fillers (use key on lock), slower pace than ideal, terrible navigation, subpar voice acting, and 2 game-breaking bugs I've encountered, the first I could recover from (Dr. & bullet, ch.1), the other I couldn't (wooden pole in museum, ch.2). I'm not even giving Chapter 3 a try even though I bought it. Completely ridiculous.			"

												So i bough this game with high hopes of fun investigations and clue solving. Both of those went allright for me but my main problem is that the game isen't made for you to move around with a mouse. I would get stuck inside a train car for a longer amount of time then i care to admit. So if you plan on playing this game without a controller i do not recommend it unless you enjoy clicking every single spot on the screen to try to get to the next cart and watch your fat clumsy constable zellner turn back and forth. seriously i think this game was made just to make me rage			"

												WARNING!  DO NOT buy this game!  Unless you like paying for games that don't work.It does NOT even run, and the developers don't bother to answer all the problems many people are having with getting the game to run on Mac, PC and Linux.  It won't even start on Mac OS X 10.9.1, I have not been able to play 1 minute of this game.  It immediately crashes when you click on ""Play"" in Steam.  Almost 3 weeks now and they have not even gotten back to me on my problem.  Sure they post when the game is on sale and answer when someone wants to know what's included the Deluxe edition of the game but not the REAL problems people are having with running the game.Read thru the forums here and on the official site and see what I'm talking about.I just want my money back now.  But I highly doubt they will answer my email or the many other people in the same boat.Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this game unless you want a real headache to deal with.			"

												Pretty good if you like adventure games. The puzzles aren't unrealistic or very hard (maybe there are some points where you'll need to use the hint system, which helps figuring it out), in my opinion it has a very good balance... some adventure games are so twisted that you end up having to look up guides all the time, this one has just about the right difficulty to be able to go through it without too much help and still be challenging.Even thought there are a few optional puzzles to try to avoid linearity, this is mostly showcased in the first chapter, and not so much on later ones, which is a pity.The story is engaging and it's interesting how they make you see the action under different points of view and when you think you had figured it out they still manage to surprise you in the end.However, unless you are really a big fan of graphic adventures I'd wait for it to be on sale, otherwise it's quite pricey.

												This game is one great piece of art. The graphic quality is outstanding for the genre, and the visual style perfect for the ambience the game wanted to set. The characters are believable and the voice acting, magnificent. The key characters are also very charismatic and charming. You can pour yourself into the game; there's no lazy storytelling to stop you.While the riddles tip the balance towards the ""too easy"" end of the scales, it doesn't really affect the gameplay in a very noticeable way. The pacing, although slow, is not mood-breaking. It serves its purpose of building up the tension when it needs to.I would recommend this game to anyone who has a liking for detective/noir fiction, or someone who wants to step down from their more agitated gaming worlds and chill out in a classic point and click adventure with a brilliant story to tell.

Product received for free
Too expensive?This was a free game for a gaming magazine a few months ago. But not paying for a game doesn't mean playing said game is free. You invest more than 10 hours of your life into this. Which means that if the game is not good enough, even ""free"" can be expensive. Was it this time? Let's find out.Wo bist du?You play the role of a Swiss policeman in the hope that your final act before retirement would be to catch The Raven. The burglar who was responsible for stealing expensive jewelries earlier. So you find yourself in a point and click adventure game walking around and clicking on things. Later you also get control of other characters to be able to see the full picture and get to the end of the riddle.We are the playerWas it a good idea? Is it a good mechanics to reveal the picture by controlling multiple characters? From the immersion perspective, it isn't. I felt disconnected when I first realized that from now on I get to control someone else. However, from the story perspective, it is a good decision. Seems to be the most logical choice of storytelling once you know the whole picture. Which you don't until the last scene.Walk Like an EgyptianSo what do we have here?We have a great music in this game, also we have a nice story and a great storytelling. And while I did not really like how the characters look like, I do like how the environment looks like. Not the most impressive looking thing ever, but still decent and it has its own charm.Then why did I put a ""not recommended"" seal to this game, you might ask. Unfortunately because of every other aspect of the game:You make no decisions at all and what you do in one chapter of the game doesn't affect the happenings in the other chapters at all. You can't even play the game continously. Once you finished Chapter 1, the credits roll then you simply click ""New Game"" and you select Chapter 2 from there.You can save. But don't be fooled. The save feature doesn't really saves your current progress instead it saves from an arbitrary checkpoint. And that checkpoint might had happened to be just a moment before your save or 15 minutes earlier. You never know until you reload your save and you realise you have no idea which point of the game you are at. And you also have to redo a lot of things.I found most riddles dumb. At a point you have a mirror. You want to look around somewhere using that mirror. So you take a radio antenna and stick the mirror to the radio antenna by using a candy you chewed to make it stick. I'm serious. And it holds for like 30 minutes or more. And there are more of these.The movement around is horrible and makes your head ache. You are lucky if the character you control goes where you clicked. Otherwise they love teleporting, moonwalking, ice skating on the floor without having ice or a pair of skates, or just standing in one place and doing full rotations like a radar.The animations are poorly done and the faces look like made of plasticine. If you wish to avoid nightmares, just follow this sanity-saving tip: whenever you think Mrs. Miller is going to smile, close your eyes.TL;DRGreat story with nice music. But for full price it doesn't worth the pain trying to get the characters go where you want them to go. Because they won't. I'm not entirely sure that even playing it for free worth it. Can't honestly tell you any scenario where you should be buying this game for real-life money. And that's really sad because the Poirot-mood is nicely catched.			"

												This game is embarrassingly bad. Not only it's extremely boring, filled with inane dialog and ridiculous plot, but also riddled with bugs. I had to force close the game because the character was stucked in an animation loop in chapter 3 (and by the way, animations are so bad they're almost hilariously funny). Unfortunately I can't force myself any longer through the boredom, so I guess I won't see the ending. Chances are I'm not really missing anything at all.			"

												The interface is horrible you will spend for ever slowy moving your curisor over things to find objects to interact with and just trying to move from one area to the next is a feat of patience and random clicking. I have never ever been so ticked off at a video game in my life. I love stories but would it of killed them to have move arrows for between the sceans/areas just so I could get on with the story? -_- I will not let a dumb and poorly thought out game defeat me! I will finish this and them never ever buy from these people again in this genre unless they annouce an all new easy to use clicking interface for movement. Game made me feel sick with frusteration. Also Guess what!!! they keep warning you when the screens are loading that if you get frusterated take a break or talk to all the npc. Almost every single time you load into the next area. If they knew what a pain in the butt something was going to be why not fix it? Oh it's suppose to be a mystery and you have to find the right items to continue forward.  Like Hell you do! There's objects everywhere you can't interact with but you could logical use. Why make a torch when theres a flash light and batteries in the bar drawer? Also they have adventure points that will show a magnify glass above the items in the room you can interact with, it's a brief flash and almost useless, unless you hit it look in one area of the screen, click it again and look in another area, etc. Actually as I'm typing this I don't even want to finish this game screw it and what a waste of cash. I want my money back!!!! An elementary student could of beta tested for problems better then the creators of this game. Also a kid could of given them tons of feedback. -_- fricken LAME!!!!!!! more colorful words add here.If you play this anyways to see for your self, have a punching bag/pillow or alot of soft things to throw.

												Poorly designed, particularly in terms of puzzles that exist. In Chapter 1, there's a button which matches the floor (but apparently has little to do with anything because it's gone almost as soon as you got it); some puzzles make little sense or continue to allow you to do the thing you shouldn't do (or might be bugged -- I know I need to light the bowl of rum on fire but I can't, despite the fact that I should logically be able to light the torch directly with a match).Constable Zellner often gets stuck in some weird pirouette when trying to move between areas of the same compartment, which is infuriating. Keyboard controls or controller configuration need to be implemented to avoid this, as it really detracts from any fun a person might have.It might be interesting, it could be endearing, but there are aspects of it that make it obnoxious to play through and difficult to tolerate.

												This game is a bit too mind numbing for me. You don't want to beat the game in one day. If you do you'll be forcing yourself to enjoy the rest of the game. It's better off to play in the three different point of views one day at a time if that. Each point of view/chapter is at least 2 hours or so, depending on how fast you find items in the game. There's a hint button at the bottom as usual, but it'll take away from your score. As far as I'm concerned I only had to use it twice so far, once in each point of view so it's fairly easy to progress in the game. If that's a game for you then go ahead and buy it, but I feel they could've made it so much more interesting, especially with how much they bragged in the trailer.			"

												Not *terrible* at all, I will preface this review with. Just not good enough to warrant its price, and likely that you can find many better games in the genre.Aside from a never-ending supply of technical bugs (there are apparently *less* now than there used to be and it's still kind of a trainwreck) the story of the game fails majorly in one regard, and I'll get to that first. The main issue is that halfway through the game (and the second chapter) you basically know everything that's going to happen in the plot save the last 5 minutes of chapter 3. Because the entire second half of the game is one long flashback. Basically showing how the villain's plan was pulled off in what we see in the first half of the game. A lot of this is tedious and uninteresting; the developers would have been better off having the villain explain how the plan succeeded or at least picked up the pace of this section. I don't need to see/perform every single action slowly removing the mystery of the plot. The point where the flashback occurs also leaves a massive cliffhanger, which is, again, not resolved until 5 minutes before the game ends. I just feel the story could be much better organized than it ended up, which is a big fault in a game that's 50% story.Technical bugs in this game include stiff animations, characters magically jumping from one point to another, getting stuck on objects, a room or two that's hard to find your way out of, an instance of dialogue sound levels being near-mute, and many, many more, but just these off the top of my head. It's mostly in the animation, yeah, but I was once in a scenario where the only solution was to save and reload because an item didn't properly appear in my inventory when it should have (which thankfully it does after you save and reload but it's a bit worrisome regardless.)So. The gameplay fails on a technical level. The story fails on a written level. All in all... the game still manages to be decent fun in spite of this. The puzzles are never too obscure and there's an in-game hint system if you get stuck. The characters for the most part are well-written and there's some great dialogue between them. The mystery of the plot is well-presented (at least in the first half of the game) and the identity of the Raven is well-obscured without being entirely impossible to work out (I didn't, but playing through the second time I spotted some of the tells, which is a sign of a well-written mystery). One thing that irks me still is the game's insistence on what a true mystery novel should be (as spoken by a character who writes mystery novels). It's a tad preachy and it fails in its own regards at being a good story in some aspects making it hypocritical. That aside though, the story is good ignoring the horrible decision to make half of it redundant.I can't recommend this game though because it's fairly pricy (the same as Telltale's recent offerings!) and there's just much better in the genre.

There is a lot of sitting and waiting while staring at a black black screen as your uncharming protagonist moves between rooms (or from one half of a railway carriage to the other), and everything is done in an annoyingly roundabout way and without real humour.There is nothing appealing about any of the characters. A potentially great story and some lovely cinematic ideas havw been completely ruined here.An easily pleased ten year old with low expectations might enjoy this game. "

It's a mix of a bit o' dis book a bit o' dat novel, they didn't really make an original story. I thought the finale was cute, but after an unbearable amount of bugs, movement impairments and slooooooooooow walks I rushed to the end and was so relieved to get to it, I didn't enjoy it properly.The game isn't difficult at all, you can't go wrong: there's such a small amount of objects in such little space and almost no puzzles that it almost feels like a movie (one that you could swear you've already watched), more than a game.

It's mostly in the animation, yeah, but I was once in a scenario where the only solution was to save and reload because an item didn't properly appear in my inventory when it should have (which thankfully it does after you save and reload but it's a bit worrisome regardless.)So. The gameplay fails on a technical level. The story fails on a written level. All in all... the game still manages to be decent fun in spite of this. The puzzles are never too obscure and there's an in-game hint system if you get stuck. The characters for the most part are well-written and there's some great dialogue between them. The mystery of the plot is well-presented (at least in the first half of the game) and the identity of the Raven is well-obscured without being entirely impossible to work out (I didn't, but playing through the second time I spotted some of the tells, which is a sign of a well-written mystery). One thing that irks me still is the game's insistence on what a true mystery novel should be (as spoken by a character who writes mystery novels). It's a tad preachy and it fails in its own regards at being a good story in some aspects making it hypocritical. That aside though, the story is good ignoring the horrible decision to make half of it redundant.I can't recommend this game though because it's fairly pricy (the same as Telltale's recent offerings!) and there's just much better in the genre.

												semi-ok story but very slow ...even for a point and click..besides the story being slow it slows you down very much with the fact the devs of this game gave us a BORING lead character and no way to move him faster..by double clicking him walking does nothing..His middle aged balding chunky little wobble just starts to get annoying..And.. you cant change your direction once you click to go across a room..you need to wait until this wibble wobble of a man finishes his walk...Unreal how a newer point and click game didnt think to make movement faster for those who dont need to see this guy walk the WHOLE room just to get to a area you need only to come back and have to wait again..Sad.. story is BLAND..no flavor..no memorable characters either..the only thing that will stick out in memory about this game is that is SLOW..and Story lacks any type of creative thinking...YEah...This game could be called PInk Panther Strikes AGain..change the RAven to Pink Panther..DOne...if your looking for a intresting detective police point and click..this one will BORE you...it sure Bored me...

												I didn't enjoy the game.  I understand it's a point and click, so you point and click but there didn't seem to be much thought behind the clicks.  Just keep clicking and eventually the answers will be shown to you.  I just found myself after awhile clicking and clicking, just going through the motions and finding very little enjoyment in playing the game.			"

												Great idea, great graphics, great atmosphere. Terrible execution. The gamepad controls are confusing and unusable--they are sloppy, don't consistently allow cycling through all available hotspots, and don't allow access to the inventory. The mouse controls are also inconsistent. Instead of allowing you to click on every hotspot with every inventory item and sometimes saying, ""that won't work"", they leave you guessing about whether you clicked the right place. This is terrible because there's no way to interrupt a long monologue once it has started, and you can click one pixel off and trigger the same whole discussion again with no way to stop. Finally, the main character is annoying. I didn't want to be that guy. Many of the choices presented were ones where I didn't want to do any of those things, and you can't abort a conversation early. So, you basically end up reading an annoying novel in slightly random order instead of playing a game where you are in control.			"

												I remember watching the trailer and thinking this will be a fun game when it comes out. I finally got it with all three chapters. I just finished the first chapter and the story pulls you in from the begining. This point-and-click adventure has many of the trappings of a good old-fashioned mystery.The Raven begins with you, as Swiss constable Anton Jakob Zellner, aboard the Orient Express. A priceless jewel, one of the two Eyes of the Sphinx, has just been stolen in a daring museum robbery.I would strongly suggest that you read through the raven achievements, which will help you get through the game. Check everything twice or more and get all the information. I don't want to give away too much, it comes down to things like the personalities of the characters, the excitement of the story, and the cleverness of the puzzles.The Raven is a fun Mystery/Puzzle game so far. I would recommend this game if you like Mystery or Puzzles.			"

												This is a mediocre adventure game, with uninteresting characters and an uncompelling plot.  The only thing it has going for it is that it has an Agatha Christie athmosphere, though the similarities are a tad over the top.I found the characters to be bland and uninteresting most of the time, with slow and tedious dialogue... I constantly found myself thinking ""Get to the bloody point"" while going through the dialogue options.  The plot was rather predictable and very cliché.  The final plot twist was over the top and felt ""forced"".  What I DID like about the story is that each chapter shows parts of the same story from different points of view... that was pretty well done.The game mechanic of having to ""look"" at an object once, twice or more times before being able to use it, or exhaust all investigative options was not very intuitive.  With this game, they tried to do it differently I guess, but adventure games have worked the same way for a long time and with good reason.  What they intended to be innovative turned out to be counter intuitive and frankly not fun to play.  The fact that some of the steam achievements are linked to clicking on everything until you've exhausted all possible clickable hotspots, is quite ridiculous.It's not a polished title either.  On three occasions I had to restart the game and replay part of the story because my character had gotten stuck in an animation loop.  Luckily I picked this game up at a considerable discount, so I wasn't that upset with it.I would not recommend this game to anyone.			"

												For what is supposed to be a story rich game, the main character fell short.Was looking for a point and click game with an interesting story like what telltale games has been able to produce. Read a lot of reviews and thought this would be another, but for me was boring and too tough to get into. Perhaps I didn't give it enough time (the glitches helped cut it short for me), but the setting was dull and the main character was a dolt. I cannot recommend this game mostly due to the lack of any attention-getting in the beginning of the game. Seems like a solid puzzle and difficulty level, just not for me.			"

												The first episode was fun, and had interesting characters and you could tell they took their time with it. Subsquent episodes fell flat and felt rushed. The first playable character is likable and charming, but the second one is horribly annoying. I guess early on who The Raven truly was. I was waiting for exciting build up but when it came time to reveal it, it felt almost cheap. The puzzles were straight forward, not too hard not too easy. Episodes two and three had a lot of bugs and at one point was game crippling. The achievements didn't work correctly which annoyed me because I should have had max score, and I don't think I want to try again to get them. Episode one ropes you in and you expect a good follow up, but it falls horribly flat in the end. It's not a terrible adventure game, but not good either.4.5/10			"

												Bad handling, terrible suspension, nice view, great radio. Get it for a couple of quid on sale if you enjoy watching a bit of Poirot but can't get your fix after the show finished.This game is a clunky one, and you may have to click in the wrong direction to get the correct perspective to go in the right direction. I often wished for a keyboard and mouse control combo, It would have been improved by tank controls even. It has something like it for the 360 controller, but mouse was a better choice over that. Hit boxes are hit and miss (miss, mostly). Good luck finding things that are somewhere behind another object. Or the exit. It is not terribly exciting, and the story is really slow, but it gives a *mild* feeling of wanting to know what happens next. Just enough to play the game through twice over. Barely. The graphics are.. ok? Backgrounds are great, walk cycles are dreadful, characters are nice from afar but demonic hellspawn of wallace and grommit from up close. Voice acting and writing is.. not annoying? Good enough. I think most of the budget has gone to set painting and music; the ambiance is great.			"

But instead, for example, you must play as an north african who sleeps with a blonde woman: something very unlikely to have happened before 1968, and not explained at all in the trailer. That was just an example of how misleading the trailer is. In summary: the game is very different from its sales pitch. Buyer, be aware.			"

												I quite enjoy this game. It's a point-and-click adventure that's also part detective novel.Pros:Engaging story. It's a crime novel, so it makes you guess whodunnit every chance it gets.Deep, well-defined characters. *Every* single character has something unique and likable about them. They feel like real people rather than just characters.*Very* beautiful animations and character models. Tons of beautiful, rich environments. 10/10 on the graphics. Incredible attention to detail. Every scene, every room looks like it took days just to decide what objects went into it. The game rewards your observation skills, like whether the doctor handed the glass of champagne to the captain.Cons: Sometimes has graphical glitches -- character warps in from edge of screen or rubber-bands into place. Doesn't affect anything though. Sometimes it's hard to get the character to move to the next screen. You have to know where to click. Unskippable cutscenes. Annoying when you f**ked up and are replaying a chapter for the achievements.Music gets annoying very quickly.Summary:10/10 graphics7/10 gameplay10/10 story+characters8/10 overall game experience "

												Charming graphics, if Howdie Doodie made a game the color palette would of come from it.  3D models well done as are the textures. Very colorful and vibrant. Love mystery adventures and this one seems like its right up my alley. Has the flavor of most of the The Adventure Company games. This one just seems more polished and well done.  Load times between scenes are a tad long but liveable.  Typical adventure game mechanics, point to walk to a point, investigate everything around you, speak to everyone. Very heavy in dialogue but thats not a bad thing, it does keep your attention as its not particularly wordy, just  a lot of back and forth discussions. Certainly interesting, and Im interested in seeing how this plays out. Scores well in Europe with and average rating of 80%. A must grab if your a classic adventure buff.			"

												In the beginning, The Raven seems like a fantastic little adventure game. The characters are interesting, from the Hercule Poirot-like main character to the various passengers you'll interact with, including a genre-savvy mystery novelist who may as well be Agatha Christie (it's easy to tell where their inspirations came from), and the mystery and intrigue that the first episode builds up seems like it's going to be a great time. But then episode 2 strolls along, and the story ends about halfway through it - the entire rest of the game, including all of episode 3, is essentially a recap detailing the events from the perspective of two other characters. Everything after the middle of chapter 2 is just a downward spiral, both in the storytelling and in the actual game stability, with episode 3 being a rollercoaster of moments where you can get stuck in a walk cycle and have to force the game to close. The reveal of the villain isn't just uninteresting, it's practically insulting; at one point in the game, while talking to the mystery novelist, the main character is discussing her thoughts about the culprit and she replies ""This isn't one of those cliche mystery novels where the culprit is someone who isn't introduced until the end - it's likely someone you already know well!"", and yet that is exactly what happens. The game has little side-puzzles and optional things you can do throughout it, but none of them matter because despite being episodic the game doesn't actually link the episodes like most do; you have to start a new game and choose a new episode for each one. The Raven showed a lot of promise initially, but underneath its mask there wasn't a master thief, just disappointment and regret.			"

												This is a good game.The graphics are well done, soundtrack and voiceover are amazing, the story is thrilling and involving.The only thing is game lack is gameplay.Sure, it is a point-and-click adventure, not much to expect on the gameplay side,but the controls really annoy me. Walking is a pain. The character is not responsible,and the camera angle really makes it hard to walk to another area, specially when you need to walk towards the lower part of the screen, which will make you open the inventory while you are trying to walk.But then again, what would one expect of a middle aged man who needs to talk out loud every single thing he sees or does to himself before being able to make any choices?Also, there are a few bugs... sometimes the character disappears, sometimes all the map disappears and only the NPCs are left, weird stuff, but usually fixes itself just by taking any actions.If you don't mind the inconvenience, it is a great game. But can be pretty annoying to hardcore gamers.			"

												This is the worst game I ever bought.  It was too expensive, doesn't play right, all you get is silly characters talking.  I asked for my money back because they game sucks and they refused, so all I can do is go to every game review site and give it a failure rating.  I really think it is lousy, there is no ""game"" to speak of, instead you get these badly constructed characters engaged in silly conversations that go nowhere.  As far as it being a 'game"" it isn't, more like a RIPOFF in the name of a game....really, they charged $25.00 for this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥and won't admit it is a piece of crap.Perhaps if my money was returned I could maintain a polite discourse and as is stated above 'follow the rules' but the game maker didn't follow the rules of backing up what they sell and returning money if the game didn't work....I am playing through Steam on an iMac, using a Macally mouse (two buttons, one scroll wheel) but under options, there is no way to set up a mouse to coordinate and move the 'so called game' along, so one is forced to participate in the useless/sensless dialogue with no game play at all.  This game company is a RIPOFF, and steam is participating, therefore they are a RIPOFF TOO.i want my money back for this bogus ripoff so-called game that doesn't work.			"

												A charming 3D point and click adventure published by Nordaic Studios. I really love the atmosphere and world in this one, it is so relaxing and laid back but at the same interesting. If you want a interesting adventure game that will consume a lot of your time, pick this up :)EDIT: I have played the game 100% and I have to say this is one of my favorite detective stories ever told in a video game. I will not spoil anything but please, play the game all the way through and enjoy. Make sure you listen and talk to everyone possible and more importantly think. Thank you for delivering the best 3D point and click adventure game I have played in a unbelievabe amount of years. This game has wonderful enviornments and a charming art style to go with it. I will never forget its wonderful music that gave each level its own personality.The only thing I can negatively say is that there are tons of bugs and honestly it is fustrating to go from one screen to the next. The way to fix this is to use the controller option, so please get yourself a XBOX 360 or PS3 controller and switch the settings to ""Gamepad."" I know it might take the point and click charm away, but the adventure and story is still there without most of the bugs you may encounter. But please don't let it stop you! Love you			"

												This game is really good. The story is fun to follow. The puzzles inside the game are okay and sometimes too easy. The graphics are really good for an point&click adventure and the overall feeeling inside the game was good. BUT...the programming staff of the dev team should be fired! It is enormously annoying that there were so many flaws in the programming. There are situations, where you can't switch from one scene to the other. Sometimes the characters start to turn in the circle without doing anything else. And you can't even escape this situations. You have to reload the last save. I mean...what the hell? Did the people even played they own game, before they released it? It is freaking annoying! The game is really good...but the bugs destroy the whole fun of it. It could be a masterpiece, but in the end it was screwed up!			"

												It feels good to play again an old-styled adventure games. The game is decent graphics, sound effects and soundtracks. You can definitely see they tried as hard as possible to make little corners look good. And the difficulty is about right, not too difficult or easy. However the game doesn't work perfectly: one is that the graphics are broken somewhat under Linux -- I have only played this game under Linux so I don't know about Windows, namely several cutscenes that focus on characters or objects going on at hand. There're about 5 of them in game, it's not much but does bother the gaming experience. The second problem is that the controls aren't very intuitive. When the protagonist interacts with something, he always moves around the objective or act weird. And the transition between scenes is somewhat broken at certain locations.tl;drThis game scores at 7/10 at my standards.Pros: good graphics, good music, good sounds, mediocre plot.Cons: graphics seldom but do break under Linux though doesn't effect gameplay; clumsy controls.

That and other minor glitches (like people walking in circles) were distracting when I played.			"

7/10 - Charming+  The lead constable character is a neat old guy and he just makes you like him.  The reluctant hero plays nicely here.  Point-and-cliick storytelling with very nice textures and environments.  Dialogues are very good in comparison to the rest of this genre.  Good gameplay length.-  Linear gameplay that relies on sticking this doodad in that doobopper before you look at the thing over there.  Some of the minigame puzzles are obviously built for controllers and very difficult to maneuver on mouse and keyboard.			"

												Remember getting furious at point and click adventure games because the object combinations were just too damn illogical and impossible to figure out? Then rejoice! This game keeps everything that made point and click adventures great while eliminating this annoying trait. But that's not the only reason why you should get it. I just finished this game and I can honestly say that it was one of the best point and click adventures I've ever played. The music score was amazing and it fit the game perfectly, the environments were pretty to look at, colorful and rich (the train and Egypt... *drool*). The difficulty was well balanced - I got stuck now and then, but nothing that couldn't be overcome. But what really makes this game stand out so much are the story and the characters. I won't say much about the story because it would be difficult to keep it spoiler-free, but I'll say a bit about the characters. The character work is one of the best I've ever seen in the games. These are no ""accessory"" characters that are in the game only because someone has to give you clues - they all have their history, their unique personality traits, they react to each other. And their voice acting is very good. Their involvement in the story and how the things you know change as you progress are surprisingly well executed. And the ending had my jaw drop. Although I love this game to bits, there were some things that made it a little frustrating for me. I never found out how to cancel a movement, so when you accidentally click somewhere, you can't do anything but wait for your character to finish the walk. The transitions between screens were sometimes difficult to find and sometimes the character flatly refused to walk to the next area, making me walk around for a few minutes, clicking on different parts of the floor. It is also somewhat buggy, the character sometimes got stuck in an object and then teleported to the intended direction, or appeared somewhere else before executing an action. But even though these things were unpleasant, they did not affect the gameplay much.To conclude - if you're a lover of point and click adventure games, then this is a gem you should defenitely not miss. I finished the game in 12 hours and still don't have all of the achievements, so the game time isn't bad. If you're looking for a great story and believable, memorable characters, the Raven is your man (game).			"

												Brilliant game to be honest, mostly all thumbs up. Nice plot twists and interesting characters and conversing with them is enjoyable. Very story rich, and there's a lot of things you can interact with that's got nothing to do with the main story but it's still interesting to see/hear.The only problem I have with the game is the amount of bugs in it. Using one item to interact with another sometimes doesn't work, and requires a client restart (for me at least). Getting from one frame into the next is extremely buggy in almost all areas of the game, requiring you to walk back and forth a lot before triggering it. Honestly though that's the only problem I had with it. Other than that it's one of the best point and click crime games I've ever played.			"

It is the usual point and click adventure game where we play as an amateur constable from switzerland named Zellner. It's basically finding things throughout the place and combining them to solve problems. The gameplay is okay, but sometimes I got stuck while walking to a different area, but it's not a big problem.

It's above most point and click crime solving mysteries, but the cons are too much.Because sadly the controls are so difficult, it's a feat to make the constable go where you want him to. Not to mention it's at most times impossible to walk between rooms, which you do a lot in this game. The game is simply too buggy for me to recommend it, at least for full price.PS: I run on Windows 8.			"

												The early chapters were brilliant, an all round great point and click game. The voice acting, dialog, atmosphere, puzzles, characters, music, and backgrounds are great. There are some annoying parts of the game, like getting stuck at the end of one screen and finding it difficult to enter into another section. For example having to spend five minutes clicking everywhere you can to try and access another part of the train. I did also feel that the last few chapters were not nearly as polished as the early ones and were kinda buggy which is a real shame.I'd still recommend the game, even though Not really spoiler but I'll put it here any wayI thought the ending was a bit strange considering we have access to the protagonists thoughts.

Sometimes difficult to leave a room, to place the character well, but I thought it was little bugs with no importance. And then, the big bug, an important screwdriver that I pick up doesn't appear in my bag. Impossible to use it, it doesn't exist, and without it I can't keep on the game. I reloaded 3 times my last auto-save but the problem is still here. So I have to stop the game or to begin again, knowing that this game has many other bugs which aren't fixed, a lot of people are complaining about it. If I knew before buying and beginning the game... I never played to a game with so much big blocking bugs, and I think it's a shame to sell such a product, it should still be in Beta.			"

												I play allot of P&C Adventure games...just look at my library---I am not sure why but I love to play them.  This is a game I really had a love hate relationship with and as a fan of the genre I feel abit torn about this game. The story is very Agatha Christe-esque and Its a nice change of pace to be a fat old dude for the lionshare of the game... I know that sounds odd but I did find him rather likeable. The story is a bit thin at times and I feel it needs more polish. The voice acting is hit and miss and so are the graphics, theres a part where your talking to a certain female character on the ship and I swear she looks NIGHTMARISH like a Five nights at Freddy's anamatronic... however some of the emvironments like the the train look fairly nice. Now the biggest issue is the Interface... I ATTEMPTED the controller option but that was joke, Frankesntien is more agile and responsive than the lead. The mouse controls are equally attrocious but the lesser evil. sometimes you need to click the bottom of the screen but the stupid inventory auto pops up or the camera anagle changes to stairwell and you accidently click the wrong way and the game forces you to wait for the lead chacracter to lumber back accross the screen. However if you can navigate through these issues, its a decent adventure game and WAY worth it if its on sale for 50% or more. The puzzle are mostly logical save a few (one involving a door) and its not to hard to avoid the ""looking up a walkthrough"" method online. I give it a 7.2 out of 10 -			"

												If you like Poirot this game is for you! Immediately you will see that the characters and settings are shamelessly used throughout the game. Both large and small references to the books and series are made. You will be taken on a ride where you will experience being a master detective on the hunt for the Raven. Buy it and enjoy hours of fun puzzles.			"

												I'll change my recommendation once the developers fix the UI. This is a good old-fashioned detective story, and I enjoy the thought put into the puzzles, BUT. The character often won't walk where you need him to, effectively halting your game progress. The fixed camera is also frustrating. If they simply let you move the camera around there wouldn't be any issue with getting Zellner to move where you want him to.			"

												Great ""old-fogeyish"" point&click adventure game which reminded me of Agatha Christie's detective stories. The story is really clever and so are the dialogues. Just bear in mind that it's a really slow-paced game with almost no action and a lot of talking.Graphics and animation is very nice with the exception of hair styles. And the 3D engine renders pretty bad shadows on characters' faces.The only major complaint are the bugs. The invisible or teleporting characters didn't happen too often and could be ignored. But three times I've encountered a serious bug when the main character got stuck and walked infinitely on the spot. There is no way how to stop the walking once initiated so the only solution was to kill and restart the game and hope for the best.			"

												I have a soft affection for point and click ""adventure"" games.  I purchased The Raven because the producers had a previous reputation of producing very good point and click games.I played the game for 2 hours (according to steam) and it's just hard to want to play it further.  The game is simply boring.  There is nothing that makes me want to go further.  All you do is walk around talking to boring characters, trying to figure things out that are sometimes, way too hard (I had to cheat and look online what to do next, seriously, a tiny spec on the ground hardly visible is a button critical to a storyline in the first episode).  The game's pros: you will learn historical culture (and I fancy myself as cultured, German philosopher Johann Goethe is referenced, as is the movie ""Cleopatra"" etc.).  For a point and click, the graphics are pretty good too, not great or superb by any means, but good for a genre that generally is not visually all-too stunning in comparison to contemporary games.Maybe I'll go back to play it, but I doubt it.  The game is just too boring, added in the fact there is no suspsense whatsoever.4/10.			"

												I started playing this game and really liked it. However, after a few hours of playtime the game suddenly would no longer launch. I've received no support from neither Steam nor the Kingart in regards to this issue which appears to have been existing for over a year according to the forums. It's disgusting business practice to keep selling a game as bugg riddled as this one and incomprehensible that the developer can't care less about addressing the problem. For your own sake, don't waste your time getting into an otherwise entertaining story only to find yourself unable to finish it.			"

												I've had this game in my wishlist for a long time.  I finally got it as a gift, and when I did I was super excited.  Sadly, I only got passed the first cut scene before the game started giving me issues.  All I could see was the background and hear people speaking.  The game was just frozen.  For now, I'd suggest to just steer clear of this game as it seems to have issues.  Hopefully they will fix it eventually.			"

												Enjoyable adventure game with a great story, atmospheric locations and interesting characters. The puzzles aren't overly difficult and the few times I got stuck were more because the next step was not quite logical. Looks decent graphically for an adventure game but you'll still notice quite a few bugs with the animations in particular, but they're minor. Cutscenes are also disappointingly low resolution.If you liked any of the Sherlock Holmes adventure games this should be on your wishlist.			"

												9/10There are a few bugs, mostly in the third chapter of the game and closer to the end - the character would try to walk through an object and eventually just teleport to where he/she needed to be, and at one point walked through an NPC. Very few audio glitches, though, and an amazing story and ending that kept me guessing the whole time. Highly recommend for Point-and-Click fans, or those who enjoy mystery stories. Casual gameplay style - I could save and exit and pick up where I left off without any problems.			"

												The early chapters were brilliant, an all round great point and click game. The voice acting, dialog, atmosphere, puzzles, characters, music, and backgrounds are great. There are some annoying parts of the game, like getting stuck at the end of one screen and finding it difficult to enter into another section. For example having to spend five minutes clicking everywhere you can to try and access another part of the train. I did also feel that the last few chapters were not nearly as polished as the early ones and were kinda buggy which is a real shame.I'd still recommend the game, even though Not really spoiler but I'll put it here any wayI thought the ending was a bit strange considering we have access to the protagonists thoughts.

												Great story but don't explect any brain melting puzzlesI love adventure games for the story but I hate puzzles, which is why I love this game so much.  Firstly, the games biggest con was a pro for me, the puzzles are very easy and there are very few of them. Rather than puzzles the gameplay is all about talking to people, finding items, and figuring out where and how to use said items. The animation is also somewhat janky sometimes and the characters move pretty slowly.With the cons out of the way, the majority of the voice acting is wonderful and the story is really intertesting, in my opinion. It's a pretty lighthearted story, overall, but it has enough twists to keep you guessing. Especially around the last chapter, I had plenty of moments that made me go, ""Whaaaat?"" I also really liked how you played the story as different characters and experienced the plot from different angles.If difficult puzzles are why you play adventure games, I'd say skip this one. but if you enjoy the stories and characters of adventure games, this is very worth picking up. Completely worth the $25 price tag but a must buy, as far as I'm concerned, if you find it on one of the Steam seasonal sales			"

												The Raven is an enjoyable game with exciting twists and a great storyline, along with some brilliant voice acting. The music is nice and fits the setting quite well. The Raven is about 12–15 hours long, each chapter taking you around 4-5 hours to complete.Unfortunately, the game can be a bit boring. The Raven is quite slow paced and you will experience a lot of talking. Your character moves around slowly and it can be very frustrating to have to wait for him to move from one point to another. As for the difficulty, it was sort of in the middle. Most of the puzzles were easy to solve, though I needed walkthroughs for some parts, but that's probably because I suck at solving puzzles.The art style was quite nice – It wasn’t too cartoonish or too realistic. Close up, however, some characters, such as this one, looked ugly and somewhat creepy. The animations can be very awkward. For example, to pour a cup of coffee, my character had to walk two steps away from the table, walk back towards the table, and turn 360 degrees before managing to merge with the table and finally pour a cup of coffee.The Raven is littered with bugs: There were times where a scene would not transition to the next, times where characters would suddenly stop talking, leaving you unable to do anything, and clipping issues such as this. There isn't a setting to change the brightness, making it almost impossible to see what is going on in dark rooms.Despite all of the issues above, I really enjoyed playing The Raven. However, I don't think it's worth the full $24.99. If you are a fan of Point-and-Click Adventure games, this game is definitely worth checking out. 8/10			"

Point-and-cliick storytelling with very nice textures and environments.  Dialogues are very good in comparison to the rest of this genre.  Good gameplay length.-  Linear gameplay that relies on sticking this doodad in that doobopper before you look at the thing over there.  Some of the minigame puzzles are obviously built for controllers and very difficult to maneuver on mouse and keyboard.			"

The voice acting in English is superb with the accents and all - the German unfortunately rather mediocre. The story is well done, the characters are believable, the looks and atmosphere is great.What is not so great in my eyes is the walking animations (otherwise it is very nice), the 2nd chapter felt waaay too short and the third chapter is a bit of a drag for me for the basic ... setup (I won't spoil it for anyone but to the developer: really??).For ten bucks on sale I would recommend it. For $25 ... not so much, I'm not sure I want to finish the 3rd chapter by now and hav only spent a bit over 8 hours with it.			"

												Better than average point and click adventure game. The puzzles are logical (for the most part) and make sense in the game world, but somehow often felt mechanical and uninteresting. It rarely felt rewarding to figure anything out.The story is where the game shines though. It's clearly an homage to Agatha Christie and made by people who genuinely are fans of that style of mystery. It will seem a bit dull at first, but there's a brilliant twist about half way through the game that will make you reexamine everything you think you've seen up to that point. There's a second twist at the very end that is much less brilliant and, while clearly intended from the beginning, is much less clever than the designers seem to think. Still, it wasn't enough to ruin it for me.Ultimately, if you like adventure games this is worth your time.			"

												This is a wonderful, wonderful game. It is an absolute must for any adventure gamer. I'm halfway through episode one and the game I have played so far is what other developers are selling as complete titles. And I still have many, many hours to go. Very clever game, makes you think, great music, makes you feel like you are inside a captivating mystery novel. (A.C. - Which the game pays respects to, constantly)HOWEVERIt has very frustrating technical problems. Aside from the difficulty of moving around, the game literally gets stuck at certain screens and since there are no autosaves, you lose a lot of time that you have invested in the game. The first time it happened to me, the screen completely froze and I had not saved it so I quit and did not return to the game for months. Now that I have returned and progressed more, I am once again stuck in a screen that I cannot get out of. And this will also make me lose hours of work. FINAL VERDICTIt's most certainly much, much better than any other adventure game out there for the past few years but the bugs may make you go crazy.			"

												I'm using mid 2013 Macbook Air. The game says it is not compatible with 2013 Macbook Air, but it is compatible with mine, so.. I think it is okay to play it on a 2013 Macbook Air :DSince I'm playing with my Macbook, I haven't had a chance to play a lot of great adventure games because they're mostly only available on windows, but this one is Mac compatible and on a discount so I bought it yaay :)I have only played the first episode of chapter I. It is the usual point and click adventure game where we play as an amateur constable from switzerland named Zellner. It's basically finding things throughout the place and combining them to solve problems. The gameplay is okay, but sometimes I got stuck while walking to a different area, but it's not a big problem. I think the storyline is interesting, makes me want to play it more! >.<can't tell more about this game because I haven't finished it yet, but will do ASAP! :D			"

												Brilliant game to be honest, mostly all thumbs up. Nice plot twists and interesting characters and conversing with them is enjoyable. Very story rich, and there's a lot of things you can interact with that's got nothing to do with the main story but it's still interesting to see/hear.The only problem I have with the game is the amount of bugs in it. Using one item to interact with another sometimes doesn't work, and requires a client restart (for me at least). Getting from one frame into the next is extremely buggy in almost all areas of the game, requiring you to walk back and forth a lot before triggering it. Honestly though that's the only problem I had with it. Other than that it's one of the best point and click crime games I've ever played.			"

												Great storyline overall. I liked the plot twists and *SPOILER ALERT* playing through the story with multiple characters, but it did get a bit repetitive through Chapters 2 & 3. A few things could stand to be improved in this game, including:1. Hint system - the barely-there magnifying glasses were not much help and it frustrated me more than helping me.2. Accuracy of moving around - I got stuck going back and forth in the room a few times where I just couldn't seem to move out of the room/train car, particularly when you were supposed to use the bottom of the screen to move down and instead wind up  opening the inventory bar.Other than that and if you have some patience with the controls, I would recomend purchasing this game! It was well-worth the 10+ hours of game time.			"

												Remember getting furious at point and click adventure games because the object combinations were just too damn illogical and impossible to figure out? Then rejoice! This game keeps everything that made point and click adventures great while eliminating this annoying trait. But that's not the only reason why you should get it. I just finished this game and I can honestly say that it was one of the best point and click adventures I've ever played. The music score was amazing and it fit the game perfectly, the environments were pretty to look at, colorful and rich (the train and Egypt... *drool*). The difficulty was well balanced - I got stuck now and then, but nothing that couldn't be overcome. But what really makes this game stand out so much are the story and the characters. I won't say much about the story because it would be difficult to keep it spoiler-free, but I'll say a bit about the characters. The character work is one of the best I've ever seen in the games. These are no ""accessory"" characters that are in the game only because someone has to give you clues - they all have their history, their unique personality traits, they react to each other. And their voice acting is very good. Their involvement in the story and how the things you know change as you progress are surprisingly well executed. And the ending had my jaw drop. Although I love this game to bits, there were some things that made it a little frustrating for me. I never found out how to cancel a movement, so when you accidentally click somewhere, you can't do anything but wait for your character to finish the walk. The transitions between screens were sometimes difficult to find and sometimes the character flatly refused to walk to the next area, making me walk around for a few minutes, clicking on different parts of the floor. It is also somewhat buggy, the character sometimes got stuck in an object and then teleported to the intended direction, or appeared somewhere else before executing an action. But even though these things were unpleasant, they did not affect the gameplay much.To conclude - if you're a lover of point and click adventure games, then this is a gem you should defenitely not miss. I finished the game in 12 hours and still don't have all of the achievements, so the game time isn't bad. If you're looking for a great story and believable, memorable characters, the Raven is your man (game).			"

												Great story, great music and the graphics are pretty good going. Falls short on the gameplay front, however. Gameplay mechanics are heavily flawed and in some places, almost unplayable. Not sure how it managed to be such high quality on the one side and so terrible on the other. If you can stick through it for the sake of the story, music and general ambience, then go for it, but if you're a fan of point-and-click adventures for the actual pointing and clicking, it fails on this front.

												9/10There are a few bugs, mostly in the third chapter of the game and closer to the end - the character would try to walk through an object and eventually just teleport to where he/she needed to be, and at one point walked through an NPC. Very few audio glitches, though, and an amazing story and ending that kept me guessing the whole time. Highly recommend for Point-and-Click fans, or those who enjoy mystery stories. Casual gameplay style - I could save and exit and pick up where I left off without any problems.			"

												The early chapters were brilliant, an all round great point and click game. The voice acting, dialog, atmosphere, puzzles, characters, music, and backgrounds are great. There are some annoying parts of the game, like getting stuck at the end of one screen and finding it difficult to enter into another section. For example having to spend five minutes clicking everywhere you can to try and access another part of the train. I did also feel that the last few chapters were not nearly as polished as the early ones and were kinda buggy which is a real shame.I'd still recommend the game, even though Not really spoiler but I'll put it here any wayI thought the ending was a bit strange considering we have access to the protagonists thoughts.

												Great ""old-fogeyish"" point&click adventure game which reminded me of Agatha Christie's detective stories. The story is really clever and so are the dialogues. Just bear in mind that it's a really slow-paced game with almost no action and a lot of talking.Graphics and animation is very nice with the exception of hair styles. And the 3D engine renders pretty bad shadows on characters' faces.The only major complaint are the bugs. The invisible or teleporting characters didn't happen too often and could be ignored. But three times I've encountered a serious bug when the main character got stuck and walked infinitely on the spot. There is no way how to stop the walking once initiated so the only solution was to kill and restart the game and hope for the best.			"

I Recommend to all adventure fans no doubt!I call the attention to whom as I usually read the game critíticas on Metacritic...the most of them are completely unfair, because most of them only take into account the first episode, and they should have played the 3 and then comment!

												The Raven - Legacy of A Master Thief is an adventure game from King Art, the makers of ""The Book of Unwritten Tales"". I feel the biggest strength of the game rests in the narrative. If you enjoy mysteries or detective work, or just point and click adventures you may enjoy this game. The narrative starts strong with well developed characters and strongly written dialogue, and continues to be strong throught chapters one and two. Unfortunately, I feel the last half of the final chapter is handled clumsily from combined narrative and gameplay standpoint and as a result the ending is underwhelming. I have no problems with with the story itself, but rather the way all player agency was removed in the final portion of the game.Still this is about 5 minutes of a game I spent many hours on, so in the overall perspective the rest of the hours were spent with good logical puzzles, conversations, voicework, and narrative.The only real draw back I had to the game I discovered was with navigation between scenes, especially in the first chapter on train and one particular screen on the ship. It was not a problem in the other two chapters. However in either the end of chapter 2 or beginning of chapter 3 I had issues with the character walking in place for several seconds before completing and action. This happened several times. The screen navigation issue can be frustrating at times so be aware that it takes some getting the hang of but does improve. The second did not influence my opinion and may have been a unique bug.I own the digital deluxe edition. The value in the that will depend on wethere or not you want the soundtrack. The making of book is good for a read, King Art clearly puts time and love into their adventure games as seen with both this and the series of ""The Book of Unwritten Tales"" games. There is not much to the story books, and nothing that is not revealed in game in one form or another.			"

												 When you play ""The Raven"" it feels more like you are reading one of the Agatha Christie novels. And i mean it in a good sense. The gameplay itself is a classical adventure point-and-click, and the riddles aren't that hard either (because they are founded on the real-life logic and reason, unlike some other games where you need to replace the behemoth tooth with a blue parrot so that a UFO will descend to study the new life form so you can steal the screwdriver from little gray man to open the can of beans, ugh).  Personally i percive that game as a good interactive detective novel, and i have a feeling that the authors intended it to be exactly that. In which case they did a good job.  For the fans of the classical XX century detective novels that game would be sitting around 9 out of 10, for others though it may feel kinda slow and boring. But you would not buy an adventure game with the title like ""legacy of the master thief"" if you are not a detective fan anyway, right? So rest assured the game will keep you entertained for a few evenings and good luck discovering the true face of the Raven.			"

												Point & click adventure game with a nice story line, but with a lot of technical flaws (sounds sometimes drops, characters move really slow and constantly bump in to  objects and/or get stuck, terribly slow loading of scenes etc.). There's a lot of conversation to go through but you can speed that up by reading the subtitles and left clicking your mouse which will make it jump to the next line. There's no challenging puzzles and use/combination of inventory items is reasonably easy. This probably doesn't sound like a thumbs up but I approve of the game anyway, since I got it on sale and I would prefer an average true adventure game over all the FPS, simulator, hack-and-slash etc. games any day.

												DISCLAIMER>> I'm at chapter two now, so I have not yet finished the game.What I can say thus far is that the game is verry enjoyable. Nice scenes and characters, a good story and good writing.If you are a die-hard adventure player I cannot recomment the game. It is far to easy in a sence that there are not many puzzles to solve.I have not looked at my notebook once and the items found should hardly ever be combined.But because I'm not an adventure player (I get nervous from going back and forth over and over again just in search for that 1 missing piece of the puzzle) I really enjoy this title.Just a note; I read a lot of bad reviews of Mac players complaining the many issues the game had with the OS, but I had none so far.Some minor bugs and glitches not related to the OS but nothing too big e.g. when pressing 'Continue' in the main menu the latest autosave is loaded, even if you have a newer manual one. All in all I give it a 7/10 thus far.UPDATE: I finished the game by now and I must say that there are more puzzles and they get a bit more challenging in chapters 2 and 3. I had good fun playing it.			"

												Now that I have finished the game I can make my review. The game wasn't bad, and the story was interesting.  A classic crime game which starts on the well-known Orient Express. However there were some problem that ruined my game experience, like plot holes and some pixel hunting. The game was released divided in 3 chapters, but it looks like that the creators forgot what they did in the previous chapters when making them (in chapter 1 you need to enter in the cargo hold of a ship. since there is no light you have to search for a torch, but in chapter 3 during a flashback you return there and your character is able to see in darkness better than a cat. did they forgot that is was supposed to be dark there? Also  when with zellner,  he is distracted by the sound of glass being broken, that is never explained how happened . Again in chapter 3 more than once, a certain Mr. X is named. Still we will never know who he/she is, and still in chapter 3  a girl is held hostage, guarded by an armed man, how the hell did she managed to escape by herself?  . the game looks so full of plot holes!This game unfortunatly suffers from pixel hunting as well. In more than one occassion I just searched for items by simply moving the mouse all over the screen until the cursor changed. After all how was I supposed to see an axe hidden by my character, since it was behind him? Or, how was I suppose to know that behind that particular bag there's the item I need?Lastly, my personal impression of the game is that it looked...too linearEverything you can click, you will surely need it. Other point-and-click games always offer you the possibility to examine everything, Even useless things, making it all more interesting and also less easy for the player who won't be able to just click and try until it works. In The Raven, if you can click it is because you need it now or later. This made the game incredible easy since the game doesn't offer particular difficult puzzles. Most of the time you will only need to talk to the right character to procede with the story.These are his major flaws, in my opinion. Still the game was good, good musics, a bit boring to hear after a while, nice voices (I played it in english), I reall liked Zellner's, If you are searching a good point-and-click you may consider this, but only if you don't have anything else			"

												I started that game and enjoyed it, played during some hours without caring about saving, auto-save is here. Good characters, mistery, it has everything to be fun. Sometimes difficult to leave a room, to place the character well, but I thought it was little bugs with no importance. And then, the big bug, an important screwdriver that I pick up doesn't appear in my bag. Impossible to use it, it doesn't exist, and without it I can't keep on the game. I reloaded 3 times my last auto-save but the problem is still here. So I have to stop the game or to begin again, knowing that this game has many other bugs which aren't fixed, a lot of people are complaining about it. If I knew before buying and beginning the game... I never played to a game with so much big blocking bugs, and I think it's a shame to sell such a product, it should still be in Beta.			"

												This is a wonderful, wonderful game. It is an absolute must for any adventure gamer. I'm halfway through episode one and the game I have played so far is what other developers are selling as complete titles. And I still have many, many hours to go. Very clever game, makes you think, great music, makes you feel like you are inside a captivating mystery novel. (A.C. - Which the game pays respects to, constantly)HOWEVERIt has very frustrating technical problems. Aside from the difficulty of moving around, the game literally gets stuck at certain screens and since there are no autosaves, you lose a lot of time that you have invested in the game. The first time it happened to me, the screen completely froze and I had not saved it so I quit and did not return to the game for months. Now that I have returned and progressed more, I am once again stuck in a screen that I cannot get out of. And this will also make me lose hours of work. FINAL VERDICTIt's most certainly much, much better than any other adventure game out there for the past few years but the bugs may make you go crazy.			"

												Enjoyed the game, but found that the 'twist ending' actually messed the story up for me a little. When you're role playing a character, it's annoying to then suddenly lose all control of who that character is and what he's doing. I felt like I had control of the characters and could choose who they were - at least to some extent - and the ending felt more than a little forced. Nonetheless, I did enjoy the game. The voice acting was really good for the most part, and the story was entertaining. It also had the unique quality that you felt like it could actually happen, almost. Most games like this rely on fantastical magical boxes that couldn't ever actually work. This game really stuck to the 'real world' even though the crime was of the complicated fiction variety.			"

												Having just completed his game, I have to say that it was a very satisfying play.The immersion factor is fairly good, you do feel like you're trying to solve a mystery while playing the game. The storyline is one of its strong points, with enough loose ends and red herrings to keep you playing just to find out what is going on. In terms of the challenge, the majority of the puzzles are of the point and click variety (Broken Sword) instead of the mini-games vaeriety (7th Guest). The backgrounds and settings are gorgeous- it is obvious that a lot of effort and research has been done for the game, and it shows. I particularly appreciate that the solutions to the puzzles are logical and make sense, instead of being ludicrously far-fetched so as to increase the difficulty level.Cons wise- The character animations I feel do not do justice to the excellent voice acting. It can be particularly jarring when, for example, you have to sit through several minutes of conversation with Mrs Miller whose jaw appears to be dislocated. And some of the male characters appear to sidle across the floor in an effeminate manner. Other have mentioned bugs in the game but I personally did not come across any.Play this game if you want to relax with a good mystery story, lush settings and logical puzzles. A good way to spend a quiet evening.10/10 would play again			"

												I started playing this game and really liked it. However, after a few hours of playtime the game suddenly would no longer launch. I've received no support from neither Steam nor the Kingart in regards to this issue which appears to have been existing for over a year according to the forums. It's disgusting business practice to keep selling a game as bugg riddled as this one and incomprehensible that the developer can't care less about addressing the problem. For your own sake, don't waste your time getting into an otherwise entertaining story only to find yourself unable to finish it.			"

Hower the bug in the game which invoved been unable to exit a room was really frustrating and at one point made me want to through my computer across the room. I see from forums that many people have complained and I think it unacceptable for the bugs not to be fixed by now.			"

 Amazing story with very competent voice work, but riddled with animation bugs  The puzzles were relatively easy, so they did not get in the way of the story development.If you are looking for a challenge you might need to look elsewhere, but if your main interest is the story, you are in for a treat.As for the gameplay itself, it is a fairly standard point-and-click adventure game. There is a built-in hint system and there is a button that highlights the clickable objects in the scene, although you can still breeze through the game without using them. There was some degree of pixel-hunting, but it was rarely excessively annoying. The most frustrating aspects were the camera angles, since sometimes it was not clear where was I supposed to click to go to a neighbouring scene. Moreover, the character animations were far from smooth and there were lots of ""jumps"" in the animation. I got the impression that, near the end of the game, it got even worse, with a character being able to pass through another and characters getting stuck in front of objects only to jump instaneously to another location. I also thought the characters walked a bit too slowly for my taste. I don't know if these issues happened only for the Linux version (I am using a notebook with Ubuntu 14.04). Either way, it shows it either a lack of polish or a lack of care for Linux users.Still, if point-and-click is your cup of tea and you favor story over puzzles, there is plenty to enjoy here.			"

												This is a tough review to write, because I've only played through the beginning of episode two, and I'm already 8 hours in. (See edit below: finished it after writing this review.)With that said, the game has two major flaws for me.1) It's buggy. I'm frequently stuck in spots walking infintely, or unable to open doors (the triggers vanish). I'm forced to reload a prior save to sort this out, but this causes me to lose progress. Save early, save often.Also, manipulating the inspector is like watching Austin Powers maneuver the cart at the end of the first movie. You'll click on a location to exit a scene and watch the inspector go forward, back, forward, turn, forward, back, then forward again like he's lost his mind.2) It's boring. As said, I'm 8 hours in, and I don't care one bit about any of the characters. They all seem lifeless and interchangeable with one exception - the kid. You spend a lot of time backtracking and listening to people talk about the boring details of their life. There are some attempts at red herrings but they all fall a bit flat.One other minor complaint is the animation. I'm not expecting photo-realistic graphics or skeletal rigging here, but when the characters talk, their mouths flap open and closed like ventriloquist dummies. It's very disconcerting. The worst was watching the American lady talk on the outside of the ship in the first episode - just one big hinged jaw and a gigantic mouthful of teeth flapping at me.The game does have some things going for it. It's one big Agatha Christie homage, so if that's your cup of tea, it may be enough to overcome some of the other aspects of the game.I'd like to finish the game to see how the plot plays out, but since it took me just over 7 hours for the first episode, I don't have the patience to put in a potential 14 more hours. I feel like the game does not respect my time, which is enough for me to press abort.Not recommended, unless you really really like Agatha Christie homages and don't mind being disinterested for hours on end while trying to steer the shopping cart that is the inspector.Edit: I finished the game today, after I wrote this review. Fundamentally, my opinion has not changed but I do have a bit more to add.First, the game is - as far as I can tell - not able to be completed if you're using a gamepad. There are two parts in episode 3 where you will not get the proper interaction spots when using a gamepad. The first happens when you're in the ship cell area trying to hook a rope onto a hook. The hook prompt will not appear and I was only able to progress by switching to keyboard play.The second happens outside the museum. You get no prompt to enter the museum. Again, switching to keyboard lets you enter and continue on. At that point, I stopped trying to use the gamepad.Furthermore, I did run into two more cases where the character got stuck walking infinitely. The first was again in the cell portion of the ship, the second was - surprise! - outside the entrance to the museum. For both cases, I had to quit the game and relaunch.So again - pretty buggy and frustrating experience. I did feel that the game picked up some interest once you start playing as other characters, but that is somewhat deadened by having to go through the same environments all over again.			"

												I have a soft affection for point and click ""adventure"" games.  I purchased The Raven because the producers had a previous reputation of producing very good point and click games.I played the game for 2 hours (according to steam) and it's just hard to want to play it further.  The game is simply boring.  There is nothing that makes me want to go further.  All you do is walk around talking to boring characters, trying to figure things out that are sometimes, way too hard (I had to cheat and look online what to do next, seriously, a tiny spec on the ground hardly visible is a button critical to a storyline in the first episode).  The game's pros: you will learn historical culture (and I fancy myself as cultured, German philosopher Johann Goethe is referenced, as is the movie ""Cleopatra"" etc.).  For a point and click, the graphics are pretty good too, not great or superb by any means, but good for a genre that generally is not visually all-too stunning in comparison to contemporary games.Maybe I'll go back to play it, but I doubt it.  The game is just too boring, added in the fact there is no suspsense whatsoever.4/10.			"

												DISCLAIMER>> I'm at chapter two now, so I have not yet finished the game.What I can say thus far is that the game is verry enjoyable. Nice scenes and characters, a good story and good writing.If you are a die-hard adventure player I cannot recomment the game. It is far to easy in a sence that there are not many puzzles to solve.I have not looked at my notebook once and the items found should hardly ever be combined.But because I'm not an adventure player (I get nervous from going back and forth over and over again just in search for that 1 missing piece of the puzzle) I really enjoy this title.Just a note; I read a lot of bad reviews of Mac players complaining the many issues the game had with the OS, but I had none so far.Some minor bugs and glitches not related to the OS but nothing too big e.g. when pressing 'Continue' in the main menu the latest autosave is loaded, even if you have a newer manual one. All in all I give it a 7/10 thus far.UPDATE: I finished the game by now and I must say that there are more puzzles and they get a bit more challenging in chapters 2 and 3. I had good fun playing it.			"

												Enjoyable adventure game with a great story, atmospheric locations and interesting characters. The puzzles aren't overly difficult and the few times I got stuck were more because the next step was not quite logical. Looks decent graphically for an adventure game but you'll still notice quite a few bugs with the animations in particular, but they're minor. Cutscenes are also disappointingly low resolution.If you liked any of the Sherlock Holmes adventure games this should be on your wishlist.			"

												Point & click adventure game with a nice story line, but with a lot of technical flaws (sounds sometimes drops, characters move really slow and constantly bump in to  objects and/or get stuck, terribly slow loading of scenes etc.). There's a lot of conversation to go through but you can speed that up by reading the subtitles and left clicking your mouse which will make it jump to the next line. There's no challenging puzzles and use/combination of inventory items is reasonably easy. This probably doesn't sound like a thumbs up but I approve of the game anyway, since I got it on sale and I would prefer an average true adventure game over all the FPS, simulator, hack-and-slash etc. games any day.

												After finishing the game I want to highlight two things about this game. First, the music. The main theme is a really catchy tune. Like many aspects of this game if reminds me of the golden age of crime films from the 70s and 80s like the films featuring Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot or the fabulous must see Murder by Death from 1976.Second, the way chapter 3 is woven into the main story. You are revisiting previous events from a different perspective and this really gives the game an interesting twist and improves on the overall experience.The game has some issues that are common for most point and click adventures, like ""right idea, wrong time"" blockers, or ""would work in real life, but not here"" blockers.I'm using a dual monitor setup and for me the biggest issue was that I sometimes couldn't return to the game after switching to a different desktop program on the other monitor.

												Oh, what a story! Let's get this out of the way: the technical side of this game is pretty bad. Glitches, frustrating layouts, audio failures -- it's all here. It is a particular type of torture to traverse this game: everyone walks soo slowly and the loading screens take forever. Oh, and there's a mini puzzle in the middle that doesn't fit, is completely unfun and unskippable.But it's totally worth it. If you buy this game and get frustrated and feel like quitting: don't. I found the pacing, characters, and story utterly compelling. The twists and turns of the story were the most effective I've seen in a mystery game. And the player feels a part of the action -- there's not much player agency but enough to keep things interesting.So what if it's a little cheezy. I loved this game, flaws and all.			"

												Is the master criminal known as the Raven actually dead, or has he (or she!) returned to strike again? At first glance, this seems like your ordinary mystery/heist story in adventure game form. It starts off as an Agatha Christie homage aboard the Orient Express, and later an Agatha Christie homage on a boat to Cairo, but it turns into something so much better. For the first half of the game (which is in three separate chapters), you play as Constable Zellner, a Swiss policeman who loves mystery books and thus inserts himself into the mystery unravelling around him. He's basically the most likable character in the world, and is like your favorite old uncle who slips you a twenty and tells you not to tell your parents. You follow him through jewel heists and murders, investigating alongside the detective who supposedly killed the Raven years ago--or did he? Then, right at the story's climax halfway through, where normally you would get the big exposition dump about how it was all done, you instead actually jump to the start of the game and get to replay the story's events as thte thieves. You get to see all the weird unexplained details that you revealed as the constable and begin to understand what was really going on the whole time. There are twists and turns even when you know what was going to happen during the flashback playthrough, which keeps it interesting. It finishes with a pretty satisfying ending.So, the good and the bad. The good: EXCELLENT music, which is very cinematic. It might as well have been the score from Death on the Nile or any other good detective movie. GREAT characters. You interact with a small group of characters, with new ones added along the way, and you get to interact with them and slowly learn their stories. These aren't NPCs that you never learn their names or don't care about them . The voice acting is likewise EXCELLENT. The story is entertaining.The bad: The animation is not great. A couple of the character models are plain creepy (one lady's smile is 90% teeth). Shadows are off frequently, not fantastic lip-syncing. The backgrounds and scenery are fantastic (in one scene, they even animated the little dust particles in a beam of light from a window) but the characters compared to it are awkward. The character motion is often annoying, as characters will move to a spot when you interact with an object and often get stuck and turn around or shimmy several times to try to get into a spot blocked by local geometry. It's frustrating to watch. Also, there is a ""fast forward"" function when you are going to a new area that is SUPPOSED to allow you to cut away from the chraracter walking to that area, but it didn't work 70% of the time, and I had to watch as these characters walked horribly slowly to the next scene. There is also a puzzle in Chapter 3 where there are 3 WRONG orders to put together some items, and only 1 right order. If you do the wrong order, the character simply won't do what you need them to, and there's no way to undo the steps you already did. I got stuck and had to redo the entire chapter from the beginning because the autosave didn't put me far enough back in the story to get around the glitch. Save often! Don't rely on autosave!Overall, if you like Agatha Christie-like mysteries, jewel heists, great characters, point-and-click adventure games, or all of the above, you should definitely play this game. It's glitches and less-than-stelllar character models/animations are easily ignored for this story.			"

												I'm not really an avid gamer, but I'm big on mystery games and have played most of the good ones. The Raven is pretty good, but definitely at times the gameplay is clunky and it's difficult to figure out what the hell to do. There are a couple technical glitches here and there, but the overall storytelling is enticing and the way it unfolds is unique. I'd recommend it, but it wouldn't satisfy an avid fan of Agatha Christie or Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (I know there are bits of the game meant to reference Christie, but I felt that they weren't followed through enough.) Overall, a decent game with decent graphics and a lovely story.			"

												Now that I have finished the game I can make my review. The game wasn't bad, and the story was interesting.  A classic crime game which starts on the well-known Orient Express. However there were some problem that ruined my game experience, like plot holes and some pixel hunting. The game was released divided in 3 chapters, but it looks like that the creators forgot what they did in the previous chapters when making them (in chapter 1 you need to enter in the cargo hold of a ship. since there is no light you have to search for a torch, but in chapter 3 during a flashback you return there and your character is able to see in darkness better than a cat. did they forgot that is was supposed to be dark there? Also  when with zellner,  he is distracted by the sound of glass being broken, that is never explained how happened . Again in chapter 3 more than once, a certain Mr. X is named. Still we will never know who he/she is, and still in chapter 3  a girl is held hostage, guarded by an armed man, how the hell did she managed to escape by herself?  . the game looks so full of plot holes!This game unfortunatly suffers from pixel hunting as well. In more than one occassion I just searched for items by simply moving the mouse all over the screen until the cursor changed. After all how was I supposed to see an axe hidden by my character, since it was behind him? Or, how was I suppose to know that behind that particular bag there's the item I need?Lastly, my personal impression of the game is that it looked...too linearEverything you can click, you will surely need it. Other point-and-click games always offer you the possibility to examine everything, Even useless things, making it all more interesting and also less easy for the player who won't be able to just click and try until it works. In The Raven, if you can click it is because you need it now or later. This made the game incredible easy since the game doesn't offer particular difficult puzzles. Most of the time you will only need to talk to the right character to procede with the story.These are his major flaws, in my opinion. Still the game was good, good musics, a bit boring to hear after a while, nice voices (I played it in english), I reall liked Zellner's, If you are searching a good point-and-click you may consider this, but only if you don't have anything else			"

												I almost gave it a thumbs down because of the freaking many bugs and glitches!!! At one point I had to abort a game and return to a saved point because there's no way of moving forward with the investigation (when the Dr, doesn't give the bullet).Now with that in mind the ending and the good mystery pushed me to do a positive review. The story and the set-up of playing different roles were interesting. In life events are affected by the actions of all participants not one (regardless of the end and its great reveal). The characters are interesting and I came to like constable Zellner a lot. When you start you don’t expect you’ll be playing him: old and unaccomplished policeman who wants a breakthrough. The mystery writer whom the more I learned about the more I felt I Am in an Agatha Christie novel! it feels like the whole story (and not just Lady Westmacott) is a tribute to her :)  The mystery itself is intriguing, as you play you begin to question everyone and try to speculate and guess who’s the culprit, who’s the killer, who’s the Raven. By the end I kinda guessed who the Raven is but didn’t at all expect the last twist. It will keep you interested.One last thing to mention and has to be said is the soundtrack. When I first heard it I thought of Love Story I mean peak part is definitely inspired from it. Regardless, the pieces are still beautiful and very immersing.  Overall, a nice game once you overcome the technical issues, be sure to save constantly just in case. Enjoy the mystery and music. "

												A charming clever game with a charming clever constable making observations as you play through the game. It's above most point and click crime solving mysteries, but the cons are too much.Because sadly the controls are so difficult, it's a feat to make the constable go where you want him to. Not to mention it's at most times impossible to walk between rooms, which you do a lot in this game. The game is simply too buggy for me to recommend it, at least for full price.PS: I run on Windows 8.			"

Like every adventure game, the pacing can be horrible if you aren't keen on critical thiking skills. I did run into a few bugs and just simple annoyances with the UI. This game definetley needed a few more months of polish. There are twists and turns as well as a few plot holes, which can bring it down a bit. If this game gets a sequel, I'd be happy to give it a try; only if the developers step it up and improve on their foundations (and more development time).			"

Save often, save all the time actually. Your character gets caught in animation loops, objects become uninteractable, the brightness of the scene is often so low you can't actually see anything, scripted cutscenes get stuck, scene transitions fail to load properly and so on.Generally you fix this just by saving and reloading, but sometimes even that doesn't help...so save often and frequently. The achievements are a huge spoiler for the story and certain achievements are also bugged so they don't trigger unless you follow an archaic set of steps.Despite all that...I had a good time.

												Masterpiece games are not made... they are born. This is not a masterpiece. However, I'd give it between 4/5 and 5/5. There's something about this game. It feels similar to The Last Express. Ambiance, if I had to put my finger on it. It's a very realistic adventure game with realistic personalities and a captivating story. If you won't be buying it, at least give it a try.			"

												Beautiful scenery, great story, catchy (and not annoying!) soundtrack, great voice acting (Rula Lenska FFS!) but, as a lot of reviewers have said, is glitchy to the point of crashing repeatedly. Particularly towards the end of Chapter One, I found.Fortunately, the autosave (and ""resume game"") option mean you don't lose TOO much progress, but save often to prevent disappointment.Would be worth full price if it wasn't so glitchy, but until the issues (IF they ever are) fixed, try and get it in a sale.
