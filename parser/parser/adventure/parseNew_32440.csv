												As the title indicates, LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga is an amalgamation of two earlier games, LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game and Lego Star Wars II: The Original Saga.  I'm calling this an amalgamation as opposed to a compilation due to the fact that the gameplay is presented as a single uninterrupted experience, rather than as two that are separate and distinct.  Traveler's Tales has also added some additional content that was not present in either of the earlier stand-alone games.  LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game was the very first LEGO game developed by Traveler's Tales (henceforth referred to as TT), whereas the Original Saga was the second title they developed under the LEGO banner.  These titles form the foundation of what are now familiar gameplay features found in nearly all subsequently developed LEGO games.  The hallmark sense of humor is here (although like all of the earlier TT LEGO games, there is no spoken dialog), as are the simple LEGO building puzzle elements.  We find a familiar hub based level structure with each level branching from that central hub, and of course the LEGO collect-a-thon aspects make their debut here including the requisite stud collection, mini-kits, red bricks, golden bricks, etc.  So while a majority of the gameplay elements will be familiar to those who have previously dabbled in LEGO games, it's interesting nonetheless see the ways in which TT was still experimenting with their formula, solidifying what would become their trademark style.  This last bit is particularly interesting in the context of The Complete Saga, because you can see Traveler's Tales incorporating lessons learned and improving their games between the separate bookends of the Prequel Levels (featured in LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game), and the original trilogy levels (as featured in The Original Saga).  From a historical standpoint it's striking to see how quickly Traveler's Tales was able to deftly incorporate lessons learned from the first game and use them to improve the second game.  From a gameplay standpoint though, this creates a bit of dissonance.  Stylistically, the Original Saga is a much more robust game.  The levels are longer and more complex, the puzzles are generally more interesting, the graphical elements are improved upon, etc.  So while the levels in Complete Saga are presented seamlessly, in practice you will notice a very definitive division between the older (prequel) levels and the newer (original saga) levels.  Speaking as a bit of a Star Wars nerd I'm happy that the Original Saga levels are the ones with better gameplay.As I mentioned before, the gameplay elements here will be very familiar to anyone who has played TT LEGO games before.  Given the ubiquitous nature of these games, you probably already know whether this game is for you.  If you love the LEGO formula you'll find a lot to love here.  If the 'break everything in sight collect-a-thon' turns you off, well … these aren't the droids you're looking for.  <groan>  As I mentioned earlier, TT was still developing their trademark style in these games, so even those who have enjoyed more recent LEGO titles might find some of the elements featured here to be a bit rudimentary.  The controls are (naturally) very familiar, but at the same time feel slightly 'looser' than later LEGO titles.  Switching between characters can be a bit tedious since TT had yet to develop the character wheel system seen in more recent titles.  This means that you need to stand directly next to the character you wish to switch to, and since you often have several characters crowding in on you this can lead to several instances of switching to the wrong character.  This can be slightly rage inducing when you're under attack.  Speaking of computer controlled characters, they are basically useless while not under your direct control, and even worse you may find many circumstances in which they will actively become a hindrance.  There were several circumstances in which I would need to destroy one of my computer controlled allies simply to create a clear line of fire.  Get the heck out of the way Chewie!  And while I'm on this topic, I won't lie, sometimes I would randomly just lay a beat down on Jar-Jar, because … Jar-Jar.I need to make special mention of the collectible elements in this game, because that aspect has really been dialed to eleven.  If you're like me and you like to unlock everything these games have to offer, well … you're going to be here a while.  You'll need to play through every level no less than four times.  You'll play a level once in story mode which will unlock free play mode.  Then you'll need to play through free play mode to clean up any of the standard remaining goals in that level.  Once you've completely finished the episode you'll unlock Challenge and Super Story modes.  So you'll play each level again in Challenge mode to retrieve the blue mini-kits, and lastly you'll play through them yet again in Super Story mode which is a time-based score attack and simply adds to your completion percentage.  Four times for every level.  Once you couple this with the fact that this game features unskippable cut scenes, it can all start to become a bit … tedious.  As I mentioned, this part really only applies to completionists, so your mileage may vary significantly in this regard.  I think this is another area in which TT was still figuring out the formula, which in this case meant finding an acceptable line between ""collect a bunch of unlockables"" and ""OMFG, will it ever end!?""The story is … well, if you don't know it by now, you should schedule yourself for a Star Wars movie marathon, stat.  Having said that, you don't need to be a Star Wars scholar to appreciate the game for what it is.  In point of fact it can be a great introduction to the Star Wars universe for young padawan Star Wars fans looking to get a toehold on the series.  It keeps everything fairly light and deftly negotiates some of the darker aspects of the story.  It's also a great game to play co-op with young ones.  The game treats its subject matter with great reverence and humor.  As a Star Wars fan I enjoyed the game from beginning to end, and this game easily fits within the upper echelons of the greatest Start Wars games ever released.  There are six levels devoted to each movie within the Star Wars saga, and among them you will find all the standard Star Wars set pieces you might expect in a game of this nature along with some surprising gems.  The levels feature a mix of on-foot and piloted air/space craft missions.  All the missions are paced very well, and keep things moving along at a nice clip.  Furthermore the plethora of unlockable characters available keeps things fresh enough so that repeated playthroughs seldom feel stale.Overall the games presented here are highly enjoyable and well done.  Even in their first forays into LEGO games, TT was already onto a winning formula that would continue to be refined in later games.  This game gets my recommendation for fans of simple puzzle-based action adventure games appropriate for gamers both young and old, and especially for being a great co-op game.			"

												When the first LEGO Star Wars game came out in 2005 my dad bought me a PS2 and the game. My 6 year old self was extremely happy that my favorite toy and my all time favorite movie series were packed into a well made video game! When the second game was released the next year, I asked my dad to get it for me and we went to Gamestop and bought it. My dad lives out of the country now so I don't get to see him much but these games really brought my dad and I together and playing them now gives me the feels :P. I highly recommend this game for anyone who loves LEGO, Star Wars, or just wants a great game to pass the time with until Half Life 3 comes out!			"

												Lego Star Wars, the compelte saga. If I were to describe perfection to somebody, I would simply respond with Lego Star Wars.This game without a doubt is a 10/10. It brings back a beautiful, heartwarming sense of nostalgia and memories. Ranging from the ability to play many characters, to the intriguing missions, this is a game that people of any age will enjoy. At first glance, I thought this was a game from the future juding purely by the graphics. Each individual misson accurately represents the parts out of the movie. It is as if you were to be in the movie, in the midst of the action the whole way through.I would recommend this game to absolutely any human being on the planet. This game is the saviour of or world, our people and life as we know it.Straight up 10/10Better than sex.			"

One of the Best LEGO Games!This game has to be my favourite LEGO game out there. It is nostalgic playing through it again and is once again a great experience. You get to play through the whole Star Wars movie story from start to finish. There is great replayability as throughout the game you unlock various characters in which you can use in any level you have beaten in free mode. The graphics are great and what you'd expect from a LEGO game and it runs smoothly too. The combat is fun especially with each character having its unique abilities. The puzzles occasionally make you think but they aren't too challenging.Whether or not you are a Star Wars fan if you like LEGO games this is one that is a must buy!			"

												In my opinion, this LEGO game is one of the best ones I have ever played, and I've played almost every single LEGO game. Here's why I enjoyed it so much.First off, replay value. I have beaten this game twice on a Nintendo Wii I had, and now once here on PC. Since there are so many levels, collectables, funny cutscenes, and it staying very true to all six Star Wars movies, it really never gets old.Which brings me to my second point. This game lasts for quite some time, especially if you are in it to collect everything. You'll have to play through every level (36 levels) about 2 or 3 times to get everything. Sounds tedious, right? Well, no. You see, once you have done story mode, like all other LEGO games, you can go back with any other characters and power on through the level. It's very fun to go back and explore the places you can't get to in story mode.So now the third reason why this game is so fun. Throughout the game you can collect ""Power Bricks"" which enable you to do things like become invincible and make the in-game currency, the studs, worth many times their original value. This makes it so you can buy vehicles, characters, and other things faster. You can also make it so your Jedi Slam does more damage, disable enemy weapons, and so much more.And finally, the shear amount of characters is amazing. There are over 120 characters, some being different variations of the same person and lots of others. You can even be Indiana Jones! Being set in the Star Wars universe, it's only natural there would be plenty of characters to choose from, and this game doesn't disappoint.But what are the levels like? They are all unique, providing different things to do in every level. However, a few levels are a bit repetitve and boring. One or two are extremely hard in story mode, such as one where you have to fly around and destroy enemy ships and weapons. But the rest of the levels certainly make up for them.With this game having the replay value and normal LEGO humor, it's a fantastic game to play. I got halfway through the game about 17 hours in, so it's certainly not a short game, especially if you are a completionist like me and want to get to 100%. So if you have never played it and were wondering, I strongly recommend it! 9/10.			"

												I originally owned Lego Star Wars I and II for the PS2 but never tried the Complete Saga until now. Lego Star Wars takes a humorous twist on an otherwise serious aspect of both the first three episodes and of course the classic trilogy. All I can say is it was money well spent.Fyi, You don't have to be a kid to enjoy this, I'm 18 and I still enjoy these Lego games. You can gurantee that I'll be ordering more Lego games in the future!My Rating: 10/10 (Recommended) "

												This game, hearing about it, sounds like it wouldn't capture the idea of Star Wars well, but it does. The lightsaber combat is amazing, there are many characters you can play as, it has couch coop (chair and end of bed in my case) and is a lot of fun. I look forward to Lego TFA.Also, this game has the force. IT HAS THE FORCE.			"

												LEGO Star Wars - The Complete Saga, takes the Original Trilogy of; A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi, and combines it with; The Phantom Menace, The Clone Wars, and Revenge of the Sith. It was released in 2007.As is custom with LEGO games, you collect Gold Bricks to unlock additional content, collect coins to purchase things, and complete missions to further the story. A difference between the Complete Saga and the original  LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game, are two previously deleted levels, The Bounty Hunter's Pursuit, and Anakin's Flight. These are unlockable by obtaining Gold Bricks.As with many of the other LEGO games, Single Player Mode as well as Co-operative Two-Player mode is available locally. Having played this particular game on both the PS3, as well as PC, I can say I haven't seen any difference. If you enjoy the LEGO series, this is a must have for the collection. If you are new to LEGO games, LEGO Star Wars - The Complete Saga is a great place to start. "

The amount of characters you can play as in free mode is large. You also have the option to make and customize your own lego characters in the Mos Eisley Canteena. 30/10			"

												Maybe it's just nostalgia. Or the emotional connection. Or that it's considered the greatest lego game. Or I may have bad taste in games.This game is my favorite game of all time. If you haven't played it, buy it on sale or buy it now. Just give it a try. I've played every lego game I can get my hands on from lego island to lego worlds to lego city undercover. This one still remains the greatest, even after a decade.			"

												So this is Lego Star Wars - The Complete Saga, it's the sequel to Lego Star Wars II, which was in turn a Sequel to Lego Star Wars. If you've played this as a kid on the Ps2 like I have, you know what you're getting into, but regardless here's a review.The Complete Saga features the 6 pre-force awakens episodes - the prequel era episodes through the original trilogy - and levels are based on scenes and events in the movies.So the game starts you off in the first level of Episode 1, the Phantom Menace, in the Trade Federation blockade ship Episode 1 largely started in. You play as Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan and try to escape from the ship, the first level serving as a tutorial on how the functions of the game work, such as the force, building, studs, minikits, deflecting blaster shots, and access panels only characters can access.After you finish that level, you're free to go to any of the other episodes of the Prequels/OT. Which is rather nice and actually really well thought out, while you can continue with the plot of TPM, you're allowed to jump to any of the other episodes and start off at level 1. You don't have to complete all the levels of TPM to move on to AOTC, for example. The game is really open and free, and as such comes off as a really good title.The gameplay is just what you would expect from a Lego game, it's fun, interactive, and runs great. Most props are composed of Legos in the game, with the exception of environments (Which still look good) and it gives the game and levels a great atmosphere that you expect from a Lego game.As you go through the game, you can unlock more things with money, be it custom characters, cheats, or hints from the store. And can use the characters when replaying missions.Meanwhile, the explanation of the story in the game is arguably better than how it's explained in some of the films. This being an early Lego game,(since modern Lego games seem to have dialogue) there is no dialogue and thus the cutscenes explaining the story have to rely on only visuals to get the plot across, and it's honestly genius how they explain some of the Episode Plots. The cutscenes for the Phantom Menace Episode, for example, are not only more funny than the actual film it's based on, but the game's explanations of the story in the episode in the cutscenes more easily explain the plot of the film, and you're able to get a gist of what's going on. Which, in the case of TPM, where the conflict is based on a trade blockade dispute,(and honestly one of the most difficult plots to explain due to how messy it is for a Star Wars film) is very important for game cutscenes to be short and to the point, and this game is great at explaining stuff by way of 15 second cutscenes.The game runs fantastically and I've yet to find a PC of mine that cannot run it, it's greatly optimized and allows for great customization of settings, including the controls. Though the mouse cannot be bound as a key, which confused me until I realized that the setup of the game is for it to be entirely played without a mouse, which is cool, but if you have a controller I suggest you use it for this.If you're looking for online Multiplayer though, you won't find it here, the multiplayer service is local (i.e two people would have to share the PC screen) but I don't blame the game for this as the original game on the consoles was also local and without online multiplayer connection. Though if you want to set up Steam Big Picture and grab some remotes, it's probably possible to mimic a console.			"

												Lego Star Wars the Complete Saga came out in 2009 on PC and combined together Lego Star Wars the Video Game (1-3 episodes) and Lego Star Wars the Original Trilogy (4-6 episodes). No, Lego Star Wars 3 on Steam is a compltely different game. Aside from combining, it also changed gameplay in vehicle chapters of 1-3 Episodes, as well as adding bonus chapters, which include original versions of those vehicle levels. And well, let's just say that Lego Star Wars was quite a sudden hit when original came out in 2005, developed by Traveller's Tales, who made few charming games in the past and now are making Legos non-stop. Also, PC version has no online multiplayer. No Lego games on PC do.Technically it still works excellent. No glitches or crashes. Supports widescreen, as it should. It also works excellently with non-Xbox360 controllers, something that became quite rare nowadays.So, what is Lego Star Wars? Let's just say that it's one of the most casual games in action genre. There is no such thing as ""game over"". You can't die, you have infinite lives. The only thing that you lose is ""stud"", the currency of the game. Instead the game forces on collecting, unlocking, sillyness, humor and collecting and collecting. You got over 120+ characters to unlock, for example. And in each chapter 10 minikits are hidden. And often you can't get them all in Story Mode, instead having to use Free Play where you can change character to one of the few specially selected. Even though there are a lot of useless character or the ones who do same stuff, have same powers. But hey, this is what you get when the game tries to appeal to Star Wars nerds, putting every single character from background into it, while also making them stay unique in Lego shape.Game wants you to unlock some characters and then come back to the levels, uncovering all the secrets. There is probably too much of stuff to collect.And I must say though that the game, due to it's relaxy nature, can get quite repetitive for more classic gamers. After all, you can't die, you immeditly respawn in same spot. Penalty on Stud isn't huge, and people who don't care about unlocking anything just will not care. As a result of this, playing through all 6 episodes will get so old, that you will want it to end ASAP by Episode 6. One of those cases where game is too long for it's own good.Talking about story, it's probably slightly friendly to those who didn't watch Star Wars itself. Sometimes not. There is text before each chapter but the cutscenes are silent, instead being just about parody. Probably great for those who watches films first.And I got to say that 4-6 Episodes somehow were more interesting in story part than 1-3. Didn't see movies myself. Maybe people who kick the prequels aren't so wrong.The gameplay combines the action of fighting and puzzles in it, with some exploration for sake of gettin studs. Puzzles are quite varied. Sometimes you have to push a box. But most often it's about switching to the right character to open the door. Original trilogy got better there, making you take on a helmet to pass some doors. You don't have to get hit so the helmed will not get knocked off. Also, AI is pretty great there, as in cases where it requires 2 players, it will help you happily.Now, there is action, fighting part. You got either got a gun or lightsaber. Gun users can shoot with attack button. Some of them can avoid incoming shots if you press attack in a moment when the enemy laser shot is nearby. In such cases character will dodge and then aim at the one who shot it. So, spamming attack can win the battles there. Gun users can also use hooks to get into some areas.Lightsaber users can once again smash button to hit things. Hitting attack when somebody is about to hit you also makes your character block, also deflecting any laser back at attacker, so panicing by mashing attack can work there too. But they can also double jump and do area attack this way. Actually, you fight most bosses with Lightsaber character and most often the way that you can do damage on them is just spamming jump attack.And well, such simplistic nature of fighting should compliment the game that is mostly about puzzles and exploration for sake of collecting. The thing is, there is at times way too much fighting. And it doesn't help at all that AI refuses to help you any bit, only sometimes distracting enemy attention on itself. You feel quite alone in these cases.Actually it gets to completely frustrating moments by the end of a game. Like, after fighting a bunch of enemies, you just want to concentrate on puzzle solving to get into next area. But as you finally found that you have to move something with force, game decides that you spent your time too boring and spawns yet another bunch of Stormtroopers. By this time, you really don't want to fight them, because you know you will win by spamming attack button, you want to solve the darn puzzle already. And all of this while few AI characters stand dumbly around, doing nothing. If you try to do something with force, then suddenly every enemy will focus fire on you, so you sigh and just spend another 15 seconds on destroying them all.There are also vehicle missions where you fly around, spamming attack, collecting purple balls in one spot and then unleashing them on purple target. Most of them are like that. You can also play original versions of vehicle chapters in bonus levels, and boy, looking at them, they were much harder than you would expect from such relaxed game.Well, and graphics and music. Graphics are nice and fits well. It's hard to claim that Lego figures look unrealistical and lack polygons you know. Though, it feels too bright or blurry at times.Music is mostly same as in movies. I guess. It's either something forgetable, or arrangement of either Star Wars themes or Imperial March. Which is fine for movies. Not fine for games where you need more unique and memoriable tracks for each location. But hey, at least it changes between battle and peaciful music during gameplay.So yea. if you got two kids who love Star Wars and like collecting things, while being silly to each other, then it's perfect game right there. There is a reason why they say it's a game fo their childhood. And if you want more of traditional gaming values in it, then well, only expect to be amused.			"

												Lighthearted and fun. I played the first three Episodes years ago on the Playstation 2, so when I saw a version with all 6 episodes I knew I had to pick it up.The game is great both for adults and kids, the story is slightly modified to keep it understandable in this format (the game features no voice acting - everything is grunts). I played it solo here, but I know that when I played it years ago, the co-op was great fun (the game was designed to have two players at all times - if you play solo the second player is replaced with an AI who automatically does their part in the teamwork puzzles but does nothing else).The game is broken up into 6 episodes (the original triology and the prequel triology) with each episode having 6 levels. Each level has a story mode. Upon completing each level, you also unlock the ""Free Play"" version of that level which allows you to revisit the level using any characters. Each level has a number of secondary objectives, most of which require you to visit the level in Free Play mode to use characters with certain abilities to access hidden areas, so once you finish the game on story mode, you still have a lot of content to explore!If you have kids, putting two of them in front of this is a great way of getting them to learn teamwork and puzzle solving.All in all, an extremely fun game.

												I may have low hours for now on PC however I have played Lego Star Wars: The Video Game and Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy. This game is a merge of the previous to Lego Star Wars games i have mentioned and I honestly think its better. With extra cut missions from the previous games and extra side missions who would not want to buy this game.The first ever Lego Star Wars game was my first ever Star Wars game as a child and brought me great joy and made me become the Chosen One I am today.Pros:*You can run this game on a toaster or If you want I guess you could run it on a old PC*You can kill JarJar Stinks but sadly he respawns again... but you can kill him again :D*It Goes through the Origianl Trilogy and the Prequels.*You can create your own charcters*You can play as Indiana Jones...wait indiana jones is played by harrison ford and han solo is also played by harrison ford so if there are two harrison fords in the game that means that If one dies so does the other and if you multiply 12 letters from harrison ford's name and multiply is by 7 you get 84... 84+100 hours of fun you will be getting from this game you will then have 184, 184x2 harrison ford's=368 you then add this by 297 which will give you 665 then add the 1 game as a complete and you get 666... Oh my God ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls you have seen it here first folks the true Identity of Harrison Ford... He Is The Illuminati. Why didnt we see this sooner!Cons:*The Storm Troopers can actually aim in this game which means that you have a higher chance of loosing all your amazing lego republic credits*Jk There are no Cons well apart from Jar Jar but then again you can kill him.How to play Lego Star Wars- The Complete Saga:Step 1: Buy This GameStep 2: Run This Game Step 3: Play This Game until you go bald and become SaitamaStep 4: Use This Game to become  a true JediStep 5: You are now Master Jedi Saitama...

												For those of you familiar with the LEGO series, here is one of originals that set the tone.For those of you who aren't, you have the cute LEGO figurines playing through a somewhat stylized version of the Star Wars Saga (episode 1 to 6), breaking LEGO pieces for studs along the way. After playing through in story mode, you can come back in free-play mode that allows you to switch between any character you unlocked. This allows you, for example, to use Princess Leia to grapple up to a ledge, and then switch to R2D2 to open a switch to open a door that was inaccessible in story mode. The game is easy but fun, and has a TON of collectables, unlock-able bonus levels, and such. Perhaps it is partially nostalgia, but this one ties LEGO Lord of the Rings for my favorite in the LEGO series.			"

												I never have seen any Star Wars Movie so I figured this is the perfect way to learn the characters.And it has a fun story to offer.You can play from Episode 1 till Episode 6 every Episode has 10 minikits, 1 blue minikit, 3 gold bricks, 1 red brick. Also every Episode has 6 levels + 2 bonus missions.To get the Blue Minikit you must play Challenge Mode it's a fun addition.The game is old so it's not perfect you can't depend on the AI to kill anyone for you and sometimes you have so many enemy's constantly respawning you can't do what you have to do.But this game has allot of gametime and it allot of fun even if you don't know Star Wars like me.Characters can fly, throw bombs, use lightsabers, use the force, jump extra high. open certain doors depending on who you use.

			100 out of 100. Watch JonTron: https://www.youtube.com/user/JonTronShow		

The game has missions in which you can only do flying it's cool and you can unlock more vechiles, you will need a Tie Fighter to open certain doors for the Minikits.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=609198622http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=609697112Besides all of that the game has 6 bonus rooms you will be able to unlock with the Gold Bricks nothing special doh. And when you own all Bounty Hunter characters you can do the 15 Bounty Hunter missions.I do recommend this game, I finished it 97% and then I was done with it.One of the few down things is that you can't skip Cinametics and to swap Characters you must stand near them but thats about the only bad stuff.Should do for about 30 hours if you follow that path.The storyline is fun as Fan you will reconize stuff and if you are like me you will learn things.I learned theirs more then 1 version of R2D2 and C3PO.

												You might think that this game is like every other Lego game out there. And to be honest, you would be pretty much right. But. Because there is a but (there always is). It was the first of this kind of lego game. Or, more precisely, it is the combination of the first two, the Lego Star Wars games (duh).To those who played them separatly before, I say this : they took the first game, and got rid of what was infuriating to make it more diverse, like the second one is. And then they added the two games together, which means that you do not need to have a saved game of Lego Star Wars I to fight the Emperor with Jar-Jar and a young Boba Fett (I don't recommand trying that, btw).To those who have played other Lego games, I say this : it is no open world. It is quite linear at first. And there is nothing original here : you play through the movies. But it is funny, it is easy to beat (you get through the missions in under 3 hours), and you will go through it many times if, like me, you are a completionist.To those who have never played a Lego game, I warn you : if you happen to like this game, you might lose yourself in the Lego franchise. As I mentionned, it is quite easy to beat it ""normally"", that is to say finish the story mode. But that is when the real fun starts. You have much to unlock, discover, search... You can go back to any level to play it with unlocked characters, to look for secrets and secondary objectives. And that is without the bonus levels. Also : you see Vader show Luke a picture of him and Leia together to prove that they are related. Just saying.In short, it is well worth the price. If you happen to have an Xbox controler, that is. It is dreadfull to play with a keyboard (no mouse allowed). You have been warned.			"

												I played the original two games on the Playstation 2 when I was young (7 or something), and I loved them.This is SO MUCH BETTER - no need for disks, no need for two different games, no need for a console.This is wonderful nostalgia. Oh, and I have not experienced any bugs or issues, unlike some people, so this is a MUST BUY. Love it - and thankfully, it does not incorporate Episode VIII, which I really didn't like, so that's another plus.			"

												As far as LEGO games go, this game is definitely... well, a LEGO game.What I mean by this is that if you have ever played a LEGO game in your life then you already know everything there is to know mechanically about this game. In my experience, LEGO games are not so much about ground breaking, innovative gameplay; but rather, immensely enjoyable fun for the whole family that comes in all kinds of assorted flavors. Personally, I find the Star Wars flavor to be the best out of all of them, but for the same reason that a die-hard Harry Potter fan would tell you that the Harry Potter LEGO Games are the best.Overall, if you haven't ever played a LEGO game, then don't just buy the ""latest and greatest"". Buy a flavor you love, and I promise you won't be disappointed :)			"

Very fun, easy on newby gamers (my gf, with whom I play local coop is far from what you'd call a ""gamer"", and she still really enjoys it!). The time for a single playthough from episode I to VI is around 10-12 hours, and for total completion the game requires multiple playthroughs with different characters! Highly recommended title!			"

												My first lego game I really liked. It's fun, one of the first before the double trilogy games. It's basic, but fun, Lots of humor, works great, not many bugs. Probably one of the better lego games. -There's no talking, which is a plus for me for lego games. Makes it feel like you're playing with legos.-Uses the hub system, so no open world like the newer lego games.-Hardly any bugs. Runs well.-Overuses the ""Scrolling Space Credit Opener"" & Star Wars theme song for every single level.. For 24 levels, or 48 since you beat each level twice, plus bonus levels, So you'll get tired of both of em fast but you can skip so plus.-Fun game, simple, and long-ish.-Nice graphics, easy on the eyes.

												Are you one of those who played Lego Star Wars as a child and are asking yourself wether you should play it again on Steam ? Well I am.And it´s still as much fun as ever. I´m currently trying to get this game to 100% (again) and I just can´t stop playing. The graphics aged pretty well due to the Lego Artstyle (some low res textures here and there but overall it´s ok).This game has soo much content. It includes:-The Prequel trilogy -The Orininal trilogy-new levels (e.g. Episode 2 the pursuit of the assasin on Corruscant)-reworked flying levels from the first game-Original flying levels as bonus levels (they have been hard af)-1 Billion things and characters to unlockI got this game from a recent humble bundle and didn´t plan on buying it, but i would suggest it to everyone who considers to do so. It´s pretty easy for and adult to play through (except the old flying levels, holy **** has that old pod racing level been hard), but it´s a nice change in between the competetive online multiplayer games I play normally (Dota and Csgo).May the force be with you.

Давным-давно в далёкой-далёкой галактике...Являясь огромным фанатом вселенной Звёздных войн, я не мог не обратить внимание на эту игру. Когда она только вышла, а это был 2009 год - год выхода на PC и ""слияния"" Lego Star Wars: The Video Game и Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy в одну игру, я купил пиратский диск в ближайшем магазине и побежал устанавливать и проходить. Сейчас уж не вспомнить, когда в последний раз я брал диск с какой-либо игрой в руки. И вот, игра запущена, идут всем знакомые начальные титры с также всем знакомой музыкой. Так как эта игра заточена под кооператив за одним компьютером, веселее будет конечно проходить вдвоём. Но мне не повезло, я играл один, но поверьте, получил море удовольствия лишь от того, что видел персонажей, локации и события в новой, не свойственной обёртке + доля фирменного теперь LEGO-юмора.Мнение об игре по пунктам  Графика Для тех лет сносная, 7/10   Сюжет За исключением первого эпизода, 9/10   Музыка Старина Джон - лучший, 10/10   Геймплей Помню были такие моменты, где я застревал надолго, 8/10 Средняя оценка - 8,5Да пребудет с тобой Сила.

												Old-style LEGO game for sure, and that means it's good as long as you're not too serious. It's not the best - too many useless characters, weird-length levels, vehicle levels are kind of a pain, etc. But on the whole, it's a fun experience.And this particular installment certainly has more plain-old, unadulterated STUFF than any of the others. 36 levels, challenge mode for each level, some 40 bonus levels, and a two-player arcade equals many many hours to get to 100%.Easily worth a buy if you like (or think you might like) the LEGO games, as long as you don't despise Star Wars.

They provide so much nostalgia and that is honestly the best feeling you can get when playing a game. This one provides quite a few hours of gameplay. If you own a controller, I would advice you to use it to it's potential, it's really relaxing to just sit back and play the game.

												Being a compilation of the first two LEGO Star Wars games developed by Traveller's Tales, The Complete Saga stands resolutely as a lot of bang for your buck. Particularly if you're a completionist because finishing the game as-is will probably leave you at about 50% completion rate with plenty more to find in form of unlockable characters, gameplay gimmicks and additional levels. As a game it's your action adventure fare with platforming as you go through the entire movie hexalogy. I have to point out the game does suffer from having vehicle levels with extremely loose controls that simply end up getting in the way of things, though. The Complete Saga even retroactively adds some vehicle sections to prequel episodes to keep the entire experience consistent. It does benefits from eschewing voice acting in favor of simple gesticulation which leads to a lot of funny scenes as characters try to convey some plot points. Speaking of characters they operate based on different types ranging from Jedi and Sith aka Force users to droids and bounty hunters, each with their own specific utility which you will need to use in order to complete each level to its fullest. In practice this means you'll be going back to already finished levels in order to complete them as you unlock more characters. You'll also be spending omnipresent studs you gather throughout the game as currency to unlock things. This write-up may seem to be a bit all over place, but that's because I find myself fighting for words. It's a really great game and should not be dismissed as a cash-in game, not even close. Just beware – completionist mentality is recommended.			"

												I own this on PS3 and PC/Steam.  Highest possible recommendation for casual gaming (or obsessive collecting).  I am not a big Star Wars Prequel fan, but their least-irritating form is, surprisingly, their Lego gaming depiction.  Who would have thought back in the 80's while we were struggling to beat ""Contra"" on NES with only 5 or so lives that our favorite games in the future would be ones in which you can't really ""die"" or ""lose.""  All of these Lego games are only frustrating when it comes to 3D platforming at times, when it's hard to guess what depth the platform you are aiming for exists at, but overall, this is a great, comprehensive, varied, fun game.  I have experienced zero bugs with it.			"

												Don't let my measly 2.5 hours fool you, I have played this almost to completion on the Xbox 360. The two versions are practically identical save for maybe a higher framerate on PC. If you fear that the PC version is any different then you need not worry because it is just as good and I look forward to 100% this game.Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga is the six star wars movies told in lego form. Each episode is split into six chapters, so there are 36 levels of lego silliness to enjoy. Each level has different objectives like collecting enough money in each level to get ""true jedi,"" collecting ten minikits to make a vehicle to use in other levels, and the red brick that gives you abilities to purchase (with ingame money, as it should be). On top of this there is free play, that lets you have fun in each level instead of playing the story, and even other levels outside of the original saga like challenge modes. There's a ""super story"" that tests how fast you can complete the six chapters in an episode in succession. So in terms of gameplay there is a lot to do.Lego Star Wars is definitley a completionists game, with things to collect wverywhere you go. There's minikits, red bricks, characters, true jedi, and lots of money. Your progress is tracked with a hologram by the shop in the hub world of Mos Eisley cantina. Even this cantina has loads of things to do like make custom characters, view ones you've unlocked, go outside the cantina and look at vehicles, and a two player challenge mode (everything in the game can be done with a local co-op partner).Given that this game was released in 2009 the graphics are dated compared to the Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens game and others. There is also a lack of co-op over the internet.I would definitley recommend this game to people of all ages, people who like star wars, and completionists of all levels.			"

												****THIS REVIEW HAS BEEN EDITED****I don't normally write reviews but im so upset that this game does not work on windows 10. I was so excited when i bought it but i keep getting a frozen black screen whenever i launch it :( so if you have windows 10 dont bother buying this unless they magically release a version optimized for windows 10 users.Edit: So my problem was that i had to change the compatibility to windows 8 it was originally on windows vista which caused it to not run on my pc. So if you have any problems just go to your game directory and right click the exe. Then go to compatibility and change it to windows 10.			"

												10/10 Get it play it love it!LEGO® Star Wars™ - The Complete Saga has all of your favorite moments from both the prequel and original trilogy. Multiplayer co-op is a blast! Having the option to replay story missions in ""free play"" mode with any characters you've unlocked or made yourself is especially cool. There are mechanics designed for specific types of characters which encourages you to play through as different heroes and villains which just adds to the over all fun factor of the game.All of the lego games offer exploration, action and silliness, but this one is all of that bundled up into one big Star Wars themed adventure. Sprinkling Star Wars on top of an already fun series of games and you just grabbed a hold of my heart strings. As a long time fan of Star Wars and legos this game speaks to me and I highly recomend giving it a try!			"

												LEGO® Star Wars™ - The Complete SagaWhat can i say? It's beautiful, comical & overall a great game. I remember playing it for hours and hours, never wanting to stop. TCS is an amazing game that you can sit and enjoy for hours on end without getting bored. It's one of the few games that aged well. Most games get boring after a while, the memory serves better than the game itself. But TCS always keeps you going. It's also one of the few games where you don't get bored collecting all the stuff. It's got a ""fun"" feel to it. It doesn't challenge you, doesn't bore you, you can just sit and enjoy. This game is my childhood. I would reccomend this to anyone. Even if you're a no-good lego-hating blaster-weilding stormtrooper.			"

												C'mon, It's Lego And Star Wars Combined together to bring one of the best experiences you have had. With the power of excellent missions, collecting all the characters, minikits, gold bricks, and studs you can, you are guranteed to have a fantastic trip as you get to experience not one but all 6 of the Star Wars movies. As of now, I have played the game for 39 hours and my percentage level 65.8%. Trust me, it's worth it's price tag and you won't regret buying, Unless you absouloutly hated lego and Star Wars as a Kid to which I say, ""Why?"" Also this game will be able to run on that laptop you put in the closet becuase you got a new one that was better.The only real faults is that there a some glitches like in chapter one, episode 3 theres a sound glitch towards the end but the glitches are very rare and don't mess with your fun. Overall I would give this game a score of 10/10.			"

												The game you played as a kid is back! Journey through all six films and experience a story that is legend. There is no dialogue ripped from the films, a plus for prequel-haters. I've seen all six films and the story is more fun to play through than watching the films ever was.There are some glaring issues like useless playable characters, objects with unnatural sounds, and the custom characters' faces differing from the story ones (these are all issues in the PS3 version too), but none of these can destroy my love for this game.This really is a good deal. Lego isn't too keen on sales so just buy this one when you have the cash. I've bought this gem a total of four times.  The first two were on the PS2 (The game used to be split between the two trilogies), the third was on PS3 for that 1080p shine and merger of both games. Now it's found a home in my Steam library. With the addition of Vsync, graphics options, sixty frames per second, and 1080p screen resolution, I can safely say this is *the best version of Lego Star Wars*!			"

												The Star Wars fanbase is a tumultuous one. At the time of Lego Star Wars’ release, the franchise consisted of a fantastic trilogy, an awful trilogy and a mess of other content of varying quality. There are various groups of Star Wars fans with different opinions—some defend the prequel trilogy wholeheartedly while others are more down-to-earth, insisting that there hasn’t been a good Star Wars film in over 30 years.One of the biggest strengths of Lego Star Wars is that it doesn’t seem reminiscent of either trilogy, instead bringing forth its own style of simple, family-friendly humour and simplifying down the plots of all six Star Wars film into a cartoony mashup of the popular sci-fi series and the equally popular line of children’s toys.In theory, it’s a bizarre concept, but in practice it works rather well. The Lego adaptations of the various sets and characters from the films look fantastic, providing a wacky, cartoony art direction complemented by the game’s child-oriented sense of humour. It consists mostly of slapstick comedy by way of over-the-top animation. In fact, the graphics overall are actually very good. While the ‘photorealistic-in-2005’ textures on some of the non-Lego environmental objects are a little ugly, everything that’s made of the titular plastic bits looks great. It’s quite amusing to see well-known icons of the franchise like the famous Millennium Falcon rendered as an excessively detailed Lego model.There is, however, a bit of a disparity in overall visual fidelity between the episodes taken from the original 2005 Lego Star Wars game and the 2006 sequel. The original trilogy characters taken from Lego Star Wars II each have unique animations and each has an exotic look about him. Han Solo winks knowingly at the camera as he twirls his laser pistol on his finger before he holsters it, Darth Vader simply taps his foot in front of security cameras rather than give the wave of acknowledgement an average Stormtrooper would. My favourite is the animation that plays when you try to punch Princess Leia as Lando Calrissian—rather than attack her, he plants a gentle kiss on her hand and bows. It’s the little details like this that make Lego Star Wars such a joy to look at.Characters from the prequel trilogy, however, all share the same set of generic animations. I didn’t notice any of the detailed animations with them, and there was even one character I noticed who kept the ‘generic Lego smile with soulless black eyes’ expression regardless of the situation he was in. It was unnerving and honestly just felt like a bit of a cop-out. I understand that these characters were from an older game, but I think if the developer is going to re-release both of these games in a package like The Complete Saga, the least that could be done is an update to bring these parts of the game up to the quality level of the original trilogy.Surprisingly, the quality gap doesn’t stop at the animations. Allow me to give an example. Characters from the original trilogy who use laser pistols have access to a ‘dodge’ move, allow them to quickly step out of harm’s way in combat. This feature wasn’t implemented in the original game, so the characters from it cannot use this ability. This is baffling laziness on the developer’s part, and it actually makes about a quarter of the game’s characters obsolete by comparison. It’s especially embarrassing when you consider how much effort it would take—all the characters are almost exactly the same model, and all the animations are already in the game. In fact, the entire amalgamation is rife with this kind of laziness. All that’s really been done to the original game's content is a slight graphical tweak. Don’t get me wrong, everything that’s here is fantastic, even the older stuff, but I just don’t quite understand why a developer wouldn’t take the time to even out the quality so that even the content from the 2005 game feels like less of a re-tread and more like a remake.The gameplay itself is essentially a 3D platformer with an emphasis on combat, puzzles and collectible items. The levels are beautifully rendered as Lego models, though there are a lot of models and textures designed to look like real-world objects. It’s a little disappointing that not everything’s made of Lego, but it still a treat to look at.The controls are sufficient. I did find that far too many actions are bound to the B button, and the vehicle-based levels are an absolute nightmare in general, but the ground-based levels control well enough. The combat is extremely simple—it’s not really viable to use more than two buttons—but I still found it engaging, perhaps because of the (mostly) superb animations.Lego Star Wars uses sounds taken almost exclusively from the films, and it works fantastically. John Williams' score speaks for itself, but it’s not even just that—every sound effect is authentic to the point where just listening to the game’s audio could leave you thinking you were actually watching one of the films. The way the characters collide with a soft click is so charming, and fits with the game’s overall style perfectly.The Complete Saga has a whole lot of content. There are 37 levels total, 20 side missions (given out by the illustrious Jabba the Hutt), 160 characters and a variety of vehicles. I do have a problem with the character roster, however. Out of the huge selection, there are maybe 8 that aren’t just remodels of other characters. To make matters worse, a lot of characters are just another character minus one ability. Every Jedi is identical, and every Sith is just a Jedi with an extra ability, thereby invalidating the need to ever play as a Jedi outside of story mode. There are a ton of other comparisons that can be drawn up, which I’d bet would invalidate over half the roster. I get that they want to include everyone from the films, but it feels like they could have buffed up a lot of the weaker guys. Sure, that may end up with most characters being reskins of others, but that’s still a better alternative to what happens now.On the topic of content, a lot of The Complete Saga’s replayability feels pretty contrived. For instance, within each and every level there are 10 ‘minikit canisters’ that will give the player a new vehicle once collected. The problem is, most of these canisters can only be acquired using abilities that the player does not have in story mode, thereby mandating a second playthrough of the level in ‘free play’ mode to reach 100% completion. ‘Free play’ mode is the same as story mode, but it removes the cutscenes and allows the player to choose one of their unlocked characters to play as throughout the level. They may then swap between a select group of characters on the fly. This party of characters is selected based on their abilities, ensuring that you will always have access to every ability in the game as long as you’re in free play mode. It’s good fun to go back through early levels searching for collectibles as Darth Vader (obviously the best character), but I just wish it didn’t feel so much like the game was trying to force multiple playthroughs. It’s a minor criticism, however. I still had a great time in free play mode.Overall, The Complete Saga does feel like a bit of a lazy compilation of two fantastic games, but I’m still going to recommend it based purely on the outstanding quality and unique style of those original games.

												This is a fun game but somewhat antiquated feeling if you've played the newer Lego games and then go back and play this. For those who may not know, this is a combination of 2 original titles - Lego Star Wars and Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy. I have played neither of those but from my understanding, their recreation in this ""Complete Saga"" is pretty faithful to the original games with some minor changes here and there. One of the nice bonus features is that they let you play the original version of 2 stages from the first game and you can tell that they definitely made some improvements in terms of the maneuvering and physics on those stages. However on one of the stages they also made it a lot easier by essentially removing certain goals that have to be met throughout the stage to continue.On the whole thoguh, if you've played most any Lego game before, then you know what to expect. If not, then expect to smash a lot of stuff, play as a lot of different characters from the Star Wars series and use those characters' various abilities to progress through stages and find the insane amount of collectibles, if you so choose. As with most Lego games, this game goes almost overboard on the sheer amount content and collectibles that you have to play and find to achieve 100% if you're a completionist like me. This one really almost wore me down and I feel that they maybe put a bit TOO much, but you certainly get your money's worth.All in all, if you're a Lego game fan and/or a Star Wars fan, I would recommend this game. It does a very good job of staying mostly faithful to the Star Wars movies, while taking some creative liberties in order to keep gameplay consistent. It also has the light-hearted humor throughout that the Lego games are known for and I think that Star Wars fans will appreciate most of it. Again though, be prepared for a slight feeling of antiquated controls and mechanics if you've played newer Lego games, sepcifically Lego Star Wars III: The Clone Wars because they have definitely continously made gameplay improvements over the years.

But be WARNED if your going to buy this your better off using a controller because using the keyboard controls are kind of bullsh*t and you also have to control your other characters with seperate buttons so long story short use a controller. Rate this 8/10 maybe even 10/10 and totally suggest you buy it.			"

												30 minutes in but I can tell you this games only real problem. It has the worst controls for this type of game that I've ever seen. You can't bind buttons on your mouse (any button) to any function, so you will only be playing with the keyboard. There aren't enough wasd area keys for the controls, so I had to use both sides of the keyboard. It's really akward. Other than the akward controls, the game is the same as it was on the console. Still as nostalgic as ever. Still a great game. If you have a gamepad and the game has gamepad support I absolutely recommend it. I'm not sure if it has gamepad support or not.			"

												I never played a single LEGO game and I always thought they were terrible in both presentation and development. I was then curious enough after being annoyed at the many releases of them. I figured I would start with the Star Wars Saga. I was immediately hooked. Star Wars Saga adapts the prequels and original movies in a light hearted way. The kind of comedy I laugh maniacally at. There is no dialogue and all the characters either grunt or use gestures to show emotion. Gameplay is not too bad but I played it mostly for story and it really is just a casual game that you easily turn off your brain to and enjoy.			"

												For those of you who know about the Lego games series, this was the one that started it all. I still remember playing this game back when I was youger. To anyone new to the series it's a very simple and funny game that follows the storyline of the first 6 movies from the Star Wars Trilogy, with a twist.			"

												LEGO Star Wars - Die Komplette Saga habe ich bereits vor meinen Steam-Zeiten beendet und auch hier auf Steam noch einmal angefangen. Es ist ein besonderes Spiel für mich als Star Wars Begeisterten. Es lässt einen in die Athmosphäre der Filme eintauchen und die Handlung erneut mit etwas mehr Humor erleben. Und obwohl die Grafik und die Animationen mitlerweile etwas überholt und nicht mehr den heutigen LEGO-Standarts entsprechen, ist es keinen Tick unattraktiver geworden als es damals schon war. Einfach super dieses Spiel. Würde es JEDEM wärmstens ans Herz legen. Auch Umfangmäßig her ist man mit diesem Spiel sehr gut bedient, da es eigentlich aus zwei Spielen besteht ;)			"

												The first Lego game I ever played years ago. Sill holds up to this day. Wish I had a friend to play co-op with. Ohwell, solo IRL, surrounded by ""friends"" online multiplayer gaming.Would recommend for us that are still a child inside and if you have kid, play this with him. Some puzzles are not that easy for a child to understand so help them.I own all Lego games, not all on Steam though but still. Good games imho.This is an ""old"" game at this point in time but the price tag at 19,99€ does not reflect that. I say wait for a sale. "

												Featuring all the usual Lego game features, most notably the humour, this game actually manages something that so many Star Wars based games fail to do... be an enjoyable game. In fact, if you were to overlook the lego connection you'll find this to be an excellent Star Wars game. I'm no Star Wars fanatic, but i have absolutely no hesitation in recommending this game to the most hardcore of SW fans as well as anyone who is looking for a fun game that doesn't take itself too seriously and is thoroughly absorbing as a result.

												Takes me back to the days of playing this beautiful game on the PS2 and Wii. The PC version is basically the Wii version with PC optimisations, although I swear I can see some extra content in the PC version...The Wii version in and of itself was incredible, basically merging the original two PS2 games. In keeping with the Wii game, this is also incredible. It's fun, and a hell of a lot of it. At their core, Lego games are pretty basic: Get your Lego minifigures and go nuts in some themed setting, which appeals amazingly to children (Exhibit A being myself about 10 years ago). But the more intricate features (gold/power brick unlocks, challenge mode, etc.) are enough to keep more hardened gamers (Exhibit A being myself right now) coming back for more.And it's Star Wars. Jar Jar actually has a purpose in this game, and you can quite successfully fight Darth Vader with Darth Vader in Free Play mode.Brilliant game, and the nostalgia rush makes it even better.9.5/10 "

												I've been a fan of the Lego Star Wars games ever since I've played the original for Game Boy Advance back in 2005/6. Along with The Original Trilogy on Gamecube and The Complete Saga on Wii, I've sunk in hours back then on playing all 6 (soon 7) episodes of the Saga. With the funny easter eggs, tons of characters to unlock including creating your own minifigure from various parts and pieces, visual gags made by characters to explain plot points without the need of annoying voice acting like the newer Lego games and the sheer madness of cute minifigure replicas of beloved characters from the movies. This is the definitive Lego game to play and I highly recommend it. 10/10			"

												As much as I despise the Prequels and the Special Editions, I cannot insist enough on how this game is what a die-hard Star Wars fan wants to play. LEGOs and Star Wars are the blood of my childhood, and seeing them being reunited this way is more than I ever asked.Star Wars video games have unfortunately had the habit of being quite dreadful, with some exceptions like Shadows of the Empire, Dark Forces and Rogue Squadron, and here we have one special case of delight. With the next Battlefront game stinking failure for miles around *cough* microtransactions *cough*, this and the upcoming Episode 7 can only ease the pain of a too often disappointed fan of a Saga being always more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥d to uninterested and casual audiences....

The graphics hold up to this day and if you need some nostalgia in your life, I would highly recommend this game, and my most Hope for A New LEGO game is when the rest of the movies come out (7-9, including side stories) will combine all the movies into one game, and to have hours upon hours of content to complete.

And you get so much out of this game. Although if I had to mention some bad points, it's very easy to lose yourself in this game and realize hours later you've been playing for hours. Some of the musical score can get repedative and annoying.

												This game used to be my second favorite game on ps2 (close second to Star Wars Battlefront II). It's by far still my favorite Lego game of all time. The graphics are slightly better on PC, my only complaint is the default controls are quite awkward to use, but are easily changable. The description claims it has full controller support but my PS4 controller has not worked so far. I will update this review if I manage to get it to work.For the future I hope Telltales Games combines all 9 episodes (assuming Disney follows up on their three-movie contract) into one amazing game for ALL platforms.

I'm so happy right now, played it on my cousin's PSP for years, and now is finally mine.This game is a piece of art, even more for Star Wars fans!Can run it on high with 60 fps eheheh Buy this game! worth every euro!You will play with a keyboard, but in 5 min, you will easly play it without problems! or just play it with a controller remember, people thing LEGO games are easy to end, they're not, they're open worlds, full of story line, and then side quests, and challenges! the graphims... is just, diferent, from other games, is beautfil, and calmBAD ASPECTS:annoying driving systemscharacters have no voice, and there's no dialogue.anyways, the game follows the entire saga, until the episode 6, for people who dont want to watch the old movies, from the 80s, play the game, so you can have much fun aswell.. now, i m going to buy the LEGO the force awakens,and LEGO the clone wars!btw! childhood <3 LEGO games, are awesome! awesome! awesome!MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU ^_^			"

												This used to be my favorite game many-a-year ago and I was afraid to return to it in fear that it would lose what had made it so entertaining for me. This game hasn't aged at all and I really did enjoy it. Before I knew it, I already had 3 hours logged on to the game! This game truly is one of if not the best Star Wars game you can buy. I've never reccomended another game as much as I can reccomend this one. I've logged over 200 hours on the DS version with less levels and features. This game includes many levels with puzzels that require different types of characters in order to get collectables and other objects in order to complete the game and to unlock secret areas and levels. Unlike other LEGO games, such as LEGO Indiana Jones, the puzzles are not tedious and not required for progression. Even with the game's cheat codes, the game is still as fun as ever and with no DLC, it is truly worth a buy.			"

												I bought this game purely for nostalgic reasons. But, after playing it again enough to remember why I used to play it in the first place, I realise that it holds up incredibly even today. The levels are fun and creative, the controls are tight even without a controller, and there's no feeling like immersing yourself as your favorite Star Wars characters. The amount of detail in this game is amazing. There are SO MANY things to do just around Mos Eisley cantina. Super good.			"

												This is the third LEGO game I've played, and I can definitely say they have improved over the years.  Unfortunately, that means that this very early one is missing a lot of the refinements that have been added as the series has developed.  While it still has the enjoyable LEGO rendition of familiar characters and scenes, as well as the trademark sense of humour, this particular game gets repetetive pretty quickly and lacks the variety of later games.  It's the first LEGO game where I couldn't be bothered to get 100%, mostly because that required replaying the same missions on a timer.  It was a good way to get ready for The Force Awakens, but it just doesn't measure up to Marvel Superheroes or the Harry Potter games.Also, I found it interesting that the prequels were just as boring and reprehensible in LEGO form as they were in the cinema.  I suppose that didn't help.In order to decide whether to recommend it, I imagined there were no other LEGO games.  On its own, it's good enough.  It's just nowhere near their later offerings.			"

												This brought me a lot of nostalgia, and runs very well as it should.  The gameplay is solid and has good humor.  However, the controls are rough if you're using a keyboard and mouse.There is no mouse support whatsoever, not even on menus.  You can rebind all the keys to any buttons on keyboards, joysticks, etc.  I highly recommend playing this with a controller or even a joystick.As with most Lego games, you can play local co-op on a single computer, which is a great feature.  Supsequently, there is no online co-op.  However, co-op is nearly impossible with a keyboard.  Essentially, one player uses one half of the keyboard and the other player uses the second half.  This isn't the issue though.  The problem is that regular keyboards cannot register more than 4 keys being pressed at the same time, so sometimes one player won't be able to attack or jump.  If you have a mechanical keyboard, this isn't an issue.  Ideally both players should have controllers, but either player can bind their controls to any kind of input peripheral.			"

												I bought all LEGO games on impulse and this was the first one that I played and finished. I have mixed feelings about it. While the thematic is amazing (STAR WARS!!!11!!) and it recreates all movies stories perfectly the game itself doesn't offer a real challenge and it is really annoying sometimes.Pros:- Thematic and story- Lots of humour- You can play with almost every Star Wars character- LOTS of things to find in every level- Friendly AI is impressive on some levels (pathfinding + actions)Cons:- Starship and flight controls and combat are really bad and stressful. Yes, the flight levels are awful. Actually I would say that vehicle controls overall are terrible in this game. - Music and Sound can be really annoying. I know we are talking about Star Wars music, but it just doesn't stop playing anytime.- The only challenge is to collect all coins (stud) to then buy stuff in the store, to get to 100%. I finished all levels and story mode with 27% and I don't plan on coming back to keep collecting coins just to buy some new characters.- Enemy AI is dumb most of the time.- Repetitive. On Episode VI I just wanted to finish it ASAP.I don't know if this is the default recipe for LEGO games, but the next LEGO game I'll play has to be a newer one with achievements, because I want to check if the mechanics and challenges have changed - but specially the vehicle controls. So I'll decide it the other ones that I own will be worth playing.Score: 6 / 10.TL;DR; Play only if you are a Star Wars fan or if you are a game completionist and like replaying the same levels over and over again to find and collect all stuff.

												I love this game. When I was younger I bought the other ones seperately and I loved them, this time it's even better with both of them combined. I remember this being a big part of my childhood along with some of the other Lego games that came out back then. People would probably say ""This is a kids game."" which they are correct but anyone can enjoy this very fun game. I love the collectibles and secrets to be found and the wide range of characters you can use in free play. All in all I would give this game a 4/5.P.S I can't wait to see what they do with the upcoming movies like 7, 8 and 9 and even maybe the spinoff movie Rogue 1. What do you guys think? Will the revamp the original 2 games with new levels and updated graphics? Or make 7, 8 and 9 all into one game and maybe not add Rogue 1. Thing is though the fans would have to wait 2 years between each movie until we can get a game if they were to do 7, 8 and 9 all together or they might just do the single movies and make them really long.

												I played the original LEGO Star Wars on PS2 with a friend back in the day, and it was hella fun.I bought this, remembering how fun it was, and knowing I'd get the content from the second game that I'd never played, the decision was even more of a ""duh"".To my surprise, they actually changed some of the most frustrating aspects of the original.  The Mos Espa Podrace is now fully 3D rendered, no longer has a timer for each segment of each lap, and is far more forgiving about hitting obstacles, making it much less frustrating to play and much easier to get True Jedi on.  If you want to see what the original was like, it's available to play in the bonus section.Sorry I can't really go more in-depth, I just don't think I need to. I'm extremely happy that I can play this game again.  You get to play through all six Star Wars movies (even if only 4, 5, and 6 actually exist...), in LEGO style with plenty of humor thrown in.Also, YOU CAN KILL JAR JAR BINKS.  REPEATEDLY.  HOWEVER YOU LIKE.  WHY HAVE YOU NOT BOUGHT THIS GAME YET.			"

												Here is the thing....this is a damn fun game.....I mean really really fun.  However before I sing the praises let me bring up two huge issues for me. One is the A.I. it is utterly inept.  You REALLY REALLY want to play with someone in co-op, as the A.I side kick does NOTHING.  NO help of ANY kind while you fight.  I am sure this is a result of wanting players to use the co-op feature.  An that is my second issue.  This really really is best served as a co-op play.  You will enjoy it far more if you play with a friend, the wife, the hubby, the kids...anyone but the A.I.  Now to recap the great here.  All Star Wars films, the original 4,5,6 and the prequel 1,2, and 3.  All here, all very in depth, insideously cute, and amazingly deep.  The collectable got to get every Lego alone is a 100 to 150 hours alone.  The reply value here is endless..... An for Any fan of Star Wars really needs to sit back, re enter the universe and do not be afraid to smile, and see it Lego style.  Enjoy, I am.			"

												10/10 This game is a masterpiece. The old games I remember from the GameCube and PS2 are now combined into a single game, which means more free play characters and more fun in free play, as well as having all of the missions from Lego Star Wars: the video game, and Lego star wars II: The original trilogy, and they're not tweaked!This game doesn't use mouse, but it's for the better. BUT, you can use a controller!			"

												For me, this game is a good ol' slice of nostalgia. If you haven't played the game, you should find some fun in the simple yet addicting gameplay with a bit of puzzle solving, and Star Wars fans should find some fun laughing at the jokes scattered throughout. The story convayes the plot of both Trilogies without any dialoug beside some grunting.There are countless new Lego games that are also great, but if you want a simple and old one, this is defiently worth it.

												For several hours I was pretty sure this was the best thing ever. It's just so incredibly charming in the way it presents everything, and absolutely everything is interactive in some way. As you wander through the Star Wars movies in hack and slash/pantomime form, just about all the props and set pieces can be smashed or prodded with character abilities to make something interesting or funny happen and get some sort of reward. It's extremely entertaining to poke everything and see what happens...at least through the prequel levels.Unfortunately, once I got to the original trilogy, the pacing completely fell apart. The levels went from being tightly constructed and bite-sized, which works extremely well with the density of stuff to fiddle with, to fairly long and tedious right when episode four hit. I'm not really sure I have the patience to keep going, which is a shame because when it comes to the movies themselves, I hate the prequels and was really looking forward to the second half of the game being even more amazing than the first half based on that.

												Here is the thing....this is a damn fun game.....I mean really really fun.  However before I sing the praises let me bring up two huge issues for me. One is the A.I. it is utterly inept.  You REALLY REALLY want to play with someone in co-op, as the A.I side kick does NOTHING.  NO help of ANY kind while you fight.  I am sure this is a result of wanting players to use the co-op feature.  An that is my second issue.  This really really is best served as a co-op play.  You will enjoy it far more if you play with a friend, the wife, the hubby, the kids...anyone but the A.I.  Now to recap the great here.  All Star Wars films, the original 4,5,6 and the prequel 1,2, and 3.  All here, all very in depth, insideously cute, and amazingly deep.  The collectable got to get every Lego alone is a 100 to 150 hours alone.  The reply value here is endless..... An for Any fan of Star Wars really needs to sit back, re enter the universe and do not be afraid to smile, and see it Lego style.  Enjoy, I am.			"

												I am a fan of LEGO games in general, it's a nice casual way to play. It doesn't require a lot of thinking though some of the puzzles can be challenging.  I enjoy this game the most I think as LEGO Star Wars II was the first LEGO game I ever played. Many hours of gameplay and for me a lot of replayability. It's not just for kids!! If you enjoy the humor TT is known for then you will enjoy this title as well.			"

												I once said, in another review, that I used to play Lego Indiana Jones with my little brother a lot when I was a kid, but it was difficult because of our lack of skill and faulty hardware at every level. Well, there's a secret backstory for that review, because I'm fairly sure that Lego Star Wars was the first game I ever played, and the conditions and brother were even MORE trying then. The disc and laptop were worse, we were younger and thus worse at games, the shared keyboard was even more compact, and we only ever got to play it on long car rides, where every bump on the road knocked the disc around in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ holder and spawned another game-breaking glitch. Truly a crucible of early gaming.Well, it wasn't the entire thing. The version we had was just Lego Star Wars 2, which was Episodes 4-6 (which happen to be the ones I just completed the story mode for). We didn't get the full package until a couple of years later, when it was one of the two games we got along with our new Wii for Christmas. To justify its existence as 2 games stapled together, it added a few new features, like new bonus levels, a 1v1 mode, and powerups scattered throughout the levels, all of which are fairly pointless. As to the levels themselves, episodes 4-6 are far stronger than episodes 1-3, for what I think are a few reasons: 1, more interesting things happen in the originals; 2, it came out a year later, when all the developers had finally earned their game design degrees; 3 (and this is complete speculation), the devs probably had more love for the originals than for the new ones; and 4, I have more nostalgia for the parts I played first and therefore those parts are better. Shut up, it's true.And as for the game itself? Well, it's not nearly as polished as Lego Indiana Jones (the devs clearly learned more the more games they made, which is a trend I support), but for what it is, it's fantastic. Coming back, not only was I realizing how much fun I was having in just the first level, but I was also experiencing almost crying levels of nostalgia for things that had all come rushing back from almost a decade ago. I remembered that puzzle with the crane! I remembered wanting to be R2-D2 or Captain Antilles! Oh my God! Rebel Friend! I remembered Rebel Friend!Anyway, nostalgic tangents aside, the same rules apply for this as they do for Lego Indiana Jones; everything's either good game design, funny and/or goofy, or probably broken (or John Williams's score). Tell you what, if I ever make a game, I'm going to hire all the animators from Traveler's Tales, because those guys know how to do an incredible amount with very little. Look up the intro cutscene for Episode 6, Stage 5. See how they convey all (or at least most of) the conflict and emotion of the scene in the movie, in the space of about 30 seconds, using absolutely no dialogue, with F*CKING LEGO FIGURES? These people are masters!Also, they managed to nail the vital Stormtrooper balance of adorably bad but taken completely seriously. You should buy the game for just that.P.S. If you think it's just a game for kids, go to the Zero Punctuation for Lego Indiana Jones and listen to what he has to say about kid-oriented vs. family-oriented. This one's family-oriented.P.P.S. Like the Indiana Jones review, I haven't played the whole thing through here but I did when I was younger, and I remember all of it.			"

												BEST GAME IN HISTORY!!!!! I absolutely love everything about this game, and has now started my obsession for collecting other LEGO title. This is still the original and the best LEGO game. I had previously purchased on xbox one and was SO excited to find Steam also had it! -NO DLC! That alone is amazing compared to games nowdays. -I play with an xbox one controller and find it to be easy and smooth to use.- Great if you love achievement farming! - Easy to navigate through to each level and for free play; unlike the newer LEGO games.

 Not the best ever assembled, but creative I cannot tell you enough how much I adore this game. It is so funny to think that LEGO made a Star Wars game - and even better - it works! It totally works, and that's the beauty of it. It is easy to pick up and just as easy to plop it right down again (Yeah, stay right there on the ground!). LEGO Star Wars - The Complete Saga offers a fun and simple experience to enjoy alone or with friends. I had just as fun hacking away with my green LEGO lightsaber alone as I did with my brother. The gameplay mostly consists of building, fighting and figuring out simple but rewarding puzzles, while collecting addictive collectables and new characters from the expansive Star Wars-mythos. I love how these games aren't very hard but still so gosh darn rewarding. It's quite an achievement and I've liked it since I was just a little youngling myself.LEGO Star Wars - The Complete Saga gets a score of8/10 from me. I don't recommend buying it for it's full price, which is quite expensive, but if you manage to pick it up on a sale - trust me, you will have a good time.			"

												Proof that simpler can be better. Great Lego game, great Star Wars game, great game in general. I remember paying $50 a pop for these 2 titles seperately when they came out ~10 years ago, worth every penny, now at $20 for the pair this deal is impossible to pass up. Might even be enjoying this more now than I did when I was 12. 10/10 would slap a droid to death again			"

Yes it's rather easy and                                                                    simple, but to achieve a 100% walkthrough,                                                                   you'll have to be patient and you have to use                                                                the Force. You'll gonna play the sxy episodes six                                                              levels (yes, it's 36) a numerous times. First in story                                                          mode, then in free play too. To get every hidden things                                                     you'll need special characters. To have the special characters                                                 you'll have to play throughout the story and need to collect bricks.                                               I played with this hundreds and hundreds of hours before discovered                                             Steam, and started to collect games. Since then my first priority was to                                           own this amazing game. Others say that you'll gonna die more times then                                       in Dark Souls, because of some control flaws. At first it is true maybe, but don't                                   let that bother you too much. If you love Star Wars and want to play something easy                               and funny (with a friend, boy/girlfriend, or just alone) i recommend you this game. For me                             it is THE video game, and an instant classic, maybe it will be for you too. Try it and decide for                           yourself. It is sale time so it is cheap. Once a Jedi, always a Jedi, or something like that. Peace...			"

												Okay, let me start by saying that I loved the original version of this game on the Wii. My brother, then wife, and now kids all had fun playing with me.But there's a SERIOUS optimization issue with this port. I have solid specs and can run GTAV maxxed out with no issues. I can throw any game on Ultra, with tons of mods if they're available... but no matter what I do, I cannot run this game in 1080p because it randomly lags out due to what I'm assuming are memory leaks.If this game were hurting for ""recommendations"", I'd probably give it a ""Yes"" but this is an extremely annoying issue for me.

												Story: Pros:- Follows the story line from the movies.- Lots of collectables to find after beating the game.- 13+ hours of story and up to 24+ hours of going for all collectables.Cons:- No dialogue.- Jumps through the story's fast.Split Screen:Pros: - Play with one other friend or sibling.- Access to the ""Two player arcade"".Cons:- No online- Not  ""split screen"" both players on one screen, no going opposite directions. Characters:Pros: - 160 induvidual characters from all six of the movies. (obviously no force awakens)- Indiana Jones.- Two fully customizable characters.Cons:- Can't think of a con. lolControls:Pros:-Lightsaber spam is good.Cons:- Not very good controls with keyboard + mouse. (controller recomended.)- Some levels that require you to do some parkour can be difficult.- When you have a large party of characters it can be hard to switch to the right one.Overall:The story mode is great, reliving all the starwars movies excluding force awakens with a lego cosmetic layout. The character sellection is great. If you like starwars and legos this game is a big recomendation. Only try to purchuse when it's on sale don't pay the full $20.7/10 "

												Watch out for that vicious bounty hunter Boba Fett, Luke. Did I ever tell you I fought his dad? He was hired to assassinate a senator me and your father were guarding. We kept bringing her around open windows and public areas in order to draw the would-be assassin out because we knew he had too much pride to just shoot her from long range. He had used his payment to hire another bounty hunter to kill the senator for him while he sent us on a wild bantha chase. Also the 2nd assassin used her payment to buy a robot to assassinate the senator for her. Did I mention the 2nd assassin was a shapeshifter? She could have been a good friend in disguise and just shot the senator for all we knew! Then the robot used its payment to buy poisonous bugs to release into the senator's room while she slept after lasering a hole through the window. It could have just lasered her too after that because we weren't watching her at all, but it already bought the bugs. So we sense the hostile life forms (not the robot) in the room and rush in and save the senator in the nick of time! Then I jumped out the window to chase the robot back to its owner! Luckily it didn't have a self-destruct function. Then we found the 2nd assassin and chased her across the planet, and caught her when she tried to kill us instead of shapeshifting and escaping. But to our surprise, Jango Fett was watching the whole thing instead of going to kill the senator while we were away chasing the bugs chasing the robot chasing the shapeshifter. He shot her with a poisonous dart instead of sniper blaster, and only her instead of shooting all of us or blowing all of us with a rocket or something, then he escaped with his tiny jetpack. Luckily for the senator, my good friend Dexterr Jettster owned a 50s dinner on Courscant that had Republic secrets on the menu along with cheeseburgers and malt shakes. We found the assassin and Mace killed him later, right in front of Boba. He was a good friend.			"

												I originally played this on the GameCube way back in the day. I loved it then and  I love it now. Even though this is just a LEGO game the lightsaber controls are some of the best in any Star Wars game making you truly feel like a jedi. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the vehicle controls which are floaty, unreponsive and stiff. Thankfully though there are very few vehicle levels. The only other minor gripes I have with this game is the occasional frame rate drops and the camera which sometimes has a hard time keeping up, especially in mulitplayer. This is a great casual game that I'd recommend to anyone. I give it an 8/10.			"

												I never played the original LEGO Star Wars games when they first came out. Coming from having played some of the more recent LEGO games (LoTR, Marvel Superheroes), I can definitely see that the games have improved over the years.Compared to the newer games, the easiest way to describe this game is annoying. There's a lot of endlessly respawning enemies in almost every level and not much you can do about them until you get to freeplay.The hub world is cramped with no way to open the character roster to try out the characters you've unlocked without actually freeplaying a mission. Sometimes you can find the character you want wandering around the cantina if you get lucky. In freeplay, you have a tiny subset of your unlocked characters you can bring, of which all but 2 are chosen randomly so you probably won't get to play with your favorite characters.Your AI controlled teammate does ZERO damage to enemies and is at best a distraction since the enemies focus almost exclusively on the player anyways. You're effectively punished for playing solo.The difficulty (until you unlock cheats) is firmly on the side of annoying. The penalty for dying is minimal so it's not really difficult, but it's still not fun to be getting shot at by a dozen different enemies focused exclusively on you, interrupting you left and right and killing you frequently until you do whatever is needed to stop the respawns or move to the next area. On the other hand, the auto deflect cheat with exploding blaster bolts is immensely satisfying once unlocked.Vehicle missions are awful. Controls are terrible, and there's way too much running back and forth through endlessly respawning swarms of enemies to pick up torpedoes or (even worse) tow a bomb to a target.There's a lot more content reuse (game time is padded with an extra challenge mode for each level where you can't use extras) but it still counts towards 100% completion.There's a very annoying bug where the game effectively freezes for a few seconds every once in awhile. This is on a modern PC with dedicated graphics and a SSD.Much of this is forgiveable (except for the bugs) since this is simply a remastered version of the games that started this (mostly) wonderful collection of TellTale LEGO games. The newer games have improved upon these issues, and the newer games with the huge overworlds are surprisingly fun open world games.I can recommend this game based on the humor and for anyone who wants to complete their LEGO game collection, but unless you've got some seriously strong rose colored glasses on the gameplay falls short compared to the newer games.

												I never played the original LEGO Star Wars games when they first came out. Coming from having played some of the more recent LEGO games (LoTR, Marvel Superheroes), I can definitely see that the games have improved over the years.Compared to the newer games, the easiest way to describe this game is annoying. There's a lot of endlessly respawning enemies in almost every level and not much you can do about them until you get to freeplay.The hub world is cramped with no way to open the character roster to try out the characters you've unlocked without actually freeplaying a mission. Sometimes you can find the character you want wandering around the cantina if you get lucky. In freeplay, you have a tiny subset of your unlocked characters you can bring, of which all but 2 are chosen randomly so you probably won't get to play with your favorite characters.Your AI controlled teammate does ZERO damage to enemies and is at best a distraction since the enemies focus almost exclusively on the player anyways. You're effectively punished for playing solo.The difficulty (until you unlock cheats) is firmly on the side of annoying. The penalty for dying is minimal so it's not really difficult, but it's still not fun to be getting shot at by a dozen different enemies focused exclusively on you, interrupting you left and right and killing you frequently until you do whatever is needed to stop the respawns or move to the next area. On the other hand, the auto deflect cheat with exploding blaster bolts is immensely satisfying once unlocked.Vehicle missions are awful. Controls are terrible, and there's way too much running back and forth through endlessly respawning swarms of enemies to pick up torpedoes or (even worse) tow a bomb to a target.There's a lot more content reuse (game time is padded with an extra challenge mode for each level where you can't use extras) but it still counts towards 100% completion.There's a very annoying bug where the game effectively freezes for a few seconds every once in awhile. This is on a modern PC with dedicated graphics and a SSD.Much of this is forgiveable (except for the bugs) since this is simply a remastered version of the games that started this (mostly) wonderful collection of TellTale LEGO games. The newer games have improved upon these issues, and the newer games with the huge overworlds are surprisingly fun open world games.I can recommend this game based on the humor and for anyone who wants to complete their LEGO game collection, but unless you've got some seriously strong rose colored glasses on the gameplay falls short compared to the newer games.

Great game, I definitley reccomind this if your in for some nostalga (especially with the original trilogy half) My only complaints are the game is clearly made to be played with a controller and the main mos eisley area is alot smaller than the one in Lego Star Wars 2, other than that the game is fine.

												Seeing how LEGO Starwars and LEGO Starwars II for the Playstation 2 were one of my more early childhood gaming experiences, I couldn't believe that they combined them both. When I looked into it more, I thought, ""Heck yeah! I could be General Grevious and Boba Fett ANYWHERE!"" so I bought it. Some might be thinking ""what's the point to buying another game that consists of two other games?"" Well, some parts of levels are changes with new mechanics, and there are even more levels you can play (consisting with 6 chapters in Attack of The Clones instead of 5, bounty hunter levels where you go on the hunt for characters throughout the levels, and extra levels which you unlock using the Gold Bricks you have aquired throughout playing.) Yes, I do admit, the game is somewhat slow when you begin it, but once you unlock some stuff, it's a blast. If you are looking for a challenge and only a challenge, these may not be the droids you're looking for. This game is more of a casual, relax time of game consisting of collect-a-thon with combat and exploring elements built in. If you want to get the maximum experience of the game, go for ""True Jedi"" by collecting a certain amount of stud in each level, also find all ten minikits in each level (which requires free-play) find all red-bricks, and do the challenges the game offers you (Blue minikits and speedruns of movie). This game's presentation is absolutely amazing. All of your favorite characters in LEGO, and you get to play as most of them. The cutscenes could use voice acting to improve them, but overall, they are entertaining to watch, and they look very clean. Also, The Prequels are actually tolerable now since you dont have to play as Anakin hating sand, and boring hour-long consle meetings. I am somewhat disappointed that you cant play Anakin's side of the story much in Revenge of the Sith, it would be cool to be the bad guy for a couple levels. But overall this is a very good game I extremeley reccomend it to any Starwars and/or LEGO fan.			"

												I love all of the LEGO games, and this is no exception. I originally had LEGO Star Wars one and two, but they glitched so much I couldn't play them. I saw this on sale and decided to buy it so I could actually play LEGO Star Wars, and I'm so glad I did. It's super fun. Great game if you love Star Wars or LEGO games. The levels for episodes 1-3 seem pretty short, I wish they were longer, but episodes 4-6 are fairly long. I could do without the chanllenge levels, if I didn't want 100% I probably wouldn't do them. The super story levels also seem a bit tideous. Over all a really fun game.			"

LEGO® Star Wars™: The Complete SagaPros:- 120+ characters from all I-VI episodes- 5 fun and amazing levels in each episode through I-VI- Simple game but very fun- Unique levels like the podracing level- Puzzles are fun and simple- Bosses are very cool and unique- Cutscenes are funny and great- Bonus levels from Jabba the Hutt and moreCons:- Keyboard support is garbage, get a controller- Jar Jar Binks :PConclusionIn all seriousness, for me the game doesn't have any cons besides the horrible keyboard support, its a classic, most of the people played it first on Wii or DS and then we played it on PC. I hope LEGO® STAR WARS™: The Force Awakens, gets a lot better and taking notes of this one, definitely one of my favorite games of all time.			"

												This is a very cute, fun game that is best played with 2 people. It does outline the stories of the first 6 films, but there's a whole bunch of other content in there (unlockable characters, vehicles etc.) that can be used in Free Play mode (play as anyone you like) or Challenge Mode (for you serial game clockers who need to have 100% completion). The controls are intuitive and despite the fact there's no dialogue, you know what to do during missions. ****			"

												The game overall is good. But there's a bunch of problems that are making me think that I've wasted my ♥♥♥♥ing money buying this.1. Friendly Ai's don't do ANY sort of damage to the Enemy Ai.I've had this stupid thing happen to me all the time. The worst incident was on the death star and the Hoth mission. I had to build something to get to the next part of the level, but it was extremelly hard due to the fact that the AI's can't do ANY sort of damage towards the Hostile Ai's. It took me a total of 2 or something hours just to get through the Death Star mission, just because of that.2. You stop building when you get shot.This is quite annoying, when you have to build something and there's a bunch of guys shooting at you, the AIs you are set with cannot do any damage and cannot protect you. If you're shot while building, you'd have to start all over again.There's many more problems, but I cannot be bothered to list them all. These are all of the problems I have ran into as of right now. I would reccomend this game, although the problems  are fairly annoying.			"

												A wonderful nostalgic experience, great for playing with little ones, friends and family to create even more nostalgical memories in the years ahead! And a fun, interactive experience to introduce people of all ages into the Star Wars saga/universe.  ^-^The missions can get very tedious at times, especially if playing alone. So let's hope you have friends (which aren't on the internet).It also accomodates controller support, and Co-op can be played with both, 1 or 2 keyboard(s), with different assigned keys. And it's lego, cmon! It's pawesome. *Gives the pawesome stamp of validation* ^_^			"

												This game was my childhood. I'm biased of course, but I think this is a really great game whether you have nostalgia for it or not. For me, now I'm able to relive those blessed afternoons playing this on the WII- ""Let me be Darth Vader!"" ""Stop throwing bombs at me!"" ""GO FASTER SEBULBAS GETTING AWAY""It's a lot easier than I remember it- when I played this as a kid I paid a friend to beat Mustafar for me (he couldnt but still took my money). Now each level is pretty much 20-30 minutes on story mode. The game isnt really a challenge (aside from the bonus levels that ravaged my village when i was a child). I mean, it's sometimes tricky to get the minikits but never infuriating. There are some parts that feel very dated (I'm looking at that cutscene of the Slave 1 ""taking off"" on Kamino), but in an odd way the small bad parts are endearing. Let's just say you can tell it's aged, but it aged with dignity.Bugwise, it's pretty clean. Good port. The only issues I have are the dumbass controls for p2 (if you don't have a controller) and the friendly AI not dealing damage. That's something I don't remember from back in the day, I remember relying on them to pick off stragglers? Also droidekas are overpowered as hell and it's BS to die twice doing the only lightsaber move that kills them, and also BS because you're basically invincible when you play with them.Word from the wise, on the Hoth Ice base level with Han and Leia there's a part with a bunch of fans and a little truck that's practically impossible without P2 controlling C3P0, which means you either need to get a friend or grow another arm. That's actually the only gameplay issue I've seen, and I remember it infuriating the hell out of young me.			"

												I am at a loss for words with this game. I am literally speechless. This is THE perfect game. With its fun and memorable levels, tons of different characters, bonus content, hilarious hijinx, and the ability to play as LEGO minifigures, how can you go wrong. I actually own both of the previous installments that make up this game(Lego Star Wars) and (Lego Star Wars 2 The Origional Trilogy), and yet I knew I still wanted this game just to see everything collide. This game built up my expectations and knocked them completely out of the park. One of the key factors of this game that I don't think other lego games of our time have are the fun, and not to be redundant but, memorable levels, characters, and events that all can be linked to the origional source material. Traveler's Tales really outdid itself with the creation of this game. As an ENORMOUS Star Wars enthusiest, it makes me feel so glad how much effort and tlc was put into this game unlike others who purchase the rights merely to sell basic games just under the name of ""Star Wars"". This is one of the only games I actually reccomend to all people for its amazingly fun and sometimes addicting gameplay and its intensly immersive experience. I of course, give this game a ten out of ten for its sheer creativity, fun loving characters, truity to the films, immersive environents, mesmerizing mechanichs, and most importantly, its impact on how I see the art of Gaming.

												Please God, let me meet her. All I want to is to find that perfect girl I know exists. She’s sweet and shy and my age and likes all the things I do, perhaps even is on this site itself. The girl who won’t secretly think I’m a loser, the girl I can cuddle with (even if only possible online) and spent nights talking to and laughing and sharing happiness. Someone who can reciprocate the love I put in, the girl who I can make feel safe and secure unconditionally and can fill this gaping, empty void in my heart. Please, just let me find this person. I’ll change everything about me if that’s what it takes Please, I just can’t take the loneliness anymore.			"

												Played this on PS2 and Wii originally, this is a blatant port. Cant even use a mouse. That said, its still a decent game, pretty fun and a lot of content if you like completionism. However, sometimes it feels like the game is based around the collecting more than the actual game. So much of it assumes youll go back and replay all the levels. If its in a star wars bundle, maybe its worth it. Otherwise there are better games out there.			"

												You can't change keybord bindings to something more comfortable.It is 2-player 1-keyboard type game with no way to make the ""second"" player an NPC... meaning if you don't move both with the camera, the camera doesn't move.No way to get out of bar / other area with the only hints being you need to collect 160 gold bricks and episode 2 or 4 coming up at the force-field... Car is useless... etc etc etc...There is no way to set the game into windowed mode, but it does support most resolutions which is a surprise...It did detect my joystick in the controller section but it didn't detect the wheel and there is no way to use more than 1 device at a time. Additionally, I was unable to set any binds on the joystick, or the keyboard making the detection useless...			"

												LEGO Star Wars: Prepare to Die (and again and again) Edition. TL; DR – If you are in doubt which Lego Star Wars game to buy, buy The Clone Wars. It‘s shorter (18 vs 36 story levels) but vastly superior game.I am huge Lego and Star Wars fan. This game is a big disappointment and very frustrating. I will talk about NEGATIVES.1) Driving and flying is f.cking dogs.it! You read it right. There is no difference between gamepad and keyboard controls. Both are utterly terrible and almost broken. I hated every mission with it.2) Who the f.ck thought that putting unskipable videos is great design?! Watching the same scene again and again… The main problem is some of them are just too long and you can‘t skip it. If you Alt-Tab it just pause and continues when you come back. 3) This game is ment to be played in co-op mode! Single player experience is terrible and very frustrating in the some half of missions. Let me explain. Your co-op AI is just useless and brain dead. They can only help you when you both need to push lever or jump on platforms to move. Full stop. Yes, they suck up blasters, but they can‘t kill anybody and they aren‘t even that good at sucking up blasters because you are going to die a lot. Again, a lot of dying. You want to construct something from blocks? Too bad you just died from blasters. ""But just kill enemies."" No you can‘t if they are on another platform and they just spawn again even when you kill them. Beyond terrible. That‘s why you need real co-op partner to shield you so you can do stuff.This game is aimed to children and yet you constantly die! It‘s very hard to collect studs for True Jedi because when you die you lose them. F.ck you from the bottom of my heart!OK I get it, in the past Lego games mostly sold in Nintendo systems, so it‘s logical that father and son played co-op, but please, this disaster could be mitigated if co-op AI wasn‘t passive! And guess what, co-op AI in Batman The Videogame is not passive.4) I really don‘t like Ep I-III movies, and yet in game those episodes are vastly superior gameplay wise. I even replayed them for additional mini kits. There are no words which can describe how much I hated most of missions in Ep V and especially VI! I replayed none of EP V and VI missions.There are positives: 1) humor is absolutely fantastic (see my screenshots) and2) music is great but what SW game doesn‘t have it?All in all, bad game :-/.EDIT Fanboy brigade downvoting like cra.y and yet nobody challenged facts.

												I'm sure the game is cool. Unfortunately, (perhaps because I misunderstood since I've never touched a console game in my life), the local co-op means that ya can only play it with someone, as long as ya do it in the same computer. What I was expecting, was two systems on the local network.Never going to touch this game in single player, so.tl;dr: might be a good game, but the unclear description made me buy a game with mechanics I hate,			"

												I only suggest buying this game if you are a hardcore Star Wars fan, otherwise buy an other lego game. Maybe it was pretty good back in the days, but now its nothing compared to the newer lego games. First off, you can skip trough the levels like its nothing. Second off, the story goes so fast, you barely know whats happening. And third off, the graphics are really bad.It also did not feel like I was Luke, it felt like I was a plastic figure with a bad lightsaber. Something I haven't felt in any other game.			"

												First I gotta say, this is actually a very funny game. Childhood memories 'n stuff from the old PS2 days, funny gameplay, lots of characters, Controller support. The reason I am still not recommending this game is the following: The local Co-op sucks. Seriously. It is not possibly to freely move around the area, the camera is even worse than the one from Devil may cry. You and your Co-op partner can't just go wherever you want with a proper split screen. No, the screen doesn't split at all. Sometimes you are even being forced to move with your partner without actually pressing a button. We fell off cliffs several times, just because we were standing a few meters too far apart from each other. So yeah, anyway,Funny game, funny Single-player, but the local Co-op is a joke. If you are not going to play this in Local Co-op, well - ignore my review, get the game, have fun			"

												Cut-n-copy from my review of Lego Marvel Avengers as this game has the same issues:(-----------------------If you like the Lego gamescape you'll like this title.  I highly recommend getting a game controller for the PC version as the keyboard setup is cumbersome to say the least.  And there is NO advantage in buying thise title if you own the console version!At first I was happy to see ""Local COOP"", as in other games (not Lego) Local COOP had usually meant LAN-locked connectivity.  However, disappointment reigned as my son and I discovered ""Local COOP"" really means, shared keyboard or multiple game controllers used on ONE computer.Had high hopes we could play drop-in-style as a family or with friends using either our laptops or desktops wherever we were comfortable at home or away:(  So, I'm rating this a thumbs down on that one hangup as otherwise I'd have saved the cost of buying multiple copies and just stayed with the console version.

												I absolutely LOVED lego star wars games as a kid. I have fond memories of playing them on the PS2 when I was younger.Going back to them now after roughly 7-10 years though, they are sadly nowhere near as good as I remembered them being as a kid.My main problem is with Disney, who owns the rights to the Lego Star Wars games. They are total money-grabbing jerks whose business practices I daresay are even worse than Rockstar Studios (we all ""fondly"" remember the sale scams Rockstar did the past few steam sales, where they jacked up the base price of GTA5 so that the ""sale"" price would be no different from the normal price). This game hasn't gone on sale in YEARS and there is no sign that DIsney has any plans on selling this fairly. Now if this was a brand-new Lego game with cutting-edge graphics, really good gameplay and a long storyline, i'd definitely say the selling price is fair, but there is absolutely NO justification for selling this 10-year-old game for 20 freaking dollars. It's a total ripoff.Now that I've got that off my chest, let's move on to the pros and cons of the game.PROSLiterally hundreds of different Star Wars characters to play asClassic Lego feelEnvironments are quite interactiveCombines the 1st and 2nd Lego Star Wars games into 1.CONSGraphical quality has deteriorated significantly over the years. The Prequel Episode levels are virtually unchanged from how they were back in 2005. The PlayStation 2 graphics are real.No online MultiplayerGame is specifically designed for young children. The gameplay is just so uninteresting if you're an older person like me that it's almost impossible to stand playing this for longer than a dozen hours or so.The game dogmatically insists you play in Co-Op mode, as the AI for the secondary player is god-awful to have to complete levels with alone (they dont do jack to help you out in combat, and just sit there letting themselves get shot at).Poorly-designed flight/racing levels have incredibly frustrating gameplay, with constant running back and forth and constant dying (especially on the Geonosis gunship combat level).The camera system the game uses is god-awful for telling what you're doing. It's incredibly easy to misjudge jumps and where your position is when platforming. Also it makes it really hard to see what you want or need to see in the environment around you.Flight controls for the racing/flight levels are god-awful. Making sharp turns when you need to fly over a specific object (eg. money, torpedo stockpiles) is practically impossible as the game instead just makes you do a sharp, huge 180 flip and go in the opposite direction. It's awful for maneuvering in tight spaces, and since colliding with the walls does damage, it makes unintentionally dying a massive issue. It can also undesirably launch you into the path of dangerous weapons fire when you just wanted to turn, which is also very bad. I can't count how many times I died due to this god-awful flight control system on the Geonosis map, or on the Coruscant Speeder Chase map.Gameplay becomes extremely repetitive and uninteresting from the very start. 90% of your time playing on levels is just spent running around destroying or messing with stuff to get more money/studs, and then running around in a frenzy trying to pick up as many studs as you can before they abruptly disappear.No real worthwhile objective to work toward in the game except getting more money and more lego characters. No meaningful or interesting story to want to complete, as it's all the same repetitive crap every map and every level, with constant unwarranted deaths in a mad scramble for getting as much studs as you can.The awesome Lego City map from Lego Star Wars 2 has been basically chopped in half with the most interesting parts taken out, and that's the Lego City map on this game. It absolutely sucks. They got rid of the boat and the lake (my favorite part), as well as some other fun buildings and locations.All in all, this game was perhaps fun to play back 7 or 8 years ago but it has since lost a lot of its replay value, and will easily come across as boring and bland to anyone above the age of 12. I'd only recommend buying this if you have a super bad case of nostalgia (but even then I guarantee you will be disappointed when you play this).			"

												By far the worst LEGO game I've played so far. First of all I noticed that there are no voice acting whatsoever, which confuses me since TT games apparently got a license to do these games but couldn't get a licence for the voices (for example in LEGO Lord of the Rings and LEGO The Hobbit).Second the controls when playing as a LEGO man is good but if you're in a flying vehicle then it's just frustrating hard and third but not least the boss battles are nothing but annoying.Luckily I got this game dirtcheap on a Steam sale, otherwise I would've been really annoyed.

												utter garbage. blatantly the beginner to the lego series. every mechanic is designed to needlesly take up as much as possible. the lego series has improved overtime but this is a definite skip. about 6 hours of gameplay with very light humor, with about 20 hours of grinding for no reward.

I was so excited when the full saga came out. This game is too much fun and it brings happiness to me for my old childhood. Definitely pick this up. It's still worth the 20 bucks, hopefully the price will go down but I doubt it unless there's a sale.			"

												Joyous fun, suited to fans of the Star Wars universe of all ages. Runs smoothly on most dated machines, but doesn't allow a terribly large amount of graphical adjustments, so if your compute is on the lower side of the bell curve, it's unlikely that you can adjust the settings to a point where it will be found more agreeable. All in all, delightful in design, gameplay, graphics, and representation of a beloved universe.			"

If you can get the Complete Saga for a good price and you're on the fence, go ahead and grab this.  Don't expect amazing combat, but a fun journey through a creatively designed, tongue-in-cheek and surprisingly lengthy game world.			"

												LEGO Star Wars is a classic video game for me. It was one of the first games I was actually excited for. I bought it at a Wal-Mart in Florida back in 2005 for the Game Boy Advance. It wasn't until 2007, till I played the full game. The GBA version and console versions were completely different. I bought The Complete Saga upon release in 2007 at my local blockbuster for the Wii. This game is awesome. It lets you experience the Star Wars films in a whole new way.			"

												Do I even need a review? This game is a classic and is obviously one of the best things LEGO has ever done. This game created the very milestone of the LEGO Games Collection (Besides the first two installments). The only thing I would like to see is an updated version. Not so much to where it would ruin the game, but to where it can advance. Such as punching, targetting, a larger open world, and maybe even just adding in voice clips to the cut scenes like the newer ones today. That would be pretty cool too. Anyways, if you like LEGO and/or STAR WARS then you either have this game, or you're buying it right now.			"

The gameplay is very simple, maybe you have to get used to it a little bit, but you can change any control option ou want. The game tells the story of the two Star Wars trilogies in a funny way, and the levels are beautiful. I would definitely recommend this game if you have seen, or are planning to see the Star Wars movies. There's a ton of 'inside jokes' in the game, and it's overall a fun experience to play through the Star Wars saga in Lego style.			"

												I have previously sung the praises of the LEGO games and this goes right back to where it started. It already has the key ingredients of the success of the later games. It has the silly retelling of the story. It has the varied character abilities that allow you to replay each level and find hidden stuff. It has the mini-kits to collect, the red bricks that unlock new abilities. It has the bonus levels and the 2 player cooperative focused gameplay. All of this is great.However it really isn’t as polished as the later games. It does not have split screen so your two characters are awkwardly, invisibly tethered together making the cooperative mode very frustrating. And conversely there are a few sections of the game which didn’t work well when playing on your own as your AI partner gets stuck or refuses to do what is necessary. Character switching is annoying as you have to be right next to the character you want to switch to and the ship controls are rubbish.My main complaint is just how many times you have to repeat levels. You play through the level in the story and then again in free play with any characters which is fine. However the game then makes you play the level again to find a new set of canisters against the clock and then again to play all the levels in a film in one go against the clock. So if you complete each level perfectly first time you have to repeat every level 4 times but if you play without consulting a walk through you are likely going to have to play each level 7 or 8 times. Also once you have bought all the bounty hunters there unlocks a bunch of Jabba the Hut missions that, yes you guessed it, involve you playing through sections of most of the levels again. This is the first time I have failed to 100% complete a LEGO game because after spending an hour grinding my way through the entirety of Empire Strikes Back and just failing to complete it within the time limit, I just thought ♥♥♥♥ this I have better things to do. Overall this established the massively successful formula that paid off in later games but as far as this game goes in its own right it is disappointing. I’d only really recommend this if you are a big Star Wars fan. Maybe if you have never played any other LEGO games then you would enjoy this more, then you can play other ones and see the improvement.			"

												C'mon. It's LEGO, and it's Star Wars. You combine the two together, and you have an amazingly fun and successful video game that's worth playing a thousand times over again. The Complete Saga version just makes it even better, allowing you to play through all six Star Wars movies, create your own LEGO character, and have a blast doing it all.This game's great. Play it, and if you've already played it, go play it again.			"

The ProsThis gem has lasted 10 solid years, providing a memorable spitscreen, pick-up-and-play approach that makes it fun to play with others.  The story mode itself has brief, adapted cutscenes from the actual films that make me feel warm inside.  Combine that with a vast array of characters, unlockable (not downloadable) content, quality sound, and a lovable asthetic; and you've got a solid 20 hour experience that will stick with you for a while.The ConsI said it's a gem, but even gems get dirty.  While it shines in sheer quantity of gameplay and multiplayer, the game has a few other problems.  It feels slightly dated, even though it's very similar graphically to any other recent LEGO release.  As someone no longer in elementary/middle school, the controls feel a little clunky, the combat overly-simplified, camera angles frusterating, and overall experience underwhelming.  I loved piloting the X-wing on the surface of the LEGO Death Star, but had no clue what I was really doing and just held down the fire button.My VerdictThough it pales in comparison to other games (Like Marvel Super Heroes) by simply feeling dated, I genuinely believe that it's a game that everyone deserves to experience.  Grab it when it's on sale, a friend, and play for a few hours to feel like that 6th-grade stud hoarder everyone is inside.  Instructions not included.7.5/10 "

												Relive your childhood here through this game.  Used to love it as a kid, idolizing every single minifigure character.  This is still the best Lego video game out there.  It's just so much simpler this way.  All the others are way too advanced, too many controls and in-game chores.  This is Lego Star Wars at its best.			"

												A long trip on the nostalgia-train. I remembered a lot of levels and secrets from my childhood, and even now, it's still a lot of fun to play. The gameplay is very simple, maybe you have to get used to it a little bit, but you can change any control option ou want. The game tells the story of the two Star Wars trilogies in a funny way, and the levels are beautiful. I would definitely recommend this game if you have seen, or are planning to see the Star Wars movies. There's a ton of 'inside jokes' in the game, and it's overall a fun experience to play through the Star Wars saga in Lego style.			"

												Where it all started. LEGO® games really picked up when the first game, covering the original trilogy, came out, and from there on, none missed the beat. The second game, covering the prequels was incredibly fun, if frustrating. Gameplay is now concidered basic, but it isn't so basic as to make this boring, leaving a serie of levels that brim with the kind of magic we've learned to love. Humor at every turn fills the cutscenes, the secrets are well hidden, collectibles aplenty, characters out the wazoo.Recommended for: Fans of the LEGO® games that want to experience the origin of it all, fans of Star Wars® games.

												My short reveiw may not mean a whole lot since I haven't really played the game all that much, but, I will go ahead and say that I have really enjoyed this game so far. If you like the other lego series games then you will almost certainly enjoy this one. It's not as good as The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings games (in my opinion) but it's still really enjoyable. It's nice to have levels with some of the vehicles in it and be able to have the ship battles. My biggest complaint out of the entire game would have to be the lightsaber combat. It feels really slow and clunky. Not really sure what could be done to change that but that part gets kind of annoying every once in a while. Other than that, I think the game is excellent.			"

												When I was young, we got Lego Star Wars on PS2 and I loved it. It was kind of my introduction into the Star Wars universe, to be honest. I preferred the first one simply because I was more familiar with the prequels at the time (ew, I know), and I'll always miss the original Lego Star Wars hub, Dexter's Diner.Anyway,The Complete Saga is a wonderful combination of the (first) two Lego Star Wars games. It adds Red Bricks to the original prequel levels, new characters etc, you know the drill, you read the product description. It essentially acts as a PC port / HD remake for the best games in the Lego video games franchise, and you should absolutely buy it whether you played it in the past or not. If you miss the platformer days of the PS2 era - that is to say, collectibles, fun combat, the occassional puzzle, unlockable characters, no rubbish DLC - this is the game for you.It pretty much never goes on sale, but I'd say it's worth £15.Also, you can create your own C3PO with a droid head and Sith powers, so that's pretty rad.

You can play co-op with someone (not online thankfully) and have the time of your life as Traveller's Tales successfully manages to blend the joy of Lego and the entire Star Wars movies into a hilarious game. The presentation is top stuff and the brief cutscenes have great delivery and humour which will leave you chuckling. Bring out your inner child and don't expect some crazy supah dupah stuff. Buy this game for fun and it will deliver. Replayability... oh gawd, now that will take you most likely hundreds of hours. There is so much packed into this game and so many goodies to find that you'll be foaming at the mouth at all the collectables. So what are you waiting for? Want fun? Buy this game!			"

												Its often hard to recommend a game without any negatives (only one, and yet its minor enough to barely mention it), and yet.. Lego Star Wars does just that. A childhood summoned up through all the movies, all the characters and more -- this game hits the nail on the head for exctiment, gameplay value, and especially replayability. 50+ playable characters from Vader, Yoda, to a Droideka. Many famous levels such as Hoth, Deathstar, etc. I cannot recommend this enough. The amount of hours you will put in, going back, doing a new area with a new character is just staggering. The story has qurky humorous moments that genuinly made me chuckle and many secerts that were a blast messing with. Overall, a very, very, amazing game.Pros+Extreme replayabilty+Travel across many famous locations in the star wars universe+A TON of characters to play as (50-100?)+""extras"" earned let you cheat alittle or make the game easier. Great for kids+Nice moments of humorNegatives-Odd keyboard controls (No Mouse support ingame)			"

												This game's crisp, clean graphics have aged wonderfully and depending on how OCD you are (completionist or not) this game can actually be pretty hard.  The charming, nostalgia-inducing environments and music make this game a gem for lifelong Star Wars fans like me.  If you can get the Complete Saga for a good price and you're on the fence, go ahead and grab this.  Don't expect amazing combat, but a fun journey through a creatively designed, tongue-in-cheek and surprisingly lengthy game world.			"

												LEGO Star Wars is a fun game, probably best for younger players.  There's lots of stuff to blow up.  It can get a little frustrating at times, but you can usually figure the puzzle out just by googling it.  This game, unlike most of the other Lego games, is practically impossible to reach 100% completion on.  So if you are a big-time completionist, this game may drive you insane.			"

												Joyous fun, suited to fans of the Star Wars universe of all ages. Runs smoothly on most dated machines, but doesn't allow a terribly large amount of graphical adjustments, so if your compute is on the lower side of the bell curve, it's unlikely that you can adjust the settings to a point where it will be found more agreeable. All in all, delightful in design, gameplay, graphics, and representation of a beloved universe.			"

												I used to play this game after school at a friend's place, and I mainly bought this game for nostalgia's sake. This is one of the 'classic' lego games out there, from the time where the characters would only hum, instead of actually speaking, which gives it a very distinct look and feel.The local co-op is a lot of fun to play (with controller support, for those interested). It'd have totally rocked if it also offered online co-op, but at the time this was released, online multiplayer in such games was not yet such a common feature, and it's of course a lot more fun to use the force on your buddy's character and then laugh at him right next to you ;)I'd recommend this game to anyone that's at least a bit into Star Wars, and is looking for a fun game to casually play. It's family friendly (3+), so playing it with your brother/sister won't be a problem. Just buy it. It's awesome!			"

												I took a trip back to my childhood with this game and I gotta say: playing through both LEGO Star Wars games in one collection is pretty neat. I still remember the novelty of battling across the stars with my friends as we discovered the secrets of Free Play mode in every level. Tt Games really nailed replayability in these games, encouraging players to return to previously inaccessible areas of a level by using unlockable heroes with their special abilities. One thing has to be said about the original LEGO Star Wars, though: it hasn't held up especially well. I found the sequel to be the much more enjoyable and memorable of the two thanks to its clever level design and quirky humor. The first game is noticably slower paced and lacks the visually gags that add so much to its sequel. Regardless, it was nice to take a trip down memory lane and remind myself what all successive LEGO franchise games built themselves upon.It's really hard to say no to a package that packs in so much content. Hundreds of iconic Star Wars characters and tons of replayability keep me coming back for more from the galaxy far, far, away.			"

												This game is one of my favourite games, having played it as a kid for hundreds of hours, so i might not be completely unbiased, but man, this game. It takes you through all the original 6 star wars movies in a very unique lego-y way, with each episode/film split into six parts; every part is one level, taking approximately 20+ mins to complete. The main storyline takes about 20 hours or so to complete, and is fairly simple (apart from some details you might miss about what you have to do). But the game does not just hand everything to you. To get really OP, you need to replay levels and discover every little detail and corner you could not explore with the story mode team, basically just completionism. This is completely optional though, so don't freak out. There's just so much to this game. From the amazing music with the original soundtracks, to the small little details like lando kissing leia's hand when pressing the action button, to the cheesy lego humor, to the big variety of characters to unlock, to the overall star wars-feeling overall; this game is simply a joy to play. (I found airship levels to be particularly enjoyable, with an amazing feeling to them) Admitted, combat is kind of lame, and the graphics aren't fantastic due to the fact that it is a 10 years old lego game, but the game is still enjoyable. The last complaint I have about it is that money is annoying to pick up sometimes. That's it. For a ten year old game, that's not that bad i would say, so go buy it.Tl;dr version:+game has loads of unlockables and secrets +great music+airship levels are great+option to play hard or even extremely hard levels, but easily playable normal levels+a sh** ton of small details that make the game so much better+easy playability; even a brick could handle this game-Graphics are not always the best-combat is fairly easy-money is annoying to collectStraight 8.5/10			"

												Lego Star Wars is a game I consider a classic from my childhood and the Star Wars VII hype got me to pick up this game in the Winter sale (Damn you marketing tactics!). This doesn't mean I think it's one of the best games I ever played as a kid but it's one I have very fond memories of and pretty much anyone I talk to about it has played it at some point. It's that perfect blend of co-op, collectathon, movie tie-in that's just great to play when I'm not feeling something very intense and just want to relax. The game is most certainly flawed, the artificial difficulty and lack of any complex combat is the one of the big complaints; I never felt challenged playing this game but I also died a lot because the game throws enemies at you non stop and while they only take one hit to kill avoiding all the blaster bolts can prove annoying if you aren't a character with auto dodge. This really slows down the game and while I don't expect the most from the combat every lightsaber battle was jump attack, jump attack, jump attack ect. It's impossible to hit someone while they're blocking with anything other than the air attacks which are undodgeable by the AI if you're in range. I know this is a kids game and not meant to be challenging but after a while even kids would find this tedious at best.The lack of online co-op is my biggest grind with this game. At first I thought it was an issue with it being such an old game that relies on single screen co-op but after checking other Lego games I realized that it was nothing more than a trend of laziness. I did manage to take my laptop to a friend's and play it with them and it was great fun except that save files are harder than needs be to locate and impossible to get working on a separate machine to the one it came from meaning we had to start a fresh with none of the cool characters I'd unlocked. Besides some of the vehicle levels being a bit lackluster and Superstory being total BS and a lazy way to recycle content these are my only real complaints with the game so from here on out it's all positive. The Lego formula has practically been perfected now but that doesn't mean it wasn't always great. Star Wars has so much charm in its cutscenes and is very humoresque due to it's recognizable and lovable characters acting out the Star Wars story in a silly and joking way. There is so much to do in this game and so much to find. While some levels practically hand you the collectibles some can prove a real challenge to find, but if your smart you can aim to collect the stud multipliers and minikit/red brick detector red bricks giving you a hint on in which direction there is a collectible. There's also some extra game modes in the complete saga that add that make 100%ing this game a real journey as you try collect all the gold bricks.One of the best things about Lego Star Wars is that it's well, Star Wars. Playing all your favourite Jedi battle it out on all those great planets from the Star Wars universe is immensely entertaining and even more fun in Lego. I would enjoy this game even if it wasn't Star Wars but the real heart and charm of the game comes from seeing your favorite scenes re-acted in Lego form. There were dull moments while playing this game but I thoroughly enjoyed it and I felt both a sense of fulfillment and emptiness once I reached 100% which shows just how great this game is. May the force be with you all.			"

												Its often hard to recommend a game without any negatives (only one, and yet its minor enough to barely mention it), and yet.. Lego Star Wars does just that. A childhood summoned up through all the movies, all the characters and more -- this game hits the nail on the head for exctiment, gameplay value, and especially replayability. 50+ playable characters from Vader, Yoda, to a Droideka. Many famous levels such as Hoth, Deathstar, etc. I cannot recommend this enough. The amount of hours you will put in, going back, doing a new area with a new character is just staggering. The story has qurky humorous moments that genuinly made me chuckle and many secerts that were a blast messing with. Overall, a very, very, amazing game.Pros+Extreme replayabilty+Travel across many famous locations in the star wars universe+A TON of characters to play as (50-100?)+""extras"" earned let you cheat alittle or make the game easier.

												There are two things I do not understand:Why people say that keyboard controls suck when they're changeable.ANDWhy people think that you need the mouse on this game.The game only uses six buttons other than for movement. Two of these are only useful in Free Play and are never needed urgently.One hand can cover movement and two buttons. That leaves two fingers on your other hand that have to be somewhere on the keyboard. The other two that you never need quickly could be put right near them so you can use a third finger and then MOVE one of the others to press the other button should you need it. Or use all four fingers, whichever is easier.Seriously though, it's a game with incredibly simple controls and so very straightforward, you don't need a mouse or controller to play this game and enjoy it. It sits alongside LEGO Indy 1 and LEGO Batman as the Golden Trio of LEGO games before they started adding the horror that is voice acting in a series that prided itself on mimed slapstick retellings of famous stories. (Or mimed slapstick tellings of original stories starring Batman).Nominated for ""The Test of Time"" award.			"

What if we told you we'd rolled both of those games into one single package with even more bonus features then great. You should really think about picking this one up if you like LEGO and Star Wars. It has Co-op so if a friend comes over there's always something for you to do and it's LEGO what more should I say.			"

The graphics are good, the level are engaging, and the character swapping keeps things interesting. I'm not too keen on playing each and every single level three times just get to the %100 mark; twice on each level is enouch to retry each game to improve on your last performance. Overall, very fun.			"

												If you have never had the privilage to play lego star wars the complete saga, you are missing out. Lego games are great games but, their only problem is that with every new game, their formula is reused so it's like playing the same game but re-skinned and with a new name. This being one of the original ones, is just truly amazing.It takes you through all 6 original episodes of star wars with a lego touch. It is truly fun. I have played the lego star wars games since 2006 and they are still fun. I do find that episodes 1 and 2 are kinda dry with their level design (NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE PREQUEL LEVELS) but episodes 3 and on are really fun. I think my favourite level was actually the first level in episode 3, Battle over Coruscant. I just found it very epic.			"

												I originally had the Lego Star Wars the Video Game on my GameCube. It was part of my childhood. Unfortunately, I never bought the Original Saga of Lego Star Wars. This thing has them both, with a bunch of connecting details. Instead of two separate games in one bundle, they are truly combined into just one game. For example, you have to be a Stormtrooper to access areas in Episode I, II, and III. It's a joy to be able to purchase this beauty on Steam and play it with a controller. The ability to relive some of my childhood memories with a boost in the graphic quaility is amazing! I always played Lego Star Wars on older TVs, so it feels odd to see it with a 1080p resolution and higher framerate. If you want to play a Star Wars game that has a TON of content and replayability, this is certainly a viable option.There is nothing serious about it! It really is just a playground of Star Wars fun.

												I took a trip back to my childhood with this game and I gotta say: playing through both LEGO Star Wars games in one collection is pretty neat. I still remember the novelty of battling across the stars with my friends as we discovered the secrets of Free Play mode in every level. Tt Games really nailed replayability in these games, encouraging players to return to previously inaccessible areas of a level by using unlockable heroes with their special abilities. One thing has to be said about the original LEGO Star Wars, though: it hasn't held up especially well. I found the sequel to be the much more enjoyable and memorable of the two thanks to its clever level design and quirky humor. The first game is noticably slower paced and lacks the visually gags that add so much to its sequel. Regardless, it was nice to take a trip down memory lane and remind myself what all successive LEGO franchise games built themselves upon.It's really hard to say no to a package that packs in so much content. Hundreds of iconic Star Wars characters and tons of replayability keep me coming back for more from the galaxy far, far, away.			"

												LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga was one of the first video games in the LEGO franchise I played and which made me come back and play more LEGO games and now this title again. That being said, I find 60% of the time I spent on the 2007 title I was hard-pressed not to put the game for good. Controls and scripting have improved so much with later games that it is just a hassle to deal with their state in this game. Plus, I don't understand how over a decade after games came to PCs there are still unskippable cutscene.Recommendation: I started to play this game because it's a LEGO game and kept at it because I like to 100% a game. If you think, that description fits you as well and you are prepared for some discouraging game design, I'd say, go get the game. Same if you think you're satisfied with only going through the story missions once - this was quite fun. Otherwise you may just want to get a newer LEGO game. They are objectively better.+ LEGO game+ The Star Wars saga retold+ Loads of characters from the Star Wars universe (+1 extra)+ Lots of levels- Outdated controls- Immaturely scripted ""player 2""- Immature camera / point of view- Flying missions include long and unnerving sounds- Unskippable cutscenes- I repeat, unskippable cutscenes- Reward collection policiesBrace yourself. What follows is as much a review as a rant, read as psycho hygiene, and thus may transport negative feelings.Why ""60% of the time""? Well, it took me about 40% to get through the story mode, the rest of the time was spent bringing the savegame to 100%.The game has an in-built requirement for replaying levels if you want to get to 100%. AFAIR each story level, and there are many, requires the completionist to play it at least four times. There are quite a few levels outside the story, a welcome diversion. Replaying levels, of course, also restarts the connected cutscenes. Of those you can skip the very first story cutscene, which is directly followed by another cutscene you cannot skip. Throughout each level you'll encounter more transitional cutscenes - none of which are skippable. I actually want to follow the story of a game so I'm cool with games requiring you to stick through cutscenes. Still I would strongly advocate to make every piece of a game that takes up time but doesn't provide game play to be skippable at the player's discretion. The game already got the player's money and shouldn't unnecessarily commandeer the player's time. I had times when the game actually felt like a boring chore.The controls are somewhat outdated. When running into a ""steep"" inclination you usually cannot jump. This is right away irritating because it takes away the functionality of one of the main buttons without apparent explanation. I guess, it's because you're supposed to slide on steep inclinations - a nicer device to limit levels than invisible walls (which are also in the game) - and at the bottom you're sort of halfway on the inclination. There are some places where you can slide into stuff in a way that makes it very hard to slide around them which is nevertheless the only option - except for quitting - since you cannot jump at the time.Stairs are usually a device to ease ascent, in this game they often fail to do so. You're often better off just jumping up stairs. In case they are winding you'll notice that the game is a bit lacking in providing a sense of depth. Although the camera is not too close to the ground most of the time, the camera often jumps between certain pretty fix position, then swivels. This in combination with upwards movement can lead to unfortunate angles.When playing in ""free play"" you can effectively choose two characters that enter a level and the game will provide a number of further characters in a way that all skills necessary to complete a level's secondary goals are available. You can then switch between those characters. I couldn't figure out how the game sorts the extras and so had to learn them for each level.You're always running around with at least two characters. That way you can play as one or two players. The extra character(s) can be quite a hassle. If there are fewer players than characters you can tag and change the currently played character. When you're running with more characters it can be hard to change to the wanted character. When attacking something extra characters are often in the way as the auto-aiming rather hits an extra than anything else. Sometimes extras are blocking you sometimes they keep their distance when you want to tag them. NPC cooperation, e.g. when having to pull two levers at roughly the same time, is still a bit lacking in this game.The problem with camera angles is even more problematic with ingame rewards, mainly LEGO studs that act as currency in the game and are also part of secondary level goals. Reward collection policy in LEGO games has always been an issue with me, right from the first time a stud vanished into an abyss. So what about the camera? The studs in this game do not have a shadow so their movement in 3D space is somewhat hard to follow. Sometimes you can translate from the movement of another stud moving on the screen plane, i.e. at a right angle to the player's line of sight. Why do you need to follow movement anyway? Most ingame rewards vanish after about 4 seconds which is relatively short. Most ingame rewards are not collectible right away, i.e. studs usually have approximately a second after they appear in which they are protected from collection. Some rewards drop down an abyss or jump behind a wall right away. If there wasn't the argument that there are basically always more studs to collect I'd find that unbearable - so I'm only somewhat upset. Also, game designers were aware of that as is evidenced by the fact that certain levels change policy so that every stud is automatically collected.My policy would have all studs collectible right away, no time-related vanishing, no jumping through walls and always dropping a shadow.The game has a few dead-ends, i.e. places you can get to but cannot get away from without quitting a level. There is also a bit of unnecessary tunneling. Example 1: In free play despite having a character that can theoretically make it across wide abysses the game still drops you into the abyss because it just wants you to take the scenic route. Example 2: Some silver object cannot be bombed unless some other object has been built despite the object to-be-build and the silver object never interacting.There are a few flying missions. Whenever you happen to collect a power-up - which due to bad visibility cannot always be avoided - the game starts to make an unnerving sound for the duration of the power-up. Later in my game I simply turned off sounds altogether.Again, I recommend LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga to those that don't mind playing only the main part of the game or have a high tolerance against boredom when 100%-ing.

Or switching off the emperor at the last second to get a super jump. Or removing C3PO's limbs so he has to hop around and hit panels with his face.

												""LEGO® Star Wars™ - The Complete Saga"" is basically as the name implies, it's a Lego game that contains the saga of Star Wars, well until Episode VII just released haha.This game features a hub world where you first start and includes all 6 Episodes and within each Episode there are six Missions and one/two Bonus missions. Only Episode 1 is unlocked in the beginning, but if you complete the first mission you'll unlock all the other Episodes. So if you don't like the prequels just do the first mission and then skip the rest and jump straight into Episode 4. There is also a ""Gold"" bonus area that has extra content to do if you get all Gold blocks in the game.You're not going to find voice acting in this game unless it's the droid sounds, so there is little to none of the political scenes from the movies(at least so far in Episode 1). If you're looking for pretty much an all action version of Star Wars this is the game to get that experience. However there are some missing scenes from the movie that I would have liked to see in this game like the underwater ship in Episode 1 is skipped when that could have been part of a mission for more collectibles/blocks. There is also no space scene with Anakin when he's in the N-1 which I thought could have been a cool addition. The pod racing is included however. So very mixed so far in Episode 1 of what scenes you'd expect to see. Probably more missing scenes like this in the later Episodes.As for performance I'm getting 60fps 100% of the time in-game at 1920x1080, but when there's cutscenes I've noticed there are framedrops occuring but they come back to 60fps. So a bit stuttering when in cutscenes. Not sure what the cause is, but it isn't that big of a deal to me since I'm just watching and not playing.Controller support does feel perfect in the game, I don't have the time currently to find a local co-op partner and test two controllers plugged in, but I'm assuming it works fine. If it doesn't I'll update my review and make note of it.So far I'm very happy with the game. I used to play Lego games a long time ago on my original Xbox back when it was split into two parts and this Complete Saga on PC plays exactly how I remember it years ago. I'd say it's worth $19.99 if you know you're going to be playing this and wanting to collect everything and it's 100% a for sure purchase at $5.99 on sale even if you're just going to casually run through it.

												I originally had the Lego Star Wars the Video Game on my GameCube. It was part of my childhood. Unfortunately, I never bought the Original Saga of Lego Star Wars. This thing has them both, with a bunch of connecting details. Instead of two separate games in one bundle, they are truly combined into just one game. For example, you have to be a Stormtrooper to access areas in Episode I, II, and III. It's a joy to be able to purchase this beauty on Steam and play it with a controller. The ability to relive some of my childhood memories with a boost in the graphic quaility is amazing! I always played Lego Star Wars on older TVs, so it feels odd to see it with a 1080p resolution and higher framerate. If you want to play a Star Wars game that has a TON of content and replayability, this is certainly a viable option.There is nothing serious about it! It really is just a playground of Star Wars fun.

												This game is SO much fun. It was made in 2009 and has something that the newer lego star wars game doesnt even have: Controller support! That is really important for a game like this. Im talking about the clone wars game, that doesnt have controller support. If you dont have a controller for steam, then get one. Xbox 360, Steam controller, and I believe that the Xbox one and PS4 has compatibility for steam too. Local multiplayer on PC. IMAGINE. Star wars is a great multiplayer game. Be jerks to your friends, or help along the way. Also the keyboard feels weird for a game like this. This game deserves regognition. Why is the force awakens game the same price? Hello! Its only one movie! This game is 6! There isnt much else to say. Its a great game, challenging, puzzeling, fun, and fair. Even better with a controller!			"

												I wish they can make a keybind for collecting bricks nearby automatically, this game makes me feel like a scavenger, very time-consuming.Camera prespective can be sometimes confusing, better have angle control.BGM is alright, but I miss the GBA version and more like the way music looped there.Cutscenes are now 3D animated rather than being a slideshow, very cute and funny!The mumbling voices are cute as in the past!!

												Like many others I bought this for the nostalgia rush from my childhood, I soon realized how ahead of it's time this game really was.This game is really an enjoyable mash of genres. It blends Action, Adventure, and slight Strategy/Puzzle all together, and it works so well. It's a shame we will never see anything like this again. The only games we get with Star Wars slapped on them are DLC force fed bantha fodder.			"

												As repetitive as the LEGO series game engines are... this game doesn't fall short of fun.I only have about an hour of Steam play on this game but I used to own another copy and nearly beat it playing co-op.. which you can switch in and out of any time during gameplay just like the classic arcades.Like people say, this game is actually the ""complete saga"" meaning you play through LEGO's re-telling of Star Wars Episodes I through VI.Can't wait to see what LEGO whips up for the new Episode VII.

												I have played through episode 1 and so far this game is as good as I remeber it. I do feel Lego should have stuck with the speechless humour it had here rather than what they use in Lego Mavel.The controls weren't to hard to adapt to after having played only on Xbox for quite some time. The adaptation of the Pod Race in this version as aposed to the prequel game is far more achievable as in the original game it was nearly impossible. However I am happy that this version was kept in the game as an extra.All in all a very good game.			"

												Just like most lego games, you play as a bunch of different characters, in similar settings and storylines as the movies. LEGO anakin, holding a LEGO lightsaber, Dueling LEGO sith, Defeating LEGO droids, on a LEGO planet.... LEGO MAN! Overall, I found it very entertaining and alot of fun. Just as you would expect, you get to use the force, pilot space ships, become a jedi and blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up...every childs dream! :)			"

												If you have never had the privilage to play lego star wars the complete saga, you are missing out. Lego games are great games but, their only problem is that with every new game, their formula is reused so it's like playing the same game but re-skinned and with a new name. This being one of the original ones, is just truly amazing.It takes you through all 6 original episodes of star wars with a lego touch. It is truly fun. I have played the lego star wars games since 2006 and they are still fun. I do find that episodes 1 and 2 are kinda dry with their level design (NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE PREQUEL LEVELS) but episodes 3 and on are really fun. I think my favourite level was actually the first level in episode 3, Battle over Coruscant. I just found it very epic.			"

												I took a trip back to my childhood with this game and I gotta say: playing through both LEGO Star Wars games in one collection is pretty neat. I still remember the novelty of battling across the stars with my friends as we discovered the secrets of Free Play mode in every level. Tt Games really nailed replayability in these games, encouraging players to return to previously inaccessible areas of a level by using unlockable heroes with their special abilities. One thing has to be said about the original LEGO Star Wars, though: it hasn't held up especially well. I found the sequel to be the much more enjoyable and memorable of the two thanks to its clever level design and quirky humor. The first game is noticably slower paced and lacks the visually gags that add so much to its sequel. Regardless, it was nice to take a trip down memory lane and remind myself what all successive LEGO franchise games built themselves upon.It's really hard to say no to a package that packs in so much content. Hundreds of iconic Star Wars characters and tons of replayability keep me coming back for more from the galaxy far, far, away.			"

												If you like the basics of the LEGO game (smash stuff and collect things), then this is still a great game. Newer LEGO games have more variety between puzzles, levels, and different characters. Newer ones obviously look better, but this still doesn't look bad by any means.I'd rank this as one of the best LEGO games, and it definitely is worth the price for any Star Wars fans.			"

												I have played Lego Games for a long time, mostly on consoles and stuff. Foudn this game on sale, bought it and boy did the memories flood back. One of the best Star Wars games out there.The characters move really well (Only had some problems with double jumping sometimes.) and can fight well too. Every character feels unique in some way, either their powers or some special animations. The levels are all well designed. Each level feels fun to play through, except for the vehicle levels. Some of the vehicle levels can be really fun to play through (Pod Racing being my favorite) while some are annoying due to the fact that you go straight across the screen when tapping a button. More often than not did i die because of the bad controls on these levels.Each level contains one powerbrick, 10 minikits, a bunch of studs to collect to purchase stuff back at the Cantina. More often than not will you have to return to a level to fully complete it, but since most levels are fun, it doesnt matter too much.Accessing levels, buying new characters, creating characters and more all takes place at the Mos Eisley Cantina. Its made so you can easily find your way to levels, extra levels, minigames and more.I recommend buying the game and playing through it. Its more fun with a friend though, since alot of the puzzles are based around two people.			"

												Fun game for all ages and especially those who like Lego and StarWars fans. Like most Lego games has aged well and Lego is Lego and looks always like Lego.SImple platformer that will not hurt your brain with it's puzzles, get it for a bit of mindless Lego fun.Perfect for parents to play with their kids.On another note:If you own a PC, then you should have a controller. Not every game is made with keyboard and mouse in mind.Do you play racing games and Mortal Kombat style fighters with your keyboard and mouse? About the only games desgined for K/M are FPS and hidden picture games :pHeck you can grab a cheap knockoff 360 wired controller on Ebay for $10AUD. (approx $7USD) If you already own a wireless 360 cobntroller then buy a cheap wireless dongle instead.If you downvote this or any other game because you're too cheap to own a controller or do not know your Xbox 360's wired controller will plug straight into yourWindows PC then you're an idiot who needs to hand in their Master Race card.If a review is ever negative because it requires a controller ignore it. Nothing worng with the games, the problem is those using them.			"

												These two games started the current Licensed ""Travelers Tales formula"" and they execute it the best (also you dont have to beat the game to access freemode, or listen to awful jokes by the characters Im looking at you Lego Batman 2)  Which one is better?Lego Starwars 2 has better humour, not just in cutscenes but the general enviroment is jam packed with outrageousness. The stages also feel more refined then Lego Starwars 1, there definitely aren't as many bs deaths either. Battle Mechanics and GameplaySadly this is the weakest aspect of the game, it has the simplicity of an early one button beat em up. Some characters are capable of doing more then just mashing the attack button, such as a rolling and then rapid fire or a force blast with a swipe. But for the most part the battling is weak, fights are usually short lived due to enemy HP being so fragile. If you're playing solo great ready to watch your AI partner never kill or assist you in a boss fight. They'll pretend they doing something (such as blocking or purposely shooting to the side of the enemy) but they're programmed to never kill... for whatever reason.SoundYou can hate this entire game all you want but the soundtrack is spectactular. It's straight out of the movies.ChoiceCharacter variety is huge and I'm not talking about just character models. I would say there are different groupings of characters and each group has something that sets it apart from each other (Droids, Sithlords, Bounty Hunters, Troopers, Jedi, Indiana Jones. Rebels, YOUR CUSTOM CHARACTER(S), Lulzy characters, Misceclanous characters).  Even in these groups almost every character is unqiue in some manner. Stage DesignFor those who have seen the series you will have no trouble recnogizing every piece of secenery, with a hint of Lego humour invovled. Bonus items are well placed and at times incredibly cryptic. The puzzles are basic at times and actually challenging at others (suprising if you've played other TT Lego games...).ReplabitlityYou will find yourself going back to a stage 2 or 3 times (especially for the Hoth Battle, Deathstar Run and Speeder Bike stages). Or you could play straight forward through the story and replay the free modes to 100%.			"

Episode VII: The Bricks AwakenThis game was the childhood of most 20-something year-olds who played video games. And, really, what's not to love? Traveler's Tales had a well-built and finely constructed vision of a galaxy far, far away entirely made of LEGO bricks (well, not entirely). What's there to say that hasn't already been said?Now that we're all adults, it turns out, there's quite a bit more to discuss about this. The episodes focusing on the Prequel Trilogy have had slight adjustments to account for the improvements made in Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy. Minikits are now playable in some sections, and powerups drop, enabling increased stud pickup radius, invicibility, and increased stud value. I personally prefer the Prequel Trilogy sections of the game, but the entire experience is phenomenal in a familiar way.The game is definitely rough, visually, but seeing famous Star Wars characters and locations in LEGO form is still a treat. Music from the series is used to great effect, and the sound effects are spot-on. Canned character animations can get old, but you'll hardly care since you're controlling DARTH MAUL IN LEGO FORM. Most relevant sections from the movies have been included in some form, and the silent, physical humor is still hilarious.Having to complete each level in one sitting is a little bit of a pain, but the levels are short enough that this usually isn't an issue. In Free Play, unlimited access to characters removes this problem as you create shortcuts or decimate enemies in ways the level never intended.Red Bricks, which grant bonuses at the cost of studs, are gradually unlocked. Some are amusing, some are useful (magnetically drawing in studs is a godsend), and some break the game (the higher levels of the stud combo multipliers, invicibility, perfect deflection), but all are welcome.The character roster is huge, and while a few too many spots are devoted to joke characters or clones (no pun intended), it's still a welcome sight to see the number of available characters increase. The manner in which certain areas are locked off to certain characters is never frustrating due to how they steadily allow you to unlock the characters you need to revisit previous levels and get everything that can be found.The episodes are all consistently good, though some of the vehicle sections and camera angles don't quite hold up when it comes to quality.Gold Bricks can be used to unlcok several bonus levels, and while some are entertaining, most you'll only complete to get the Gold Brick needed to get closer to 100% and then never look back. Lego city and its counterpart are particularly frustrating.The only other unwelcome aspect is the Super Story: while fun in theory (speedrunning through each movie using only the characters accesible when you first played the level), the fact that its needed to acquire 100% is a bit of a tough pill to swallow considering that Super Story adds nothing new. I have ~99% completion, but the thought of replaying levels I've already finished without being able to swap characters turned me off from that final completion point.Overall, though, this game is as fantastic as you remember. If you haven't played it, there's a huge amount of content here, most of it excellent. If you have, give it another go. You won't regret it.ProsHuge, varied character rosterExcellent music, of courseLEGO versions of characters, vehicles and places are nice to seeMost levels are perfectly paced and great funHuge amount of great contentConsCamera angles are sometimes iffySome vehicle sections drag on for a bit too long or aren't quite as good as you rememberVisually dated in comparison to Lego Star Wars III: The Clone WarsSome bonus levels are repetitive or frustratingLarge number of joke characters "

												This game is SO much fun. It was made in 2009 and has something that the newer lego star wars game doesnt even have: Controller support! That is really important for a game like this. Im talking about the clone wars game, that doesnt have controller support. If you dont have a controller for steam, then get one. Xbox 360, Steam controller, and I believe that the Xbox one and PS4 has compatibility for steam too. Local multiplayer on PC. IMAGINE. Star wars is a great multiplayer game. Be jerks to your friends, or help along the way. Also the keyboard feels weird for a game like this. This game deserves regognition. Why is the force awakens game the same price? Hello! Its only one movie! This game is 6! There isnt much else to say. Its a great game, challenging, puzzeling, fun, and fair. Even better with a controller!			"

												A simple but fun game, going for 100% completion was a bit of a grind due to the repetition (playing through the entire story multiple times to find all minikits, power bricks, etc). Getting 100% took just shy of 50 hours, so you get quite a bit of game without adding the replay value. That being said, I played both games as a kid before the complete saga was even released, lots of fun gameplay here still, and of course I always recommend getting games on sale, but I'd still pay full price for this game. 8.5/10 would grind my life away again.

												If you've played any other of the Lego games, you've played this one. They're all very much alike. If you haven't played a Lego game before, they're 3d puzzle-based action games, in the vein of Mario 64. They're very easy to play with simple controls.I enjoy playing Star Wars Lego with my easily excited four year old, who loves it and is always asking to play. It's gentle enough for him to enjoy it. The production values and polish are great, and it's STAR WARS. It has lots of in-jokes and nods to the source materials. There are lots of collectables which give some replayability - I couldn't be bothered myself.As of about five years ago, all six existing Star Wars films were catered for (i.e. the original trilogy and prequels), hence the title. It doesn't include anything from the more recent films, those are in different games. Each film has about six levels (so 36 in total). If you haven't seen the films then the plot is likely incomprehensible. Who hasn't seen Star Wars though?			"

												Fun with the just the right amounts of challenging and whimsical thrown in.Two player camera angles can be a pain, but for the most part, it's a fun, endearing gaming experience. If you've got a loved one you're trying to get interested in gaming, this is a damn-near perfect place to start.			"

												It is a really good game. However, I'm not a fan of auto save. I like to be able to save when I need to, not when the game developers want to. I don't like having to re-do things.			"

												A simple but fun game, going for 100% completion was a bit of a grind due to the repetition (playing through the entire story multiple times to find all minikits, power bricks, etc). Getting 100% took just shy of 50 hours, so you get quite a bit of game without adding the replay value. That being said, I played both games as a kid before the complete saga was even released, lots of fun gameplay here still, and of course I always recommend getting games on sale, but I'd still pay full price for this game. 8.5/10 would grind my life away again.

												Hands down my favorite LEGO games (LEGO SW 1 and 2) rolled into one. Star Wars 1 was my first LEGO game on GameCube back in the day and the second game brough some great times too. Bought this Steam version out of nostalgia and felt the same magic all over again. The game ran well and didn't have the crashes, memory leaks, and glitches that I encountered in the other LEGO games that I bought on Steam. If you are set on only playing one LEGO game, get this one.			"

												When I saw that this game was on sale over Christmas I freaked out. I remember playing this as a kid and loving it, and it brought back so many memories! Many people say that the controls were hard to get used to, but after a few minutes, I got into the swing of things. The levels are all different, and challenging often, but some of the space levels, especially ""falcon flight"" and the first part of the destruction of the second Death Star are boring and monotonous. Some of the levels and enemies can be a bit infuriating, but there is always something to do, and returning to the levels for free play and challenge modes is totally worth it. Very fun game, 100% worth it to complete the entire thing, very rewarding as I never finished the entire thing as a kid.			"

												This is LEGO's first video game adaptation of a film series, and it's definitely not without serious aging. The first con I couldn't get around was the game's restrictive bug that keeps the game at 4:3 ratio at a standard defition resolution. If you try setting it to widescreen or at a higher resolution (which the video settings menu says you can do), the game freezes up completely, leaving you no choice but to restart. My computer was built for high-functioning games in 2015, yet not even that can bring this game up to modern display standards! There are also frame rate issues at certain points mid-game that make you think your computer's a dinosaur.On the other hand, you have the promising fun of the Star Wars saga combined with the ingenuity and creativity of LEGO. If you want to free Princess Leia as Dex, go ahead. If you want the satisfaction of killing Jar Jar over and over again as Darth Vader, that's your choice! When it comes to thrills and speed however, you may get frustrated with having to run half as fast as you know the character should. No force-boosts there. But the controls all work, the gagetry is fun, and the reimagined scenes from the movies have their fair share of added humor and wit. Just, good luck with your patience.			"

												Greatest LEGO game and Star Wars game I have ever played. The concept of the game is simple, my 5 year old brother loves playing it! Recently got 100% myself, and although lengthy, a fun journey nonetheless! Would recommend to all Star Wars fans!			"
