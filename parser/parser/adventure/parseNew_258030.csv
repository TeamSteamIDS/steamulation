												If I could describe Earthlock in a single sentence it would be something along the lines of this: A simple, unpretentious rpg heavily inspired by NES/SNES jrpgs. The game has numerous flaws, but if you temper your expectations you'll be taken on a rather enjoyable journey.I'll begin with the game's strengths. The music is absolutely brilliant. Almost every track fit right in and strengthened the atmosphere of the entire game. The dynamic music, how the overworld track would go right into the combat version of a song then seamlessly right back out once combat ended, was a great touch.The story is simple. This is actually a boon to the game as it keeps the focus where it needs to be. The characters all have their reason for going on the journey, and it's never hard to follow.The world is pleasant to look at. Visual design for most places ranges from 7/10 to 10/10. I do not know if it was intended, but the stark contrast in appearance between the ancient technology and the modern, rediscovered/reinvented technology was pleasing. The world felt as fresh and unique as it needed to be. In addition there are lots of little bits of lore scattered around for those who wish to look. Even the character Gnart, a scribe of sorts, keeps a little journal of the adventure one can read at any time. You can tell they cared enough to flesh out their world beyond what the story required.There are many great systems similar to those used in other rpgs. There are no random encounters, all enemies being visible on all maps. One can choose to engage a large group or lure them off one at a time. There are benefits to both approaches. Obviously fighting fewer enemies at a time will make life easier, but fighting more builds a large experience multiplier skyrocketing levels much faster. It's a great risk vs reward system. Although the difficulty spikes make it near manditory to fight large groups when you can or else you may have to go back to grind levels later.You have a party of 4 out of possible 6 characters. Each character can be 'paired' to any other and they work together. They gain passive bonuses based on their bond level, which can change up how they play. Furthermore every character has two seperate stance which give them multiple different abilities. You can have the character Amon play as a rogue/thief, or as a ranged heavy hitter.Instead of physical equipment, each character has a large talent board. On the talent board you can put stat cards, ability cards, and perk cards. This further changes the way characters can play, though each one is locked into a general role. The mages are never going to be as effective fighters as the characters made for it, but they can be made somewhat passable if one chooses.The use of teleport and saving statues is nice. They're well placed so one is never far from being able to save or teleport back to a town, so the lack of being able to save anywhere was not noticed at all.The gardening is a cute addition. I mean that both literal and sarcastically. It's not required except to craft healing potions, or if you plan on turning either of the two character with ranged weaponry into ranged specialists. It is the only reliable way to gain potions or ammunition, and can be quite time consuming. Perhaps being able to purchase second best ammunition and potions from shops would alleviate the frustration I had with the game design behind it. Using it to craft the best items would give incentive, while giving the second best items to shops would have made it 100% skippable by those not wanting to touch it. The enemy visual design is a little hit and miss. In general I like it, even though there's not a wide variety of enemies so some models are simple retextures. I adored the old enemies from the ancient ruins.Now the bad. Like I said the flaws are numerous but most are relatively minor, considering the small team and inexperience behind the people involved. Some minor spoilers about characters lie below, but nothing pertinent to the story.The scope felt a little bit too big for the story. There wasn't a whole lot of character interaction, and I could feel any footing of investment I had in a few of the characters slip as time went on. Gnart and Amon end up being the most interesting of all the characters. That's not to say the others couldn't potentially be, but there is so little ever mentioned of them that it's easy to forget that they are more than cardboard cutouts holding weapons. Olia, a mysterious spear wielding warrior/scholar, obviously has an interesting backstory that is constantly hinted at, but never properly told. Taika is an odd and special breed of magic dog, but we're never told what makes them special. PAT is an ancient robot from the pre-magic-apocalypse, but he tells almost nothing of interest before that pre-magic-apocalypse. I think Ive is my least favorite character, but that may be because of her introduction to the game and lack of consequences for a particular action she commits rather than her demeanor. The game shares a lot of backstory on Amon and Gnart, on the other hand. While it serves to flesh them out a lot and is wonderful in and of itself. It also highlights just how little the game tells us of the others. In short, I think the characters have character, but the lack of interaction makes one easily forget.The dialogue is also rather simple and a little strange at times. Some of it could be due to translation, but it never bothered me personally.In addition I wish there was just more interaction between all the characters. They all had their various reasons for being dragged into this adventure, but the party banter felt very lacking. Maybe an easy solution to this could have been various interactions on the Isle of Plumpet (your home base more or less) depending on how far into the story you are. Interactions with things leading the chosen leader of your party to comment with their thoughts or feelings. The fights, or rather the game difficulty, seemed very spotty. You're driven in a linear fashion through the world, or else this wouldn't be much of an issue. However more than a few times you'll enter an area or find a new boss, and there is no way forward except to go back and grind out a level or two. Maybe it was because sometimes I preferred to not fight large groups of enemies so I became underleveled, but even so it was an annoyance. In addition, the AI seems really bad. For example, it will bring a character to the brink of death and then focus on another before actually finishing said character. Animations are a little clunky and character models felt stiff. In contract to the music work, the sound design for everything else was mediocre. This is very spoilerific for the ending, so reader be warned. I'm wondering how the party managed to escape the memory of Maato after destroing the Valvur'ed Ichabo. To my knowledge there was no proper way to leave once you entered. Them just magically pooping out after winning the fight seemed very hamfisted. I can forgive everything else in the game, but that was one thing I felt really needed an explanation. Perhaps this is due to the general feeling of the scope of the game being slightly larger than what the devs could feasably pull off, which I feel is the reason for a lot of other story/character interaction related things. But still, this if anything needed some sort of explanation.In short, the story is nothing spectacular but passable and unpretentious. The game systems are hit and miss, but with a lot of novel things thrown in. The world and music are delightful. I paid around 27 euros for this game. I'd say it's at best a  15 euro title, for those that like this sort of game. Although I feel no regrets paying the amount I did and am glad the money went to this studio. There was real talent and real love fueling this game. Despite the pockmarks and cracks, I found it to be a great experience.			"

												This game is clearly made with effort. The art assets, especially the environments, are wonderful, the characters each have some interesting mechanic to play around with, and the monster designs are cool. It harkens back to slightly older JRPGs with its use of classic tropes and terribly named inconsequential objects. The mechanics for the battle system are interesting, and at times quite fun.However, this game has so many problems, I cannot in good faith reccomend it.The writing is entirely devoid of voice. Each character sounds like the same person's speech, with a few quirks hastily pasted onto them. What could be relevant and relatable character designs are ruined by one-dimensional exposition lines and a lack of reactive dialogue. The tutorial messages placed into character dialogue are arguably worse, taking what could be an opportunity for cheeky 4th wall breaking, and removing all flavor.The navigation is inconsistent at best. There are areas of the game where you are able to walk into invisible holes in the ground, with your only recourse being to redo your past 20 minutes of progress by loading a previous save. In most places, the character models are prone to get stuck on corners of walls and whatnot.The progression could be interesting, but it takes a good deal of grinding the thief's Steal ability on different enemies to craft objects needed to use the talent points you have gained, and oft creates spaces within the game where the player is underpowered and overleveled when facing enemies, and leads to a less-than-smooth leveling experience.I found the puzzles quite boring. Not very good by any stretch. Many of them will require that your have a single character selected, something the game only ever mentions once, almost at the very start of the game. Some will require you run into stray geometry until your character finds a hidden passage, and all of them require repeated use of a quite awful context-sensitive interact button.All of that combined with the fact that the game has a number of edge-case bugs which can cause save corruption and crashes.This is not a very good game.I hope that the Developers can learn from the mistakes they made with this game and move on to something greater, because everything in this game reeks of untapped, unpolished potential.

												Nice, old school JRPG that harkens to the some of my favorites like the older Final Fantasies and Dragon Quest.  It does the fundamentals well without trying to do anything too radical or new, just a few twists on the tried and true formula, some of which are brilliantly simple and I think add a lot to the experience.  It is apparent that the whole thing was made with love. The world and soundtrack are beautiful and have a lot of character, but the storytelling is pretty lazy, the characters are a little flat, and a lot of it just feels kind of slapped together.Still, all-told, I'm having a good time exploring their world and beating up cartoon monsters with my rag-tag crew of good guys, which is exactly what I was hoping for.  If you want a laid back jrpg romp, this is a good one.   "

												It's not worth it.Although this game is fantastic for the first 90%, the developers decided to add in some of the most frustrating rpg mechanics i've ever seen in the last 10%.All of the heroes in your party cap out at level 20 which is easily hit before the final boss.Then, the last area before the final boss consist of a string of non-avoidable, exp-less, time consuming battles that offer you nothing. Then all this leading to the most frustrating final boss of all time that decides to punish you for playing the game any other way then to prepare for this battle. All Characters have to be built a very specific way that revolves around buffing a single type of damage, using a specific four party members. God forbid you didn't prepare with this exact set-up you are going to be doing a whole lot of grinding through mobs that don't give exponential exp based on their level. Not to mention all the level 20 members you have will gain nothing from this grinding.Incredibly dissapointing end to an otherwise good game. The last two hours completely destroy anything positive about Earthlock.			"

												When I first saw Earthlock I was like this likes kinda cool, so I read up on it before it came out,liked what I read and the pictures of the game too.I checked back on the game's forums every few days to find out about updates and what people were talking about.Then it was delayed for about 3 weeks give or take, at this point I was skeptical and to be honest a little upset I wasn't playing it yet.When it did come out I checked reviews which were mixed and saw the thirty dollar price tag, well that being the case I put it on my wishlist for a sale, fast forward maybe 6 weeks and I find it on Humble Bundle for under twenty with better reviews on Steam.I picked it up and glad I did because it is a hidden gem of a game, in part also because my friend Saibot wrote a good review and I respect his opinion since we like similiar game/genre.Pros: Combat is easy to understand but harder to master and includes building up each toon differently but working as a          unit.        Graphics are really nice and fit the game perfectly - Fredrik Dahl - Concept Artist,  great job Sir!        Soundtrack and game sounds are well done and again fit the game.        Story is not super detailed but solid and interesting.        Characters pull you in and are relatable.Cons:The text is not perfect, but easy to understand, remember they are a small studio from Oslo, Norway, English isn't           thier first language.           Price is a little high but they do have to make a living - at twenty they would have sold more copies off the bat.          All in all a really good RPG here from a small studio who is passionate about the game  and put their hearts into          it.          Twenty to Thirty plus hours to complete depending if you are speed racer or just cruisin.           Well Done Snowcastle Games   "

Somehow missed the check box, but I received this product for free in order to review:Earthlock: Festival of Magic is a more old-school style turn-based RPG that has some good things going for it as far as originality that make it really stand out.  From the start, the game seems a bit familiar.  I can't really come up with anything to compare it directly with, but it seems to have the makings of a solid game right off.  I'm about three quarters finished now, so I feel pretty comfortable writing a review at this point.  Most of what I'd mention up here in the introduction I've already pointed out below.  While there are some flaws and things I don't particularly care for, the good things override a lot of the negatives in my opinion.  ProsThe graphic style is very appealing.  Reminds me of old RPG games I liked from the late 90's or so, when the more 3D style games started to get popular.  There are many varied areas so far, which is great!  There are some jokes here and there.  Humor is a plus,  generally, so this is welcomed.Some fun side quests and other extras to work on during your journey.  I won't get into any details, but I do enjoy having some extra stuff to do, rather than follow one single linear plot.  Not a ton, but I do like the extras that are added in.Music is nice for the genre of game.  Definitely fits the style, and there is nothing annoying about any as far as I am concerned at least.Easy teleport system to move around from fairly early in the game.  This is helpful moving from point to point easily, and there are a good many spots to jump from.There is a nice multi-level crafting system in the game.  While a lot of what you can create might not be necessary in many cases, some aspects can be pretty handy.  The concept of using talent points on a talent grid and changing your stats and adding to other abilities through the talent points system is a nice idea.  The various cards are also interchangeable between characters for the regular stat ones, and then there are more specialized ones that apply to certain characters in ability and perk nodes.  The system is not too complicated, and simply gaining levels gives you access to more spots you can fill.  As long as it is touching one that is previously activated, you can keep activating more that are further down.There are several informative menus you can check during the game, like a bestiary, tutorial recaps, or journal so you can recall where you were if you stopped, or just got confused or didn't know what to do next, etc.  The bond system is a great addition too that adds to battle customization.  As you pair with another member of the party and fight, you gain up to five levels in the system.  They generally will give passives for whenever the two are paired, so you can mix and match depending on situations.There are various different things you can do in dungeons and places you explore.  I like that it's not just moving from place to place and killing stuff.  It makes it interesting to see new things as you are going through various areas of the game.I like the fact that you can change to a secondary stance depending on the situation.  Sometimes one might be more useful or helpful than another depending on what you are battling.ConsThe difficulty of this game is kind of tedious and there is one.  No changing it in any way.  I found myself having to use a lot of heals on some bosses if I skipped battles, and it kind of makes the game less fun than it could be, since I cannot pick up on particular strategies for certain fights that might make it easier.  I simply seemed to be under-leveled and would need to grind a bit first, or else no strategies would work due to lack of health.  Just a fair warning from my own opinion about this particular facet of play in the game.A slight freeze for a second or two after each super move for me.  It's just a small delay, but it is noticeable.Some sounds are very loud compared to others at times.  This might be a bad thing if you are already playing the game pretty loud and you get hit with one of these.No voices at all.  I think it would be a lot better if this were incorporated into the game somehow.I wish the towns were a little busier and had more activity and size.  They are pretty straight-forward and there isn't much to them besides a path or two.  More would have been nice.Camera at times can be a little tricky, especially near borders of areas.There is no skip screen if you find yourself having trouble over and over at a particular spot.  This could really help out, since there are some difficult bosses with small bits of dialogue.Not much substance to the characters or story so far.  I would have liked to see more interaction between different characters.On one particular boss, $AbilityName came up for one of the moves, and I am not sure if this was intentional or not.  Seems like a bug.  It was a seemingly robotic/golem-like boss, but it was a bit strange to see this.Game glitched out on elevators several times.  Once I had to restart because an elevator went up without me, and I fell through the platform and could never move.  I was just kind of frozen in a dark area after I sort of fell through the bottom of the platform where the elevator had been.  Had to quit out and restart the game up.Expensive price for what is in the game.  It is a good length, but there are other RPGs that are long and much longer and not as expensive, or they have more varied elements involved with the story, characters, and the size of places you explore and visit.   ConclusionAlthough I have quite a list of cons, they are not too bad overall, and the game itself is quite good!  I would not pay anything like the full price if I were buying this, but at a pretty good discount this game is totally worth playing.  I'm really glad I was able to experience this game, and it is a pretty well put together work.It reminds me of some of the older RPGs that I played, but has some extra polish added in graphically, and does some pretty neat things with crafting, as well as combat to make it different than your standard RPG.  The talent point system is an interesting spin as well, and adds a different sort of dimension compared to traditional RPGs.  I definitely recommend this, though it does have some rough spots.  Many who enjoy some of the older games in the genre might appreciate this one a good bit.  All in all, I like what was done in the game.  It's been a pleasure to get to play.  If interested, definitely get it on sale though, if you can.			"

												Earthlock is a western take on the classic jRPG formula and should be instantly familiar to anyone who enjoys that kind of game. Besides its own charming cast of characters and beautiful world, it has a number of mechanics that set it appart from the rest:Character progression: Characters level up, but unlock skills and talents on a talent board - different talents are collected or crafted, then sloted on the board as the player earns more slots. To use a slot, a character has to have an available point to spend, a talent to place in it, and must have a talent in one of the adjacent slots. There are different types of slots - some reserved for the character's abilities, some for stat boosts, others for passive abilities such as damage reduction, extra damage or the ability to ressurect once per fight.Stances:In combat each character has two stances tehy can switch between. Thus Amon, the main hero, can either be a dagger wielding rogue, able to cloack himself, mug and steal from opponents and slice and dice them, or he can grab his trusty gun and shoot opponents with ammo harvested from his garden (yes, you grow your own ammunition in a garden). Bond:In your party of up to 4 characters, you can pair up sets of characters and their bond will increase, giving them unique boosts whenever these specific two are paired up. It adds another layer to party selection, as you will not only look at what four characters to take along, but also how better to split them into two pairs to gain the bonuses you need in a given situation.On top of that, each pair shares the typical ""limit break"" style bar used to power specials. So once you can trigger a special, you still have to choose which of the two characters' ability will be more useful.Overall, it is a fun, beautiful little game. It is not the longest, it is not the most challenging, but if you give it a chance, it can offer you fun with some nifty character systems, enjoyable gameplay and some tough boss fights.Backed it on kickstarter and did not regret doing so :)			"

 This game doesn't deserve the current rating of 72% Simply a beautiful (J)RPG which will give you hours of throwback goodness. The pairing and a few other gameplay gems were also a pleasant surprise.The growing/crafting system is pretty great and I really like the way your team members team up as pairs adding passive bonuses in combat. I want to remain as spoiler free as possible so I won't comment on the story so far but i can promise you  for a Indie game its really impressive!  The signs so far are strong, especially for it being a 27,99€ Game. I got it discounted on Halloween Sale for 22,39€ and i dont regret it!Walking around the world is a little under whelming in terms of ""stuff to do"", but it's charming. Grinding enemies can be a bit of that, a grind, but there's workarounds and special things to do to make sure you're not spending to much time collecting a big mob of dudes to kill. Good story, good artwork, great soundtrack, and the turn-based mechanics are pulled of very well. Something about it reminds me of my childhood, and it shows that you don't need a big budget to make a good game.That being said... omg... The Soundtrack. Oh god please who is the God who made that Soundtrack? It gave me goosebumps. I mean.. Just listen to those 2 Soundtracks!!!

												Earthlock: Festival of Magic is the game I would reccomend to people who get turned off by staple features of 90s console RPGs.Earthlock manages to lovingly emulate the enjoyment of playstation and SNES RPG Titles, but in a truly surprising way actually progresses and reinvigorates the style. While the titles this game is based on are great, they require those who weren't fans or unable to get past certain pet peeves to put up with it for the entire game.Things like repetitive battle music, slow battles, oversimplified commands (generic Attack command), and the dreaded grinding of fighting the same short encounter list makes classics and modern retro RPGs harder to enjoy for many people. Earthlock addresses all of this while forging it's own identity.The Soundtrack is incredible and diverse, but what makes it more than just nice to listen is that battle themes are rearranged versions of the area themes they belong. It truly makes the game more enjoyable when your favorite battle themes can be traced to fighting in the sewer or on the glacier. But most importantly you never go into the hundreds upon hundreds of battles hearing the same opening over and over, also the switch is seamless as a nice touch.Slow battles is a little harder to explain, but just expect no ATB bars and being able to input commands much faster than most turn based games. In the few instances where the battles drag on a bit, the game shells you a bit of bonus EXP for sticking to the end.Very early the game teaches you a simple trick, slashing attacks kill plant enemies better. From this point on, you realize that the generic attack technically dosen't exist in this game, the game puts it in your best interest to explore and adapt since the stances can radically change your battle strategies and with more useful attack abilites (Gouge, traps) and becuase such logic as only ranged attacks can hit flying enemies, stops the players from mashing an attack command for 40 hours.Last but not least, Grinding. There are too many good games classic and modern that need warning labels about how much they block your progression or enjoyment because of this curse. It seems way too hyperbolic to state that Earthlock simply has no grinding, it techinically does, but with good mechanical and subtle design it never needs to plauge the average player. Encounters are visible and can be avoided or engaged quite easily, but another feature is to lure encounters into 1 large outnumbering battle. When you risk these battles, your exp is dramaticly increased based on the size of the encounters, in fact fighting single enemies produces pitiful gains. In this fashion, the game encourages you to seek battles that might be more than you can chew. You never find yourself fighting the same list of encounters with a static exp increase. A more subtle feature is how the hub garden let's you literally farm for ammo and craft potions, but it's used when players are spending downtime between the more active chunks of the game. Other small things help like getting extra exp for not having anyone die, or making the level cap 20, or how upgrading the bonds gives you points to level up with. The amount of options and characters and pairs, while not staggeringly large, give players lots of room to deal and adapt to bosses and tough areas all the better.In terms of cons this game does have a handful or so. The engine and the collsion can be a little spotty when walking around, the control scheme takes a bit to get used to for using abilities and items, PAT takes a small while before he truly holds up as good as the other characters. A less nitpicking issue is that gold (or as this game labels it Daler) has very very little use in this game thanks to how the garden and crafting system works, or how items worth having are found in chests and at the end of boss battles. The game has some good consumable (non health restoring) items to use, but you never get them outside of the arena, and you cant take them elsewhere, so things that could be bought with currency just dont get to be used for some reason. In the end your Daler becomes obselete really fast, I felt that removing the Daler or making more shops would have integrated Daler perfectly.There's more subjective things to talk about like how the story and characters are begging to have more time in the spotlight at times, or how the game simply dosen't offer optional areas and even a fraction of side content that more popular games offer, But I state that for a kickstarted retro style RPG this is one the most polished and refined original titles to come out of 2016 and for a first time title from a new indie studio in Norway, That is incredible.I (Regrettably) did not kickstart this game and had only found a couple of reviews prior to buying and finishing this game, Therefore most of what I knew going in was minimal at best.

												JRPG's are a rather broad genre, and can focus on quite a few different things. This one is mechanics focused: lots of effort was put into making the battles easy to control and the game itself flows smoothly. The game is ""streamlined"", in that you don't spend time messing with equipment optimization, but there's still some choices to make with your character progression thanks to the ability to put different kinds of cards on your talent board. Level up, get a point, pick a card and slap it on the board, and you're on your way. Easy and efficient. The battles themselves are the usual turn-based type, and that's a good thing. The main innovation is that you get a multiplying XP bonus based on how many enemies you fight, so you're strongly incentivized to set up huge battles against swarms of enemies. Don't bite off more than you can chew... Mechanics-focused indie RPG's usually don't look like much, and this is the best thing about Earthlock. The game is beautiful, both in terms of the vibrant 3D environments and the high quality JRPG-style music that goes with it. Then there's the parts that didn't get as much attention. Namely, the story and characterization. There seems to be some sort of plot here, but the best thing I can say about it is that it mostly stays out of the way of the actual game. This is not a cinematic or plot driven game of any sort, so if that's what you want from your JRPG's you won't find it here. Likewise, the translation, while competent, is really awkward in some places, and i find the characters to be utterly forgettable.On the balance, I quite like this game. It's exactly what we were promised from Kickstarter: a game that captures the feel of the 3D RPG's of the PS1/PS2 era. And those games weren't exactly famous for their plots or translations either, exceptions excepted. It feels like this game is being overlooked by ... pretty much everyone, and that's a shame.[Disclosure, I recieved this game due to a Kickstarter pledge, which I do not consider to be getting the game for free.]			"

												Nice game, a cool throwback at classic JRPG's. Fantastic look and design, and a good turn based combat. A truly lovable game, don't expect it to be the great RPG of 2016, just a little nice game to pass some time and have fun.PS: I'd really like this game to become the first of many (either sequels or spiritual successors) with a bigger team behind it.

												This game is pretty awesome overall. I want to start off by saying this game is inspired by the great JRPGs of yesterday, with a unique artstyle and an amazingly genuine and beautiful soundtrack. The mechanics of the game are similair to any JRPG and has many of the tropes expected. The battle system takes a unique position on the stance/position mechanics which is refreshing and makes combat interesting and adds a layer of strategic resource management. Overall battles start out generally pretty easy and ramp up in difficulty in the fist few hours. Enemies are encountered similarily to Chrono Trigger or more specifically The Last Remnant, which is a positive becuase it does away with a bad JRPG trope, random encounters. (Yay)The world is beatifully designed and again the artstyle and colour pallet used fits the experience very well. The game is more vibrant than many RPGs in general and reminds me of Super Giant Games art director Zoe's colour choices for Bastion or Starbreeze's Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons with a bit more variety. It definitely has an indie game vibe about it's aethetics and thats not a bad thing by any means (Unless your a graphics nazi). Overall puzzles are quite easy but fun so solve and treasures are not difficult to find. I was hoping for a more playstation era vibe when it comes to secrets and hidden treasure or quests. Things that take a little more consideration and thought to discover.I love the soundtrack. It is very remenisent of Nobou Uematsu, Yoko Shimomura, mixed with a light version of Darren Korb, also from Super Giant Games (Bastion, Transistor, soon to be Pyre). Each song syncs up with the desired atmoshperic feeling the developers want to convey. I cannot say enough good things about this OST. Eiko Nichols is outstanding in my books.There is a fun crafting/gardening system. Ive never played many traditional JRPGs with a gardening system, let alone one that was simple to understand yet fun to indulge in. Skill/talent/bond systems are quite unqique and allow a degree of customization in where and how you level your stats and abilities. The talent system for example allows you to determine which type of attributes you want to gain depending on your play style, and in turn, your placement of these attributes on a grid system, also determines which abilities you obtain and when. Its not perfect but it is different and does allow some customization. The story so far isn't about crystals, or people being crystals, or searching for crystals so its decent in my books. The writing reminds me of a PS1 era JRP so thats great.Overall the game is very enjoyable. Ultimately its a great first installment in the series that appears to be a light version of a Final Fantasy JRPG type game. I have a lot of faith in this game and this company. Moving forward I know they will improve upon the things mentioned above and continue to produce outstanding experiences.			"

												Earthlock is a nice little gem of a game. I'm quite happy I purchased it and it was well worth the money. I'm hoping for a follow-up game from the devs with better writing. However, when you have 7 other languages to translate it into I understand.Pros:-Graphics - are nice and colorful but can also change as you progress in the game to be dark and dense nicely matching the place you are currently going. The diversity is great and the maps are littered with beautiful vistas. Seeing the battles and the artwork were the main draws to the game for me.-Battles and Fights - are really quite fun and every character has two stances. Some characters might focus on buffing and damage which others focus on healing and damage and others have a melle and ranged stance. It's quite nice and you'll find yourself switching in and out of stances at times to get the best results. You don't have magic either you have a number of amri (abilitiy points) that you can use and some moves require more than others. It's fairly wel balanced and tweaking the talents and bonds system allows for more customization.-Leveling up system/talents/bonds - Leveling up does make a difference but something else that is quite cool is the bond system. Every character can bond with another. The point of doing this, outside of adding 3 unique points to your talent board is that it will grant the characters more unique abilities that when they are paired can make them stronger. This comes in handy when fighting certain bosses. On most fights you don't need to tap into these abilities but it's worth it when you fight difficult bosses. If you outlevel the bosses they can be easy but if not considering how to fight can be quite fun and worth your time. If you take the wrong character combos and don't consider what you need to win you will die in battle.-Music - The compositions and score are quite nice. I had a great time listening to the music and never wanted to turn it off. Of course battle music may wear on you after awhile but I still enjoyed it. The sound effects aren't brillant but they're decent and they worked and were never immersion breaking.-Languages - Lots of support for other languages in an RPG is hard to find. If you want to pratice another language or learn one it's not a bad idea to open the options menu and have it switch over. You don't need to restart the game and it works like a charm. I tested it with Chinese, since I'm learning Chinese and it was fast and easy. It's something most people won't care about but it's quite nice!-Fun Factor - I always felt like I wanted to play the game. It rarely ever felt too grindy or like a chore. I wanted to progress and explore and kill all of the bosses. Dungeons weren't too long and the game was just a blast to play through.Cons:-Storyline - It's not brillant. It's not awful but... being a veteran to many rpgs I was rather dissapointed with quite a bit of the dialogue. One of the characters who arguably does draw/stretch out the lore is often told to zip it. While this makes sense it would have been nice to find ways for the characters to ask questions as opposed to just ask him to shut up most of the time. They character dialogue when they spoke to each other wasn't interesting either. They didn't really say anything witty or clever most of the time. There were a few jokes but they didn't do it for me. If you want a wonderful story you will be a bit crestfallen.Minor Annoyances:-There are 2 characters who did not have an animation when they finished two sections of the game that are required. It just seemed off though since I started grining this to level up my bonds/abilities.-Garden Growing - Early in the game you are taken to a garden section where you grow plants to get the best items for two characters as well as healing items. This section can be quite fun but it is also grindy and you HAVE to do this for the best attack items for 2 of the characters in the game. I said this earlier and didn't mind it much but it might bother other players.-Teleportation is nice but there to teleport anywhere you first have to teleport to a main hub. It's not a huge deal breaker but it will take you about 15 extra seconds to do this and you may do it a fair amount of times.-No weapons/armor to upgrade. I personally don't mind but if you love equipping new gear you will be a bit upset.TL:DR+ Graphics+ Battles+ Leveling up/Bond and Talent System+ Nice Music-Storyline and writing isn't great because of 8+ languages supported.

												This game feels unfinished. I'm about 80% of the way through, and nothing has happened except some shark man who I call ""uncle"" has been kidnapped and I've spent most of the time grinding mobs to level up. It honestly feels like the whole game is intro to a bigger better game. I'll probably finish it, because it's not a bad game by any means. But the plot isn't very interesting. Pros> The battle experience system is good - taking on more mobs gets you bonuses. It's almost always worth rounding up lots of enemies, than fighting them individually. > The gardening/growing ammo is a neat idea. > The artwork and animation is pretty good> Good boss battles, challenging and require some thoughCons> The normal battles are fairly boring. Same tactics used each time. No in game help that lets you see what enemies are weak to what. > The gardening is a good idea. But like the plot, it feels half finished. > The frog island feels unfinished - like, they had plans for weapon upgrades and clothing and stuff, but then didn't implement it. There is clearly space for a blacksmith, and some other stuff at the base Island, but it's never used. Eg, the library also seemed like it was going to be used for something. Instead, you just go in and then use a room upstairs to rest. A lot of the game spaces in towns are like this - no purpose to them, but it seems like they were planned to have a purpose at some stage. > Extremely frustrating to have to leave an area to replenish HP. Why not just have the frog statues let you replenish your health? Instead, you have to teleport to base, run around, find the rest area, warp back, and all the monsters have respawned. Instead, just make 99 of the cheap health potions and use them to heal up. In summary, the game is enjoyable, but feels unfinished, like only half of the ideas they had made it into the game. Search google images for ""Earthlock Map"" and you'll find two different maps. One is a small map of a peninsula and the other is a huge multi island map. The small map is the entirety of the game. The other map is just lore as far as I can tell. There are three ""over world"" areas and all of them are tiny. Once again. Feels Unfinished.Hard to recommend. I'm giving it a thumbs up, because it's not a bad game. It's just not what it could have been.  "

												EARTHLOCK: Festival of Magic is an adventure RPG game with fantasy themes, and enjoyable single-player gameplay. Earthlock's story is something that I am still learning, but its story takes place in the world of Umbra, where a cataclysmic event occurs that stops the planet from spinning. This leaves part of the world scorched by constant sunlight, part of it perpetually cold due to lack of sunlight, and a patch of livable land in between. The incident ends up burying much of the past advanced civilization, but humanity survives and society begins anew in the habitable part of the planet. The story follows the adventurer known as Amon, a boy from a desert city called Zenit. Although he usually scavenges ruins, he eventually gets entangled in a conflict with a ruling Empire, when his uncle is kidnapped, and an artifact he owns is trying to be taken from him.The game's combat is reminiscent of some older RPG games, and has a turn-based system where each character can choose their attack, magic attack, or buff. There is also an MP system in the game, called Amri, and you must use it in order to use characters' special attacks and magic attacks. There is also a ""battle bonds"" system that gives passive buffs to characters that fight together over time, and they seem to increase the more battles you do.In its combat, there is an EXP system, and when characters level up, you can apply talents to their talent boards that increase stats, give them a new ability, or give them special defenses and buffs.Earthlock's open-world gameplay is quite fun. In the cities, there are NPCs and buildings that you can visit, as well as some shops in certain areas, but in the overworld areas, there are enemies of numerous kinds, each having their strength and weaknesses. Many of the game's enemies have an elemental weakness and strength, or a weakness to a certain type of attack, be it piercing, slashing, crushing, etc. There are many different types of locations to be found in the game too, from swamps to deserts to temples, and more! The locations and the soundtrack of Earthlock are my favorite aspects of the game, and the environments are beautiful and unique. The game also has a crafting system that allows you to create ammo, potions, spells, talents, resistances, and some other things as well. As you explore the world of Umbra, you'll find various seeds for plants that you can plant when you reach an island in the game, and when grown and harvested from, they provide you with key ingredients that you'll need to make important items. Though the plant-growing and harvesting process can be time-consuming, as long as you have a plant, it will be able to provide infinite resources, and as it levels up to level 3, it will give you more items per harvest than a level 1 plant.So far, Earthlock has been quite enjoyable, although the difficulty curve has been a bit difficult to adjust to, and I'll probably have to do some more grinding. Some of the puzzles can be tricky, as well, but overall, I quite like this game, and I think it should have some more recognition.Previously, I was encountering a glitch where the game would crash often for me. I contacted Snowcastle about the issue, and they released a patch that made it so that the game would work better for Windows 8 users, and I appreciate their efforts a lot, as I haven't had a single crash since then.I do have a few complaints that I have so far in playing Earthlock. There is a difficulty spike after a certain area in the game that other people have noticed as well. You will also likely have to do some grinding of some enemies in order to reach levels that make certain difficult future boss fights doable in a way that gives you a chance. Each boss has a different strategy, and it can be hard to guess what it is sometimes, but after time, you'll be able to find their weaknesses, and with enough patience and levels, you'll be able to finish the fight. Fortunately, the game seems to consistently have save-game statues before every fight, so that you can warp back to the island and rest up, as well as make items you might need, like more potions or ammo.I've also noticed a few issues with the dialogue, and sometimes I feel like the dialogue could be fleshed-out better, but the characters do seem to have their unique personalities.Overall, Earthlock seems to be a very nice game so far, though. The unique and beautiful environments, gameplay, its absolutely lovely soundtrack, character designs, and graphics so far have been very enjoyable and quite nice to experience, and I think that this game is quite fun to play, and it has quite a bit of potential. I hope that the developers can recognize and deal with the difficulty spikes, and make the game a more smooth experience, but I still like the game quite a bit so far, and I do not regret buying it.I would recommend Earthlock to anyone who enjoys RPGs with turn-based combat, and anyone who enjoys open-world adventures. ^.^			"

												The first thing I noticed about the game was how nice the music was. The character animations are kind of meh, but having cut my teeth on Final Fantasy (the first one) and being wowed by the isometric JRPGs of the 90s this is a lot like going home except without all the weird japanese references. The shop signs are all in a strange language so I have no freaking idea what they are supposed to say but that's not really why you play the game. The combat is turn based and can be quite challenging if you aren't up on your tithes in the holy church of RNJesus. There isn't a lot of room for powerleveling in the early game and the first true boss can be VERY difficult if you just ran straight to him. Don't forget to save... and make sure it saved cause a few times I clicked save and then died cause I went somewhere I wasn't supposed to and found out it did not in fact save.If you are familiar with the genre it's what you expect; flat characters, bad dialogue, stupid character animations, and a questionable story hook. If you aren't familiar with the genre, see the previous sentence on what to expect. I greenlit this years ago and was sad it took so long to come out and so far it's been worth the $30 bucks. I can't imagine myself playing it a 2nd time since there doesn't appear to be any alternate ways to build the characters in the early game.			"

												I just sat down to play this game for the first time tonight (previously it wasn't launching on my computer, but I guess they fixed whatever the issue was), and before I knew it, it was over six hours later, I was hungry, and I desperately had to go to the bathroom.I don't remember the last time I've been so drawn into a game. The feeling is, of anything, most reminiscent of the first time I played Final Fantasy VII.And yet, despite the similarities (mostly the combat system), Earthlock manages to feel fresh in a lot of ways, and changes things up regularly. I'll likely update this review when I finish the game, but six hours in, I'm enjoying it immensely, and I didn't want to hold off on recommending it to others.			"

												Earthlock is a hidden gem. It challenges you with its heavy strategy based combat and plays well on nostalgia with its beautiful art style. There are some small flaws in the game but they are greatly outweighed by the charm is has to offer. The talent system is a great way for you to customize your characters, the farming aspect can be tedious but gets quite addicting if you’re not careful, and the bond system involved with each character is a great addition. The game allows for a variety of combat styles and strategies which is what sold me on this old school RPG.			"

												It's fun. Reminds me of the old Playstation 1 JRPGs. Final Fantasy, Breath of Fire, Legend of Dragoon, ya know the classics. I don't think it's very long. Beat the lizard boss in the manor and my save says ""18%"" (only 2 hours of play time) as of the time of writing so take that as you will. It is one of the prettier games I've seen made with Unity. The writing is passable so far but the world seems neat something about the planet stopped spinning. Verdict: It's pretty darn good. It's an indie ode to the JRPGs of old and is well worth it. Especially on sale. "

Earthlock: Festival of Magic is a simple yet very enjoyable JRPG set in a mystical world of danger and adventure. General GameplayIn Earthlock you’ll play as Amon and his group of have-a-go heroes as they adventure through Umbra. The story is light-hearted but fits well with the JRPG genre and though it isn’t overly ‘deep’, it does the job of keeping you interested in the characters and wanting to find out more as the game goes on. There are some nice bits of lore throughout the game and some character development that, hopefully, will lead into a sequel.The gameplay is intuitive and relatively simple to learn - a huge plus for me is the fact that the game is fairly straightforward. There are dungeons along the way you can explore and you can veer off a little and do you own thing but your direction is clear and the story path is easy to follow.Earthlock uses the usual JRPG turn-based combat style of choosing whether you want to attack/use items/rest and though it seems easy at first, once you start meeting new party members and unlocking new talents and abilities you’ll find yourself having to think about your technique a little more. Your party members can be ‘paired’ and will gain a battle bond whilst they fight together, giving them added passive advantages and a super ability when fully levelled. The combination of skills, abilities and stances gives you a huge arsenal to play how you prefer and allows you to take different approaches to taking on enemies.There is also a fleshed-out levelling system that allows you to pick and choose what you level in what order you want but also allows you to switch out talents/abilities/some stats if you’re not happy with them, if they don’t suit your playstyle or they aren’t working in a specific battle. You ‘craft’ talents which can then be used on any of your characters and also swapped out if you need to. Abilities are found throughout the world and sometimes gained when you level, these are mostly character based and can’t be changed. You can also earn ‘stat slots’ which increase a certain stat (e.g. magic, armour, agility) – this is the only way to buff your stats beside levelling.The graphics aren’t amazing but they don’t feel underwhelming either, they fit with the game style. The little pieces of art on the loading screen are fantastic, I wish there was a little more of it in-game (though there is a comic you can buy that I’m hoping has a similar art style). Pros++ Easy to learn gameplay. Everything is explained as and when you encounter new things.++ Delightful story with likeable characters.++ Intuitive but not overly complex puzzles. None of them are too difficult but not even one feels cheap or easy either.++ One of those games you can find yourself getting lost in for hours – 22 hours playtime in a week.++ Brilliant soundtrack that fits with the game world. I probably spent longer than I should have just planting and harvesting seeds because the music was so relaxing.++ Really nice lore if you take the time to read it which is hopefully continued in the comic. Cons--Cannot skip enemy attack animations. This can become time consuming if you’re like me and prefer to fight a large group for more XP.-- You can only control your camera at certain points in the game, which has led me running into enemy ambushes unintentionally and not being able to see around me properly at times.-- No dungeon mini-maps. My memory is pretty bad so remembering which routes I’ve taken in corridors that all looked the same was kind of hard.-- Can be a little difficult at times with no warning meaning you need to grind up a level or so to pass some of the bosses.-- Little to no replayability. Once the game is over there isn’t really much to do. SummaryOverall, Earthlock is absolutely worth trying, especially if you’re a fan of JRPG’s that are a little more light-hearted. The gameplay is fun, the story keeps you interested and the overall experience is great. I completed the game in a week and had a lot of fun getting all the achievements so I’d happily recommend Earthlock: A Festival of Magic. The ending was fantastic and closed the game perfectly, and has kept me wanting a sequel so I hope these guys have something else coming.			"

												I would be recommending this game if it wasn't for constant crashing in some areas. Couldn't work out what was causing it but it was just being in an area, it could be in combat, out of combat, or even in the main menu. One of these areas was the very last dungeon including the final boss. Otherwise it ticks all the boxes for a short JRPG. Doesn't do anything amazing but it does things well. The few problems I have (other than the crashing) are just nitpicks really. Having to warp to base to recover health and then returning to the same spot is a complete waste of time, just the save point healing you would have made the game flow a lot better.Also farming plants gets boring pretty quick but if you want to use ranged characters you better have some patience.I'd say wait for the game to be patched before picking it up, though I noticed on the forum months ago people were complaining about it and it doesn't seem to have been fixed.

												Now I rarely write reviews, but since I feel like this game is often judged unfairly, I will make an exception.First off, I'm a fan of the Final Fantasy series (up until 10) and purchased the game after seeing it on a random Twitch stream because of it turn-based combat system. So, as many people I started playing with good memories of the FF games.I have played many similar games, but so far, this is actually the first one that managed to capture the mood and greatness of a past era. I wasn't blown away at first, but given time, I grew attached to the game's atmosphere, its characters, music and its combat system. It actually managed to do something that Final Fantasy VII never could: having likeable characters, of which you can't decide which ones you take into your party, since you don't want to leave any out.I feel like many play about 4-5 hours and give their review, which results in the reviews not doing the game the justice it deserves. But I'm now almost 40 hours into the game and I'm really enjoying it. It has clean, well-polished graphics, a bug-free system and a very interesting background story. I spend about twenty minutes reading through all the shelves in the Owltide Library, which give an insight into how the civilizations and races found in the game came to be. I especially liked the detailed little side-stories, where someone accidentally finds something important, but ends up short of funds, looks for a sponsor, but after some struggle ultimately makes an impact onto the world (Not going into detail to avoid spoilers). All those credible stories and character's interactions imbue the game's world with life and allow you to immerse into it and enjoy the time you spend there.I can really recommend to support this game's developers by purchasing it and sincerely hope that they will continue creating such games, ignoring all those nasty ratings of people too narrow-minded to appreciate something great even if it stands right before them.

												EARTHLOCK: Festival of Magic (EL:FoM) is a decent and a competent RPG, inspired by various JRPG released last decade. However unlike those JRPGs, EL:FoM lacks originality and depth. Underneath the passable graphics are layers of wasted potential and missed opportunity.One thing I really dislike about EL:FoM is the absence of an equipment system. Players cannot equip nor buy any weapons/armours. This makes money widely unimportant to gather as the only thing you will be able to buy are mostly crafting materials. No, you do not get to craft any weapons/armours.Battles are a breath of fresh air after a lot of Final Fantasy clones made using RPGMaker sold on Steam, though it might take some time getting used to it using the keyboards. It does have it's own weakness, however. For example, players are forced to remember the enemy weakness since you cannot view the details of an enemy in battle. To make matters worse is there's no indicator for exploiting enemy weakness, like in Persona 3/4 and Pokemon. This causes me personally question whether my attacks are effective or not. Another disappointment are the story. The story is hardly interesting, with some overly complicated lore made probably by Kickstarter backers. The awkward dialogs does not make it any better, I'm afraid. Basically, your character found an ancient artifact and goes on an adventure (with a complete stranger) to find out what exactly does the artifact contain. After a few hours, I got bored with it and simply stopped caring about the whole plot. The biggest turnoff for me about this game are the characters. I swear, sometimes I could not even remember the MC's name due to how incredibly uninteresting he is. The other characters are no better, especially the dark skinned and bright hair coloured woman. Some might call her character tough with a no nonsense attitute, I'd say she lacks empathy and can get obnoxious at times.Final Verdict: Good enough RPG but clearly not enough meat on it's bones. Better buy it on sale.			"

												A very pretty, but deceptively tricky JRPG with some challenging boss fights. I really enjoyed playing through this game, though some of the characters and dialogue are a little flat. The best part, weirdly, is the gardening section where you harvest ammunition for your rifle. It would have been nice to be able to buy armour upgrades too.			"

												Okay, this game intrigued me since I first heard about it. As a huge fan of old school JRPGs such as Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest this was right up my alley. So naturally I backed the Kickstarter, and was thrilled when it exceeded funding.I've been eagerly awaiting this game on the same caliber as Dragon Quest VII and Final Fantasy XV. So was it worth it? Oh yes. The game was developed by a small team, so it has that ""indie game"" vibe to it, but it takes the classic JRPG formula and throws some awesome unique flavor to it. I'm not one to read super long reviews though, or write them for that matter, so here's a list of pros and cons for the gamePros:- The artOh my god is this a beautiful game. The colors, and areas are beautiful, with unique character designs, amazing locales, and an old school overworld. The best part of the already amazing art though, is it's unique style. Unlike many Japanese style RPG styles developed by a small team, it doesn't look like it's stealing it's style from FF, DQ, Tales of, etc.- The battle systemA turn based RPG really has to have a unique battle system to shine, and Earthlock really does. The characters can build bonds between each other through combat, and learn passive abilities. Also in battle every character has two stances, which really makes combat strategic and fun. Also, a lot of turn based RPGs in general suffer from long battle animations which make battle a slog. Not Earthlock. The battles are crisp and smooth, delivering fluid beautiful combat, that flows perfectly, and doesn't slow down the game a bit.- The storyAdmittedly I'm not super far in yet, but it's been very good so far. No JRPG tropes of amnesiacs, destroyed hometowns, awkward romance between childhood friends etc. I'm not quite at the point where the story has ""took off"" per se, but I have no reason to believe it won't be great.- The charactersOnce again, I don't believe I'm far enough to see the characters truly develop but every character has had a unique personality without relying on a tired trope. Plus there's a character named Frogboy. How can you not love that?- The music The music is absolutely gorgeous and captures the feel of the game perfectly. Like the art style, it's a completely unique style that doesn't feel like an intimation of another game.- The hub islandI'm not a fan of ""crafting"" games, but the hub island you find a few hours in adds a lot of fun and depth to the game. You can grow plants to craft items from, and as someone who put 100 hours into Stardew Valley, this is an absolute joy to have a Harvest Moon lite thrown into an already very beefy RPG.Cons:- Controller buttons don't appear on screenI'm playing with an XBOX 360 controller, as it's my weapon of choice in my PCMR arsenal. Although the game recognizes it just fine, it shows keyboard buttons instead of the controller buttons in the menu, battles, tutorials, etc. Once again, it doesn't ruin the game by any stretch, as I've gotten used to it, but it's a bit of an annoyance. Hopefully the devs fix this and I can remove this as well.There you have it, overall there's a few small things that annoy me, that hopefully the devs patch out soon. However the pros overwhelmingly outweigh the cons. This game gives me that feeling of excitement, wonder, and awe as I had the first time I played FFIX, and I hope for the devs this can reach ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" so that they can maybe make a sequel one day.

												Fantastic, fun, with a pleasing mix of real time and turn-based action, an interesting plot, and puzzles that aren't a drag or distraction from the main game.  The game is on the pricier side, but it's a solid 30 hours of gameplay (or more if you are a completionist).  I hope they make a sequel!			"

												Loved it! <3Pros:- great art- pleasant music and sfx- fun battle system which feels unique- simple, cartoony, family friendly story- some epic, but not unfair, boss battles- runtime is perfect for this kind of game (appx 30h)- all achievements are possible to get without spending absurd amounts of timeCons:- still some bugs, for instance you can sometimes fall through the scenery, devs are working on itA surprisingly good debut JRPG for Snowcastle and hopefully the start of a trilogy or FF-like endless saga :)8/10			"

												This reminds me of one of the great late 90s RPGs. The text dialogue makes you feel more connected to the story. The battle system is a turn based that is just like FF10. Definitely worth the buy. Hopefully they develop some more games.Edit: After completing the game, I would still recommend it. It got a little buggy in certain spots of the game. I had several crashes in the railway area. It only took about 30 hours to complete and I think I could have completed it earlier than that. I like the amount of party customization available.			"

												I'll admit it: I came for the piggy.  His name's Gnart, by the way, and apparently he's a hogBUNNY.  I don't really see the bunny part, but I guess they were using that to justify the white fur.I'm glad I stuck around, though.  This game is worth it.  It's a real nostalgia trip to early 3D roleplaying games, but done effectively with nostalgia goggles.  It looks the way I REMEMBER games from that era; other developers looking to capture that feeling would do well to take a page from this game, using sleek modern lines with classical intent.  SnowCastle figured out which buttons to push and they delivered, over and over throughout this game.The Good:The music's fairly good for an indie game; it starts to drone on after a while but it has a lietmotif that is memorable and the transitions are well done.  The scenery is breathtaking and believable from a geological perspective (desert surrounded by mountains, forest in the lowlands, swamp at a river delta).  As an audiovisual experience it hits its mark.The world-building... wow.  While it's a little back-loaded, the creators went out of their way to make the setting robust.  In particular, the game sets about establishing its own idioms and jargon.  A little vocab for your convenience: Lys is the sun, a Cycle is one orbit around Lys, and a Moonrun is equivalent to one day (not a month, as I originally thought).  The concept of Earthlock’s planet Umbra is a heart of fantasy gold: the planet has stopped rotating and one half of it is in perpetual day, while the other is in perpetual night.  They track the passage of time by the movement of the moon (which is implied to circle the planet once a day by our standards).  The game puts a lot of lore in the fire and not all of it comes to fruition… that’s good if it’s the start of a series and I’m hoping that’s the case.Each character has their own flavor… you’re not likely to care for all of them but you will probably like at least one of them.  The game has context-sensitive cutscenes which trigger based on who is leading the party.  As such, you can switch in somebody you like to be your map icon and they’ll get more screentime.  I didn’t care much for the protagonist (Amon) so I had Gnart running around the entire game (Yes, I like piggies).  I thought this was a very novel approach to player preferences and I’d like to see it used in more JRPGs.Combat is excellent: each character has two “stances” which boast a separate set of abilities, doubling the utility of each team member and allowing them to fill two roles.  The aesthetic is sleek and easy to follow; icons on health bars let you know how long an effect will remain and give you the gist of its purpose.  You also have the freedom to customize your character’s stat priorities, so you can create interesting synergy with unusual strategies.  I loaded Gnart with speed-boosting talents and put him into Focus stance: he became a lightning bolt of buffs and whenever somebody else got a turn they hit like a mountain.  There are ways to make any team of four viable which is nice to see; often games with more than three characters will just write some off as throwaways.I have two issues with the combat system I’ll discuss later, but for the most part it was perfect.Random encounters aren’t random (a great move in modern RPGs): you can see opponents on the map and each represents one enemy.  One of the most entertaining components of the game is kiting them around so that more than one enters battle at the same time (which gives a bonus multiplier to experience).Stuff that could use Work:Stances are the big allure of the combat system, which makes it a pity that switching them in combat is so punishing.  Not only do you lose a turn switching stances, but your haste takes a hit and it takes longer to get your next turn.  This is incredibly frustrating and prevents you from switching stances more than a few times the entire game.  To the developers: I’d make normal stance switching accelerated (like the Quick Switch talent) and upgrade Quick Switch to make stance swapping instantaneous.Stances are also particularly punishing for Olia and Gnart: Olia loses her counterattack immediately on switching stance (rather than holding out until her next turn, like it should) and all of Gnart’s buffs fall off the party immediately when he switches stance (something no other buffing character has to deal with).  To the developers: make Olia’s counterattack a one-turn duration refreshing effect and stop removing Gnart’s buffs when he switches to Mage—they’ve already got a timer on them, that’s enough of a power balance.Stuff I’d pass on next time:PAT.  I know it’s a trope of the genre being evoked, but the quirky robot speaking in blips annoyed me.  Personal preference I guess; the bot was viable as a combat option but in dialogue I rolled my eyes every time it talked.Overall the game was very satisfying and difficult to put down.  I’d buy a sequel in a heartbeat… if it had Gnart in it, that is.			"

Posted: September 28, 2016
												I really love this game, and its universe, but I have a hard time recommending it. EARTHLOCK has some great ideas, but the game is too small, too short, to allow these ideas to breathe. Making them feel halfdone. I'll definitely look forward to any game these guys create in the future. Let me first talk about the combat system; There are 6 characters, each with two different combat-modes that you can switch between. There is also a battle-bond system, you team your party members up 2-and-2 and they'll form a bond. From 1 star to 5 this battle bond unlocks unique passives that strengthen different playstyles. (You can change bonds whenever you want without loosing any progress)There is a third mechanic to the combat system and that is the talent board. Each character has a talent board with set amount of plugs. There are Abilities, Perks and Traits. Perks gives different passives and buffs, Traits give you statpoints and Ability gives you skills you use in your combat-mode. Unlike other talent-tree systems in other games, EARTHLOCK allows you to change what is in the plugs whenever you want. So as you play the game, you'll find new abilities that you can change out the ones you already have. Meaning if you prefer one battle-mode over the other you can build your talent-board around this.The negative to this is that there isn't enough options, making the system feel halfdone, or too big for the game. Throughout the game, you feel you have options, you're finding skills and changing them out. But in the end, there's barely any choices. Not to mention the characters whose second combat-mode is simply buffs, The universe is beautiful, with no UI when walking around you get to truely appreciate the backgrounds and the details the developers have put into it. And god! Some scenes are amazing. But again, it feels rushed. At the beginning, I'd explore like I'd explore a proper rpg: I'd talk to bookshelves and crates lookings for loot and idiotic lines from books. But nothing. I could not interact with anything outside of the quest items, and that felt.. odd to me. It wasn't natural. Especially considering later in the game there WERE bookshelves I could talk to, in the giant library, out of the dusin bookshelves I could talk to TWO. TWO!! Who the heck programmes only two bookshelves to be interactables and not the rest?The game is advertised as an old-school JRPG, and that casuals should look elsewhere. I disagree. Oh how I disagree. This game isn't hard, this game is laughable easy. Sure, sure, if I ran into a boss without healing up or preparing I'll swear and wish there was a flee button so I could prepare myself. Did I die? Sure, yes, of course. But because of my mistakes. Because I tried to avoid mobs and ended up in a combat versus 12 mobs when I had half HP and no ultimate ready. But the combat is easy, tedious at times (considering before Taika my skills would each hit 10%) But slow combat doesn't equal hard combat. Once I unlocked Taika as a party member, the rest of the game became a breeze, only difficulty came from me going for 100% achievements which forced me to run around the game with random characters with random bonds together. I don't know if Taika is simply broken, or if this is some bug. Taika has many AOE skills, if you meet 8+ mobs, Taika will hit them for the normal 10%. But unlike the other few (and rare) aoe skills the other character has, it seems Taikas damage stacks. Thats a bad way of describing it. Normally, an AOE will do X amount of dmg to X character. Taika's skill does XXXX dmg spread out. Meaning if I meet 8 mobs, she'll hit all of them for 10%. But as the mobs die, at the end her skill could one hit a monster. So yes, boss fights became very, very, easy.  (While the other characters aoe would do the same dmg no matter how many or few monsters we encountered)Part of the difficulty of this game is lack of information: There is no information on skills, buffs, debuffs, dmg, or levels. You don't know what level monsters are, and you don't know what that debuff does. Your own skills got descriptions but they are limited. Which meant every time I encountered a new debuff, or buff, it was a trial-and-error playstyle. They had some interesting buffs and debuffs. Like one that reflexs all magical damage onto who casts it. I killed myself once or twice trying to figure out what that new icon under their hp bar meant. But once you figured it out it was ""oh I cannot kill him now, I'll just click rest for three more rounds untill it disappear and then kill him"".To sum up: + Beautiful universe+ Seemless graphics+ Talent Board, changeable talents+ Garden+ Beautiful graphics.+ No UI (outside of combat).+ Puzzles.+ 6 Characters, 4 party slots.+ Each character has two combat-modes, which you can change between. - Some combat-modes are useless.- No skip-button for scenes- No Flee-button - Cannot sell items to merchants- Advertised as a hard oldschool jrpg, which would have been fine if the game hadn't been so easy. - Unbalanced characters (Compare Taika's AOE with anyone elses AOE) - The game kept trying to babysit me, every time I met a boss, I got a long speech about how this boss might be too hard,  and we might not be able to defeat him and might need to change my tactic. Every time I beat the boss without issues. The large groups of monsters outside were a bigger challenge than the bosses.- A few combat freezes, if I killed too many monsters at once or something there would be a few seconds where nothing happened. Like the game was thinking. Now that's a lot of negative things, so why am I still recommending it? Because it's a beautiful game.I wish the developers would go back and spend another year on it, add another 20 levels and allow us to interact with useless things more. Who knows, maybe they'll add an DLC! I love the universe, I love the frogs, and I like the characters.(Though I wish there were more scenes where the characters interacted with eachother, giving me the time and oppertunity to fall inlove with them. As it is, the ending just made me roll my eyes)			"

												Take the game for what it is, this isn't a tripple A game from an experienced developer, and expect that it will have flaws, this way you will most likely enjoy the game a lot more. I have faith that the developers are working around the clock to fix the most important issues with the game, and as I understand some of the reviews about the game crashing are outdated.As a first project and for the price this game goes at (Especially now on sale), I would recommend this game for everyone interested in the JRPG genre. They will be releasing an episoe 2 and I have no doubt that these games will get better!I am excited about the future of Earthlock			"

												A short but fun jRPG.  Took 22 hours to 100%Firstly, the artstyle and graphics are truly beautiful; at first glance you wouldn't have thought this was a kickstarter project!The OST, though it can get a bit repitive at times, is also very good. It reminds me a lot of the music from Dark Cloud.The story was, for me, definitely the weakest part of the game.  It starts off pretty slow, and before you know it, you're 3/4ths done with the game before really seeing anything happen. There are some noticeable typos as well, and the writing doesn't really feel like it fits the plot.There were a few bugs I noticed; sometimes a character's action doesn't register so it prompts you for another action, causing two abilities to go off simutaneously.  This was different from the Double Attack perk talent.There's also some issues with the crystal geometry, mainly seen near the end of the game.  You're able to softlock by climbing up a crystal and being unable to get down.It's quite a fun game, but I'm not -too- sure it's worth the $30 price tag.			"

												This is exactly what I needed.I was waiting so long for Final Fantasy XV and then it ended up playing very different than any other FF game, so I had this massive unmet craving for a Final Fantasy-style-turn-based-combat game.This game has interesting characters, an intreaguing storyline, and a very nice combat system.  Graphically, I have seen a lot of people compare it to Torchlight.  It is clearly inspired by games like Final Fantasy, and is a homage to them in the same way that Evoland is to Legend of Zelda.I look forward to the opportunity to back the next Earthlock game if it ever comes to Kickstarter.  One suggestion for improvement:  it might be nice to have weapon upgrades available for some of the non-ranged characters.			"

As someone who has played virtually every jrpg prior to about 2012, I'd place the general style and game play in the 1999-2003 region. So if you're looking for something that feels a bit aged but well made and not something that purely relies on graphical quality and gimmicks, this might be a good fit for you.			"

Product received for free
IntroductionEarthlock: Festival of Magic is a classically inspired, turn-based, 3D Adventure RPG. Rather than setting out on the typical cliché RPG quest to the save the world, the ragtag band of misfit characters all have their own reasons to be exploring the world. They simply join each other out of convenience rather than some misguided heroic notion. With the ability to change your stance and thus change your abilities, the combat system in Earthlock: Festival of Magic adds an extra layer of strategy to what otherwise would be common RPG style fights.GameplayEarthlock: Festival of Magic is much like any other RPG of this style that you have played. Your team of up to four characters all head out to the world map to find their way to their current destination. While they all have their own motives and reasons, they will slowly grow bonds between them and be stronger for it. The Bond system is one of the features that sets Earthlock: Festival of Magic apart from other typical Role Playing Games. You can have up to four characters in play at any given time, but there is an extra layer of strategy that will come in to play here as well. Characters are grouped into pairs on the battlefield, and the characters that are paired together will form a bond between them. The longer they are paired, the stronger it will grow and new abilities will be added and talent (skill) allocation points will be earned. This encourages you to not only ensure you keep rotating your partners to make certain they gain all the talent points they can, but also to partner those together that give the best perks for whichever area or battles you are in.Another unique element is the farming system. Rather than just buying your ammunition or items, you have the ability to grow the plants required to produce them yourself. The simple farming system has you finding seeds, planting them in your garden and watering them. One they are ready to harvest, which takes only moments, you can harvest them. The plant itself is not damaged, and will grow again if you water it. Harvesting from a plant a sufficient number of times will cause it to level up or possibly mutate. Leveling up produces more crops per harvest, and a mutation gives a seed for a new variety of that plant. You can then take all your crops you have and craft them into the various ammunition or items you will need during your adventure.As mentioned earlier the game has talent points rather than typical RPG automatic skill increases purely at level up. These talent points allow you to shape your character’s stats and abilities. To upgrade your character, you have a proper tile to place and a talent point to place it. There are some generic tiles that will work for anyone and then there are those that are tailored for specific characters. The generic ones come in two flavours, the one that just boosts your stats, and the other than changes an aspect of the game or adds new abilities. Typically, after a boss battle you will gain one of the latter tiles as well the ability to craft additional units of that tile. The others are commonly found after some battles or in chests.The game is broken into two types of screens: the world map and the zone map. Both are basically the same idea, however, the world map lets you walk between zones, fighting battles on your way, and the zone usually has unique puzzle elements to it as well as the battles. Battles in this game are to some degree optional. If you don’t feel like fighting, you can avoid the enemies as you are able to see them wandering around. Each unit you see walking around the screen is typically a single monster for you to fight. A more unique feature however is the fact that you can deliberately attempt to fight multiple enemies at a time. You simply run past an enemy and have it pursue you until you have wrangled up as many as you are willing to fight. This will make the battle far more challenging than had you soloed them all, but it also gives you bonus experience due to being outnumbered. The battles are a speed-based turn system. You can see the order in which the battle will unfold, and unless an ability is used that slows or speeds up a unit, the order shown will be how the battle will play out. This adds a layer of strategy to the game as you are able to make a plan about who you should be focusing on for your current turn rather than just always targeting the weakest one.There are puzzles in each of the zone maps that you must solve to progress. These puzzles can be as simple as finding the key to unlock a door, or using coloured lights to unlock a device. One zone even had a unique twist where you had to try to make it to the next sliver of shade in order to avoid passing out from the extreme heat of the area. These puzzles add a level of challenge and interest to the game and makes for a more fun experience overall.The game works well with both the keyboard and mouse or with a gamepad. I played it mostly with the gamepad and found it to be highly responsive and worked well with that setup. The interface takes a little getting used to but once you have it figured out, it actually works very well.The only really bad things I have to say about this game is that it requires you to grind a lot of enemies fairly often and that you can't usually rotate the camera. If you have been attacking single enemies everywhere you went, you will be in severe trouble when the boss shows up. Even if you have been heavily overwhelming yourself by wrangling every enemy you can into battle, you will still have trouble when the boss shows up. This leads you to need to waste time fighting the same groups of enemies repeatedly until you gain enough levels to be able to struggle your way past the boss. Some might argue that bosses should be extremely challenging, and while I might agree, having to redo the battle repeatedly and getting lucky is far less fun than having a fair shot at killing the boss due to being a sufficiently high level to face it in the first place.Graphics and SoundThis is a very charmingly cartoonish looking game. The visuals really do fit well with this style of game and is sure to have nostalgic appeal to those of us who played games at the turn of the millennia. Each area you visit also has its own design and look to it which greatly enhances the experience. No two areas really look that much alike and it shows that a lot of care and attention to detail went into the planning of the graphic designs of the game. The enemies on the other hand are not that varied in design. While there are plenty of enemies in this game for you to fight, there are quite a few that are just recolours of ones you previously fought. This leads you to fighting pretty much the same enemies everywhere you go with a few new ones tossed into the mix. It’s mildly disappointing, but is something that is common to these types of games so it shouldn’t really be considered that much of a detractor.The music is wonderful and really helps with the charm and appeal of the game with each area pretty much having its own theme music. For the most part, the sound effects are your standard RPG ones that are common to the genre. There is a distinct lack of voice acting in the game which I am not sure if it was done to add to the late 1990s feel of the game where speaking wasn’t that common, or if it was simply because they didn’t have the ability to record all the dialogue with the budget they had for the game. I know I always prefer it when the characters talk aloud in games, however at the same time I wouldn’t avoid a game for lacking that feature. Plus this way it avoids the risk of having a really annoying sounding character spoiling your experience!Overall Earthlock: Festival of Magic is a welcome addition to the RPG Adventure games available on Steam and has enough unique elements to it that I found it to be quite enjoyable.

												When I first purchased this game, I had quite a bad first experience. Since then, the studio have been in contact with me over the problems highlighted in my origional review, and gave me a key to review changes they recently made (as I had actually refunded the game, the first time I had ever dome this for a steam game.)The changes made in the recent update really overhauled the opening, and I know that my first experinace of the game would have been much much better if had found the game now. The tutorial was completely overhauled, and this section now guides you through their battle system bit by bit, rather than paralysing you with a wall of text information. The delivery of dialogue by characters has also been improved, now with small flourishes of acting from some characters when speaking, which really is a huge step up.I do wish the characters acted more, but this just didn't seem to be their aim with this game-- and that's ok. Since bringing it up, they have even worked to improve this, and I find that pretty admirable. From reviews I've read, I know this game is a pretty seizable experinace, so I cannot expect the same characterisation to be added into the entire length of the game; but it's now there at the start and it would have won me over if It was part of my first experinace.So yeah, if I bought this game now, I wouldn't refund it. I feel I can recommend it if you're looking for a longform RPG experinace with all the trappings of it's genre predecessors.Thank you to all the guys and gals at Snowcastle for taking the time to respond to player feedback in a bigger way than I have ever seen from any other studio, And thank you for not taking negative feedback as badly as many many indie studios seem to be doing these days. I wish you all the best in the future and look forward to seeing more of your games!			"

												As a long time fan of JRPG's I backed this when it was on kickstarter, and have waited in exitment since. Finally got it on my computer and so far I really like it! only just started playing som i will update the review as i get along.Really like the combat system that gives a variety of tactics to beat the more difficult enemies. The music is nice in the background without getting boring or annoying.I like the fact that they have opted for text boxes and dropped voice actors as listening through a lot of dialog can get me impacient.Well worth the money! I would recommend enyone getting this game and I am very happy I backed Snowcastle on their kickstarter campaign!			"

												Waited for this game for years and finally it`s here! I am just a couple of hours into the game, but I can already say that I abolutely love it. Nice and colorful, epic music, cool battle system, what more can you ask for?:) It`s been a long time since I had a this good feeling from the start. Games these days are way to advanced just to turn it on and play. Sure the battle system is tactical, but I didn`t need to read up for hours to get it. Looking forward to play the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of Earthlock this week:)			"

												I find this to be a pretty high quality indie game. It looks very cute but is quite hard.It has beautiful art, a bit simple animations, ok story and really good combat mechanics - it feels relatively fast for a turn basted type.I would like to see more equipment and side quests, but all in all I think this is a good game.Also, they changed the wall-of-text tutorial into an in-combat tutorial that works way better.

												A little over an hour into the game. Loving it so far. Lovely music, gorgeous art and puzzles to solve. Turn based combat and the ability to out-run critters if you don't feel like getting into combat makes this pretty relaxing to play so far. The added bonus are the languages the game is available in, great way to beef up reading skills  in a third language if that is of interest XD I recommend the game so far, shall update when I get a bit more time on it.

												In these days filled with fads and the ""must have the newest""-attitude, this game embraces what real gaming is all about: Storytelling. For those of us old enough to remember how it was to huddle in front of the warm glow of a gigantic CRT-screen blasting turned based rpg, completely immersed in the story...this game is definitely for you. However, it would be unfair (and untrue) to say this i just for the old gamers (old as in over 30...). Earthlock offers well written dialogue, interesting characters and a beautifully designed world which i engaging for people of all ages. The gameplay itself is easy to learn, but still gives you some new interesting takes on the well established (and much loved) turn based rpg. You will have hours to play around with abilities for your characters when it comes to combat. Which also has a cool new touch of letting you change stances which in return opens up for a more complex and diverse combat experience. I still have hours left to play and I absolutely will. I am hooked and I am sure you will be too if you give it a shot. Incredible game made by a dedicated hard working team. Download it and see for yourself. :)			"

Product received for free
												I have played the game for 75 hours on Xbox One. Don't let the time played fool you. Here is a nice video preview which I made which'll help you decide if you want it or not.


YouTube™ Video: Earthlock: Festival of Magic Gameplay and Preview - September Games with Gold (Xbox One) 

			Views: 22,580		

			In this video, we show a preview of the game ‘Earthlock: Festival of Magic’ for Xbox One and Steam. Video was Recorded and Voiced by The Hidden Levels one and only Manic Ado.		

 Positives:Music is beautiful – Through the most RPG games I play the music is always top notch and beautiful. Earthlock is no exception to this and provides a beautiful soundtrack to go a long with the game. Although the soundtrack is nowhere near the level of Final Fantasy or any other big RPG games, it was still enough for me to highly praise and enjoy it.A great RPG experience – Earthlock is everything you seek from a more ‘classic’ RPG experience. This game is turn based and relies mostly on strategy. You are level capped at 20 and towards the near end of the game the enemies get tenaciously strong. If you don’t pay attention then it’s easy to get a party wiped and hit a game over screen. There aren’t any voice overs in the game and it relies more on just being able to read the text on the screen as it pops up. I preferred this over the voice acting as it gave me more engagement. Not the farming you’d expect – In RPG’s, especially MMO’s farming revolves around killing the same monster repetitively in the hopes of getting rare loot. Earthlock however takes the meaning literally as you have farm land in which you can plant seeds and then harvest them for materials when they are ready. I spent quite a lot of time doing farming because I enjoyed the relaxed style of it. Character change – This is a really minor positive but one I enjoyed. I really liked how you could swap between characters when in the actual game. In some instances this required swapping to a smaller character to get to a place inaccessible by other characters.Unique Talent and levelling system – For each character you are presented with a board full of squares where each time you  level up you get a talent point and can put a talent card in an empty square. You can also get talent points by levelling up bonds with each characters and certain squares required skills which you can find the cards in loot and chests. Negatives:Selecting an enemy to hit – Depending on your camera angle, choosing an enemy to hit can be frustrating and annoying at times because it’s super sensitive and only rotates to certain characters. This sometimes left me hitting myself and healing enemies.A lot of the NPCs are just filler – Most the NPCs in the town just wander around aimlessly providing no text option or talk. Even in certain cities they were walking around and into each other stuck in an endless cycle of doom. The walking detection on them was very poor.Camera Angles – The camera angles on the game are not so great. It uses the fixed camera pivoting in one position. On some scenes this caused a huge amount of frustration and some scenes where running into a blind corner led into me running straight into enemy mobs.No option to sell – Being a hoarder sometimes I would get duplicates of items I wouldn’t want duplicates of, for instance seeds and recipes. I wish there was an option to sell so I could sort my inventory out perfectly the way I want things.No minimaps – The only map on the Earthlock is the overworld map. I would’ve loved if they had an area map too with the location name. For instance, I had no idea where “Konkylian Plains” were and when referencing a boss is located there makes it hard to find.You. Are. Dead – Later on in the game there is Ice Regions of Nunaar Station. This part of the game is absolutely dreadful and almost ruined my entire experience of the game due to frustration and unfairness. The enemies are mobbed together in clumps meaning there is no way to sneak around very well or escape them and you will most likely fight between six to eight enemies per fight. These monsters are overpowered with deadly aoes and a very high attack speed that even when it was their turn I knew my maxed characters were going to die. The sound of ice constantly crunching and crackling was a very big nuisance and one which I did not like, I had to mute the games audio.Conclusion:Overall, I really enjoyed my time playing Earthlock and it provided me my fix of turn based RPG games which I really missed due to them being viewed as “outdated” or “old”. Earthlock was not brilliant and certainly flawed at times but I still enjoyed the experience it provided and really enjoyed my time playing it. I hope that more developers will follow suit in making turn based RPGs and not describe the genre as “outdated” or “old” because they simply aren’t. We also found out earlier this year with another game “I am Setsuma” which was another great example of the turn based RPG games really excelling.			"

Posted: March 28
												What a pleasant surprise this game was. I will admit, several red flags were raised prior to me buying this game. The $30 price tag, mixed reviews, Kickstarter, Unity Engine... But on the promise that it would take me back to old JRPGs I played as a kid, I decided to give Earthlock: Festival of Magic a chance. And I'm glad I did.Before the review proper I want to thank Snowcastle Games for putting so much effort into something that could easily have been one of many failed Kickstarter projects. I truly hope the small downsides and problems this game have will be fixed in the upcoming sequels. You guys said there was going to be a trilogy and I hope you stick to it.Now, for my somewhat lengthy review:The game is wonderfully crafted. You can tell a lot of effort went into the scenarios and the soundtrack. The art itself may not be for everyone, but it's hard to deny they knew what they were doing when they decided for it. The game, as stated, plays as an oldschool JRPG, so a few modern day luxuries, such as quick saving / save anywhere, are absent. But thankfully we don't have to deal with random encounters.Combat is surprisingly challenging, truly a remnant from bygone eras. I don't remember the exact line spoken by a game character, but it was something like ""a hammer and a key can be used to open a lock; both work, but one makes it significantly easier"", and this is what the game promotes. You are given many customisation options and it's up to you to decide which one to use for each boss. Expect a few game overs every now and then. The little tune that plays in the game over screen is also lovely, you almost forget this is your 4th failed attempt on the same boss.The story, which is what I value the most in a game like this, is a bit lacking. If you're a hardcore RPG fan like me, there is nothing you haven't seen elsewhere. You have the main character with a hidden past, a strong independent female co-lead who is not very good at being strong or independent, a few mascots, and a bad guy trying to take over the world. It's all here. The characters' backgrounds are mostly left unanswered.At the time of this review, there was a comic book DLC telling the story of two of them, which is not something I agree with, but it's something, I guess. It says comic book #1, so I assume there are more coming, which will rack up the final price considerably, for something that should have been in the game from the start.The game is also very short, with very little side stuff to do, and zero replay value. Took me 20 hours to clear the game with 100% achievements. And that's counting all the game overs. For $30 it might not sound like such a good deal, and this, along with the cliche story and DLC character stories, made me want to give a negative review, but I'd still reccomend it if you get it in a sale, or as a gift. It's a fun little adventure regardless.			"

												For a digital version of a game I hesitate to spend $29.99 in case I don't like it but there was just something about this game that drew me.  I'm so glad I spent the money!  The story is great, with just a touch of humor (Uncle Benjo's moves when he wins a fight), but not so much as to have a high cheese factor.  The story is also intriguing.  I'd say the graphics are a VHS quality, so not high end but definitely not pixelated.  It's just the style.  The colors and various areas you go into are VERY attractive.  Gameplay is straightforward, which I Like, and the tutorial is very helpful without being tedious.  If anyone knows how we can search for other games by the same publishers, can you let me know? There is this and a few others that I'd like to ""follow"" (on Amazon you can ""follow"" authors and Amazon will notify me of new releases).  The Steam recommended for me feature is usually pretty INACCURATE.			"

												I'm only 1 day into the game but so far impressed.  I read that it bears similarity to final fantasy 7 and 10 - Battle/Overworld system very much like final fantasy games, character's heads are a little big but you get used to the art, has sidequests and a feeling of freedom of movement early on, and it's readily apparent I'll need to return to some of these places later.  I read complaints that there is some grinding but feel that early battles just actually take some strategy - pair up your party for the situation you're facing and it'll go a lot smoother.  Seems like a pretty well thought out game.  Initial impression, good.  Maybe I'll have to grind a lot later, we'll see!			"

												This game is fun and is a great throwback, when its working.  The game will randomly crash when changing zones -- losing all progress since the last save.

												Game is crashing constantly, closing the game completely without a save, the characters get stuck and the only way to get them out is to load a game (and there are fixed save points, so you can't freely save the game whenever you want).So sad... Game is very fun but the number of crashes is rendering it unplayable. And from the comments section it seems as it was in this state since the release.			"

												I backed this game on kickstarter on a whim. I liked the cutesy artstyle and felt like playing a classic RPG again, so I just pressed the button and prepared for a let-down. Fortunately, I was proven wrong. The developers gave frequent updates, reacted to bug reports and criticisms (although one bug in particular, that you can fall through the ground on plumpet island on occasion, hasn't been fixed in the finished game) and delivered a finished game more or less on schedule. That alone almost deserves a recommendation. But how is the game?Let's be honest, it is not brillant. But I still enjoyed it.The story is pretty lacking. There is no voice acting, so the story is conveyed through speech bubbles, and since no one wants to read endless dialogue, there is not much to it. There are some books you can read for some additional lore but there is no rich story to be found. There are still some bugs, the aformentioned falling through the ground on plumpet island, and the game gets slower the longer you play. It also crashed a couple of times. But I didn't encounter any game braking bugs or save corruptions so it is definitely playable. I really enjoyed the artstyle, you can see it in the trailer and the pics, so see for yourself if it appeals to you. The background music was varied and relaxing, no complaints there. I liked the actual gameplay quite a lot. The fighting system is pretty straightforward. I strongly recommend playing with a controller, though (I used an xbox controller). The talent system allows you to give your characters different perks (mostly partial immunity against different attack types, strengthening different attack types, but also some special ones) and character upgrades (defence, offence, evasion, quickness, accuracy) and you can also add new abilities that you can find along the way. There is also a bond system: Depending on which two characters you pair with each other they gain different perks which can be quite powerful. You have 6 characters to choose from (you fight with 4). Taken all together, you have quite a large variety of fighting styles, whether you want to be more defensive or offensive, rely more on physical attacks or magic, melee or ranged or area of effect attacks, it is all up to you. All 'talents' (perks, abilities, upgrades) can be exchanged at any time so you can experiment quite easily and even adjust them to a particular boss fight if you want. I recommend the game for people who like classic RPGs, enjoy the artstyle and are looking for a not-too-complex game that still provides lots of variety in fighting styles. I would wait for a sale, though, 28 Euros are a bit steep, in my opinion.			"

												*Edited review because the beginning of the game was changed.Earthlock: Festival of Magic was a JRPG I kickstarted a while back. I was looking forward to a fresh jrpg that played as good as it looked from the preview screenshots. Sadly I got an mediocre jrpg that feels unpolished. It looks like this was Snowcastle's first game and you can really tell. There are a lot of flaws you can tell immediately from the get go, poor dialogue, music that cuts in and out suddenly, no animations on the characters, and bad camera control (there is no camera control really); to list a few.I'm not going to say the game is all that bad but the beginning definitely left a bad taste in my mouth as if you're used to more polished jrpg's this is definitely not it. It's not all doom and gloom, there are some positives to the game as well. The graphics are very nice to look at, the music is pretty decent, and the combat system is fast and feels good. Overall if I could give this game a 5.5/10 I would, sadly Steam only lets me recommend YES or No, and I'm going to have to give this game a NO. Maybe it's like FF13 where it gets good after a certain amount of hours, if I get there I will change my review, but until then I would save your money.*They did change the beginning tutorial portion of the game. I will say they significantly improved the way the tutorial is introduced, but not much besides that has changed. Still much needed improvements like this do get my hopes up that the developers listen to the players. Still going to give a no but a much softer no.			"

												I was really hoping to love this and i am so sad to be giving it a negative review. I just found that the negetives for me are unbareable and make the game a lot less fun! The biggest problems i had with it was how long it would take to get to where you are going and the fights would just drag on! At first it was fine and i was able to look past it, but then the enemies jumped from pretty easy to Having to fight them multiple times to win. There was no progression with the enemies. They went from really easy to really hard and it made the grinding a lot worse. Besides that you have to grind a lot and steal from enemies to eventually find what you need and these things together just don't make it fun for me. It ruins it!!! And i can't recommend this game under these circumstances.			"

												I get into RPGs for the story. Gameplay is a lovely addition of course, but this game seems to have focused entirely on that. The dialogue is so atrocious that I just can't wait for a save point to show up so I can stop playing it. Either they should have hired a proper writer or stripped the story out of this game and made it into a turn based adventure, either way it would be significantly better.			"

												The game looked like quite a bit of fun. Throwback to my favorite era of final fantasy and such. I was even excited for the (somewhat unbelievable/corny) writing that really gave that feel of a low-budget translation.Unfortunately the game feels like every other early release kickstarter title. In 30 minutes of playtime, I twice encountered bugs that caused me to have to replay ~5 minutes of the game, and once encountered a bug that prevented me from moving or performing any actions except swapping my visible character.I was excited to give it a try, but for $30, 3 game-breaking/ctd bugs in 30 minutes is a bit much.

												So I went into this game hopeful. The intro cutscene was a little lackluster with a thick dousing of fantasy garble. The first scene you play through you begin to notice the writing is a little forced and maybe not the games strong suit. Continuing past a leap-frog styled tutorial  you finnally get your hands on some combat, and its not much better. This continues for a few levels. And then it happens. You find youself infront of your first REAL boss which is actaully just a random mob by the name of something that started with a y and rolled around the keyboard for few strokes. You will know him as Buffzilla the 20 minute encounter. He cloaks himself so you can't attack him for three turns. all the while he is healing and shooting up buffs like a junky just out of the drunk tank. Your party members will have have a few turns to kill him before he goes ghost again and heals back whatever little damage you could pour onto him cause♥♥♥♥♥♥bro accuracy is a ♥♥♥♥♥. He is a standard mob encounter. COMMENCE THE GRINDING OR PEACE OUT. 3/10 PEACE'D OUT			"

												Oh gosh... couldn't get through more than 10 minutes of this game, the trailers make it out to be much more amazing than it truly is. The characters control terribly; there's a painfully obvious delay between hitting the button and the character actually performing whatever task (which really cannot be an issue with my computer since I've got twice the recommended RAM and I'm way beyond the minimum requirements, so what is the issue?). The music and the cut scenes are magnificent and then you reach the actual gameplay and you wonder what happened. Everything's just very janky and it's hard to connect with the characters when they barely even move during a conversation and there is no voice acting. It's honestly like watching two Sims just standing in front of each other silently with boring speech bubbles above their heads. I cannot believe that this game is £22.99, it's outrageously expensive for something this bad. Please do tell if you think this is a damn masterpiece that I need to give another go but I'm honestly in shock...			"

												Well this game seems to be in every aspect geared to the 8-10 yr old gamers to be honest. The graphics are good but the writing and actual gameplay are simple and basic. Ive not played it thru but from what ive seen the story is simple and not really going anywhere. Definately NOT worth 30$usd by any means. If you want pretty anime style looks and gameplay this game may be for you but still at a much lower price tag.			"

												Sadly, the minimum requirements listed for the game appear to be incorrect.  I am not at the bare minimum, but not that high above it, and experiences constant stuttering and freezes.   Twice within 20 minutes it hard locked my computer.			"

												It's not a deep review.I am fairly disappointed by this game because even the tutorial area and your first ""fights"" are bland and uninteresting.All doors locked, NPCs that don't say anything meaningfull, not a single drawer to open or anything somewhat hidden, basic combat as a flavourless turn-based thing that doesn't even try to hook you in, not a single line voice acted, not even the intro video...Granted, it could be an amazing game after that, but you are switching out to a different character with no explanation, and not showing me anything remotely interesting (hell, not even a level up from the two tutorial fights).I know that it says ""inspired by the classic 3D RPGs of the late 90's"" on the description, but it completely fails to show any of the ""fresh take on turn based combat"" when it presents it to you for the first time.The soundtrack is not bad, at least.If it had been a 5-10€ game, I could understand getting a rough game, but first impression is really important in games, you want to hook the player with ""look at what we promise you during the game"", presenting the world (we got a bit of lore at least), the main character(s) (not even sure who is the ""main"" at this point), and giving a glimpse of the cool things that the player can get later on (be it flashy skills, complex combos, or at least OP stats).Not all games need all of those of course, but if you remove the games that purposedly set you up as ""you are not a legendary hero, just a common person that will have to work hard to even just keep up"", those that miss those are usually not purposedly choosing it for an actual effect (dramatic or otherwise) and more of an indication that game designers are still working on their basics (or lack of interest/funds for the project).It does need to be noted that I am biased against the turn based battles (FF style), because it was playing with the hardware limitations at the time.Nowadays, if I see a game use it, I go in thinking ""it's lazy"".Granted, there are a lot of good games that use this, but if they don't seriously rework the combat, then those games shine for other reasons (graphics style, animations, characters, world, story, take your pick).TL;DR: The start of this game is really sub par and doesn't give me any hope for an actual good game worth nearly 30€.

												Combat mechanic is ok. Graphic/art is pretty cute. butAbsolutely bland writing. Most dialogs consists of only few minimum lines and fails to draw a necessary picture.It would probably be ok 5 or 6 years ago but in 2016 this level of story presentation for the game of this genre is unaceptabble.

												Horrible game. Bad controls. Bad story and dialogues. Bad - what am I say? - horrific respawn system (move two steps away and the enemy you have just defeated are there again....). Unforgivable save system. Did I miss anything? Oh yeah, the time I wasted on this piece of polluted coding....			"

												I've really enjoyed this game. The art style is cute and the fights are reasonably challenging. I don't usually lose fights ever in these sorts of games but I certainly have in this one. I've grinded a little for levels but it wasn't ever tedious and their system of encouraging the grouping of enemies for big fights is refreshing.EDIT: After playing this game more, I've come to the point where I have to grind hardcore to progress. It is no longer fun and I have stopped playing completely because of this and no longer recommend people buying this game.			"

												*Changed review to positive as of 1st Dec 2016.*The developers have read community feedback and worked hard on them. There were constant patches to address notable issues since release. I'm happy to say that the game is a lot more playable now as compared to the release version.Old review:Backed this in Kickstarter years ago. tl;dr - it is very unpolished and should be in early access. Don't get me wrong, I think Earthlock has potential to be a really great game. It has a really strong core to it. But with this level of polish, I simply cannot recommend it as a full game.The music at the start came in abruptly and really didn't fit the scene. That ruined the entire first scenario for me. Music is ok by itself, but choosing it for that scene is (imo as a musician) a poor choice.Based on first impressions and general feel:Gameplay & Mechanics - Good; I really enjoy blasting monsters in combat.Presentation (graphics, animation etc.) - Good; colorful and smooth, gorgeous for a JRPG.Music - Decent; not ""wow!"" feels but not bad either.Writing - Bad; Generic. Dialogues are not believable.Polish - Very bad; everything is abrupt. Music suddenly comes in, scenes skip forward a lot, conversations are awkward, spelling mistakes etc.Still looking forward to continue playing and will change my review accordingly. However, I expect the devs to fix and polish the game in future patches. It's a waste, I'd rather have the game delayed so that it gets polished or just have it released as an early access title.
